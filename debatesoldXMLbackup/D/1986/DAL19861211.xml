      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to ask the Taoiseach if his attention had been drawn to the incomprehensible and worrying judgment handed down by the High Court in the case of the Derrynaflan chalice and if he will confirm to the House that it is the Government's intention to appeal this incomprehensible decision to the Supreme Court?  Furthermore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise in this way.  Furthermore, I do not think it is in order to refer to a judgment of one of the courts set up under the Constitution as incomprehensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly in order. This is the only place it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be done impromptu.  I would ask Deputy Haughey to reflect on the matter.  I want to clear up the matter because if we get to the stage where if one Deputy stands up and does it without reservation every other Deputy will be entitled to stand up and make disparaging remarks about judgments of the courts and about the courts and in that way will reduce greatly the standing and respect in which the courts are and should be held.  That in the Chair's opinion is certainly not good either for the courts or, more importantly, for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully submit that it is perfectly in order and legitimate in this House to criticise decisions of the courts.  In fact, this House is the only place <Col N="2375" /> in which that can be done.  Furthermore, we have had a procedure in this House where a certain decision of the courts during the last few years was debated in this House and the decision of the particular judge was severely criticised by Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We will keep this cool but I want to be firm about it. In the Chair's recollection the judgment Deputy Haughey spoke about was debated by way of orderly statements. There is a well defined procedure for criticising or disagreeing with judges or the decisions of judges and that is by way of substantive motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have neither disagreed nor criticised but indicated that in my view it is incomprehensible.  I suggest that is the view of the vast majority of Deputies. I merely wish to ask the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Chair's opinion the word &ldquo;incomprehensible&rdquo; and the way it was introduced might be taken as an impromptu attack on the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will in a minute.  The Chair can be hired and fired by a simple majority but the Constitution lays down that judges are appointed for life and can only be removed in a formal way by a special procedure in this House. I appeal to Deputies to respect the courts. If they are brought into ridicule in this House we would be going down a very <Col N="2376" /> slippery slope which would not be good for anyone, particularly the poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>You know perfectly well that this House is the last bastion of the liberty of the citizen.  There was an instance when this House felt it necessary to criticise the decision of the judge in a certain case.  I am not doing that.  It was never my practice to denigrate the dignity or importance of the courts.  It was &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; an incomprehensible decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the time at our disposal.  In the case of a general dog licence if, as quite a number of breeders do, a person keeps a large number of dogs, perhaps 40 to 50, he is given the option of taking out a general dog licence which he can buy for £100.  There is some confusion in peoples' minds in that some think that if they have five dogs over the number, they have to take out a general dog licence.  That is not true.  They can take out £95 worth of single licences and if they go over number of 20 dogs they can take out a general dog licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied <Col N="2380" /> with paragraph (c) in respect of the transfer of &ldquo;possession of a dog pursuant to a change of ownership to any other person unless the other person is the holder of a dog licence for that dog or a general dog licence.&rdquo;  That seems to place the onus and responsibility on the person selling the dog of ensuring that the buyer is in possession of a dog licence.  Is this fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kernel of the Bill.  We have had long discussions with various groups of people on that aspect. Basically, it is one of the few ways that we have at our disposal of ensuring that people take out dog licences.  In other words, if you are selling a dog to somebody and give the details of the dog, the buyer then takes out a dog licence and you transfer the dog.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that we all accept that if one has a dog that dog should be licensed. My concern is that one is placing the onus on the person selling the dog rather than on the person purchasing the dog.  This will affect breeders in a very significant way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a discussion yesterday with the Deputy on that point.  In fairness, the Kennel Club of Ireland and various groups of breeders whom I have met welcome this legislation.  If the breeders themselves, who have offered to cooperate with this legislation cannot operate that small discipline, what hope have we with the general public?  That is the point that I have to keep on making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> During the debate on Second Stage of the Bill, I raised a question with regard to the issuing of licences from local authorities.  I mentioned in particular then that I thought the current system under which dog licences can be purchased at post <Col N="2381" /> offices, of which there are many throughout the country, should be continued. At this stage I should like to hear what arrangements the Minister proposes should be made under this heading.  Up to now the post office is the only place at which a dog licence can be purchased.  If licences were available only from local authorities or at their area offices in the counties, access of the general public to these places would be very limited.  I am a little concerned that the current system may not be continued by local authorities. What guarantee can the Minister give that his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, will continue to use the post offices for the purchase of dog licences and what arrangements has he made or does he intend to make with An Post to ensure that this practice will be continued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the reservations of Deputy Noonan.  While some local authorities feel that they may have the necessary structures to collect dog licences, because of representations from Deputy Noonan on Second Stage, the Department of the Environment are at present in consultation with An Post regarding his request.  It is generally felt that, whatever about a small urban area or a borough council, in rural areas the post office has been the obvious place to pick up a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I emphatically want to know what guarantee has the House that the Minister for the Environment will insist that local authorities utilise the existing outlets for the purchase of dog licences.  This is not included in the Bill.  In the event of the negotiations between the Department of the Environment and An Post breaking down, what hope have the general public of purchasing licences in post offices?  We all wish this Bill to be successful and that the legislation can be put into effect very quickly.  If there is not easy access for the purchase of dog licences that will make the operation of the legislation difficult and the revenue from the purchase of licences would not be as great as it is at <Col N="2382" /> the moment.  The Minister has mentioned, and I agree with him, that an insignificant number of dogs are licensed. We want to ensure that as many as possible are licensed.  I am not too happy as yet that the post offices will be availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us have been involved in local authorities and the purpose of local authorities will be to ensure that the legislation works effectively and efficiently.  The general consensus is that An Post would be the obvious people to issue licences.

Perhaps the Minister would give a better definition of a public place.  The Listowel Urban District Council have passed a special by-law enabling urban greyhound owners to gallop their dogs in the town park before 6 a.m.  Is the Minister, by this measure, denying those urban greyhound owners, who do not own an inch of land, the right to exercise their dogs on the strand or in a public place where the local authority allow it?

It was decided after consultation with representatives of Bord na gCon that four dogs was the maximum number and we are happy with that.

The word &ldquo;appears&rdquo; is rather weak and indicates that a stray dog can be picked up on doubtful grounds.  I would prefer a much stronger term.  The dog warden or garda should have very good grounds before he seizes the dog, he should make inquiries and be satisfied that it is a stray dog, and not a dog which has strayed outside the garden gate.</P>

      <P>In section 13 sweeping <Col N="2392" /> powers have been given to the dog wardens. I will give a supposition to the Minister. If at the final of the Derby in Shelbourne Park two dogs are going into the park and one of them decides to empty himself at the nearest pole and if the dog warden says that dog committed an offence and the owner tells him to hump off, has the dog warden power to take that dog from the owner and to prevent the dog from running in that race?</P>

      <P>No.  That is a separate matter and one we steered clear of in this Bill.  If a dog causes that sort of nuisance on footpaths and so on it will be up to the various local authorities to make the decision on the matter.  In other countries if a dog discharges on the footpath the person in charge of the dog has to clean up after the dog.  There is absolutely no question of a dog warden seizing a dog under these circumstances.  The only time a dog warden can seize a dog is if the dog is not kept under effectual control, that means from the point of view of doing damage.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> This section deals with local authorities in particular and details of local authorities, which I agree with.  I outlined on Second Stage that under this Bill the local authority will make use of the very wide and <Col N="2393" /> necessary powers given under the Bill to enable the long overdue control on dogs to be properly imposed.  I hope this will happen.  On Second Stage I spoke about the need to review the progress made by the various local authorities.  I mentioned the possibility of an annual report.  My idea in suggesting an annual report was that it would enable local authorities at regular times to report to the Minister, in this case the Minister for the Environment, and through him to the Minister for Agriculture about progress being made under this Bill.  Perhaps more frequent reports may be needed from local authorities, especially in the early period after the Bill is enacted.  I would like to know if the Minister has thought over my suggestion as to how he might see this request being met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In providing special voting facilities for disabled electors this Bill implements a commitment given by successive Governments over the past decade.  It meets a long-standing demand which has been expressed eloquently, not only by the organisations representing the interests of the disabled, but by Members on both sides of this House.</P>
      <P>The Bill responds in what I believe is a reasonable and balanced way, to the competing requirements of preserving the integrity of the electoral system and providing voting arrangements which take appropriate account of the legitimate needs of electors.  The House will recall that these competing considerations were given explicit recognition by the Supreme Court in the constitutional case taken by a disabled person, Mrs. Norah Draper.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill are geared to the specific requirements of the disabled. For the non-ambulant it introduces an arrangement which will enable them to cast their votes in their own homes in precisely the same conditions of secrecy, security and freedom from pressure which obtain in the polling station. For the disabled who are mobile and capable of going to their polling station, but find it difficult to gain access to the voting area, it provides a facility which will enable them to transfer their vote to a more accessible polling station in the same constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disabled who are unable to attend the polling station by reason of long term physical illness or physical disability may apply to the local registration authority for entry on what will be called, the special voters list.  At an election or referendum a ballot paper will be conveyed to each elector named on the special voters list, at their residence, by a special presiding officer accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  The <Col N="2397" /> special voter will make a sign a declaration of identity, which will be witnessed by the special presiding officer, and will then mark the ballot paper in secret.  The ballot paper, enclosed in a sealed envelope, will be conveyed by the special presiding officer to the returning officer for the constituency.  It will then be placed in the postal voters ballot box and will be treated in exactly the same way as voting papers received from postal voters.</P>
    <P>As originally drafted the provision for the entry of disabled electors on the special voters list was intended to have applications in relation to the register of electors which is due to come into force on 15 April next.  However, at the request of Members of the other House I agreed to an amendment which will make it possible to have the special voting arrangement in operation for the current register of electors.</P>
    <P>Should the House see fit to approve of this measure, it would be my intention to make the necessary regulations straight-away. Application for entry on the special voters list will commence as early as possible, a period of about three weeks, which I think is reasonable in the circumstances, will be allowed for applications and the special voters list will be prepared as soon as administratively possible.</P>
    <P>In future years this list will be drawn up at the same time as the draft register of electors.  Each application for entry on the list must be supported by a medical certificate.</P>
    <P>The arrangement under which the mobile disabled may apply to transfer their vote to a station more accessible than their own will come into operation immediately on enactment of the Bill. Application for transfer may be made to the returning officer for the constituency up to seven days before the polling day at an election or referendum.</P>
    <P>The special voting arrangement envisaged for the non-ambulant disabled may well be described as cumbersome and there is no doubt that it will be relatively expensive.  A stranger not well versed in the realities of the political practices of the country might well ask why we have <Col N="2398" /> not opted for the seemingly simpler and less expensive postal voting system.</P>
    <P>The answer lies in our experience in the operation of an extended postal voting system at two local government elections. A fairly open-ended system was introduced for the 1974 local elections.  It was tightened up considerably for the elections which took place in 1985 and additional safeguards were introduced. However, the sad and inescapable conclusion to be drawn from experience at these two elections is that postal voting is open to abuse, that it has been abused and that there is every likelihood that it would continue to be abused.  It is equally clear that it is not possible to devise safeguards which would guarantee the elimination of such abuse.  In particular, under postal voting, the individual voter and his ballot paper cannot be given the protection and the guarantee of secrecy which is afforded to an elector voting in the polling station.</P>
    <P>As legislators there is undoubtedly an obligation on us to provide reasonable facilities to enable electors to cast their votes and in providing such facilities to take into account, as far as reasonably possible, the specific difficulties experienced by particular categories.  However, there is a still more fundamental obligation on us to ensure that elections are decided by the free vote of the people and not by machinations.</P>
    <P>The preservation of the integrity of the electoral system is particularly important in our situation where Government majorities tend to be slim&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Or non existent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and where individual seats can be won or lost by late preferences on a handful of ballot papers.  I am aware of one situation in a recent general election where the allocation of the last seat in a five-seat constituency &mdash; this is a chilling reminder &mdash; was decided by five votes on the eleventh count.  No doubt other examples can be given.  The clear message is that abuse even on a very limited scale could call into question the <Col N="2399" /> result of an election.  In those circumstances the concept of an acceptable level of electoral abuse is simply not on.</P>
      <P>We are faced, then, with the problem of striking a balance between the desirability of adjusting the voting arrangements to suit the particular circumstances of the disabled and the necessity to preserve the integrity of the electoral procedure. The special voting arrangements proposed in the Bill represent a measured response to this problem.  They provide the disabled with a reasonable opportunity of voting and at the same time provide a complete safeguard against the abuse associated with postal voting.</P>
      <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that the abuse which took place was not perpetrated by the sick, the disabled or the other categories for whom the system was devised.  These were simply the innocent victims of the abuses which took place. It must be a source of sadness to us all that this is the situation.  But we live in the real world and our proposals must take account of the situation as it is, not what we might wish it to be.</P>
      <P>The second element of electoral reform in the Bill is to make it possible for diplomats representing this country abroad and for their spouses to vote at elections here.  Under existing electoral law no provision is made for voting by civil servants attached to our diplomatic missions abroad.  I understand that we are virtually unique in not making some provision in this regard.</P>
      <P>The position so far as this country is concerned is that, not only are special voting arrangements not made for persons in this category but the persons concerned are not, generally speaking, eligible for registration as electors. Under existing law, a person must be ordinarily resident in a constituency in order to be eligible for registration.  A temporary absence of up to 18 months is not regarded as breaking the continuity of residence.  Civil servants attached to missions are normally posted abroad for a period of several years and, thus, would not satisfy the residence requirement for registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2400" /> The Bill provides that civil servants and their spouses will be deemed to satisfy the residence requirement and will be entitled to be registered in respect of the address in this country at which they would be living if not posted abroad. They must, of course, also satisfy the normal requirements in relation to age and citizenship.</P>
    <P>The arrangement envisaged is that applications will be made to the appropriate registration authority each year at the time when the draft register is being drawn up.  The fact that the applicant is qualified for registration under this procedure will require to be certified by the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The registration authority will enter the names on the draft register and, as in the case of members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána, will also enter them on the postal voters list.</P>
    <P>Voting by persons registered under this provision will in general be carried out in the same way as voting by gardaí or members of the Defence Forces but with an important modification.  In voting they will make a declaration of identity in the presence of a person authorised for this purpose by the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, normally the ambassador or head of mission, and will mark their ballot papers, in secret, in his presence.  The purpose of this modifiction is to provide a safeguard against the possibility of the kind of abuse which appears to be endemic in any postal voting system.</P>
    <P>In satisfying a long-standing demand for reform in relation to voting by the disabled and by our official representatives abroad, I am confident that the Bill will be welcomed.  An explanatory memorandum has been circulated which, I think, will serve to answer any questions in relation to the detailed operation of the provisions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to refer briefly to the motion under Standing Order No. 95 (2).  This is a technical device to make it possible for the Dáil to consider in Committee certain amendments which I wish to propose but which are outside the scope of the Bill as it <Col N="2401" /> stands at present.  The amendments involve two very important and, to my mind, essential reforms in the electoral procedure.  The effect of them will be first to prevent the inclusion on ballot papers of the names of political organisations which are not registered in the register of political parties and of slogans or other references, whether political or frivolous; and, second, to strengthen the safeguards against personation at polling stations by providing that electors may be required to produce evidence of identity.</P>
    <P>I trust the House will agree that these matters should be discussed and will see fit to support the amendments.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Its purpose is to provide special voting arrangements for electors who are unable to vote in person at polling stations because of physical illness or disability; to permit disabled electors unable to gain access to their polling stations to cast their votes in other stations in their constituencies; and to enable civil servants attached to diplomatic missions and resident abroad because of the requirements of their duties to be registered as electors and to vote by post.</P>
      <P>The Minister quite rightly said that this is a response to pressure from all sides of the House on successive Governments in the past ten years.  It is also in response to the disabled.  It is a particular response to the report of the working party on the register of electors and other matters set up by me, as Minister, in 1982, which reported in March 1983.  It was under the chairmanship of Mr. Sexton.  The principal recommendation of the committee was that a standing list of eligible postal voters should be prepared each year when the register of electors is being compiled. Persons on that list should be entitled to vote only by post in an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact they are not being allowed to vote by post.  They will be called on by the returning officer accompanied by a garda, and voting will take place as laid down in the Bill.  I realise the Minister's <Col N="2402" /> fears and concerns about having the postal vote organised merely by the form of a special register and that voting would take place only by post.  It might be open to abuse.  As the Minister said, we live in the real world rather than the world we would like it to be.  Therefore, the procedure proposed is to be welcomed.  We all remember the abuses in 1974.  All sides of the House have learnt from them.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommended that applications to be included in the register of postal voters should be open to electors who are physically disabled or prevented from voting in person by circumstances of their occupation.  This part of the report has not been accepted by the Minister and I ask him if he will consider the position of persons other than civil servants, the Garda and members of the Army for this arrangement.  For instance, we have a number of commercial travellers whose business, by tradition, takes them away from Monday to Friday and therefore they are unable to get back home to cast their votes in general elections. On behalf of that group &mdash; they are just one of many, because you have truckers and fishermen who may be away from home for two or three days &mdash; I ask the Minister to provide them with this facility.  Not only should our diplomatic staff abroad be given this facility, but IDA personnel, Bord Fáilte, CTT and other State promotional personnel abroad, should be able to avail of postal voting.  Arrangements could be made for them to vote in embassies, and the ambassadors could appoint people to act as presiding officers.  I do not see any reason why there should be a difference between our Civil Service personnel abroad and our commercial semi-State personnel abroad.  Private sector citizens living abroad who are anxious to vote should also be given this facility.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation of the committee is that applications for inclusion in the postal voters list should be supported by medical or employment certificates or statutory declarations in the case of the self-employed.  I wonder why the Minister did not accept that recommendation? A self-employed man with <Col N="2403" /> a factory employing between 30 and 50 people might have to go away on business to try to keep those people in their jobs. Why he should not be allowed to vote by post and have it recorded I do not know.</P>
    <P>Another purpose of the Bill is to permit disabled persons who are unable to gain access to polling stations to cast their votes in another polling station in the same constituency.  This was considered by the working party and they recommended, under the heading of &ldquo;Access to Polling Stations&rdquo; that there should be an extension of the provision for temporary ramps by returning officers to facilitate entry by disabled voters.  I ask that the Minister, in his instructions to returning officers throughout the country, would insist that as far as possible available buildings would be accessible to disabled people and that if, in certain circumstances, this cannot be arranged, for instance old schools, etc., that the recommendation in regard to ramps should be complied with.  Many disabled persons feel it is their constitutional right to vote in polling stations nearest to their homes.  Rather than take advantage of the provisions of the Bill, they would feel they did not want to transfer their vote to another polling station within the electoral area but would want to cast their vote with the remainder of their family at their own polling station.  It is incumbent on returning officers to provide ramps and every other facility for them.</P>
    <P>Item 3, under the heading of Access to Polling Stations, specifies that where circumstances warrant it returning officers should make greater use of the power to site polling stations in hospitals or institutions.  This is a very welcome proposal.  We have all had the experience at general and by-elections throughout the country of the old and disabled being taken out by the political parties, struggling into polling stations.  While they might not be eligible for a certificate to say they are non-ambulant they would still experience difficulty getting into polling stations.  I remember working in one by-election in Ballybay in County Monaghan, in 1974, where, about 300 yards <Col N="2404" /> from the polling station there was a senior citizens' home sited up the hill.  It was an appalling day, it rained from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Few of us in the House would remember that by-election &mdash; if the Deputy looks to his right and left&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly recalls that day himself.  We had the spectacle that day of many of the people from that senior citizens' home being wheeled down that road.  We were trying to keep umbrellas over them, get them into vote before a presiding officer and wheeled back again.  They were appalling circumstances. Therefore the siting of polling stations in hospitals or institutions is eminently to be recommended and I support the recommendation of the working party in that respect.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of commercial travellers in the private sector travelling on business within the country and private sector and/or semi-State personnel working abroad who should have the right to vote.  Perhaps we should have a further working party at present examining the question of voting on Sundays. It is something that is done throughout Europe.  Its merits should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The way our social life is evolving it is something worthy of consideration. It would constitute a major change in our voting patterns and would probably increase the percentage vote cast at elections.  Such provision would mean that families could vote together rather than have the mad rush that normally takes place between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. at polling stations.  Usually one finds there has been quite a low poll up to 7 p.m. but, thereafter, 50 per cent or a 70 per cent vote would be cast in the last two hours.  Generally people are free on Sundays, families are together and <Col N="2405" /> would have an opportunity of voting daylong rather than with the usual burst within the last couple of hours.  We have all had the experience of seeing the weather change in the after-tea period and the whole voting pattern change as a consequence.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposal to have a special presiding officer with a garda go from house to house to those on the special register, the political parties' rights should be protected in this respect. Each political party should have the right to nominate a personating agent to accompany the presiding officer and garda to ensure that not alone is the system fair but is seen to be fair.</P>
      <P>The other group of people who should come within the provisions of this Bill are those working in polling stations.  If the Minister were agreeable it is not too late to have a small amendment drafted to have them included.  At present what happens is that people acting as presiding officers, as polling clerks, have to attend at their polling stations at 9. a.m.  In many cases they are not the polling stations where they would cast their vote and, consequently, they are unable to do so. After all, they are entitled to cast their vote also which is not the situation obtaining. I am familiar with such people moving from one part of a constituency to another and, just because they are not on the register in the polling station where they work, they are not entitled to vote under the law as it stands.  A simple amendment could quite easily be drafted by the specialised, qualified staff available to the Minister to allow those people working in polling stations to cast their vote if they come from that constituency.</P>

      <P>Within their constituency or otherwise.  For example, there could be a presiding officer living in one constituency, working in another, acting as presiding officer where he is not entitled to vote.  He should have the right <Col N="2406" /> to vote.  Similarly, he should have the right to vote if he is working within the same constituency.  I am speaking of somebody living in one town, acting as presiding officer or polling clerk in another town.  He should be entitled to vote there and then and, to the best of my knowledge, he cannot as the law stands at present.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the fact that the provisions of this Bill will be brought into force for the February election and that we will be operating on the present register for that election.  I welcome the Minister's assurance that he will sign the order to bring the provisions of the Bill into operation immediately.</P>
      <P>Time will be against us with regard to the Minister's amendments but obviously we will be agreeable to the Minister's proposals to eliminate abuses of the system.  The Minister has my support on the measure as far as it goes.  I would like him to take note of the points I have made.  I see no reason why simple amendments could not be drafted to include the points I have just made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and in general I agree with many of the things I have heard Deputy Burke say just now. It must be read against the very clear expressions in Article 16.1.2º of the Constitution which provides that:</P>
      <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of eighteen years who is not disqualified by law and complies with the provision of the law relating to the election of members of Dáil Éireann, shall have the right to vote at an election for members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to place the onus squarely on the State to lean over backwards if <Col N="2407" /> necessary to make sure that every citizen who is not disqualified &mdash; we are not talking about disqualifications here &mdash; and who is 18 years of age and who has complied with the provisions of the law should have a vote.  We reduced the voting age from 21 to 18 at one blow, so to speak when 100,000 or so young people were enfranchised overnight.  That happened in December 1972, an election was called in February 1973 and a large number of young people were in theory then qualified to vote under Article 16 but they were not on the register.  One of them brought an action, unsuccessfully, to be allowed to vote.  The construction of the machinery to permit that to be done in an orderly way at such short notice would have been extremely difficult. Nevertheless, I mention this only to say that the onus is on the State to make sure that everything within reason is done to respect the precept of the Constitution in this regard.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Supreme Court said in Mrs. Draper's case, that a reasonable balance has to be struck between the integrity of election &mdash; which is, after all, the main purpose of the whole thing &mdash; and the right of the individual voter.  A certain discretion must be given to the Government and the Oireachtas in striking that balance, but it seems that the State has been extremely sluggish until recently in doing anything over and above what it has been doing for the last 60 years towards facilitating voting by people other than those put on the register and able to trek down, or be carried in the way Deputy Burke described, to the polling station in the old, traditional way, not to put too fine a point on it, in the way they had done under the British. As far as I am aware next to no innovation was attempted by the State until now, in the more than 60 years of its existence to extend the power to vote.</P>
    <P>Since all the Stages of this Bill will be wrapped up together, I may be allowed make a couple of comments which would in the ordinary way be more appropriate on Committee Stage.  I agree with Deputy Burke that the reason a distinction <Col N="2408" /> appears to be tacitly drawn between members of diplomatic missions and people on other State or semi-State missions abroad is not visable.  I cannot see why a special case should be made for, let us say, the first secretary or the third secretary of our embassy in Stockholm and not for a CTT or Bord Fáilte representative who may be posted there equally in the national interest and who, for all we know, may be doing a more important job, a more difficult job than the diplomat.  Perhaps that person's terms of employment were not in the first instance so clearly targeted towards service abroad as were the diplomat's who must take for granted that he will be posted to some city other than Dublin sooner or later and perhaps spend the major part of his working life abroad.  While I take it that the Minister's Department must have some reason for restricting this to diplomatic missions and not extending it to other State missions, I would be interested to know the reason if the Minister has a moment to explain it.</P>
    <P>I will go further than that, as Deputy Burke did, and say that if the thing is to be extended this far &mdash; we welcome even the first step &mdash; there seems to be a good case for asking ourselves if we can go further even in advance of the British. This is the unseen shackle that drags us down and keeps us back always.  If they have not done something we assume instinctively that there must be some hidden snag in it that we cannot see, as soon as they do it, we are quick to copy them.  Can we go any further in accommodating in our voting arrangements people who are away for some reason not connected with the public service, whether diplomatic, commercial or semi-State? If a commercial representative &mdash; a marketing executive as he is more frequently called nowadays &mdash; is abroad doing business for this company selling Waterford glass or I care not what, or even if he is not abroad but in some other part of Ireland and cannot get back on voting day or would find it seriously disruptive to his business do do so, the State ought to make some effort to see if he can be accommodated, to see whether <Col N="2409" /> his specifically conferred right to vote under Article 16 can somehow be made real for him.</P>
    <P>To bring it down to the humblest level, even if someone is away on holidays there is room for the State legitimately to say whether it is possible to respect his right to vote.  There is nothing illegal about going on holidays.  The month in which elections are most ofter held here, except in times of convulsion, is June.  I have fought three June elections out of six as far as I remember &mdash; or at least three summer elections in June or the beginning of July.  That is the early part of the holiday season but quite a number of people go on holidays in June because it suits them or their children's pattern or whatever it may be.  They go away and who is to blame them?  Their's is not as strong a case for special treatment as is the person's who willy nilly is sent abroad to serve his country in the diplomatic service or in the semi-State service, but they are legitimately absent.</P>
    <P>If we are considering making a case for the man who is absent on business in some other part of Ireland or abroad we might make a similar case for somebody who is away for some private reason of his own, not necessarily a commercial reason.  To start going into the reasons and the motives for absence would be impossible.  A special bureauracy would be needed for that.  We would be into unimaginable difficulties trying to decide whether somebody was away for a reason of which the Dáil approved or disapproved. If I go away to do a bit of work in a library or something like that for a week and follow that with a week's holiday or the other way round, I am foxed by one of these pieces of paper put in front of me by people from the CSO who want to know the reason for my journey. The simple thing to do would be to refuse to answer it but I do not like to be unhelpful. However, it is difficult to answer that when one has mixed motives for going away or may be doing two or three things in the course of the next week or so when one is abroad.  If the officials operating under electoral law were obliged to sort out people's motives for being away the <Col N="2410" /> thing would be impossible.  The right thing to do is to go back to the Article in the Constitution, consider the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; and see how a blanket arrangement can be made to cover all citizens who do not find it possible for whatever reason, public or private, commercial, industrial, agricultural or recreational, to be present at their local polling station on whatever day the election is held.</P>
    <P>That problem is not insoluble.  I have no personal experience of it and I do not know what the chilling electoral example is that was mentioned about the seat decided by five on the eleventh count, but I can see that the Minister has severe problems there to handle and his appreciation of them may be swayed by which side won that final seat.  However, other countries seem able to digest such problems. I think that American subjects abroad vote at their own local consulates and are invited to do so if they so choose. I have seen notices in German and Dutch in Irish papers inviting nationals at election times in their countries to present themselves at their missions here and register their vote as absent electors.  I have been in Germany on a couple of occasions at election time.  There they have a system by which one can vote ahead of the election and in the same way as one would on polling day.  Elections are held there on Sundays.  One presents one's self at the polling booth which is manned for a number of hours on each of the preceding Sundays, shows one's identity card and register one's vote.  That would take care of any of the commercial or holiday problems.  Presumably the vote is guarded and its integrity protected in the same way as would an ordinary polling box and it is put into the general count two weeks later.  That would involve extra expense and I am anxious to avoid unnecessary additional expense. It would not be necessary to have every single polling station in the city of Dublin open if we adopted such a system.</P>
    <P>Persons who knew they were going to be absent on polling day would not think it a great hardship if they were asked to go to a city polling station to record their vote.  That would not be too much to ask <Col N="2411" /> people to do as a contribution to the solution of the State's problems in running a system intended to give effect to their essential constitutional right to vote.  I do not want to seem begrudging as I recognise the Minister has gone a long way in trying to give effect to the constitutional rights of voters who find it hard to exercise their rights in the conventional way.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat puzzled by the provision in section 3 which provides that a person who is unable to go to the polling base because of disability must produce a certificate to prove he is of sound mind and understanding, and capable of comprehending the act of voting.  That requirement is not made of any mobile voter.  One could be as mad as a hatter and vote if one could get there on one's own feet and nobody would ask as to one's mental condition.  I know it is not intended in this way but I cannot see that physical disability is a condition which would lead the State to raise the faintest question mark over one's mental capacity to exercise a vote.  If there is such a thing as a requirement of mental capacity to vote, why is it not applied to all?  If there were more time I could richly embroider that theme but I will abstain from the temptation to do so in consideration for other Deputies who wish to speak.</P>
    <P>I do not know of the Minister's intentions with regard to the Schedule which talks about the time for issuing ballot papers.  Not only is there presumably a time before the polling day when ballot papers can be issued but there must be a certain time before they can be returned. What does the Minister propose to do about the four or five Irish people that are in the diplomatic mission in Peking? How far in advance of polling day would their ballot papers have to be issued so that they would have a chance of getting there and back in time for the count? While the intention here is excellent, I wonder whether in every case postal voting will be practical.  I am sure it will only affect a very small number of people.</P>
    <P>I completely agree with what Deputy <Col N="2412" /> Burke said in relation to Sunday voting. I suspect that if the British get around to Sunday voting it will be no time before we find an excuse for doing so.  Even in this humble instance, could we do the sensible thing ahead of them and let them catch up for a change?  Why must we always wait to see what they are doing before following suit?  Surely we have a free Republic in order to have our own way of doing things.  The reason we still have elections in the middle of the week, unlike the rest of western Europe, is because the UK still do it.  If the UK found reasons for not doing it, like they found reasons for a seven-cornered 50p piece or for double yellow lines, we would find reasons for doing the same thing.  If there are good considerations in favour of Sunday voting, let us have Sunday voting.  There is not a Sabbatarian in this Republic who would be offended by it.</P>

      <P>Many other things a great deal more unholy than electing a Dáil are done on Sundays, publicly, widely, conspicuously and uproariously done on Sundays.  There is no reason why the sober, essential nationally valuable act of electing a Dáil could not be done on a Sunday.  A consideration which Deputy Burke did not put forward, but which I would consider of no small value, is that if there were Sunday elections it would prevent the school week from being disrupted. If the school could be cleaned and tidied up before Monday morning, the school week would not be interfered with.  As Deputies will remember from their own school days, a week with a holiday in the middle of it is not really a school week.</P>

      <P>Let the Chair and I not get into cross-talk.  I have only been on my feet for ten minutes and I will sit down soon if the Chair will just bear with me. I am worried about the Minister's amendments. He has a proposal empowering the returning officer to object to the name of a candidate if the name is misleading or if it is unnecessarily long.  I agree with that.  I suppose a returning officer will have different views as to what is an unnecessarily long name, but I could not find fault with that theory.  If somebody wishes to run under a name by which he is not commonly known, should it not be his own funeral?  Why must we be so officious?  That is not the only case in the electoral law where officiousness springs to mind.  Whatever chance Deputies have of re-election, we certainly would have a better chance of election under our own names than under some fictitious name which nobody recognises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody is looney enough to risk his deposit by putting in a name which is not his own, why must the State prevent him?  No serious interest is served by making the returning officer consider whether somebody is running under a name by which he is not commonly known.  How is the returning officer to know?  The returning officer does not necessarily know the people by name and perhaps a person might have a pet name by which he would prefer to be known. A name which is clearly a false name designed to make some point independently of the personality of the candidate, in other words if the candidate was only a bogus candidate, he should be kept off the ballot paper but that should be done by some other means.  The criteria which the Minister is putting into the hand of the returning officer here are unnecessarily wide.  The section also empowers the returning officer to refuse to include a name on a nomination paper if the name contains a political reference. I presume, not because the Bill says so but because the Minister's speech says so, that this political reference would be <Col N="2414" /> an attempt to include in the name something like a reference to an organisation that is not on the register of political parties.</P>
    <P>Let me ask in a couple of words what is the point of this panoply of the register of political parties?  Why do we need a register of political parties?  Is the entire paraphernalia of a register seriously necessary?  If somebody wants to call themselves the Freedom from Mozambique or the Integrated with Taiwan Party and who do not mind making fools of themselves for three weeks and ending up with 12 votes let them do so.  God knows, there are enough potential ones around but are we so solemn that the State feels affronted if an eccentric inserts himself into its machinery in this form?  I cannot see the reason for it.</P>
    <P>The register of political parties has no function in the law whatsoever except to the extent that it permits people to add if they are on the register, the name of a party after their names.  That is its only function and it is very frequently understood as being in some way a guarantee of constitutionality.  It is very frequently misunderstood by people as meaning that the Clerk of the Dáil has certified the party as being somehow morally OK.  It means nothing of the kind and there is no such discretion in the Clerk of the Dáil.  All he has to do is be satisfied that it is a genuine political party and they are organised to contest elections.  They do not have to be organised in any particular way.  All he has to be is satisfied of these minimal requirements.  What is the point of a register?  It is a piece of gratuitous State busybodyness.</P>

      <P>In that case we must pin a rosette to ourselves.  Certainly, we have got ahead of them but I would rather we had done it for a useful purpose and not for a piece of empty officiousness such as the register of political parties which is what the 1963 Act is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister is going to include, <Col N="2415" /> whether we like them or not, these quite important extra provisions in this Bill I wonder whether the Title of the Bill ought not simply to be the Electoral Amendment Bill because if it is going to include these regulations with regard to the ballot paper it is no longer going to be concerned merely with special voters? Therefore, to call it an Amendment Bill might be more appropriate.  In that way, it would spare us the possibility that somebody looking for the amendments which the Minister is now inserting into the Bill might pass over the special voters Bill saying: &ldquo;wherever it is, it is not in that because this Bill is only about special voters&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In general, I would like to thank the Minister and commend him for taking this step.  I hope it is only the first step in trying to make the voting rights of Dáil electors more effective.</P>

      <P>I will be brief although I must say I am concerned at the small amount of time which has been allocated to this measure because while it affects only a small number of voters it is a very important measure.  I realise it is important to pass this Bill at this time particularly as the Minister informed us this morning that he would like to have the Bill in operation in time for the next election.  I would like the Minister when he is replying to say whether it is his intention to have all sections of the Bill in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will confine myself to the Bill and <Col N="2416" /> there are a couple of points about which I am concerned.  One is with regard to the drawing up of the special voters list. Is this really necessary?  Can the letter &ldquo;P&rdquo; not be put after the person's name on the existing register in the same way as in the case of a member of the Garda Síochána or the Army?  It appears that these people will be categorised and it might not be in the best interests to have that special list in that way.  I do not know whether or not there is any particular reason why this should be done.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make on the Bill is on the question of compilation of the register of special voters.  Is there any right of appeal?  It appears from reading the Bill that there is no right of appeal if the registration authority refuse to register the name of somebody as a special voter.  In the last local elections we saw that the registration authority did refuse to allocate a postal vote to certain people.  In my own area people who I felt were entitled to the vote on medical grounds were refused for one reason or another.  It is very important that there should be the right of appeal.</P>
    <P>Another point which I am concerned about in the Bill is when the presiding officer and the member of the Garda Síochána go to the home of the disabled person, as the Minister informed us this morning, the disabled person will make and sign a declaration of identity.  Where the person is not in a position to sign his name &mdash; many disabled people are not able to sign their names and the same would apply to marking a ballot paper &mdash; will he be able to have a companion voter present to mark the ballot paper for him? It is important that we should look at the provisions in the Bill to ensure that it sets out to do what it is supposed to do, which is, to see that special voters, in this case disabled voters, will be in a position to cast their vote.  I would fully support the case made by Deputy Kelly as to why there is need for a certificate of sound mind for the disabled person.  I do not think that this should be necessary any more than for a person going to a polling station in the normal way.</P>
    <P>I would also support fully the case <Col N="2417" /> made by Deputy Burke about extending the list of special voters.  I am aware of two or three people in my own constituency who happen to work in County Louth for the local authority.  They are employed to work on election day and are precluded from voting in their own constituency.  I do think that there is a case to be made particularly for these people who are working in the election as officials of the State.  They should be included on the list of postal voters along with the other categories of persons whom Deputies Burke and Kelly spoke about.</P>
    <P>I would also support the question of Sunday voting.  A very good case can be made for Sunday voting both in terms of ensuring the maximum number of people would have the opportunity to vote and also in economic terms.  I have no doubt that it would be in the best interests to have Sunday voting available.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am disappointed that we do not have more time to go into the Bill in more detail because there are areas which do need to be teased out.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that the Bill after it passes through this House will do what it sets out to do.  I am particularly concerned about certain sections of the Bill which do not provide sufficiently to ensure that disabled voters, particularly those who cannot use their hands, will be entitled to vote under this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak briefly on this Bill and welcome it as an overdue development.  I am sure that all the Members of this House would welcome the fact we are now introducing facilities for special voters.  We are all aware of individuals in our constituencies who from time to time have not been able to vote either because they are bedridden or it is exceedingly difficult for them to get to a polling station.  It is a testament to their strength of character that at times they have been the strongest lobbying group.  They are an example to able-bodied people.  They make great personal sacrifices in order to vote.  Between now and 15 January, the date by which corrections must be made to the present <Col N="2418" /> register, there are a number of bank holidays.  I am not sure if it is intended to advertise this measure but advertisements should be placed in the newspapers.</P>
      <P>I do not foresee any great difficulty in relation to persons who are in nursing homes but where a person is living alone the presiding officer and garda could call and find that the person was out.  There should be an onus on the presiding officer and garda to call again on the person or forewarn him that he will be called on at a certain time.  The number of persons will vary from constituency to constituency. I appreciate that the time is limited and that a presiding officer can only call on a certain number of persons. Presumably in a nursing home some special arrangement could be made. However, it is important that the facility be given to persons who are living alone and every effort should be made to ensure that they are able to cast their vote.</P>
      <P>When an application supported by medical evidence is made, is the decision of those in the local authority the final decision or will there be an appeals procedure?</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that diplomats will now have a vote.  I hope that will be extended to cover persons working abroad in semi-State or State organisations.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of merit in the idea of holding a general election on a Saturday or Sunday.  I know it might clash with other events but there are many people who travel in the course of their work, for example, sales persons and so on and the weekend would suit them.  This should be considered in the future.  It might ensure a greater turnout by the electorate.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister is still giving consideration to changing the time for compiling the register.  The Minister mentioned that the special voters list will be compiled within the next three or four weeks.  What measures will be taken to marry the current register with this list in order to avoid abuses?</P>

      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Burke, on setting up the working party on 3 June, 1982 which has resulted in this Bill being before the House.  I thank the Seanad for pressing on the Minister the need for this legislation to apply to the current register.  It is obvious that the Government are now in their dying days.  This is probably the second last week of the present Administration. We look forward to a general election and hope that it will take place on the existing register.  The Minister realises that the date of the new register will be June 1987 and he has decided to agree to the amendment which allow the new regulations to come into force on the present register.  I welcome that.</P>
      <P>For many years, disabled persons felt left out when it came to deciding on who would be their elected representatives. Many of them endeavoured to attend at polling stations although it caused great distress to them to do so.  I know many people who are extremely disabled and who insisted on voting in local and general elections.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Burke's suggestion to extend postal voting rights not only to diplomats and secretaries in the diplomatic corps but to those working abroad in CTT and IDA offices and other firms. The postal voting facility should also be made available to the 100,000 people who have been forced to emigrate as a result of this Government's policies.  They have a right to play their part in getting rid of this Administration.  They have been forced to leave the country.</P>

      <P>It is very relevant to the Bill.  A temporary absence is mentioned in the Bill and I hope that as a result of the change in Government their absence will be temporary.  The majority of them are on the register.  A polling station should be set up in the embassies or consulates in New York, Washington, <Col N="2420" /> London, Manchester and Birmingham to allow young voters to play their part in getting rid of this Government.  They are entitled to that.  I challenge the Minister to give such an opportunity to those young people.  Many of them, unfortunately misguided at the time, voted for Fine Gael and Labour in 1982.  They did not realise that was their ticket to emigration. They were voting to be practically deported through the policies adopted by this Government.  The Minister should make an order to allow such people to have a vote in the next general election.</P>
      <P>Commercial travellers and those travelling abroad working for companies should be given an opportunity to vote on the Saturday or Sunday before polling day.  The presiding officer should be available to take the votes.  A simple order could be made to that effect.</P>
      <P>In relation to the postal vote already available to members of the Garda Síochána and the Army, I suggest that the letter P indicating that they are postal voters be deleted from the next register of the electorate.  It has been brought to my attention, particularly by members of the Garda Síochána, that they have been listed out on the register of the electorate and from a security point of view their position is very vulnerable.  They are easily identified, even the numbers of their houses and the streets where they live.  There is no justifiable reason for the letter P appearing before their names on the register.  Many gardaí have indicated to me that they will not apply for the postal vote because of this vulnerability. Perhaps the Minister will indicate to the authorities that such provision is not necessary in the new register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the welcome provision of a choice of polling station for the electorate, one may find one polling station far more accesible than another.  However, the quality of the polling stations leaves a lot to be desired.  In my home town of Roscommon the main polling station, which covers practically seven polling stations, is practically inaccessible to anyone who has any physical handicap, because of the number of steps leading to it.  There <Col N="2421" /> should be some ground floor facility made available.  I am delighted that this provision of choice has been made in the Bill because there is a polling station in a local welfare home which could be available to people if they so wish.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there are safety precautions at polling stations with regard to proper access to the stations and that adequate lighting is available during the forthcoming winter election.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, many people have been injured and even fatally injured in going to or coming from polling stations.  Many of these stations are located on main roads and there is no lighting whatsoever outside the buildings. A request should be made of the presiding officers to ensure that they now start making arrangements to provide proper facilities for people coming to vote.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendments being put forward by the Minister, these are rather intriguing.  I presume they refer to Alderman Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus. One of the ideas is to ensure that Mr. Loftus will not be able to use all those titles during an election campaign. However, is it worth while putting forward an amendment to prevent him from using those titles?  I know this is an effort to indicate a certain policy line and I appreciate that the idea is to prevent other unregistered political parties from using their political titles during an election. I can see that there is a certain case for it, but is it all that relevant or important?  The electorate are very intelligent and are well able to make out, from looking at the ballot paper, the actual political parties of the candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to voting on the day, the provision is quite good in a sense that it prevents abuse.  I could see the difficulty of having every party representative in the home of a particular voter, although it would be desirable, as our spokesperson indicated.  Knowing many of the locations <Col N="2422" /> in my constituency, it could be very difficult for these people to leave the polling station because if there are five or six cars driving into a particular location on the day it could be very difficult to carry out the work.  Is it necessary to have both gardaí and presiding officers present for the voting?  It may not be all that necessary in a civilised electoral situation.</P>
    <P>In compiling the voters' list, it would be important that action be taken fairly quickly because of the shortness of time before the general election campaign, to allow people to apply and make sure that they are listed well in advance of election day.  People in hospital who feel they may not be available to vote should be given the facility of applying for the postal vote. The provision is worthwhile.  It is very timely and I am particularly delighted that it will be available for the forthcoming general election.  It would be a mockery that it would be held back and used only with regard to the new register of the electorate which will come into operation in April, 1987.  Members on this side of the House are delighted to get the opportunity of supporting the Minister's amendment in that regard.</P>
    <P>The people who can make the change in the next general election are those who have been forced to emigrate.  They are very angry at what has happened in this country and want to have a say in voting out this administration.  Their votes will make a considerable impact in deciding the third, fourth and fifth seats in numerous constituencies.  They would be voting in a very positive way for their future return to Ireland.  If by any chance there is not a change of Government, then the situation for them is extremely bleak as the Government have no concern for them whatsoever.  They are more interested in extradition and in other Bills than in providing jobs for our young people.  They are quite complacent about those who have been forced to emigrate and are quite happy to see young intelligent people leaving the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but having listened to the contribution from the last speaker I must ask if it is any wonder that there have been delays in introducing reform in this area?  Deputy Leyden should have concentrated on the Bill and on the people outside the House who fought so hard for its introduction. I refer to the disabled who value the vote, especially since it was denied to them for so long.  It is contemptible of Deputy Leyden to take up the time of the House in cheap electioneering when we are talking about fundamental rights.  Perhaps women appreciate the right to vote more than men because they had to fight for 60 years to achieve it.  The disabled had to go to court to achieve this right and I pay tribute to Nora Draper who continuously fought over the years for a right that should have been hers automatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I and thousands of others emigrated nobody in this House worried about our education, much less our right to vote.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has, at the request of Members of the other House, agreed that special <Col N="2427" /> voting arrangements will be in operation for the current register of electors.  The sooner we make this possible for the people for whom the Bill is designed, the sooner their confidence will be restored. When referring to abuses, it is incredible that we place so much stress on the morality of certain aspects of our lives, especially in regard to our private lives.</P>
    <P>One of the most fundamental areas, voting, is more abused here than in any other democracy.  This abuse is so widespread that we had to introduce this complicated way of enabling disabled people to vote.  The able-bodied have abused postal voting which indicates that they are morally disabled.  It is a condemnation of this House and democracy that we cannot allow open postal voting without it being totally and utterly abused by people who cast moral reflections on the rest of us in regard to other areas of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The complicated voting arrangements will include visits to the homes of disabled people by the presiding officer accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  We know that the Garda are overstretched and I hope that some allowance will be made within Garda stations to enable personnel to visit all the disabled in the area so that no one is excluded from the special voters list.  Having fought so long for the vote, it would be terrible to be excluded from the list because of lack of personnel to ensure that everything is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that in a future Bill voting rights be extended not just to civil servants and diplomats but to other categories as well.  For example, exporters are very often out of the country and the same applies to fishermen who have to work when the tide is suitable and to aircraft crews, those involved in shipping and so on.  These people are normally resident here and are entitled to vote for the Government they want.  It is a denial of their rights if, because of their jobs, they are not allowed to vote and to decide <Col N="2428" /> who will represent them in Parliament.  I would like the Minister to think about introducing a Bill which would allow all these people to be included.</P>
    <P>Lastly, and most importantly, when we bring about a change in legislation, particularly dealing with the right to vote, would the Minister ensure that there is an advertising campaign in all the media, especially television, to ensure that the people it will affect will know what the legislation is about, how it will affect them and the preparations that are being put in train to allow them to vote.  Not alone are we widening the legislation to include these people but, having done all that, we should make available this vital information which will enable them to take advantage of it.  Once again I ask the Minister to ensure that when this legislation is passed every avenue will be used to ensure that every voter who will come under this broad net will be aware of what is happening and will make arrangements to be included on this list.</P>

      <P>I am glad this Bill has come before the House and we will facilitate its passage in any way we can but we have some criticism of it, and particularly of the most recent amendments.</P>
      <P>In March 1983 a working party, as distinct from The Workers' Party, on the electoral register recommended that postal voting should be extended to the disabled and also to those who could prove they were sick or unable to attend polling stations.  Nothing happened. Twelve months later, in March 1984, The Workers' Party, as distinct from the working party, introduced a Private Members' Bill aimed at providing postal voting facilities for the disabled.  It was intended that it would be in time for them to vote in the 1984 European elections. Amazingly, the Fine Gael and Labour Parties in Coalition opposed this Bill and it was defeated by 73 to 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The then Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, when opposing our Bill said it was piecemeal, that we were dealing with the disabled only, that we were not dealing with <Col N="2429" /> the whole question of postal voting and he recommended the points raised by Deputy Barnes today, that transport workers, seamen, commercial travellers and so on should all have postal votes.  He said in March, 1984 that comprehensive proposals on postal voting were being prepared which would strike a sensible balance between the requirements of those who seek postal voting and the necessity to provide adequate safeguards against abuse.  That has not happened. There was temporary postal voting for the 1985 local elections, and there was much talk of abuse after that, but to my knowledge, there is no evidence of any widespread abuse.  Postal voting was available in the 1974 elections and the working party which reported in 1983 investigated it and said there were allegations of abuses of the postal voting system in the 1974 elections but they could find no evidence of any widespread abuse.  There has not been any evidence that the abuse of the postal voting system is any worse than the abuse of the normal voting system.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous abuses in all polling booths at all elections but that does not say we should not allow people to vote.  This should not stop postal voting being extended to those who need it, yet it has and I believe it has dominated the Ministers thinking in drafting this legislation. The idea seems to be to stop abuse at all costs rather then give the vote to the disabled at all costs.  I do think the Minister has struck the balance he was talking about between the requirements of those who seek postal voting and the necessity to provide adequate safeguards against abuse because the voting for the disabled is most complicated and bureaucratic and postal voting has gone only to civil servants, those attached to diplomatic missions abroad.</P>
    <P>The special system of voting for the disabled is not postal voting at all, and the Minister was thinking of abuse.  For some reason he thought the disabled would abuse this much more than gardaí or members of the Army.  This introduces an entirely new concept of voting for the disabled.  It is good that they are getting <Col N="2430" /> the vote but nevertheless, they are put in a very special category.  Nobody else is in that category and this is what the disabled have always objected to.  They want to be able to do what the able bodied members of society do.  They want to go to the polling stations, collect their ballot paper from the presiding officer, go into the booth and put their vote in the box, just like everybody else.  Many of the disabled could do that, although there are others who could not but there is a special new concept for all disabled persons in this Bill.  It requires the special presiding officer and a member of the Garda to visit the home of a disabled person where the vote is to be cast.  This turns the person's home into a polling booth.  As has already been pointed out, the disabled person might not be at home when these two people call and they will have to come back again.  The special presiding officer, who is a representative of the returning officer, presumably it could be anybody who is nominated.  Why can he not nominate a member of the Garda Síochána and let him call to the disabled person's home in plain clothes? What is the reason for two people calling, a garda and a special presiding officer?  I believe a garda calling to the disabled person's home will be a deterrent.  The garda is superfluous because the disabled person will have already had to provide medical evidence, forms and so on to get on this voting list.  Let somebody call out with the voting papers but allow the disabled person to put it in the post like other people.  Why is postal voting not available to the disabled?</P>
    <P>The extension of the postal vote to other people abroad has already been dealt with by a number of Deputies and by Deputy Kavanagh when he was Minister for the Environment.  Why this Minister can think only of first secretaries and third secretaries serving in missions abroad but cannot think of truck drivers, seamen or fishermen, is unbelievable.  If these people are not at home on election day they cannot vote.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but I must refer to these amendments which suddenly appeared on our desks within <Col N="2431" /> the last hour.  It is unbelievable that a Minister should bring in an amendment which has nothing to do with the special voters list, the disabled or the postal vote. He is taking this opportunity to slip in this amendment covering names of candidates in an election.  This Bill has nothing to do with candidates in an election.</P>

      <P>That is exactly what I am doing, debating it.  I am debating the fact that any Minister should think he could, by sleight of hand, slip this amendment into the disabled postal voting legislation.  This is an unbelievable impertinence on the part of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Any candidate can ask that a person produce an identity document, such as an unmarried mother's book or a children's allowance book.  Men will not have any such documents but women will be asked to produce those documents and if they have left them at home they will have to go home and collect them.  That is unbelievable discrimination.  If everybody is supposed to have an identity card or a certain document, that is different; they can produce it, but only some are to be asked to produce certain unnamed documents.  A candidate may ask that a person produce an identity document but what is that document?  Is it a driver's licence, an unmarried mother's book, a children's allowance book or a deserted wife's book?  Everybody does not have an identity document and if they do not, according to this amendment, they will not be allowed vote.  That is unbelievable. I ask the Minister to withdraw those two amendments and to bring them in in a separate Bill where they can be discussed. They are ruining this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that this legislation has come before the House.  It will give a reasonable opportunity to the disabled to cast their votes without too much disruption of their lives.  Like a <Col N="2432" /> number of other speakers, I am saddened that it was not easier to arrange for postal voting for the disabled.  Various Members of the House in all parties in the last number of years have constantly sought the implementation of a reasonably easy access type of postal voting system for those people.  It is unfortunate that as a result of the gross and constant abuses of previous systems it was not possible to bring in such legislation.  However, the fact that we have this Bill before us today is at least a step in the right direction.  I compliment the Minister for bringing it in.</P>
      <P>There is only one thing I am a little concerned about and that is that the special returning officer will have to visit the individual's household.  That is a rather cumbersome way of doing the job. I already accepted that because of difficulties that have arisen in the past, something has to be done to tighten up the system.  Nonetheless, it is a little cumbersome. Perhaps in the future it will be possible to make the system more accessible.  I would like to reiterate the sentiments expressed by Deputy Barnes a few minutes ago.  It is a sad reflection on our society, a society of lovers of and believers in democracy, that whenever an attempt was made to introduce a facility for voting for people such as the disabled, the abuses were so massive that it had to be discontinued.  That is a very sad reflection on a democracy loving society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle of extending the franchise to people who up to now have been disenfranchised by virtue of their disability.  The system being proposed is so cumbersome and convoluted that it is likely it will not enable many people in that category to vote.  I concur with much of what Deputy Mac Giolla said and therefore I will not repeat it.  The proposal to arrange for two people to visit each individual home is staggeringly bureaucratic.  It is likely to result in people simply not taking up the option.  I cannot understand why a development of the postal voting system would not be adequate if there were proper and fulsome sanctions for abuse, the evidence of which is not readily available. Disabled people are among those people, if one can make those judgments at all, who are least likely to be engaged in that kind of abuse by virtue of the fact that the disablement is easily observable and people who are not entitled to such voting rights could hardly claim them.</P>
      <P>It indicates some degree of significance to our priorities in this respect that we allow an incredibly short period of time for this measure to be introduced and debated.  It is not adequate to allow a couple of hours to debate a measure such as this which has been long promised and which needs not just adequate debate but, in a number of respects, amendment. I ask those in charge of the affairs of this House to ensure in future that if there is to be this kind of limited debate there is a limit on the time of speakers. An hour or two hours to debate any measure is far too short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of special voter in the Bill is unnecessarily restrictive.  I, with many of my colleagues, argue that there are many people whose work takes them outside the ambit of being able to vote at present.  They should be facilitated.  I include people in the public service who work abroad, people in semi-State organisations who are on business abroad or <Col N="2434" /> who are working abroad, seamen whose work regularly takes them out of the country and others.  People in the armed forces and in the Garda get a postal vote and it seems to work quite well.  I know in some cases they are positioned in a particular local but there is no evidence of any substantial or significant abuse in those respects.  It is time for us to trust our people and to gradually introduce a phased development of postal voting for people whose rights are not being respected in this area.  I include people working in the polling stations, some of whom have to forego their rights to vote in order to undertake their civic duties. The scope of the Bill needs to be defined. I am interested also in the distinction that is clearly drawn in relation to the practice of postal voting.  Postal voting is relatively acceptable at local authority level but not at general elections.  Whether that indicates a degree of judgment about the values of those institutions is an interesting question to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment briefly on the two amendments.  I am not clear as to the basis for the amendment relating to the judgment which a returning officer can make about names of candidates, the confusion that misleading names might create, about names that might be unnecessarily long or which might contain political references.  I share Deputy Mac Giolla's view that these amendments fit uneasily into the Bill and do not seem to be part of an approach to broadening democratisation.  I am not clear that there has ever been a problem in this respect. These are not the kind of priorities we should be perturbed about.  There is no manifest evidence I know of to suggest that there has been a problem about misleading names or that names have been causing confusion.  People are quite selective and very clear about whom they vote for.  The reference to a name containing a political reference is somewhat bizarre in the context of an election which is <Col N="2435" /> intensely political.  I urge the Minister to have the courage to trust the people and not to embody an extremely cumbersome and tedious procedure in the Bill.  I know disabled people who, if they hear the only way they will get their vote is by setting up a mini-polling booth for a period of time in their own home and having a visit of a returning officer, or somebody on his behalf, and a garda, may say they are not interested.  If we are seriously interested in extending the right to vote to people who have that constitutional right, we should make it as easy as possible for them to vote.  I do not believe that given the introduction of significant and tough sanctions for abuse there will be any such abuse of the postal voting system.</P>

      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for introducing this legislation. He has faced the real problems experienced by voters.  I am appalled at the simplistic approach of other speakers who said they never heard of abuse of the postal voting system.  A few moments ago Deputy Keating said there was no such thing as abuse and no evidence of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>People have been charged in the courts in connection with such abuse.  Members of political parties registered in the House have been charged with abuse of the postal voting system. Did the Deputy not hear of a big problem in Donegal?  I wonder what world people like Deputy Keating are living in.  Did Deputy Mac Giolla not hear that there was a problem in Donegal?  I would be amazed to think that he did not hear of it.  That Deputy has a very active councillor in Donegal who grabs the headlines from time to time and I would be amazed to hear he did not know there was abuse of the postal voting system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is positively amazing to hear the simplistic approach of some Members who are trying to give the impression they are sympathetic to the disabled but Fianna Fáil, when in power, never made <Col N="2436" /> an effort to change the procedure.  The Minister has come upon a solution which is novel.  It may be a little cumbersome but at least it recognises the problems of the disabled.  If Members of other parties had a solution to the problem it was open to them to bring forward a Private Members' Bill.  However, when it comes to headline seeking and putting over some type of soft message they will peddle it here and say the Minister is wrong.  Those Deputies are being niggardly in their approach.  I commend the Minister for the work he has done in connection with this legislation.  He has shown his concern for the people who want to vote.  I applaud him for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Carey's assertion that Fianna Fáil did not do anything about this problem, I should like to point out to him that the working party which reported on the question of postal voting was established by Fianna Fáil.  It is as a result of their deliberations that the Minister is in a position to bring the Bill before the House.  I welcome the decision of the Minister to provide a facility for the disabled to vote.  However, when he decided to include other categories in the legislation it was most unfair of him to deny other citizens their constituional right to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that a temporary absence of up to 18 months is not regarded as breaking the continuity of residence and that amazes me.  In practice that is not what happens. In my part of the country when a person leaves his or her residence their name is struck off the register.  Those who leave their area to take up temporary employment are immediately struck off the register and that has created problems throughout the west.  Many people have to leave their area to get employment but they are denied the right to vote.  When the Minister decided to include civil servants he should have extended the categories to include others who are maintaining a residence here but are not given a vote.  It is most unfair if people who, because of their place of work or the fact that they cannot find employment <Col N="2437" /> in their own area, are denied a right to vote although civil servants who are absent from home are covered.</P>
    <P>The legislation has been prepared hurriedly. I agree with Deputy Mac Giolla and others that it is an important piece of legislation.  My objection is that the Minister has confined the facility to the disabled and a certain category of civil servants.  The people I am referring to have a constitutional right to vote but that is being denied to them by the Minister. For many years the names of people who leave their home to take up employment elsewhere are deleted from the register of electors shortly after their departure.  The Minister should have given more consideration to those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Bill which is pinning down something that has been like a will-o'-the-wisp for disabled people.  Those people were given an opportunity to vote in 1974 but it was taken from them.  They got an opportunity to vote in last year's local elections but that has been taken from them.  I commend the Minister for dealing with this discrimination against a section of our population that has been going on for a long time.  I agree with the remarks of other Members about those who have not been included in the legislation.  I should like to appeal to the Minister to ensure that his officials continue their efforts to include more people on the special voters register.  I am concerned about people who are working for the Department of Foreign Affairs in the Third World.  I gather they are not covered under diplomatic and consular activities.  Will the Minister ensure that in selecting the special presiding officers, care is taken to appoint people who have an understanding of the needs of disabled people? If possible the people appointed should have had experience of working with the disabled because there will be cases of severely physically handicapped people wanting to vote.  Those people will need special care as they mark their ballot papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister <Col N="2438" /> for including a provision under which a person who may be injured seven days before polling may avail of the new procedure. Some people may not be able to make the journey to a polling booth but they can cast their vote under the new system.  I agree with Deputy Barnes that the Department should embark on an extensive advertising campaign to make people aware of their rights under the Bill.  It should be made clear in those advertisements that those who cannot vote in their local polling booth because of steps or ramps can cast their vote under the new system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Members who have, in general, given a welcome to the legislation.  I accept that the system being introduced is cumbersome and will be expensive but much thought was given to it.  Frankly, the reason postal voting is not being continued for this or any other category is because of the ingenuity of the Irish and the amount of abuse of that system.  Following the postal voting in the local government elections last year 2,640 cases were referred to the Garda although in virtually no case was sufficient evidence available to prosecute.  I could entertain the House from now to midnight outlining the instances that were uncovered.  Primarily, I want to ensure that disabled people get a vote as readily as possible.  Under the new system a ballot paper will be brought to their home and the procedure will be supervised by a member of the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason for Deputy Mac Giolla's objection to a disabled person having a garda visit their home.  It would be a sorry state of affairs if we get to the stage that it is represented that people would be ashamed to have a garda officer bring a ballot paper to a disabled person's home.  I do not believe that is so.  The new amendments are being introduced in response to a particular announcement by an organisation with direct subversive connections that they intend to contest the next election here. It is good that they should contest the election but, based on experience when <Col N="2439" /> that organisation contested elections in the other part of the country, it is clear we must move to prevent candidates changing their name to that of, for example, another candidate, a Member of the House or an emotive name.  It is clear in the light of the wide scale abuses of the electoral system in Northern Ireland that we must now require that people should have some reasonable evidence of identification if they are requested to produce it.  I am not surprised that Deputy Mac Giolla objected to those provisions.</P>

      <P>The structural stabilisation of Ross Castle is a major engineering and architectural project.  It is hoped to have it fully finished and to re-open the castle to visitors by 1991.  Full restoration of the castle is not proposed.</P>
      <P>Works done up to late 1984 included: conservation of the bawn walls and towers; restoration of the original entrance; major masonry repairs and the removal of modern infill in the smaller chambers; major repairs to vaults, windows and doors and the removal of a concrete roof which was endangering the building.</P>
      <P>A serious problem arose at the end of 1984 when it was found that the two cross-walls in the castle were structurally unsound.  These walls, which are substantial in dimension, were inserted in the structure about 300 years ago to consolidate it.  However, they were found to have almost no bonding within them and their removal, as well as the removal of the failed upper vault which they supported, was imperative to allow works to continue in safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This dangerous work, which by its nature was very slow, has now been completed and the main part of the castle is held together by means of steel supports which have been inserted.  This work was essential to prevent the collapse of the castle.  Other recent work involved the taking down of the facing on the inside of the castle walls which will be rebuilt in masonry.  Concrete will be used between the inner and outer faces of the wall to stabilise the structure.  The masonry work is skilled and painstaking and is therefore <Col N="2441" /> time consuming.  When the major consolidation has been completed the roof and parapets will be restored.  Final repair work to the interior will then be undertaken.</P>

The work commenced in 1980 and though I do not attach any blame to the small staff involved, it is a disgrace to have the castle left there.

      <P>I am glad that the Deputy does not attach blame to the staff.  Neither do I.  As is obvious from my reply, the whole reason for the delay in completion of the work is concerned with the safety of the staff, because if the extra unexpected work to make the castle structurally sound, which was discovered to be necessary at the end of 1984, had not been undertaken, any other work would have been dangerous to the staff. The delay necessitated in making the castle safe, both for those working in it and its long term preservation, was essential and I am surprised that the Deputy should criticise the necessary delay involved.  I do not think anybody, tourists or others, would benefit from having a castle that was restored and yet structurally unsound, with the risk of it falling down at any time.</P>

    <P>At 31 May 1986 the cumulative outstanding balance of assessments was approximately £3,833 million and the <Col N="2443" /> estimate of tax likely to be collected was £664 million.</P>
    <P>Largely because of the mechanism of estimated assessments the &ldquo;outstanding balance&rdquo; is in no sense an indication of the amount of tax that is actually due for collection or legally liable to be paid. Estimated assessments are issued in order to induce taxpayers to make income returns.  When made, these returns almost invariably indicate a much lower actual tax liability.</P>
    <P>The amount of £664 million likely to be collected is based on work in progress in relation to all tax years at 31 May 1986. It, too, is an estimated figure based on experience and it takes account of the reductions that are likely to be made on the &ldquo;outstanding balance&rdquo; as a result of appeal and other adjustments.  It does not represent an amount of tax actually due for collection on 31 May, 1986.  In many instances the liabilities had not even been finalished by that date.  For example, in the case of corporation tax, money is included in this figure which is not actually due to be paid until a later date in the same year and thus is not outstanding at all, in the sense of being due for immediate payment.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be aware that I issued a press release yesterday which dealt with the issue arising in this question.  As indicated in that press release I am urgently examining a number of matters in relation to improving our tax assessment and collection system.</P>

      <P>We cannot say we are obliged to the Minister for the information because he deliberately gave a press conference yesterday to pre-empt this question from a Member, and that is an affront to the House.  When questions are down for answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the information <Col N="2444" /> disclosed by the Minister last night rather than to the House today, would he attempt to explain why assessments are issued by paid officials of the Revenue Commissioners on which payments eventually represent only 17 per cent of the assessments?  Would he explain why he and his predecessors in the past four years have presided over such a chaotic system which in effect means that only 17 per cent of the amount assessed for income tax is likely to be collected? Would he attempt to explain how the Government have presided over such a mess, to no effect but which gives rise to a considerable degree of frustration, despite the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation during the past four years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the first part of the question, the information given last evening actually facilitates Deputy O'Kennedy putting questions in addition to the one posed by Deputy Molloy.  Far from making it more difficult for the Deputy, it makes it easier. Second, the use of estimated assessments has been a feature of revenue collection in Ireland under the aegis of numerous Governments.  It was also a practice which caused many difficulties during the brief period when Deputy O'Kennedy was Minister for Finance.  Therefore it is nothing new, it has been a feature of tax collection in Ireland for years and years under successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I accept the basic thrust of Deputy O'Kennedy's question, which is, that estimated assessments issued in order to get taxpayers to comply with requirements with which they should be complying in the first place, namely, the furnishing of proper returns, do give a misleading impression as to the amount of money that is actually available for collection or even due in any sense.  That is precisely the reason I am taking steps &mdash; on foot of the Final Report of the Commission on Taxation which was only received in October 1985 &mdash; to seek to institute a system of self-assessment as far as tax is concerned, under which taxpayers would have an obligation to <Col N="2445" /> submit returns themselves, on time, without having to receive an inflated estimated assessment from the Revenue Commissioner.  That will lead to more prompt collection of tax, more efficient use of revenue resources, concentrating on where there is a genuine need and the removal of the invidious comparisions that arise from the misinterpretation of estimated assessments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the fact that the Minister has belatedly come around to the Fianna Fáil thinking on self-assessment which we announced and asserted immediately &mdash; though the Minister now claims it to be his proposal &mdash; would he not acknowledge that the system over which he has presided flies in the face of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation which I set up five or six years ago because I saw then the need for reform?  If it was obvious to me six years ago surely it must have been obvious to this Government four years ago?  Therefore, how can the Minister and the Government justifiy presiding over such a chaotic system which is not just inaccurate but imposes extra expenditure on citizens and accountants, the expenditure of more time, and also imposes an impossible burden on Revenue staff endeavouring to cope with what is submitted by way of inaccurate assessments and which it must be clear to anybody is totally and utterly inappropriate? In the light of those facts and the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation would the Minister please explain how he and his predecessors have allowed this mess to continue when, in their last gasp, they say they will do something about it?</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Commission on Taxation in regard to self-assessment were made only 12 months ago in their fifth report.  Furthermore, I might say that approximatley 14 pages only of a voluminous report was the total devoted to self-assessment.</P>

      <P>That leaves many detailed questions of practical implementation to be sorted out.  What have we done about that since the report was published? We have done the following: first, we have arranged for an outside expert team to come in here &mdash; and it takes some time to organise this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;involving two people who have worked most of their lifetime in the US Inland Revenue, who are dealing with problems of self-assessment. They are at present in this country under the aegis of the International Monetary Fund consultancy service.  Second, I have prepared a discussion document, available to me at this time, dealing with the overall question of self-assessment. Clearly the introduction of self-assessment will necessitate major changes in revenue practice in this country and on the part of taxpayers.  For instance, if it is to work, much more serious penalities will need to be available for immediate implementation in respect of taxpayers who fail to comply.  Study needs to be devoted to what precise penalties are most effective.  Also, as I explained to the Deputy in the course of an Adjournment Debate here not so long ago, there is the danger that in the first year that self-assessment is introduced, because of the teething problems, there could be a shortfall in revenue, so that instead of getting more money one would get less in the first year.  That is a practical difficulty which I hope the team of experts from overseas who are here at present will help us to overcome.  There are a number of other difficulties, which I have outlined in reply to the Deputy on an Adjournment Debate here that need to be sorted out. I am glad to say that the study to which I referred is being dealt with with the height of expedition.  I expect to have a report from this expert team before the end of this month.  I expect to be able to take decisions on foot of that report next month.  That clearly indicates the high degree of urgency with which I and the Government have dealt with the problem <Col N="2447" /> of the inefficiencies &mdash; and they are acknowledged on all sides of the House &mdash; that exist in our tax system.</P>

I might pose two questions: first, what was it that brought the Minister eventually to realise that there was a very substantial sum of over £600 million collectable in outstanding taxes, something I had been pointing out for a number of years? Second, assuming that at least 80 per cent of these are collectable taxes &mdash; approximately £500 million &mdash; will the Minister take them into consideration in preparing his budget and reduce the PAYE burden accordingly, particularly on the lower income groups?</P>

It is important to acknowledge that, while there are some people in all sections of the community who are not meeting their tax liabilities, likewise among all sections of the community there are a majority who are.  It is in fairness to those people that we feel we should give the urgency we are giving to improving tax administration.</P>

      <P>Irrespective of what the question that the Minister is replying to was about, is he aware of the report in today's papers of the profits of Guinness, Ireland leaping to 31 per cent? Is he aware that in the case of that company not alone were the profits paid last year 5 per cent but it is unlikely that any profits will be paid in the next seven years because of the capital allowances they have accumulated of £120 million to offset against tax?  In view of the very high profits being made by this company, does the Minister consider that it is right that they should pay no tax whatever as a result of the capital allowances?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to comment on the affairs of any taxpayer. However, many of those who are responsible for the creation of employment by investment of substantial sums borrow those sums of money and the interest that they pay on that money and the capital allowances that they are entitled to on investment provide them with the means of reducing the tax that they pay. However, if the investment had not been made in the first place, the jobs would not exist and the PAYE revenue from the people employed in the company would not arise with the Exchequer.  It is important not to consider the matter in isolation of the employment that is created.</P>

      <P>In view of the immense contribution the GAA have made to our social and cultural heritage over 100 years, surely the Minister can give some idea if he is prepared to remove VAT rather than saying it is going to be or that it may or may not be implemented.  I do not think the Minister is going to introduce the budget but he should give some recognition to the worthwhile contribution of the GAA over the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily acknowledge the contribution made by the GAA to national life.  As the Minister who was responsible for sport for four years along with my predecessor and my successors in the office of Minister for Education and other offices holding responsibilities we have made substantial sums of money available to the GAA.  It is fair to say that the fact that the standard of dressing rooms and other facilities at GAA clubs is so much better now than it was 15 years ago is in no small measure due to the substantial sums of money allocated to the GAA by successive Governments involving substantial amounts of tax-payer's money.  Any complaints the GAA might have about the imposition of taxes on them should be seen against the background of the very substantial investment successive Governments have made in the GAA and in particular in creating a situation where players can now change in modern dressing rooms in most clubs where 15 to 20 years ago they had to change at the back of a ditch.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that farmers who live in Lough Carra catchment area are very dissatisfied with the decision of the Office of Public Works not to place a sluice at Keel West and suggest that the Office of Public Works have spent many thousands of pounds on this area, which will be of no benefit to farmers and state that an undertaking given to them in relation to this matter has been ignored; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>An extensive hydrological study undertaken by the Office of Public Works before drainage works commenced in this area established that, effectively, the high flood levels in Lough Carra were controlled, not by the weir at Keel, but by severe channel obstructions in the Keel River immediately downstream of Keel Bridge.  This study also revealed that the installation of a sluice at the weir, as originally proposed, would provide little, if any, extra flood relief and could not therefore be justified.</P>
      <P>Extensive works including the removal of the obstructions, have now been carried out on the Keel River which will have the effect of substantially reducing both the level and duration of flooding in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the farming community in the area are not at all satisfied that a worthwhile job has been done and that they still have to tolerate a great deal of flooding despite the amount of money which has been spent on works in the area by the Office of Public Works?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The works were finally completed only last month.  Therefore, it is a bit early to be drawing any conclusions as to whether they are adequate or not.  Obviously, the Office of Public Works have satisfied themselves on the <Col N="2464" /> basis of the scientific advice available to them from their own experts that the work done is adequate for the purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <P>First of all, as I said, the work has only been completed.  Secondly, this is not a typical year.  The level of the water table is considerably higher this year than it would be in a normal year taking the average of between 10 to 20 years into account.  It would be far wiser from the point of view of care for public money at least to wait for a year or two before drawing the conclusions that Deputy Gallagher is seeking to get me to draw on this occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, in a very <Col N="2465" /> extensive report running to many thousands of pages the Commission on Taxation devoted only 14 pages to the question of self-assessment.  In those 14 pages they indicated a number of practical matters which would have to be sorted out before self-assessment could be introduced.  It is in order to address those practical problems that the consultants have been brought in.  I should say that the consultants are being brought in at no cost to the taxpayer and it is one of the privileges which goes with membership of the International Monetary Fund.  It is a very good use of the International Monetary Fund to use it to bring in experts who have practical experience in self-assessment in the United States to do, as I have already indicated, a speedy report with a view to early action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 19, 29, and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These questions all relate to <i>Building on Reality,</i> the continued relevance of the policies contained therein and the <Col N="2467" /> particular problems of the public finances and unemployment in that context.  The general economic strategy contained in <i>Building on Reality</i> remains firm Government policy, but the inevitability of divergences from specific targets and projections, due to internal and external factors, must be accepted.  In the case of <i>Building on Reality,</i> substantial progress has been made in certain respects while, in others, more remains to be done.  With regard to the main macro-economic objectives, inflation now is much lower than anticipated and the balance of payments deficit as a percentage of GNP has been reduced to about half the level envisaged.  The growth in output over 1985 and 1986 has been below expectations, due to the effects of adverse weather conditions on agriculture and tourism and slower growth in external markets, and private sector job creation has been slower, which has meant that unemployment will stabilise at a higher level than projected in the plan.</P>
    <P>With regard specifically to the public finances, the central objective of the plan was to halt their deterioration and end the upward spiral of debt and taxation which had been in danger of becoming irreversible.  Much progress has been made in respect of this objective. Exchequer borrowing has fallen from 15.7 per cent of GNP in 1982 to this year's likely outturn of just over 13 per cent. Although higher than envisaged in the plan, this represents an enormous improvement over what would have been the case had the Government failed to take corrective action.  The Government have confirmed, in the statement of 16 October, their intention of reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement to less than 11.8 per cent of GNP next year and of reducing the current budget deficit to not more than 7.4 per cent.  As I have already mentioned in the House, such a reduction in the borrowing requirement will mean that its non-interest component will be reduced to less than one-half of 1 per cent of GNP.  This in effect means that almost all our borrowing next year <Col N="2468" /> will go towards paying interest on past debt.</P>
    <P>Tackling the unemployment crisis, as indicated in <i>Building on Reality</i>, is not a &ldquo;question of establishing numerical goals&rdquo; but rather of laying secure foundations for expansion of sustainable, productive activity.  Although employment trends have been weaker than hoped for, the analysis in the plan and the policy approach outlined &mdash; curbing borrowing and strengthening competitiveness &mdash; remain valid.  In addition to building a foundation for the future, the Government have been prepared, within the overall strategy, to act directly on employment, as evidenced by the October 1985 initiatives which are proving a tremendous success.</P>
    <P>The Government remain convinced that the twin and inter-related problems of unemployment and excessive borrowing must be tackled together and are framing the 1987 budget in this light.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy the figure.  The number of people projected to be out of work at mid-April 1987 was 210,000 or 15¼ per cent of the labour force.  For 1986 on average the total projected to be out of work is 234,000 or 18 per cent of the labour force. As I indicated in an earlier reply the level of unemployment is higher than the Government had hoped would be the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware the position is that the budget deficit projected for 1987, in accordance with the Government's announcement in October, is 7.4 per cent.  The Government had hoped in <i>Building on Reality</i> to achieve a current budget deficit in 1987 of 5 per cent of GNP.  That will not now be achieved.  This is the case for a number of reasons.  The main reason is that the level of economic activity generally which generates both tax revenue and reduces the level of social welfare payments which need to be paid out has not been as high as we expected.  For instance, we had been projecting a growth in world trade of 5 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>However it turned out to be only 3½ per cent.  Ireland is a country which exports 60 per cent of what it produces.  Therefore, when there is a deficiency in the anticipated level of growth in world trade Ireland, as an exporting nation, is disproportionately affected and that in turn affects the public finances.  Last year and again this year we have had very poor weather conditions. This affected economic activity in agriculture and tourism.</P>

      <P>Any plan must be based on firm decisions which have been taken. A plan simply explains the likely consequences of those decisions.  The most important priority for us all is to ensure that decisions are taken to reduce the level of public spending in such a way as to reduce Government borrowing so as to help reduce interest rates in our community and thus give a sound basis for extra job creation.  My priority at this time is not the preparation of a paper document called a plan but is rather to have decisions taken by the Cabinet in regard to the 1987 budget and to laying out the lines of subsequent budgets into <Col N="2472" /> the next decade.  Those decisions are far more valuable in their long term effect than the publication of any document by anybody.</P>

      <P>I want to have a reply to that question.  The Minister indicated that the main target of <i>Building on Reality</i> was and still is with the Government, that is that unemployment and excessive borrowing would be reduced simultaneously.  Would the Minister like to explain to the House and to the nation how he can reconcile that with the fact that those two elements are the elements which have grown at the most enormous rate, unemployment up to 240,000 and total national debt up to over £23 million, almost doubled since this Government came into office?  Is that the Minister's notion of simultaneous reduction in unemployment and borrowing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister mentions that unemployment is stabilised at a higher level than projected in the plan, would he not acknowledge that that is a very unhealthy form of stabilisation, particularly if account is taken of the fact that in stabilising, even at this higher level than projected in the plan, we have had to export over 120,000 of our youngest, finest and best?  Could we have a formal funeral service for <i>Building on Reality,</i> perhaps at less cost than the formal ceremony in Dublin Castle, to launch this nonsense.  It was launched at great expense, a great lavish production &mdash;<Col N="2473" /> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer never did anything like it.  I can assure the Minister that there would be thousands attending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>These are elaborations of projections.  As the Deputy is well aware, Governments all over the world <Col N="2475" /> are publishing projections about how the economy will perform on a monthly basis almost, certainly on a yearly basis.  The EC, for example, publishes projections every year in its annual report about what is likely to happen to unemployment in each of the member states.  If that is not achieved, nobody says to the EC that it broke its promise because the particular projection was not achieved in the particular member state.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were to achieve the situation he seems to want to achieve, which is that any projection made by a Government about anything is immediately converted for political debate purposes into a promise, then no Government would ever make a projection about anything.  That, to my mind, would not be desirable because the Government have information available to them which is useful in assessing economic policy.  Sometimes things do not turn out as expected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;sometimes they turn out better.  In the case of inflation and the balance of trade the results were better than those expected in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  In the case of other matters such as unemployment, the results were not as good.  However, I see no reason that we should not publish projections of this kind and revise them from time to time. I have already indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question that this projection has been revised, is not going to be achieved and that there is no attempt here at concealment on the part of the Government.  I think it is better for all of us to debate matters of this kind on the basis of a true appreciation of the up to date situation, rather than attempting to rake over the coals for purely sterile party purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not stated in his question what monetary base is envisaged for such a levy.  It is estimated by the pensions industry that the total assets of funded pension schemes may currently amount to about £4,000 million but presumably the Deputy is not asking about a levy of 10 per cent or 20 per cent on these assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is inquiring about a levy on the investment income there are two possibilities, depending on whether the benefits paid out to pension beneficiaries are netted off or not.  There is no firm figure to hand for the total amount of investment income accruing to all funded pension schemes in 1986. The best estimate available is that pension funds may receive of the order of £350 million in 1986 in investment income and realised capital gains, net of benefits paid out to beneficiaries.  A levy of 10 per cent on such a base would yield £35 million and a levy of 20 per cent would yield £70 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not acknowledge that any such levy would be very undesirable for a number of reasons?  First, it would further undermine investment confidence in this country, which has already been decimated by taxes such as the DIRT tax and others introduced by the Minister.  Secondly, it would be unfair in that it could only apply to funded pension schemes in the private <Col N="2477" /> sector, or sometimes in the semi-State sector, but could not extend to non-funded schemes such as those in the public sector.  That would be blatantly and obviously discriminatory.  Thirdly, in view of the fact that these pension funds are applied to a very considerable extent towards national developments or national assets &mdash; about 45 to 50 per cent are held in Government stock and a further 20 to 25 per cent in companies securities in Ireland, though there is not much joy for them in that now &mdash; and as only about 10 per cent at the moment is invested outside, would the Minister not acknowledge that for all those reasons &mdash; equity, the whole climate and lack of confidence in our financial institutions at the moment and, finally, because so much is available for investment here &mdash; that it would be very damaging indeed to take short term advantage for the sake of getting a few more pounds into the maw of the impoverished Minister for Finance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>In view of the amount involved &mdash; the Minister said in one case, 10 per cent, or £835 million, and that the levy will only be £70 million &mdash; the Minister should indicate whether he would contemplate such a disastrous proposal. If he did not, investment confidence can be restored.  In view of the damage caused by the imposition of DIRT, will the Minister indicate, before more money flows out of the country, that he will not do so?  We will lose millions if things go on as at present.</P>

      <P>How can the Minister reconcile that statement in view of the fact that £25 million was provided in the budget Estimates this year for house grants and that £240 million will be paid next year?  There was a provision of £140 million for public sector pay, excluding special payments, but that has now risen to £380 million.  There is also a projection for low interest rates for farmers and, as reported in today's newspapers, back payments will have to be made to married women for social welfare amounting to £30 million.  From those few examples, it is clear that over £400 million is being transferred to next year's Estimates for commitments given this year, although the Government claim they will reduce the budget next year by £300 million. They cannot face up to the consequences of their disastrous economic management. The Minister must be aware of the fact that those figures are ascertainable, especially in relation to the Department of the Environment.  We will be paying next year for the Minister's promises.</P>

      <P>Late yesterday afternoon when I became aware that the contract with the salvors, Smit Tak, had been terminated by the insurers, the P &amp; I Club, I immediately made known to the insurers, the owners and their agents my serious concern about this development because of the danger of major harmful consequences through pollution by oil from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> to the coastline of Ireland and related interests.  I have now sought their immediate assurance that they will comply with the terms of the direction and requested that I be informed of what steps they now propose to take to comply with the direction.  I am awaiting their reply before considering what further action I may take.</P>

      <P>In view of the change of attitude by the insurance company involved in cancelling the salvage opertions for the removal of the oil and ordering the tug on standby to leave the scene of the disaster, is the Minister fully satisfied that the company and their agents will pursue operations for removing all this oil, thereby preserving our fish and birdlife along the south-west coast?</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that given the atrocious weather conditions in the south-west since the accident involving the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, every reasonable effort has been made by the owners and their agents to remove the wreck and its oil.  In the last day or two a diver <Col N="2482" /> almost lost his life in his efforts to remove the oil from the ship.  I do not think we can reasonably complain that there have not been any real efforts made by the owners or their agents to remove the oil. Nevertheless we are left with a tricky situation, with a ship under the sea and oil escaping, thereby creating a danger of pollution.  As I understand it, we would need a forecast of a number of days good weather before efforts could be recommenced to take the oil off the ship.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister elaborate on the press statement released by the Government Information Office yesterday evening that the operation had been suspended due to bad weather? Today he stood in the House and said the contract was cancelled, he has contacted the insurers and is awaiting their reply. How come there is such a difference in the two statements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference in the statements.  The difference is in the Deputy's ability to understand the reply. The salvage operation has been cancelled for the time being because, I assume, the insurers felt there was not much sense paying very substanial fees to the salvors who will be standing by because of inclement weather for perhaps days.  My understanding is that the salvage operation will be resumed as soon as the forecast indicates clement weather for at least a few days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is a clear and categorical no.  In 1906 the then Parliament at Westminster decided to amend the 1984 Merchant Shipping Act specificaly to exempt from powers of detention ships which came to port because of what is called <i>force majeure</i>, in other words, ships which came to port in distress because of weather or other conditions. That amendment was introduced because of the number of lives lost at sea because of ships' fear of detention by coming into a port of refuge during a storm.  That section was specifically inserted to save lives.  Whatever can be said about this casualty, the handling of it has saved lives.  This <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> casualty went in parallel with the threatened casualty of the <i>Capo Emma</i> which represented a much greater danger to our coastline than the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> does even at present.  That crisis has passed. All the oil has been discharged and has left our territory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 23, after &ldquo;Articles 33 and 34&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided that</P>
      <P>(i)  nothing in the Single European Act or in the Treaties as amended by the Act shall authorise in the State, laws, measures or Acts of the Communities or of the State which are repugnant to the fundamental rights recognised in Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  a Declaration to this effect be notified to the High Contracting Parties of the Single European Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third amendment to the Constitution, Article 29.4.3, which permits Ireland's accession to the European Community, has the effect of legitimising all Community legislation in this country without restriction by any Article of the Constitution.  Fundamental rights play an increasingly important part in Community law.  The content of these rights is derived from the treaties, from the constitutional traditions common to the member states and in particular from the European Convention on Human Rights. The fundamental rights in Articles 40 to 44 of the Irish Constitution differ in some important respects from the fundamental rights of other member states.  Notable examples are the right to life of the <Col N="2528" /> unborn and the rights of the family based on marriage which has been reaffirmed in the recent past by the Irish people, as we all know.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act will extend the scope of Community law and will give the Community new powers to achieve a harmonisation of laws in the member states acting on a qualified majority.  An analysis of the Act reveals the possibility that this extension of powers would lead to a conflict with fundamental rights in the Irish Constitution and that the Act would not provide adequate safeguards for such rights.  The explanatory guide which the Government issued recently refers to such possibilities.  In relation to abortion services, while the Government believe that possibility is removed by a particular provision in the Act, there is uncertainty and inadequacy in respect of this remedy.  There is a serious danger in the Act to some constitutionally protected rights and values.</P>
    <P>Economic and foreign policy aspects of the Single European Act are outside the scope of this memorandum.  If ratification of this Act will serve the common good in economic and political spheres, it should only be done on condition that the fundamental rights in the Irish Constitution are adequately protected.  A number of declarations have been appended to the Single European Act.  They include a number of unilateral declarations, including one on insurance by this Government which reserves a position on various matters. While a unilateral declaration would be unlikely to influence the interpretation of the Act by the Court of Justice, it might well allow the member state in question to resist measures which conflict with the reserved position.</P>
    <P>The proposed solution, therefore, is the addition of this further declaration to the Act stating clearly that the Irish ratification of the Act is without prejudice to the fundamental rights and values protected in Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution. Consequently, this amendment is for the primary purpose of safeguarding family rights as enshrined in our Constitution, especially the right to life of the unborn.  It is to ensure that no legislation, <Col N="2529" /> no new laws or directives emanting from Europe or anywhere else shall be allowed to compromise or undermine the cherished rights, so much valued by our people, in Articles 40 to 41 of the Constitution. This House puts down a marker to all our friends in Europe that a family, in so far as our Constitution is concerned, is basic and fundamental, possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent weeks and in particular in the last couple of days many people have shown their deep concern about the implications of the Single European Act for the protection of the fundamental rights recognised by the Irish Constitution.  A clear case has been made and I want to hear the Government's response to it.  These fundamental rights are enunciated in Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution.  As the House knows, these Articles cover personal rights, the family, education, private property and religion. The common Preamble to the Single European Act refers for the first time to the fundamental rights recognised in the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms under the auspices of the Council of Europe.  It is argued that the Single European Act can be taken to authorise the Court of Justice to regard the human rights convention as providing that court with the principles to which it should adhere in the field of fundamental rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Community law overrides not merely domestic law but also the Constitution and has the force of law, the Human Rights Convention does not have direct force of law in Ireland at present. This is the nub of the whole matter.  The argument is that the fundamental rights set out in the convention, where they are in conflict with the fundamental rights as laid down in Articles 40 to 44 of the Irish Constitution, may well prevail.  This would mean, in theory at least, that the European Court of Justice could overturn fundamental rights as enshrined in the Irish Constitution in favour of principles set out in the convention.  I would like <Col N="2530" /> the Government to deal very definitely and satisfactorily with this issue by accepting this amendment.  A case has been made and we would like to have it answered in this House.  The view is held by many that the fears could be put aside if the amendment is accepted by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We were enabled, under Article 29.4.3º of the Constitution, to join the EC.  That Article states:</P>
      <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
      <P>That is the basis on which our membership rests.  It enables us, under the Constitution, to be members of that Community.  The very important words in that provision in regard to the measure, and in particular the amendment, that we are discussing are &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities&rdquo;. What we are proposing to do by way of enacting an Act in this House is not necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities.  It is far from it.  We are passing the Bill into law to provide for the possibility of new and additional articles to be added to the Treaty of Rome.  It is only under the articles of the Treaty of Rome as it was in 1972-73 that the words &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities&rdquo; come into play.  It is not within the competence of this House to deal with anything beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I support the intention of the amendment put down by Deputy Sean Treacy in a last desperate effort to try to retain some sort of sovereignty over our country, we are unconstitutional in what we are doing, in what we have been doing and in anything we will do following on the alleged power that will be given if this Bill becomes an Act.  Those additional matters that are being talked about are <Col N="2531" /> not necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Community under the Treaty as it is and as it was when we became members.  It is only in that context that we can possibly enact any measure whatsoever.  Any additional measure that we enact is outside the mandate our Constitution gave us under the provisions in Article 29.4.3º.  This is the nub of our entire objection to dealing with the matter in this manner.  I hope the Minister will say how the Government can overcome what will be done in the future on our behalf by the Commission.  Article 29.4.3º states that no provision of the Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities.  The operative words are in Article 29.4.3º and they are outside the Articles of the Treaty under which we became a member and which were accepted by way of referendum. Anything beyond that is not within our competence to deal with until our people are consulted and agree to extend that mandate to cover future occurences.  The Minister must have been satisfied by somebody that what I have said is not operative.  Until he, with the best knowledge available to him, can convince me otherwise nothing will make me believe other than that what we are doing is beyond the competence of the House unless we go back to the people in a referendum.</P>

      <P>The House amended the Treaty on a number of occasions since the referendum in 1972.  I understand that the last time we amended the Treaty was to give budgetary powers to the Parliament. That was done by a vote in the House and not by way of referendum.  The third amendment to the Constitution which allowed us to become part of the Community, defined the limits within which changes could be made.  On the advice we have got we are satisfied that this is well within them.  I made that clear last night and the Taoiseach made it clear, as did a number of legal experts in articles <Col N="2532" /> in newspapers.  What we are doing now is well within our rights under the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out that a lot of the argument on this matter was outside the House.  A case had been made by those who believe that a referendum should be held and by those who feel a referendum is not necessary.  The advice of the senior law officer of the Government is to the effect that a referendum is not necessary and that we are not going beyond what was envisaged in the third amendment to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputies Treacy and Collins that the Single European Act does not authorise the Court of Justice of the European Communities to interpret or apply the European Convention on Human Rights, notwithstanding the reference in the Preamble to the Single European Act to the Convention.  This follows from Articles 31 and 32 of the Single European Act.  Article 31 provides that the powers of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, under the European Community Treaties, shall apply pursuant to the provisions of the Single European Act only to the provisions of Title II containing the amendments to the European Community Treaties and to Article 32 of the Single European Act.  Article 32 provides:</P>
      <P>subject to Article 3(1), to Title II and to Article 31 &mdash; just referred to, all of which concern the European Community Treaties and nothing else &mdash; nothing in the Single European Act shall affect the Treaties establishing the European Communities or any subsequent Treaties and Acts modifying or supplementing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two provisions taken together have the following effects: (i) the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice remains confined to the European Community Treaties, (ii) the statements in the Preamble, <Col N="2533" /> including that on the European Convention on Human Rights, do not affect European Community Treaties and, accordingly, the contents of the Convention are not by virtue of the Preamble in any way imported into the Treaties and (iii) it should be added to this that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has already decided in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the European Communities Treaties as they stand that it is liable in its judgement by the principles laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular the Rutili judgment case number 36 of 1975, 1975 ECR 1219.  The application of these principles by the Court of Justice can, however, only arise in the exercise of its existing jurisdiction under the European Treaties.  Moreover, the best view seems to be that the court acting within this sphere does not have jurisdiction to lay down interpretations of the Human Rights Convention which, after all, has its own system of interpretation by the European Court on Human Rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Without casting any reflection on the information the Minister has given the House I should like to point out that he has not clarified my mind on this.  It may be that my mind is slightly different from the minds of other Members.  Following that explanation, the position is as clear as mud.  The Minister and I campaigned very heavily in favour of Ireland joining the Community. We did so for all the best reasons, I hope. The very grave doubts expressed were answered at the end of the day by a statement that we could resort to the protection we have.  I would not have campaigned at all but for the fact that I believed that the carrot that was held out in the form of the veto to protect our interests and our national sovereignty was available to us although our country would be in a great big pool in the EC. That pool has got a lot bigger since and it may be enlarged further.  Our campaign on that was successful if one is to judge by the percentage that voted in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill is passed the crazy deal <Col N="2534" /> worked out when the Twelve were together last weekend &mdash; 11 NATO members and our little self &mdash; will be accepted.  If we do not adopt this Act, that deal cannot be implemented.  I heard Members last night saying that the other 11 would go their own way and we would be left behind but left behind where? Where would the Eleven be going?</P>
    <P>This Act cannot come into operation until the Houses of the Oireachtas have cleared it and it has been signed by the President.  We are not obliged to do that before the end of the year and most other countries will not be approving it before the end of the year.  For instance, I understand that Germany will not be ratifying it because of a pending election.  They are taking the view that there may be changes in the Government.  There may be changes in the Government here.  It would be prudent to leave this menace until after the election.  We must remember that there is no urgency about this. The veto, the last weapon, the irresistible weapon given to every country big or small, is being set aside and no amount of assurances, as were given by speakers on the Government side last night, about the vital national interest not being trampled upon will satisfy me.  Who will decide what is the vital national interest as far as the Irish people are concerned?  Is it the Commission, or the Council of Ministers, or the heads of Governments?  The vital national interest will not be determined by us if we go along with what is before us here today.</P>
    <P>What we are doing is not necessitated by the obligations of EC membership and is, therefore, outside the competence of this House to deal with.  This law would take away those rights, and no amount of persuasion, assurances or soft talk will get away from the fact that the veto, our final weapon of defence, is being removed because, as the Taoiseach said last night, it was being abused.  Damn me, we did not abuse it.  I think we reluctantly used it once.  If we had abused it we would not be in the sorry state we are in at the moment.  It is because we did not use it that we are in the difficulties we are in <i>vis-á-vis</i> the CAP and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2535" /> It is because I do not agree with this that, according to the Taoiseach, I am suffering from a historic Irish inferiority complex.  The Taoiseach said that we abused the veto and we have to set that side.  As I have said, we did not abuse it and it is those who go along with this, not those who object to it, who suffer from the national malady of an inferiority complex. Having sold out the Six-Counties under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, we are now making a present of the Twenty-six Counties to the bureaucrats in Brussels. I have great regard for them but they must be kept in their place, and this is not the way to do it.</P>
    <P>I say this is not within our competence because it is not necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Community, which is the mandate we have under Article 29.4.3º as enacted by the people in the 1972 referendum.  Until that is amended we are running totally against the entire idea of controlling our destiny and handing it over willy nilly to whoever may come together, whatever their intentions may be, whether it is multinational profit, which seems to be what this is all about.  The majority decision will determine our future and we will be dragged here, there and elsewhere, the little country that we are.  We would never be there, in my estimation, if we did not rely on the final argument that the veto was our protection &mdash; we would have been campaigning against it.  That might not have been good at that time, but if we are going to be a tiny appendage on the rock of Europe, dictated to by 11 NATO members in regard to everything, not just security and defence but all matters, the vital national interest which we have maintained for our protection will not be determined by us.  We may claim that our vital national interest is being infringed, but who will decide?  The other 11 will decide whether it is our vital national interest or not.</P>
    <P>By adopting the Single European Act, therefore, we are cocking a snook at the electorate, cocking a snook at the Irish people and the Irish Constitution, and no <Col N="2536" /> amount of glib talk, true or false, will get away from the fact that this is not necessitated by the obligations of our membership.  The veto, in effect, is being taken away.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blaney's remarks go well beyond the two amendments before the House.  He began by disputing the procedure being followed and suggested that this is not a matter on which this House is competent, and he suggested that the issue at stake is so fundamental that it should go to a referendum.  What is involved here is a series of relatively minor amendments to the Treaty of Rome.  There is nothing new about that. It has been amended half a dozen times since we became a member.  The occasions on which the Treaty was amended are set out in the first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously calling these relatively minor amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of those amendments were relatively minor, for example, technical amendments when Greenland lapsed.  Some of them were amendments of fundamental importance to Ireland, such as those relating to the budgetary powers of Parliament.  Others were amendments of potential indirect importance to us, such as the enlargement of the Community by the inclusion of Greece and later Spain and Portugal. What is happening now happened on every previous occasion when the Treaty required to be amended.  The original decision by the people contemplated that the Treaty would be amended from time to time, and that was correct because in a short period amendments were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney suggested that these amendments are of a particularly distinct and fundamental kind.  He made particular reference to the veto and said that what is involved here is a complete transformation of our membership because, he said, the basis of the case that he argued for membership no longer <Col N="2537" /> exists.  He argued for membership on the basis that as a last resort as a small country, we would have the veto to protect us, and that that is no longer the case.</P>
    <P>That is utter nonsense.  There is nothing in the Single European Act, good, bad or indifferent, about the use of the veto, because the use of the veto is not in any sense governed by the Treaties in the first place, as Deputy Blaney must be aware as one who attended Council meetings in the past and who had served in the European Parliament.  The veto represents a political compromise and it remains undiminished and is available to countries who seek to use it in their vital national interests.  The confusion arises in some people's minds because while the Single European Act does not in any sense address the question of the veto, it addresses decision making in the Communities.  A number of circumstances are laid down for decisions to be made by majority vote and for decisions by unanimity.  All that the Single European Act does is to extend the circumstances to which majority voting will apply and correspondingly to reduce the occasions on which unanimity is required.  It is the contention of this side of the House that the circumstances which are being added to the majority column, as it were, are very much to Ireland's advantage because they enhance the prospects of moving towards a genuine single market, one of the reasons why we joined the Communities in the first place.</P>
    <P>In regard to the two amendments, there seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the Community is about, what the Treaty of Rome is about and of the amendments to it which the Single European Act constitutes.  Of course, our membership had legal implications for us, and constitutional implications. They have existed since the very first day.  Nothing is being changed by the Single European Act, nothing whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy's anxieties relate to the Articles of the Constitution that deal with fundamental rights, Articles 40 to 44. Some of those Articles deal with matters <Col N="2538" /> that are not the business of the Treaty of Rome at all.  So that the prospect of those questions ever being litigated does not arise.  The Treaty of Rome does not have jurisdiction in relation to religion, morality or education.  It is true that some of those Articles relate to areas where one could comtemplate decisions of the European Court of Justice arising.  For example, areas of property are, in the nature of things, economic.  There are areas where, it may be, there will be court decisions which will be of importance, just as there may have been court decisions of importance since our accession.  But there is nothing new, in terms of a new jurisdiction being added by virtue of the Single European Act, nothing new whatsoever.  The suggestion that the Single European Act incorporates, or tags on in some way, the European Convention on Human Rights is groundless.  There are a whole series of decisions of our High Court and Supreme Court which assert very clearly &mdash; going right back to the early sixties &mdash; that the European Convention on Human Rights does not form part or our domestic law. The jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, established by the Treaty of Rome, is to interpret the Treaty of Rome and that which goes with it, not to deal with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>If one wanders down to the Supreme Court, where constitutional cases are argued each day of the week one will find lawyers seeking inspiration from the European Convention on Human Rights, seeking inspiration from decisions on the French.  American and any other Constitution. Equally, if one wandered into the American Supreme Court on a good day very likely one would find there judgments of judges like the late Cearbhail Ó Dálaigh or Mr. Justice Brian Walsh being cited.  There is nothing unusual or abnormal in that.  The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice was established by the Treaties that gave the Community its base.  Therefore, nothing has changed on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The other fear that has been floated with regard to morality issues relates to the implementation of a single market. <Col N="2539" /> The argument runs something along these lines &mdash; that if people have an opportunity to sell their goods and services anywhere within the Community those goods and services may spray into the morality field and cause problems for us, such as the distribution of pornography or whatever.  It was perhaps a remote possibility but it was a possibility. Therefore it was addressed by the Government in the course of these negotiations. The Single European Act provides very specifically that the grounds enumerated in Article 36 will continue to apply, that a country can rely on any one of those grounds in refusing to go along with the majority vote.  Of course those grounds include public policy and public morality.  There is no basis whatsoever for the suggestion that this has implications for our morality.  I might quote from the list of grounds specified in Article 36 of the Treaty of Rome:</P>
    <P>The provisions of Articles 30 to 34 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures, possessing artistic historic, or archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and commercial property...</P>
    <P>Each one of those safeguards, might, in some circumstances, be of importance to this country.  But, since the issue raised is that of public morality, I should say it is there in black and white, that the grounds which were available to a country by virtue of Article 36 of the Treaty of Rome, are available to a country concerned about a harmonisation directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I might revert to something to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs was referring at the end of his remarks last evening when it was said that the advice of the Attorney General, as it was offered to the House, was not accepted by this side of the House, and it has not <Col N="2540" /> been improved since.  It is important at least to say that what we are concerned about here is something very fundamental. This is not a minor matter and cannot be, since it refers directly to the amendment in the names of Deputies Gerry Collins and Sean Treacy, which refer to the protection of fundamental rights as laid down in our Constitution. Anybody who would imply that there was anything less than fundamental about that is misleading the House.</P>
      <P>Last evening the Minister sought to convey the advice that, in no way, was the European Convention on Human Rights going to be involved in the ratification of the Single European Act.  We cannot accept that because there was considerable reference to it in the Preamble to the Act.  While the Minister seemed to suggest that it would have no real bearing on the implementation of the Act, it is well worth bearing in mind that the actual words used in the Preamble are and here I quote:</P>
      <P>Determined to work together to promote democracy on the basis of the fundamental rights recognised in the constitutions and laws of the member states, in the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms...</P>
      <P>No matter how one seeks to convey a minimised version of the interpretation of that it still must be clearly understood that there is stated a determination to take on board the European Convention on Human Rights, make it part of the Community's law whether now or at some time in the future.  It is to protect our interests against its possible implications that we have put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to go further would the Minister suggest to us that there is no policy movement towards incorporation of that Convention into Community law either now or in the future?  We would have to say that the stated intention, as laid down in the Preamble, definitely declares that that determination is there, to have that Convention taken on board and made part of Community law which <Col N="2541" /> would be enforced by the European Court of Justice and which would take precedence over constitutional measures, as is laid down in our fundamental statement.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that there have not been declarations and instruments in the past that have changed the attitude of Community law in so far as fundamental rights are concerned.  Quite a number of them have been recorded.  Some I should like to place on record as being noteworthy would be the Declaration of the Nine on European Identity &mdash; Copenhagen, 1973; the Declaration at European Council in April 1978; the Commission Report on the Protection of Fundamental Rights in the European Communities, 1976 and the Joint Declaration by the European Council and Commission of April 1977.  These are declarations and instruments that have in some way infringed on fundamental rights as they would be enunciated and would apply in our situation also.  Therefore there is at this time some movement away from what we would regard to be the fundamental issues laid down in Articles 40 to 44 of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is well to take note of one of the matters that will clearly set out the fact that the Communities do have the declared intention, and have even gone further, to take on board the European Convention on Human Rights.  Here I might refer to the Bulletin of the European Communities, Supplement 2, 1979 under the heading &ldquo;The Accession of the Communities to the European Convention on Human Rights&rdquo;.  That document has been supported by the European Parliament, which has strongly advocated the accession of the European Communities to the European Convention on Human Rights.  In effect, therefore, they are binding themselves to the decisions of that Convention.  The European Communities are already bound by elements of that Convention.  I might now quote from paragraph 10 of that bulletin which puts in stark reality the position that the Convention now holds in Community law thinking.  It states and I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2542" /> Since 1974, all the Member States of the Community have been contracting parties to the ECHR, which has led to the Court of Justice of the European Communities to derive guidelines for the constitutional conditions common to the Member States from the fundamental rights embodied in the ECHR;...</P>
    <P>The important thing is that the ECHR is used as an indicator of the standards existing at Community level in the field of fundamental rights.  Further down the paragraph states:</P>
    <P>On one hand the ECHR represents a minimum standard of the general principles of law projected by the Court of Justice.  On the other, it is arguable that the Community, in so far as powers have been assigned to it by the Member States, is already bound, on the basis of the principle of substitution, by the substantive provisions of the convention on Human Rights by reason of the original obligation of the Member States.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that only one interpretation can be taken from that and that is the Community's wish to have the European Convention on Human Rights incorporated as part of Community law and <i>de facto</i> it almost says that is the position at this time.  This is confirmed again in the Preamble to the Act the Minister referred to last evening.</P>
    <P>This Act will be the first occasion when the member states will formally acknowledge the role of the European Convention on Human Rights in the Community's Treaties.  We must understand exactly what are the authority and the role of the Court of Justice.  The incorporation of the Convention into the Treaties will have very serious constitutional implications for us.  I refer further to the stated intentions of the Commission in regard to the status of the fundamental rights as set down.</P>
    <P>The same bulletin in paragraph 16 talks about the strengthening of the institutions. I quote:</P>
    <P>Finally, accession would reduce the <Col N="2543" /> risk of national courts using the absence of a written catalogue of fundamental rights formally binding upon the Community as justification for reviewing acts of the Council or the Commission by reference to their national constitutions...</P>
    <P>The straight implication there is that they do not wish national Constitutions in any way to impinge on what they would regard as the fundamental rights of the Community as laid out in Community law.  The Court of Justice, taking that on board, would then be obliged to take the right as seen by the ECHR as the basis for operation, and certainly many aspects of that convention are in direct conflict with our Constitution.  For that reason we think it is not too much to ask the Dáil here to put beyond yea or nay the fact that genuine doubt has been expressed inside and outside the House about the possibility of that convention becoming part of Community law, and of its being in conflict with our Constitution, Articles 40 to 44.  Why take the risk of leaving that loophole?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Community is putting us on notice that they would regard it as an impertinence of any member state to review any of the Community laws as accepted by them and as implemented by the Court of Justice. That is our basic reason for our attitude to this.  We can well understand that there might be advice to the contrary, but if there is the slightest risk we would say that the Minister should not allow it to persist.  There would be unanimity in here on the protection of Articles 40 to 44 of our Constitution.  We seek to protect that and we think that this wording will achieve that end.  We are not convinced that everybody in Europe is on the side of the angels.  If in some way now or in the future that Convention were to be incorporated in Community law then it would be in direct contravention of our Constitution, the Court of Justice would have no alternative but to apply it across the board, it would be an impertinence for us to become involved to do otherwise <Col N="2544" /> and consequently our rights would be infringed.  Because of the persistent and, we believe, valid doubts expressed we ask the Minister to relent on this so that he will have unanimity in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State had to say in reply to the case being made for the adoption of these amendments, and I am not impressed.  The Minister's attitude is utterly unsatisfactory and simplistic in the extreme.  It is obvious that the Government believe that the doubts which we have expressed here in respect of these fundamental issues appertaining to our Constitution are clearly justified.  They feel that the doubts being expressed are removed, say by Article 100A of the EC Treaty which allows a member state to apply national provisions on grounds of what is called major needs referred to in Article 36 of the EC Treaty.  The adequacy of the certainty of relying on this remedy is open to fundamental criticisms and is very doubtful indeed.</P>
      <P>In the first instance it should be noted that the proposed remedy could be authorised only in response to measures adopted by the Council under the new Article 100 A EC.  For example, it would not be available to negate a directive on the proposed Article 118A EC or avoid a judgment in the Court of Justice that Ireland had failed in its obligations in respect of say, Article 171.</P>
      <P>Article 36 of the EC Treaty applies primarily to the movement of goods.  It does not contain the phrase &ldquo;major needs&rdquo;.  It permits restrictions justified on grounds of public morality or public policy and on grounds of the protection of the health and life of humans.  Freedom of movement of services is provide for in Articles 59 to 66 without the restrictions available to member states under Article 36.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restrictions on movement of persons under Article 48 are more limited than those in Article 36 and do not include the reference to public morality. In that context, therefore, the new provisions for services and capital in the new <Col N="2545" /> Article 100 A include provisions on grounds of major needs referred to in Article 36.</P>
    <P>The new Articles on the internal market are stated to be without prejudice to other provisions in this Treaty.  My concern is that the proposition contained in Article 100 A would authorise the application of nationalist restrictions on the movement of persons, services and capital on grounds additional to those in the original Treaties.  That would be contrary to the thrust of this Single European Act.  While there can be no certainty in the matter it seems more probable that the major needs referred to under Article 36 would be related to the needs to control the movement of goods for reasons specified in Article 36.  This uncertain phrase could not be relied upon to authorise national provisions restricting the supply or sale of abortion services within the Community or to negate other undesirable measures of this kind.  There appears to be no basis in Community law to distinguish between abortion services and the other medical or professional services. This is a serious flaw in our legislation.</P>
    <P>Assuming that this procedure were available to restrict the supply of abortive services, the national provision would have to be deemed necessary on the ground of public morality, public policy or the protection of health of human life. If such a provision were challenged in the Court of Justice there might be a substantial difficulty in defending that provision, because the ground of public morality would imply that it was justifiable to regard abortion as immoral and offensive to the common good.  But, in a legal tradition that regards at least some abortions as a matter of women's health or privacy, the Court of Justice might not accept such grounds for restriction of Common Law.  We have no guarantee on that account.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;than to restict them, as the health of the woman would be preferred to the life of the foetus which in general in the European norm, is not regarded as a human person.</P>
      <P>These are some of the reasons why we are concerned about the failure to make clear the will of the Irish people in respect of abortion as shown by the vote on this issue a short time ago.  Our refusal to introduce abortion law could be held in the prevailing European view to be an arbitrary discrimination against women in favour of a non person in the womb. If the Commission were to take such a view it would appear that the national provision could not be applied.  In any case where the Commission or any member state consider that a member state is making inappropriate use of a national provision they may bring the matter directly before the Court of Justice. The Minister should rethink his position on this matter.  Only time will tell whether this Act will constitute a threat to our Constitution and the fundamental aspects in it.  I greatly fear that the Single European Act would open the door to legislation from the European Communities which could be repugnant to Articles 40 to 44 of our Constitution. That door was unlocked by the third amendment in 1972 and it is not an overstatement to contend that the whole constitutional system of protection of fundamental rights in our Constitution is clearly endangered by this Act.  That is why we wish the Minister to reconsider what we are asking.  There is nothing fundamentally wrong in seeking to implement the will of the vast majority of the Irish people in respect of the intrinsic worth of our Constitution and all that it contains in respect of family life and the values to which we all subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2547" /> I concur with the view expressed by Deputy Blaney and others that the issues are so grave that nothing less than a further reference to the people by way of a referendum will clarify these matters, the matter of sovereignty, the matter of neutrality and the matter of morality which are clearly involved, without proper safeguards being provided, so far as we can see.  I urge the Minister to think again on what has been said here.  Nothing will be lost, much will be gained and intrinsic values will be preserved if we accept the amendment in my name or in that of Deputy Collins, to safeguard the essentials in our Constitution.</P>

      <P>Deputies, including Deputy Haughey, looked for a referendum on the subject.  I would ask Deputies who advanced that suggestion, what question they would like to put to the Irish people?  Is it, that we should not ratify or not adopt the Single European Act?  Let us say the people decided to reject the Act, what then would we do? We would find ourselves in a position in which we would decide not to proceed with our membership of the Community. Is it the case that the question that the Deputies would like to put is that we would opt out of Europe?  I do not know what Deputy Haughey wanted to put in the referendum when he called for one yesterday and I am not clear as to what Deputy Treacy wants put to the people but in fairness to the House they should spell out precisely what question they want put to the people and also what the logical sequence of events will be after that if the people decide not to adopt the Single European Act.

      <P>I would remind the House that when Deputy O'Kennedy was Minister for Foreign Affairs he told the House in reply to a parliamentary question, as reported in the Official Report of 4 May 1978 at column 421:</P>
      <P>We are, however, a member state of the European Community and as such we have committed ourselves to a policy of European integration with the long term aim of European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the Fianna Fáil position.  Last Tuesday, Deputy Haughey said that we had gone far enough, that in fact we had gone too far on this so-called moving train and he told the House that he had misgivings about the completion of the common market.  The least that Fianna Fáil can do is to spell out precisely what status they have in mind for this country if we are to hop off the moving train.  Do Fianna Fáil propose that we withdraw <Col N="2550" /> altogether from the European Community? Clearly there are certain things about the Community that they do not like, though I noted that Mr. Haughey and any other Fianna Fáil Deputy who spoke on it approved of the transfer of funds we have had from the CAP and called for more.  I suspect that it is some form of associated membership of the Community that Fianna Fáil have in mind.</P>
    <P>The message they appear to want to put across to the people at present is that they can have the transfer of funds and they need not have anything else they find in the least bit unappealing.  If they want a referendum put to the people they should spell out what that question should be and if the people decide in the negative because of the so-called policy of neutrality or because of the fears which were voiced by Deputy Treacy, let them explain the consequences of that decision.  We are hearing from the Opposition many half-truths and much opportunistic cant which is not becoming of a party who have had considerable experience in dealing with Europe and in dealing in Europe.  I refer specifically to the commitment that Deputy O'Kennedy, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, described himself and his party as having to the idea of full European integration.</P>

I understand the point Deputy Treacy has been making on these amendments but it has nothing to do with neutrality. It is some other question he wants put to the people.  Fianna Fáil want us to have misgivings.  Mr. Haughey said we must have misgivings about completion of the internal market.  What question do Fianna Fáil want put to the people The Deputies who have called for a refernedum should state specifically the questions they want put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not giving you a short answer but what I am holding is that your dilemma on the other side of the House in producing this Bill is that you do not have the authority under our Constitution to do it.  If you want to do it, it follows therefrom that you go to the people by way of referendum to get that authority.  If you are required to do that, it would be for you to provide the wording to enable you to do what I hold you are not entitled to do under the Constitution as it stands.  You raised, as we all did, certain other aspects of the matter which I do not think should be allowed to go unchallenged.  You gave the throwaway <Col N="2552" /> reply to Deputy Treacy when he drew your attention to the Leader of the Labour Party talking loudly, clearly and succinctly on the need to consult the people on the matter of neutrality.  I take it that you are sincerely of the belief that neutrality does not arise or is not challenged as a result of the passage of this Bill</P>

      <P>As all 11 of our EC colleagues in some fashion or another are members of NATO who have nuclear missiles of all descriptions placed at every strategic point they can find in Europe and elsewhere, how can you in those circumstances give to the Community authority from this House on behalf of the people to deal with political co-operation, defence, foreign policy and security without there being the implicit outcome that neutrality will have gone out the window or, if not, its usefulness will have gone because we will be as suspect as those who lie with the dogs.

      <P>I was misled by the contribution of Deputy Molony.  I can think <Col N="2553" /> again and come back on it later.  I believe Deputy Molony is satisfied so far as I am concerned a consultation of the people is the only answer to my assertion that this matter does not have the authority of our Constitution and therefore, that a change will be needed in order to bring the Act into being.  The reason I have said that for the Deputy's information is because the Ceann Comhairle told us he could consult the records but not even last night's records are available today, never mind the records of one hour ago.  I hold that in the provisions of Articles 29.4.3º the operative words are &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities&rdquo;.  I hold that our obligations derive and relate solely and only to the Community as operated under the Treaty of Rome as and when we entered it and as it is today, and not as it will be amended tomorrow.  Therefore, what we are doing is not necessitated by our obligations of membership but rather the projected obligations which will be placed upon us in the future as a result of the Single European Act.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy Blaney make those points earlier but I disagree with them.  I accept the reply the Minister has given and I do not believe we are engaging in an unconstitutional act by adopting this Act.  I know the point Deputy Blaney is making but there are others in the House who are seeking to have questions put and I am simply asking them to state what questions they want put to the people.  I do not believe it is necessary or that we would be breaking the Constitution if we accept this Act but I would like those who are calling for a referendum, expecially those in Fianna Fáil, to spell our what questions they want put to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flynn spoke about the veto having been set aside but that is not true.  The veto is not part of the Treaty of Rome.  It was not referred to at any stage during the Inter-Governmental Conference and it is not part of the Single European Act.  It is still there. <Col N="2554" /> A country can still invoke a vital national interest if it wants to block something.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy said I am being too simplistic in my approach.  The matter is not simple but it is not all that complex either.  The Single European Act introduces majority voting in a certain number of cases to facilitiate the establishment of the internal market.  Those who have participated in European Councils as Ministers will know that for the last ten to 12 years the ability to reach decisions has become more difficult.  The larger the Community became the more difficult it became.  It facilitates the taking of decisions by majority vote but in relation to Article 36 of the Treaty which is the one which concerned Deputy Treacy. That must be by unanimous vote of the Council of Ministers.  Since that is so, it needs an Irish Minister to vote for a decision to amend or take action under Article 36.  No Irish Minister can do that within the confines of the Constitution. It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it refers to a lot more.  Deputy Flynn also referred to the Human Rights Convention.  That is referred to only in the Preamble.  Articles 31 and 32 have blocked off any possibility of the Court of Justice using the Human Rights Convention.  During his contribution Deputy Flynn referred to the Convention on Human Rights as if it was not quite savoury and something we should not have acceded to.</P>

      <P>Yes, we have found out that there are a number of elements in it which are contrary to our law and we have been taken to court under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney said we have no authority to do what we are doing.  I would remind him of what the Irish people voted for in 1972 when both he and I campaigned in favour of this.  I did not campaign just for transfer under CAP to the <Col N="2555" /> farming community even though they were very welcome.  The economic benefits we have derived from our membership of the EC have been considerable.  The people voted that we should accede to the Treaty established in Rome &ldquo;determined to lay the foundation for an ever closer union amongst the peoples of Europe, resolving to ensure the economic and social progress of their countries and by common action to eliminate the barriers which divide Europe&rdquo;. They also voted to affirm the essential objectives of constant improvement of the living and working standards of the people of Europe.  The Single European Act is very much in that spirit.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a matter about which many people will be unclear.  We owe it to them in the interests of clarity to get an answer.  I accept fully what the Minister is saying. We all accept that not everybody in a pub, factory or elsewhere will go through the articles detail by detail.  Could I have an unequivocal assurance from the Minister that nothing which confers powers under this revised arrangement bringing the Single European Act into being could in any circumstances override something which is part of our Constitution?  I have been approached, as I am sure other Deputies have been, by groups who are very concerned about family matters and who have a legitimate right to have these questions asked in this Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Abortion is specifically precluded under our Constitution but it is alleged in some documents we have received from concerned Christian family groups that under the proposed revised arrangements in Europe under part of the Single European Act, in the interests of health, an overriding decree could come from Brussels which it is feared could override our Constitutional provision against the introduction of abortion.  I am sorry that is so long winded but I am asking the question in the interests of people who are concerned with family matters about which this nation, with its Christian heritage, feels very strongly.  I should like to <Col N="2556" /> have a categorical, unequivocal, simple assurance from the Minister on that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>When approaching or changing treaties or laws which are passed in Europe the Government are very conscious of the provisions of our Constitution.  When the Single European Act was going through we kept in constant touch with the Attorney General to make sure we were keeping within the confines of our Constitution.  He has assured me that this Act is covered by the third amendment to the Constitution. Everything in the Single European Act, in so far as it relates to the European Communities, is protected by the third amendment to the Constitution.  We were in constant touch with the Attorney General during the Inter-Governmental Conference and during the debate in the Council of Ministers.</P>

What I am asking in plain language is if our Constitution is sacrosanct? Can it be overridden by a decree from Brussels?  Can it be breached in any way?</P>
      <P>I accept that the assurances given by the Minister are in good faith but those of us who deal with local authorities know that we get plenty of assurances in good faith in relation to housing, the settling of itinerants and so on.  Sometimes it takes a long time to honour these assurances and in other cases they are not honoured at all.  Is the Minister in a position to say that no provision of our Constitution, at anytime, can be overridden under the Single European Act by the European Convention on Human Rights?</P>

      <P>Deputy Prendergast asked whether it was possible that by reason of the Single European Act our Constitution could be invalidated having regard to the European Convention on Human Rights.  He seeks categorical assurances that that could not happen.  I say to him that that cannot happen for two reasons.  The first reason that it cannot happen is that there are, as I mentioned earlier, umpteen decisions of our own domestic courts, the High Courts and the Supreme Court, declaring that the European Convention on Human Rights does not form part of domestic law.  The second reason that it could not happen is that the European Convention on Human Rights is not the business of the courts established by the Treaty of Rome, the Courts of Justice that sit in Strasbourg.  So, the European Convention on Human Rights does not arise one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2558" /> Let me make one other comment at this stage of the debate.  It is simply to remind people that what we are debating is an amendment Bill.  It seems sensible in that situation to focus our considerations on what is changing.  Some of the arguments that have been advanced, fanciful as they are, were indeed advanced at the time when we applied for membership of the Community in the first place.  There was no basis for them then; our period of membership shows that, if anybody was in any doubt.  There is no basis for them now.  Let us look at what is changed by this.  A certain number of harmonisation directives that previously required unanimity now require only a majority vote.  In that some people saw a conceivable danger and so the Government responded and got the agreement of our partners to our position in requiring that where questions of morality or public policy arose unanimity would be required as heretofore.  The only change and the only issue that we are debating is that some things that were previously unanimous will now be by majority vote and not by majority vote when issues of public morality or public policy arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters have been raised by the Minister that I should like to respond to.  This amendment in the name of our spokesman and, I would have to say, in the name of Deputy Treacy, is to ensure that the provisions of our Constitution are protected and are in no way undermined or compromised by anything done here.  It is also to ensure &mdash; and I do not think that the Minister for Foreign Affairs understands this himself &mdash; that what we are doing here follows automatically and directly from our Treaty of Accession to the European Communities &mdash; no more and no less.  In the course of this debate we do not want to take on obligations in any area that extend beyond what we did and envisaged in signing the Treaty of Accession. That is reasonable and that is what the Irish people adopted by referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that there are areas here that were never contemplated, <Col N="2559" /> never referred to, never brought before the Irish people at the time of the referendum. I propose to refer to them specifically and to ask the Minister specifically, either in legal or constitutional terms, how he can suggest that these are minor changes.  If he has addressed these questions, how can he answer them?  The European Community is a community of institutions and the institutions that existed when we signed the Treaty of Accession were the Commission, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  There is a new institution now which is not referred to in the Treaty of Rome and accordingly is not incorporated at all in our Treaty of Accession. It is nowhere referred to in that.  You will find it under Article 2 of the Single European Act and it is called the European Council.  It is included now as an institution.  It was not ever part of the institutions of the European Community.</P>

      <P>Here the Minister is showing his lack of constitutional or legal awareness.  It has been meeting informally. Right now, the big boys have dominated and pulled down this Community and directed it the way they want &mdash; towards security as distinct from towards the development of the interests of the peoples of the Community &mdash; those that refuse to give the adequate money to finance the policies for the budget &mdash; the Mrs. Thatchers and so on that refused every time to provide adequate resources &mdash; and we all know that that is the biggest problem of the European Community. Deputies Blaney and Treacy were both in the European Parliament and will know that what has blocked the development of the Community that we all joined has been lack of adequate funding.  From whom and by whom?  From and by one group alone, the Heads of Governments who were never an institution in the Community but who in this legislation are being given the status and are being specifically referred to in Article 2.  They <Col N="2560" /> were not in the original Treaties but are in now.  That is not just a small or minor change.</P>

      <P>This has been tolerated and that is why our voice should be heard publicly, reminding those who should have the interests of the peoples of the Community at heart that they have done quite the opposite, even informally. Now they are being institutionalised and what they could do informally they will now, I can assure the House, do formally. They will now make us feel the small boys that we are.  There was no point in the Taoiseach yesterday trying, in his usual public relations projection of himself directed by the handlers, to make it appear that he had them all eating out of his hand at the European Council.  The whole thing was amusing.  Anybody who has been there, such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, knows that to be a total farce.  Nobody believes that.  One can imagine Kohl and Thatcher eating out of the Taoiseach's hand.</P>

      <P>That is a drastic change.  I say to Deputy Molony that it should suggest to the Government what will happen and they make no provision in the Bill.  They do not even incorporate the major change referred to in Article 2.  On political co-operation, I have, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, sat on committees on co-operation which were informal and that was the significance of it.  They sat to reach informal decisions with nothing binding in any way whatsoever.  They tried to reach a consensus and where they could not they did not.  I know this from two and a half years <Col N="2561" /> of experience there and the Minister knows it from longer experience.</P>
      <P>Now we are into a different scene. Political co-operation has advanced a stage further.  Now for the first time certain things &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; done and certain things &ldquo;will be&rdquo; done.  The Commission is now being incorporated as an institution of political co-operation, which it never was.  The Commission is meant to be the custodian of the values of the European Community.  I acknowledge that it failed many times but its role is to protect the Treaties and the Minister says that there is no major change.  It is stated in the Act:</P>
      <P>The Presidency and the Commission, each within its own sphere of competence, shall have responsibility for ensuring that such consistency is sought and maintained...</P>
      <P>It goes on to say what the responsibilities extend to, as follows:</P>
      <P>Closer co-operation on questions of European security would contribute in an essential way to the development of a European identity in external policy matters.</P>
      <P>They are ready to co-ordinate their positions more closely on the political and economic aspects of security.  The Commission are being brought in to achieve this.</P>
      <P>It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The high contracting parties are determined to maintain the technological and industrial conditions necessary for their security.</P>
      <P>We do not know what is involved in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are determined now to introduced a whole range of industrial innovation, as it is euphemistically called, for their security.  We are talking about arms procurement, about the whole basis of industry, for instance, the United States which are inevitably and fundamentally linked with an armaments programme, about industrial research innovation. These are all linked inevitably with armaments programmes and that is what is being incorporated here.  What has been <Col N="2562" /> done in American will now be done through the European Community.  It says that they shall work to that end at national level.  That is telling us in the clearest possible terms, as one of the high contracting parties signing this, that we shall work to that end at national level and, where appropriate, within the framework of the competent institutions and bodies.  There is no point in making general statements or a briefing from the Attorney General.  I know him and some of his advisers personally and I have practised law with them but I am not satisfied with a formal statement read by the Minister and a text prepared by officials.  The Attorney General, allowing for his obvious conviction, is not regarded as being widely experienced in the law as he is the most junior Attorney General ever appointed.  He came in at the level of junior counsel, he was not even an established senior counsel.</P>

It says that nothing in this title shall impede closer co-operation in the field of security between certain of the high contracting parties within the <Col N="2563" /> framework of the Western European Alliance or the Atlantic Alliance.  You could take two meanings our of that.  It could mean that it will enable NATO and the Western European Alliance to continue on their present course and it could also be argued that nothing shall impede the closer co-operation in the field of security between the people in those fora.  Whatever we do will certainly not compromise NATO.  I could go through the Act endlessly, it is disgraceful that the House is confined to a few hours debate on such an important issue.  I have sat here for a while but I did not learn anything from the Minister.  We have not heard a clear statement which is not the case in relation to other member states.

      <P>Article 8 A tells us that we shall adopt measures with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992.  Using a mix of political and legal experience, I have no doubt that when it comes to 1992 and if Ireland is still holding out against the harmonisation of laws because it does not suit us or we cannot afford it, we will be reminded that our veto has been tolerated for four years but that we had better refer to Article 8 A.  The Act is full of provisions in relation to the role of the Commission and they clearly state that Articles within the existing Treaty of Accession shall be replaced by deletions <Col N="2564" /> of the original Treaty of Rome to which we acceded when we signed our Treaty of Accession which was confirmed by a referendum.</P>
      <P>The amendments in the names of Deputy Collins and Deputy Treacy are at least a recognition that nothing done here will affect the Act.  I do not understand why the Minister will not give us a clear declaration as happened is so many member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>To pretend there is a big plot by the European Council, which has been meeting &ldquo;informally&rdquo; three times a year for the last ten or 12 years and we are now formalising those meetings, is really like Alice in Wonderland.  The Heads of State and the Heads of Government got together informally three times a year over the last ten or 12 years and made recommendations, which were in <Col N="2565" /> effect decisions, to the Council of Ministers which adopted them.  One of those was at the Milan Summit and another one was the setting up of the Dooge Committee. Up to now these Heads of State and Heads of Government met &ldquo;informally&rdquo; and the formal decision was taken at another time.  That was a charade. This is being formalised in the Single European Act.</P>
      <P>The same applies to political co-operation. Up to now the Council has been meeting four times a year; that, too, is now being formalised.  The pretended threat Deputy O'Kennedy sees in this is totally unreal as he knows well, because he was a member for two and a half years. Every decision can only be taken by consensus. Since the Single European Act was signed last February there has not been consensus on a number of major issues as Deputy Collins knows because I answered a question about it yesterday. The Twelve members of the European Community voted three different ways in the United Nations &mdash; abstaining for and against.  That is the basis of political co-operation. Deputy O'Kennedy used a spurious argument to heighten fears.  He knows we are merely formalising what has been the practice for the last ten or 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister if he would address himself to precise decisions and answer on the basis of a precise constitutional justification or a juridical interpretation of what these Articles mean.  There is no point telling me in broad waffle about threats.  I did not say they were a threat in every sense of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried because this was not an institution of the European Community initially for the very good reason that the founding fathers knew that was the forum where the big countries would dominate the small: the Heads of Government, amid the glare of publicity, meeting twice a year, would dominate the smaller countries and the Community interest would not be consistently expressed.  In their wisdom the founding fathers excluded it. The Council of Ministers meet every one <Col N="2566" /> or two weeks and has a certain permanence and cohesion.  For that reason it creates a different atmosphere.</P>
    <P>As I said, this institution was not in the original Treaties but it is being established here as an institution.  Why is the Minister not prepared to justify or explain the fact that this should at least involve a specific amendment because that particular section is not even being covered in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <P>The Irish people would be entitled to say they do not like what is happening even informally but they will worry a great deal about what will happen if it is formal.  In my view the failure of the European Community over the last eight years particularly has been due almost exclusively to the informal meeting of the Heads of Government.</P>

      <P>I am not happy about just hopes.  Like everyone else, I want guarantees that we have to implement.  I want to ask the Minister to address himself to specific points.  I want him to tell me how these are not major changes.</P>
      <P>The external policies of the European Community and the policies agreed in political co-operation must be consistent.</P>
      <P>The Presidency and the Commission, each within its own sphere of competence, shall have special responsibility for ensuring that such consistency is sought and maintained.</P>
      <P>The Commission never had a role in this area before.  It was purely a economic proposal.</P>
      <P>(a) The High Contracting Parties consider that closer co-operation on questions of European security would contribute in an essential way to the development of a European identity in external policy matters.  They are ready to co-ordinate their positions more closely on the political and economic aspects of security.</P>
      <P>(b) The High Contracting Parties are determined to maintain the technological and industrial conditions necessary for their security...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is not linking the technological and industrial conditions to security needs I do not know what is.  They will say it is necessary for security.  These arguments have been made for some time.  One of the things we have to look for is a <Col N="2568" /> common base on arms procurement. Anyone who ignores that is ignoring what has been happening in Europe for the last number of years.</P>
    <P>I am saying that that is incorporating new elements which were not in the 1972 Treaty of Accession.  These are not just minor changes in the Treaty, they are major developments.  If the Government were to come in here and admit they were major developments and that they wanted to argue the rights and wrongs of them, at least we could have an honest open argument but when I am told in this House by the Minister and his Minister of State that these are only minor adjustments, that is an offence to the House. I have no doubt that Deputy Collins, Deputy Treacy and other Deputies will probably want better guarantees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins's amendment says that nothing in this Act shall operate so as to limit or qualify the fundamental rights of the citizens and guarantee them protection by Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution. These are fundamental rights which cannot be undermined by external action.  That does not seem to be unreasonable.  We should debate this for another month, and not just for the sake of debating it.  People will look back on this Dáil in a number of years time and they will say, they were a petty, puny lot because they spent four or five hours debating something so fundamental that they did not seem to be aware of their own sovereign rights and obligations.  In order that that does not happen we should do something about it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The country is in its present position because we joined the EC.  So many of our traditional industries have gone by the board as a result of our entry to the EC.  Our entry to the EC contributed in a very large and substantial measure to unemployment.  Is there any going back now?  Are we in a position now to say to the other 11 countries in the EC, whatever our wishes on the matter might be as far as the Single European Act is concerned, that they have decided to go in one direction and we will now veer off and do what we could or should have done in 1972?  This is not 1972; it is 1986 and the position is very different. <Col N="2570" /> Our food policy and our agricultural position would have been very different if we had stayed outside the EC in 1972.  The economic development has proceeded along certain lines and that cannot be denied.  There can be no going back.  The industries that have gone cannot be recalled. We have to face up to the position we are in now.  Can we go sideways or backwards on this?  I think not.</P>
      <P>We have to face up to the fact that the establishment of the internal market in 1992 is very serious.  I am very fearful of what it may involve for us in terms of our economy.  What is the point in the Minister referring to the declaration in Article 8 A?  He said that the provision for setting the date of 31 December 1992 does not create an automatic legal effect. What is the point in introducing that?  It means that there is no automatic provision that, <i>ipso facto</i>, on 31 December 1992 the internal market will come into operation by its own accord.  This declaration says it does not mean that.  That does not help.  Of course it does not operate <i>ipso facto</i>.  It has to be done.  As Deputy O'Kennedy stated, and it is a fair point, we are nonetheless obligated to bring it in by 31 December 1992, be it automatic or not.  If we fail to do that we are in trouble in an EC context.  In 1992, the internal market, whether it is automatic, a compulsion of the EC court or whatever compulsory procedures are laid down in the context of the Treaty, will come into operation.  I do not see the point in introducing that unless the Minister is saying that there is some method under which we can defer the internal market coming into operation either indefinitely or for a further length of time. If that was the position, that would be different and I would accept it.  But that is not the case.  We should face up to the fact that the internal market will come into operation in 1992.  I have considerable fears as to what the effects of it will be on our economy, our employment, our financial position and the general development of the country.</P>

      <P>The contribution made by Deputy Taylor has more to do <Col N="2571" /> with his own internal market ambitions than with the internal market of the European Community.  I do not think anybody can argue that being outside the biggest economic bloc in the world could be better for a small trading nation like Ireland than being inside that bloc.  That is absolute nonsense.  I do not think even Deputy Taylor believes that.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendments Nos. 1 and 3 of section 1, I cannot understand why Deputies are concerned only with articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution.  Does that not indicate, if we were to agree to such an amendment, that the rest of the Constitution &mdash; Articles 1 to 40 and Articles 44 on &mdash; would be of no consequence, that somehow they could be overridden or that this House would approve of their being interfered with?  There are other Articles in the Constitution which are equally as important.  You cannot take one section of the Constitution and say it is more important than another section.  We must be clear in what we are doing.  We are passing legislation.  This House has no right to pass any legislation which amends the Constitution.  Therefore, we have no right or duty to pass any section or legislation which would uphold only certain parts of the Constitution.  The Constitution stands on its own.  It does not require the approval of this House or any comment from this House.  It belongs to the people and not to the Parliament. It can be amended only by way of referendum after a Bill is passed through this House.</P>

      <P>To take Deputy O'Kennedy's point, there is a strong indication that the intention in the amendment is to have this law in keeping with Articles 40 to 44 and not with the other Articles.  That is a lot of nonsense.  The House does not have the right to abrogate any Article of the Constitution; that function belongs to the people.  But, the House has the right, if we are foolish <Col N="2572" /> enough, to dilute the powers of the House which are not subject to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I note that the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Bill refers to changes in the Treaty, including the incorporation of new procedures designed to enhance the role of the European Parliament in the Community's decision-making process.  I would like to get an assurance from the Minister &mdash; leaving aside the Constitution which as far as I am concerned is sacrosanct and cannot be interfered with by the House &mdash; that the powers of the House not affected by the Constitution will not be diluted by the Bill <i>vis-á-vis</i> the powers of the European Parliament.  If we are serious about the European Parliament we will have to give that institution powers at some stage but I do not believe that the way to do it is to insert a small section in the Bill.  Will the Minister agree that the section does not interfere with the sovereignty of the House or the powers which by tradition have become its rights?</P>

      <P>The Minister of State some time ago told the House that instances where majority decisions would operate were being widened and that the veto would remain.  That would lead one to believe that if more matters are decided on a majority decision procedure the veto will not be used as frequently. The Taoiseach told us last night that the Single European Act was required because of the abuse of the veto and that what we were proposing to do in the Single European Act is to make obligatory what heretofore was done voluntarily by agreement.  What in hell do we want it for at all bearing in mind what the Taoiseach said last night?  Is that as porous as some other statements by the Taoiseach in the House and outside?  If we need to make obligatory what we have been doing voluntarily why is the time of the House being wasted?  Why has the time of the Heads of State been wasted? What is the reason for the Summit Conferences, Fontainebleau, Milan, Stuttgart and other cities?  Why were they <Col N="2573" /> jazzing about sorting out the operation in Europe?</P>
      <P>What is dangerous underlying that, something the Taoiseach did not refer to, is that because we agreed to certain matters before it does not follow that agreement was reached without the members of the Community getting their say in and shaping policies in a way acceptable to them.  That is what consensus was about and that is why the veto was seldom used by us though abused by others.</P>
      <P>Certainly, we could not be accused of having abused the veto, being the craven lot we are, suffering from a weighty inferiority complex as part of our national heritage.  We have conformed; we are the conventionalists and the good Europeans. The Government, and previous Governments, in their approach to European matters dealt with them by screaming at home to get the headlines but conceding in Europe if the weight was heavy enough.  We did not use the veto but while it exists we still have the possibility that our complex might lessen, that our feeling of inferiority will diminish and that somewhere some time some of the young Members in the House will stand up and assert themselves on behalf of our people, something we have not been doing.  We have suffered losses since we joined the Community because we did not stand up.  That is an irrefutable fact, to our great detriment.  Let us think of what will happen in the future after we hand over the decision-making process in regard to everything concerning the country, our economic progress and so on.  It will be decided by a Commission dominated by the major countries in Europe.  The people who pay the piper are now calling the tune and we are rushing in, like before, to say, &ldquo;yes, we will put this through before 1 January&rdquo;.  How many other countries have passed similar legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not passed similar legislation.  If we do not pass the Bill we will be showing that we have grown out of our inferiority complex.  The Taoiseach last night said that any Member who disagreed with what the Government are doing will be displaying the historical traditional inferiority complex of our race.  I take the opposite view. It may be stupid but my view is that those who stand against the head will not be displaying inferiority but rather confidence and strength in themselves.  We need that confidence like we never needed it before.  We should tell other member states that this is not on, that we cannot agree to it.  We should tell them that if they need this badly they should redress certain things.  The Government should have done that before they asked the Parliament to give them a right that is ours now but will never be again.  There is much that has to be redressed, so much that has to be cleaned up, things that are vital to us, including our economic wellbeing in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be disastrous if we allow this thing to go through without correcting the things that have been going wrong for a long time, due to our inferiority complex.  We entered the Community freely and by a vast majority, excluding the Labour Party whose speakers hope to adjust now.  All of us in all the parties, some of us more than others, have our drones and bees, and you would never know whether it was the drones or the bees, which is which, and which is the worst: there were those who worked for it and those who did not, those who gave just lip service to it, but the referendum was carried on the clear understanding that whatever the final doubts might be, and there were many for those of us who were going for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote at the time, there would be benefits for us.  I remember a balance sheet for and against entry and it was as close as this: if the UK went in could we stay out?  If we stayed out and they went in could we stay out, survive and progress in the future?  The question was could we survive if we did not join this great new Community, this big new market that promised us so much <Col N="2575" /> then but has failed to deliver since.  My doubts were allayed by the belief that if it came to the crunch, and forgetting about our national inferiority complex, we could use the veto, and by becoming bloody nuisances we could get our just dues.  What we got was a dismantling of every industry that had been built up during the years under protective tariffs. As Deputy Taylor has said, they have been wiped out.  That is the price we have paid, but we have not been paid a price even through the CAP and all that goes with it.</P>
    <P>When we went into the Community there was no doubt that we were going into a huge market which was undersupplied in dairy produce and beef. Today they are talking about butter mountains and milk lakes.  When we went in they did not have enough.  Unfortunately, we did not supply it all since. We made little contribution to the overall surpluses that have since developed.  But the wise boys in the better off countries have taken advantage of the CAP that is weighing down the Community.  It is being used by those countries: in the Parliament and through the Commission, and through their national parliaments they have been crying that in the Community we can no longer suffer the cost of the CAP.</P>
    <P>We are all little farmers in Ireland. One of the mistakes our people in Europe make is to think of our farmers being big if they had 100 acres and 100 cows.  All our farmers are small in the European context.  We have allowed ourselves to be ripped off.  We have compromised into milk quotas and we are being threatened with beef quotas and cereal quotas.  At the same time, all of this is pouring in from North America at zero rate tax for the benefit of the multinationals who have set up herds of milch cows, as many as 3,000 in each herd, without owning an acre of land.</P>
    <P>That is what we have allowed ourselves to get into.  We have been big in Europe, we have been reasonable, we have agreed.  I am not from milk country but I voted against on every occasion when <Col N="2576" /> there was talk of milk quotas.  I fought for what might have been better if we had got them, tiered prices, in order to preserve the small farmers of Europe, to give them all a fair way of living and not to give it to the big, the rich, the better off farmers and ranchers who have been given a licence to continue to rip us off. All this has happened despite Article 29 of the Treaty of Rome which gave agriculture a special place.</P>
    <P>How has this been handled by us?  Our inferiority complex has dragged us down to a point when we may well become worse off in the near future than we were before we went into the Community.  In the meantime, as Deputy Taylor said, many of our industries are gone.  Only ten years after we joined, 70 per cent of what has been our industrial workforce in 1973 had gone from those industries. We were paying the price and yet we were being apologetic for existing in Europe.  We do not owe them anything and we are not satisfied with the platitudes in the Preamble and the explanations we have been given about the Regional Fund and its benefits to us in the future and about the social fund being of such advantage to us.  We do not want dole from Europe.  We want a fair deal and we want the dole mitigated and got rid of.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste last night appeared to be a very naive man &mdash; I did not think he was.  He made a statement which is not just untrue but misleading to a strange degree.  He said:</P>
    <P>In our approach to the Single European Act negotiations the Government were very conscious, however, that despite the Community's efforts the gap between the more prosperous central regions and the periphery had not narrowed appreciably since 1973.</P>
    <P>He must have been in cloud cuckooland. The fact is that it has disimproved vastly since 1973.  Relatively speaking, we are far worse off today <i>vis-á-vis</i> Germany than we were in 1973, yet there goes the poor man who leads the Labour badly, the Tánaiste, second in command to the Taoiseach, saying that &ldquo;the gap between <Col N="2577" /> the more prosperous central regions and the periphery had not narrowed appreciably since 1973.&rdquo;  It must have been the Taoiseach who told him that one.</P>

      <P>What is happening here is that we are giving the authority to what will become the twelve wise men to rehash the Treaty of Rome, to add to it or take from it.  Yet under the Constitution we do not have the competence or authority of the people to give that right to anybody.  It should be remembered that they did not give it to us in 1972.  To those who would make the point, that we have made various changes since, I would say that any changes effected since were done under the existing code which meant that one got agreement and unanimity or one did not effect the change.  That meant that we had a voice equal to the voice of any other in the implementation of any such changes. Henceforth we will not have such a voice. That is what I object to.  That is what I believe to be totally dangerous and which should not be considered until we have sorted out the problems obtaining within the Community at present.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blaney made two major points, one regarding the effect on industries here of our joining the Community, referring to the number that have gone to the wall.  I put it to Deputy Blaney that, irrespective of our membership of the EC, those industries would have choked themselves because many of them were archaic, old fashioned, badly-managed and were coming to the end of their life-cycle one way or the other.</P>

      <P>No, I can assure Deputy Blaney that we are not coming to the end of our tether, nor are we archaic.  Mind you the Deputy described himself as being archaic in as much as he said he did not represent the people any longer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney spoke also about the disparity between the richer and poorer areas of the Community and maintained that that gap was widening.  I might draw the Deputy's attention to the Single European Act where, under the heading of &ldquo;Economic and Social Cohesion&rdquo;, there is a commitment to narrow that gap.  If the Deputy is interested in narrowing that gap, then he should support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2581" /> I might turn now to Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution.  He said here that he had little or no respect for our Attorney General.  It appears to me that on that side of the House our Judiciary have been insulted both this morning and afternoon. If Deputy O'Kennedy gives credit to experience within the judicial system then I might draw his attention to Pierre Pescatore, who, as the Deputy will know, is a former Justice of the European Court and a protagonist of the Single European Act, an eminent diplomat.  He has said that the Single European Act &mdash; unlike what Deputy O'Kennedy said &mdash; constitutes a moderate and insignificant change from the Treaty of Rome.  If Deputy O'Kennedy does respect silk and the judicial system generally, he should appreciate that remark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, I could.  Deputy O'Kennedy said also that this debate was too little, too late.  An opportunity for debate was available to Deputy O'Kennedy's colleague Deputy Gerry Collins, who, as chairman of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC, could have demanded a report at any time which would have afforded an opportunity to have had this debate held much earlier.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this debate has been the implied insult to the contribution of the Government in bringing forward the Single European Act.  It should be remembered that the cohesion aspect was subject to the beck and call of this Government, which has been totally under estimated and ignored by the Opposition.  Perhaps Deputy Collins might reply to the fact that there was inadequate debate on the matter when he had opportunity to bring the matter forward for such discussion.</P>

If this Act were never to be put into effect the situation would be as we enacted it in 1972 and the same would apply to social issues about which Deputy Treacy expressed fears.  I share his views and as far as I am aware every Member of this House shares these views but I do not share the concern that we are not being properly protected under this Act in this regard.  I await further elucidation and further explanation on that single issue and I ask the Minister to clarify it.</P>
      <P>There are other important issues that we would like to enter upon in connection with this Act and perhaps we could expand on them and explain them in the time allowed to us rather than going into minute matters that are totally irrelevant. All right, I accept Deputy Blaney's position. He was precluded from speaking last night on Second Stage.  We were all equally precluded from making a speech on Second Stage as we would have liked to do.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I remember well at the time of our entry, studying, going to Brussels and having <Col N="2584" /> discussions as a result of which, like other people I wondered at the wisdom or otherwise of our entry into the Community. On balance I thought it a wise thing and in retrospect I can see that it was a wise decision.  I disagree with my colleague, Deputy Taylor, who, wilfully or otherwise, is confusing Fianna Fáil's present concern to protect the terms under which we entered with an effort by the Government of whom he is a part to have them changed.  I know that at the time he and members of his party had misgivings about the terms under which we entered and now that it is obvious to everybody here that some of those are being put at risk surely he cannot honestly uphold his views here and vote for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to put a question mark behind the sincerity of the Deputy.  He is arguing on the misgivings which we had prior to our entry.  Even if they have been warranted, when the position has worsened he is going to vote for this.  That is an illogicality the like of which I have not heard of here previously.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to any of us who studied the terms under which we entered that we have other propositions now which I would describe as growths which occurred within the Community and which now, we are told, have a <i>de facto</i> position.  We are being asked to give them a <i>de jure</i> position.  I do not think we should do that because it has not been demonstrated to us that the growths that occurred were in accordance with the spirit of the terms under which we entered.  Those in capsule, are the fears I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, like any other Irishman, if I felt that what is now being proposed was going to add to, safeguard and develop <Col N="2585" /> our interests in the Community, I would be as enthusiastic now as I was then but some of us feared at the time that the stronger powers with time would lose some of their idealism and would use us for their own good purposes.  I say that we are reaching that point now.  I have no doubt that in respect of security and other matters our position is now being impugned.  That is why I have the fears I have.</P>
    <P>I turn to the interventions of my colleagues, Deputy Taylor and Deputy Prendergast.  If they thought it was such an unwelcome development so many years ago and if time has proven to them that they were right, surely they are given an opportunity now at least to salvage some little thing from what has occurred.</P>

      <P>Whenever I hear anybody speaking about concern for my or the Labour Party's welfare I am reminded of Oliver Wendell Holmes when he said of somebody &ldquo;the more he spoke of his honour the faster I counted the spoons&rdquo;.  It is interesting to reflect that whenever the Labour Party are referred to by the Opposition we hear the term &ldquo;the once proud Labour Party&rdquo;. I do not know when we ceased being proud.  We have plenty to be proud of. &ldquo;Is ar mhaithe leis féin a dhéanann an cat crónáin&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As somebody who was not given the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate let me say that an artificial kind of syllogism is being introduced into this debate by some of the Fianna Fáil people, not deliberately, but they are mistaking the situation.  For the record let me say that I am a very dedicated European and I am talking about from the Urals to McGillicuddy Reeks, from the Volga to the Shannon.  An articial campaign is being mounted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I got eight telephone calls one night, one of them at 11.40 p.m. from an elderly woman doctor who was at pains to impress upon me that I should not support this.  From the way she spoke it was evident that she was anxious to go back to somebody who had been orchestrating these phone calls to indicate that at least she had spoken to me about this.  That was an artificial campaign.</P>

      <P>To come back to some of the points made by Fianna Fáil, I argued then that we had no real choice. When people talk, as Deputy Blaney talks, about the idyllic situation prior to our joining the Common Market, they conveniently forget that we were then part of the general agreement on trades and tariffs and that already under that arrangement we were beginning to lose our traditional industries under the force of competition.  In my city we lost industries, clothing industries that were there for two centuries, and we lost the great food processing industry.  This happened throughout Ireland and it was already in progress before we entered the Common Market.  It was an inevitable process largely because of the failure of our home industrialists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The failure of our industries at that time brings us up to our position within the Common Market.  A lot of what we are hearing this evening is a regurgitation of the arguments that were made then but they should not be stifled for that reason.  Some of the arguments being made in opposition are useful and it is to our benefit that they should be made now.  As a nation we can be criticised for being like boy scouts in our approach to Europe.  We should be willing but critical members of that Community. I do not know anybody here who is against the concept of a unified Europe. We all have reservations.  I want to ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are here as elected representatives to ask these questions. I take issue with Deputy Mitchell, one of the speakers here, who seemed to criticise the questions being asked relating to specific clarification by the Minister. We may know the answers but we want the official answers put on the record for the benefit of the people.  I am speaking in particular about workers.  We have been torpedoed at times by artificial arguments.  There are two main concerns as to our ratifying the Single European Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one being the neutrality issue which can be overstated. It is supremely important and I am not undermining that.  History will take care of that.  Reykjavik is already talking about that and we will go beyond that. <Col N="2588" /> The real crunch for the Irish people is the economic argument.  I am concerned, coming from the mid west region, where there are very many foreign industries giving worthwhile employment whether, if there is a harmonisation of corporation tax laws and that sort of thing, there will then be an inducement for foreign industries presently established here to move into mainland Europe?  I predicted this ten years ago, and I can see it all around me since.  There has been industrial devastation.  The point I want to make is this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The great statement that has been made to us all the time when we asked constructive and critical questions has been that we are net beneficiaries since our entry.  That may be so in a macro-economic sense but the subventions from Europe went, largely to the farming community.  But, as Deputy Blaney pointed out, Europe is at present under siege.  They are at it in England this very evening, trying to dismantle or reduce the CAP.  The agricultural base here is dwindling and we could finish up in the worst&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to ask questions. The way the trend is moving this very evening in London, under the presidency of Britain is towards reducing the CAP and effectively reducing further our <Col N="2589" /> main industry which is agriculture.  If that continues our agricultural base will be hopelessly diminished in a few years.  At the same time we are not doing enough to protect our industries.  We got £120 million this years for education and training&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already asked the Minister if as a result of the harmonisation of tax laws, and that kind of thing in Europe, our foreign industries will have an incentive to pull out of Ireland, a move which would devastate us.  We are bad enough at the moment without that.  That is my main concern.</P>
      <P>Why we should support this is a good argumentative point.  I see no logical alternative to supporting our position in Europe.  Nobody really, believes that we should pull out of Europe, although that is not being said, but I agree with the Opposition speakers.  The truth is the truth, no matter who says it.  We should be far more critical and we should fight our corner more.  The Greeks got away with it.  The French farmers can blockade the streets of Paris anytime it suits them, and so on.  There are hidden subventions throughout Europe at the present time. Countries will tell us that under existing EC legislation we cannot give grants to subsidise industry but at the same time they are building railway lines right into the huge factories.  They are giving hidden subventions and hidden subsidies to industry on the European mainland, to devastate us.  We know that for instance, the whole of the citrus fruit industry on the Mediterranean is controlled by the Mafia.  We know that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Can we put a case to the EC Commission that some specific economic protection arrangement would be devised to protect the north west frontier of the Common Market, namely, Britain, Scotland, Wales and ourselves, such as was done for the Mediterranean countries?  I had the good fortune in conjunction with the Tánaiste, the Chairman of the Labour Party, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to meet our counterparts in the British Labour Party here last week.  We discussed at length the developments in Northern Ireland and we got various satisfactory assurances but &mdash; I am finishing on this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle they agreed with us that Britain and Ireland together should make a very strong case for some extra consideration for the north west frontiers of Western Europe.  If we do not do that we will be dragged into the centre.  It is the law of economics.  We know that so far the EC is hopelessly short on what it has done for the peripheral regions.  They can write all the books or treaties they like, but there is an inexorable order of economics that is destroying the peripheral regions.  They are giving us back dole money and training but what we want is employment.  I <Col N="2591" /> am saying that in a constructive way.  I am not against the idea of going in, but we should fight more and not go in in a boy scout way.  I am not accusing the Minister alone.  As a nation, when Fianna Fáil were in power, the same criticism applied.  We have been artificially diverted by the reference to neutrality.  I am not underestimating the huge importance of neutrality but our partners in Europe should be made aware that while every single political party in this country are willing to play their part in Europe, they are deeply worried about the adverse economic portents.  We should thus make infinitely much greater headway for the benefit of all our people.  Now I would like an answer to my question.</P>

During the course of my speech on Second Stage, I was at great pains to rebut allegations which were made yesterday and the day before and which were made again this evening by Deputy Dowling, Deputy Coogan and Deputy Molony, that those who criticise are not necessarily voting against the principle.</P>

In particular, I am delighted that Deputy Prendergast has said that, because last night the Deputy's own leader, our other good friend from the south-west, Deputy Spring, said that this increased provision for majority voting has been singled out for criticism by those who wish to reject the Single European Act.

      <P>Just try to hold yourself. The situation quite clearly is that whereas I welcome your concern about many facets which are going to be changed by what is involved in the Single European Act, I say to you that there is only one way now that you can make sure that what you are concerned about can be safeguarded.  As I said to you much earlier on this evening, you do not have to depend on just the word of the Minister of State who answered your particular question or the Minister or any individual, I do not care who he is, or any Government.  You do not have to depend on that word as you know can be interpreted in any way they like during the course of a debate thereafter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Prendergast can come back to me a little bit extra in my argument and I know he is mightly influenced by it.  He has to be because the logic he expounded makes the argument for me.  He can support our amendment and it will not in any way &mdash; I am sorry that Deputy Dowling has gone from the House &mdash; interfere with us ratifying the Single European Act.  It does not interfere with it.  It will not cause the Deputy any concern nor, had he been in this House to listen to the arguments over the last two days, would he have voted against our amendments last night.</P>

      <Col N="2594" /> The amendment in my name and that in the name of Deputy Treacy will not in any way interfere with what the Government's intentions are with regard to the Single European Act but it will, if effected, protect the type of case which we have made and which he is sincerely concerned about.  I thank him for supporting us and I invite him to come back one more step.  I am sure that when I get the opportunity in County Limerick to explain his position to those he will depend on to ensure his return to this House &mdash; I hope he does &mdash; I am sure they will understand him and be gracious to him with their support.</P>

      <P>I fail to see the purpose for which Deputy Collins's amendment is put down.  It does not seem to have much realism because the amendment says that nothing in the Act shall operate so as to limit or qualify the fundamental rights of the citizen as guaranteed and protected by Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution.  Let me put it this way.  I ask this as a rhetorical question.  If there was something in this Act which was contrary to the Constitution it would be unconstitutional and, therefore, invalid. Quite frankly, I do not see that the amendment has anything to recommend it other than perhaps as a debating point. Nothing could be put in this Act that would be contrary to the Constitution or inconsistent with the Constitution and retain its validity.  It would <i>ipso facto</i> be void.  Therefore, the amendment is, quite frankly, a meaningless one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2595" /> Deputy Tunney put it to me that here is a situation where I and my party opposed our entry into the EC in 1972 and consequently he thought it would be logical that I would oppose the Single European Act in 1986.  It is a strange proposition to put to me.  It rather suggests that the country like the Fianna Fáil Party has fossilised between 1972 and 1986.  I am sorry he has left the House because I would like to point out to him that things are very different in the country in 1986 than they were in 1972.</P>
    <P>In 1972, my party took the view, having considered it very carefully, that the country as a separate entity outside the EC would have been a viable entity and could have got by economically by means of a Treaty of Association with the EC, which you will remember was the other aspect which was seriously considered at that time.  Many other countries adopted that proposition and seemed to have got by not all that badly.  The country in the referendum took a different view.  The party accepted that decision and went along with it.  There was nothing else we could do about it.  I do not think that overall out participation in the EC has done very much for us.</P>
    <P>We knew of course and it was conceded then that many of our industries would be put at serious risk and would go under on account of our entry and the competition within Europe we would not be able to cope with.  We were told that on the other side of the coin the agricultural end would compensate for that; so great would be the influx on the agricultural side that it would more than balance out the loss of industries and the increase in food prices etc.  As I recall it, things for the first couple of years were happy enough in the agricultural sector in the EC but that gloss was not long fading away.  In the meantime industries were lost and they cannot be recalled.  I am concerned about the prospect of an internal market.  I am disappointed that the documentation did not deal in more detail with the economic aspect and what the implications of it will be in 1992 which <Col N="2596" /> will come upon us all too quickly.  It is not that far away.  The explanatory guide was produced to explain the political implications, the voting and so on.  I am disappointed it did not give a forecast or prognosis on how the country will be in 1992.  There is only one sentence that deals with that.  On page 35 it states:</P>
    <P>The improved trading conditions within the Community which will result from the Single Act should be of considerable potential benefit to our exporters.</P>
    <P>I presume &ldquo;trading conditions&rdquo; means the internal market.  Note the words &ldquo;should be&rdquo;, words that do not denote a tremendous degree of confidence.  It does not state &ldquo;will be&rdquo; or &ldquo;probably will be&rdquo; but &ldquo;should be&rdquo;.  It puts the matter in some doubt.  What will it mean for employment?  In any event, it only deals with one side of the coin.</P>
    <P>If the internal market will open up some markets for our exporters it must also open up our market here for their exporters and that has not been dealt with or analysed.  I do not see any forecast made or estimate given of what that will give rise to on balance.  How many jobs will be gained or lost?  What are the implications for the agricultural sector?  One would be happier if the Departments involved had given a forecast on how they see it developing.  I am genuinely fearful of the outcome.</P>
    <P>We faced a serious position in our development between 1972 and 1986. How will it be from 1992 onwards?  What will we be faced with then?  Many of our industries are foreign owned.  Have any calculations been done on what their operations are likely to be in 1992 with the development of the internal market? Will there be compelling reasons for them to retain their industries here or will there be compelling reasons which will induce them to move elsewhere?  Many of our industries and firms are threatened every day.  We have seen a new development under the old system in relation to record companies.  A new emporium which is foreign owned has set up here.  It will deal a serious blow to many small companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2597" /> Has the concept of an internal market been thought through?  Where are the facts and the figures?  Is all that is to be written on it simply &ldquo;improved trading conditions should be of considerable benefit to our exporters&rdquo;?  I am very concerned about this.  There must have been some studies done on this.  Has the Minister any information on such studies?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the amendments before the House have been dealt with at some length and in great depth, a much better procedure than the Second Stage of the Bill which has been passed.  Many of us wanted to make a long contribution but failed to get in on the debate.  Democracy is not served by denying so many Members of the House the right to speak on great national matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>As regards my colleague Deputy Prendergast and others who wish to seek assurances that nothing contained in the Act will interfere with the rights and provisions contained in our Constitution, naturally they look to the Minister for an assurance on these lines.  I respect the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He is a man of high integrity and great ability.  I have admired him tremendously in respect of the part he has played in upholding Ireland's interests throughout the world in recent years and likewise the Minister of State who joined him in the Department in recent times.  However, I am too long in the House to rely on the word of any Minister in respect of assurances of the kind demanded by Members on this issue.  Ministers may give assurances and make promises but unless we lay down in law the regulations in respect of matters of this kind then they may be controverted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers will come and go.  Governments will come and go.  The indications are that this Government may be on the way out and go sooner rather than later. I say to my colleagues who are looking for assurances to copperfasten what is contained in the Constitution in relation to family law, marriage, divorce, abortion and the safeguarding of the rights of the unborn, there is no more effective <Col N="2598" /> way of ensuring that a coach-and-four is not driven through these sections of the Constitution than by adopting the amendments before us.  That is the sure and certain way that the Irish people will know that these Articles in our Constitution are copperfastened and may not be interfered with, compromised or deviated from by any law, any regulation emanating from Europe in the years to come.  By the adoption of this Single European Act, every Member of this House will accept that we are all more vulnerable as a result, vulnerable in respect of sovereignty, in respects of neutrality, in all these matters.</P>
    <P>Comments have been made as to consistency in respect of whether we are for or against the Common Market.  I opposed vigorously Ireland's entry into the Common Market as a then member of the Labour Party.  I foretold that it would have the most serious repercussions on our people, that it would destroy our industry, that industrial graveyards would result and hundreds of thousands of Irish men and women would lie dead on the economic battlefield.  That has happened.  Our agricultural sector is now being seriously undermined.  There are people in this House and in this country who are genuinely concerned as to the benefits accruing to us in Europe now and in the future.  The facts are that in respect of our entry into the Common Market we in this country took a terrible beating.  As a result of our years of membership, we have seen a mountain of butter, a milk lake, a vast mountain of beef and, worst of all, we have seen a vast mountain of human beings, a vast mountain of unemployment, hardly ever known before in Europe and the highest incidence and percentage of that unemployment is the Irish figure.  We have very little to be proud of in respect of what has happened here and we have a hell of a lot &mdash; I agree with Deputy Blaney &mdash; to be ashamed of.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to deviate but in respect of the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; I have been frankly appalled by the denigration of the principle of neutrality which I have heard <Col N="2599" /> from the other side of the House.  I wondered last night, having heard the vitriol which was happened upon the whole principle of neutrality, its worthlessness now, in the past and in the future, how men who believe like that could traipse through the lobby last night and allege to maintain it.</P>

      <P>No regard was had to the fact that neutrality saved our people from death and destruction in the last Great War and to the role we had to play for world peace at large.  This was being said and was happening, ironically so to speak, at a time when one of our soldiers was being buried, who had been tragically killed in the Lebanon.  At this time I was listening to the worst type of denigratory remarks being heaped on the whole principle of neutrality and on those of us who sought to support and maintain it in this House.  That is why I came to the very strong conclusion that the honourable thing to do would be to put these issues to the people.  I admire the Tánaiste, and hope he will pursue the matter he mentioned here last night in respect of the neutrality issue, that it should be referred to the people by way of referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister for Foreign Affairs comes to reply, he will honestly admit that it is not within his competence to give categorical assurances that our Constitution will remain sacrosanct and that these aspects of our Constitution, especially in respect of family law with which we are concerned, will not be eroded or attacked in the years to come.  I contend that the matter is of such importance that the sincere and effective manner in which to deal with this issue is to adopt the amendments <Col N="2600" /> here before us tonight.  That will allay any anxiety or doubt in respect of this matter now and in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>In a sense, a Committee Stage debate is an occasion for question and answer.  That is what it should be.  In particular this debate should be an occasion for question and answer.  Because of the short timescale, people understandably have felt obliged to say today what they were not in a position to say yesterday.  I want to ask one precise question and I am sure the Minister, who has negotiated this matter on our behalf, will give me an answer.  If not, that raises some issues which I shall want to pursue.</P>
      <P>Regarding section 1, would the Minister indicate why it is that only limited sections of the Final Act we are adopting are referred to as being incorporated into our domestic law by way of amendment to the original European Communities Act?  It mentions the following provisions of the Single European Act: Article 3 (1), Title II, Article 31 and 32 and, so far as they relate to the said Article 3 and the said Title II and the said Articles 31 and 32, Articles 33 and 34.</P>
      <P>Clearly there is one major omission and there are many others.  The one major omission from what is being incorporated into the European Communities Act of 1972 is Title III, which deals almost exclusively with political co-operation. Perhaps the Minister could indicate at this point why that is not being referred to in the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has answered my question and I think has <Col N="2601" /> exposed the anxiety we have.  The original Treaty of Rome, the original Treaty of Accession, has no reference whatever to political co-operation.  It is not part of the legal international obligations we have, not part of what we adhered to, or what the Irish people ratified by referendum. Because it is not in the original Treaty of Accession, the occasion to add to the Treaty of Accession does not arise. It is not part of the competence of the original Treaty, as the Minister has acknowledged now.  We are moving into an area in this political co-operation in Title III that was not envisaged, is not embraced, is not covered in the original Treaty of Accession to the European Community and is not covered in the original Treaty of Rome.  All that we have been discussing in this House and worrying about, both inside and outside this House, namely the areas of political co-operation which impinge particularly on security are now acknowledged belatedly by the Minister to be a separate issue.  He may not recognise the extent of what he is acknowledging, that it is a major addition to the Treaty of Accession, the referendum or the Treaty of Rome.  So much for the statement of the Minister of State that these are minor additions to the development of the European Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a extraordinary admission, that we are prepared to ratify, at international level, something which involves security obligations and which incorporates a new role to the European Community.  The public were not asked to consider this in the Treaty of Accession.  We know what we signed in the Treaty of Accession.  It basically dealt with economic matters with the <Col N="2602" /> option of moving towards political matters. The people ratified it on that basis and that is why we joined the Community. However, a new element is being introduced to the Community.  The Act and its titles, especially Title III relates to formal procedures for political co-operation and certain references to security, but we are not being allowed to debated it even though it was not in the original Act.  It is an extraordinary omission by the Government.</P>
      <P>Was the Minister, when engaging in these negotiations, aware of the fact that what he was proposing to do in adopting this Act was to ratify it on our behalf.  He did not consider consulting the people as happened in relation to the original Act. He said he would ratify a new provision regarding political co-operation towards security in certain areas to which I referred.  I do not wish to overstate or to understate, just to give the facts.  A Minister of a sovereign Government should not adopt such a position.  The Minister should now make it clear to the people that the referendum allowed the Government to add something new to the Act but that they or the Dáil will not be asked to change the terms.  In case the Minister does not see the implications I will tell him what he is ratifying on our behalf without consulting us.  Political co-operation shall be governed by Title III which the Minister is ratifying without consulting us.  He does not have the right to do this; indeed no Minister has such a right.  The Minister is also ratifying the provision that the high contracting parties shall consider closer co-operation on questions of European security and will contribute in an essential way to the development of a European identity in external policy matters.  They are ready to co-ordinate their decisions more closely on the political and economic aspects of security.  The Minister is determined to maintain technological and industrial conditions necessary for collective security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a convinced European which obliges me to be frank, honest and confident &mdash; as Deputy Blaney said &mdash; in criticisms of what has been done.  The <Col N="2603" /> worries of the people have not been incorporated in this legislation.  This is rubberstamping the Act.  It is sad to think that these amendments will not make the slightest difference to the Act.  I do not know what went on at the negotiations or how the Minister conducted them but, from his performance during the debate and his apparent failure to comprehend the issues, I cannot say that I have much confidence in his ability to understand what was going on.  It certainly does not indicate that our negotiations were in safe hands.  These reservations should be written into the legislation, even at this eleventh hour.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that ever since the Taoiseach pointed out some rash comments made by Deputy O'Kennedy in the past he has become very sensitive.  His sensitivity is such that he apparently objects to other Members contributing.  However, his sensitivity apparently does not require him to understand the procedure which was followed during the negotiations.  Nor has it required him to inform himself of the procedure which this House adopted over the last two days.  A number of issues came before the House for decision last night.  There was first a motion in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs inviting the House to ratify the Single European Act.  The House ratified that Act last night although Deputy O'Kennedy charged that the Minister had ratified it.  It would be an extraordinary error for any Member of the House to believe <Col N="2604" /> that Ministers ratify international treaties. For someone who boasted that he had practised law for 12 years before he took silk it is an even more extraordinary error.</P>

      <P>The entirety of the Single European Act, its merits, wisdom and demerits came up for judgement last night.  The Act was voted on and Dáil Éireann chose to ratify it. The Dáil also gave a Second Reading to the Bill before us and we are now on Committee Stage.  The Bill is concerned with making amendments to the legislation of the European Community in 1972 and subsequently amended on the various occasions to which we referred. It is concerned only with those aspects of the Single European Act contained within the treaties and which refer to our domestic legislation.  The process of European political co-operation in the past was not governed by legislation and that will continue to be the case in future. The conduct of our diplomatic negotiations regarding foreign policy are not governed by legislation, they are governed by obligations to this House which were dealt with in full last night, just as, throughout the negotiations, the Government kept this House informed of what was happening and the direction in which these negotiations were going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night we ratified the Act in its entirety, including the process of European political co-operation.  We approved the principle of the legislation and today we dealt with details of legislation amending the 1972 European Community legislation.  These concerns that are being expressed about European political co-operation, and particularly the suggestion that somehow they erode our neutrality, strike me as very curious. Even more curious is the suggestion that the Act will in some way erode it.  Since 1970 European political co-operation has been a reality.  From the beginning we <Col N="2605" /> have been involved.  Successive Governments sent their Minister out to participate in meetings four times a year, or more, at which we sat down with our partners and sought to co-ordinate our position.  Sometimes we were able to do that but sometimes we failed.  That process represented no threat to our neutrality. What is involved now is neither more nor less than a continuation of that process.  Just as the earlier process represented no threat, neither does what will happen in the future represent a threat.</P>
    <P>What strikes me as extraordinary is that people are so timid that they are not prepared to see in that process the very real benefits that are there for us.  It would be accepted by everyone that our membership of the Community has given our foreign policy a new dimension.  One such area is development.  It was given an impetus by our membership which has been a very important part of our profile. During his period as President of the Council Deputy O'Kennedy presided over a renegotiation of the Lomé Agreement while the Taoiseach was President of the Council too.  That has been a very important part of our participation in European foreign policy.</P>
    <P>Equally we should not lose sight of the fact that there are a number of major international issues on which we have been successful in seeing the Community move towards the position we have adopted.  That is true to some extent, but not as far as we wanted to go, on South Africa, Latin America and the Middle East.  Far from representing a threat to us, what it has done is to give a richness to our foreign policy.  Can anyone doubt but that our policy is more informed by reason of our contact, for example, with the Spaniards and the Portuguese, when we address ourselves to questions of Central America and Latin America?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Collins believed that to be the case and that is why they both participated in European political co-operation, and did so without any reluctance.  We have been participating since the beginning of our membership and we continue to participate, but the question of European <Col N="2606" /> political co-operation does not arise today, that was a matter for yesterday when we ratified the Single European Act.  Today, we are concerned with the Bill to amend the European Community legislation, and that has nothing to do with European political co-operation, good, bad or indifferent.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said earlier that I should stand up and not depend on the civil servants next to me or on the Attorney General, on whom the Deputy made a most disgraceful and, I hope, uncharasteristic attack.  He attacked a man who is not here to defend himself and neither are the civil servants free to defend themselves.  I do not believe this is in keeping with the standards we expect in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another Deputy said that this House should not pass legislation which is not in keeping with the Constitution.  The Minister has an obligation not to introduce legislation which is contrary to the Constitution.  At every stage during the negotiations on the Single European Act I was in constant contact with legal advice, including the Attorney General. Last night I deliberately read into the <Col N="2607" /> record not my opinion, because that is political, but a far more authorative opinion from the Attorney General, on two issues justifying what we had done.</P>
    <P>My opinion on the legalities of this measure is a layman's opinion.  I depend on legal advice.  Deputy O'Kennedy is a lawyer and is entitled to his legal opinion.

    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned Title III, but he does not appear to understand what is going on.  He did not put down an amendment to the motion yesterday. He could have put down an amendment to the motion saying we should not ratify Title III&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and trying to see some bogey in this which will lead the Irish nation to war on behalf of some German baron.  The only thing Title III of the Single European Act does is to formalise what has been practice up to now.  It is not appropriate for domestic law and it is not being written into the Treaty of Rome.  All it does is to formalise what was going on when we joined the Community, what was referred to in the White Paper in 1972 when we joined the Community, and what has been the practice since.</P>

      <P>In other words, I am in good company.  As the Minister put it, we are formalising practices which developed over the years.

      <P>On a point of order, I am afraid the Deputy did not hear my full reply.  Under Title III of the Single European Act we are formalising what has been the practice up to now.  Only two and a half pages cover this point. The rest of the booklet deals with the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am cutting out the twaddle at both ends.  The Articles are covered in 27 pages, but there are other appendages in pages 69 and 70 and the appendices on pages 71 and 72.  Anybody who has the slightest experience of the deviousness of European politics, particularly as practised to a fine art in the European <Col N="2609" /> Parliament, the Commission and the Council, will be fully alive to the fact that what has emanated as the Single European Act started in various strands maybe ten years ago.  I can only talk for the time that I was there, from 1979 to 1984.  I remember contesting three different reports, in 1981, 1982 and 1984, that clearly endangered the very things I am trying to defend tonight.  I spoke against them and voted against them while Fine Gael, in their innocence, voted for them. Fianna Fáil, perhaps not fully instructed on the matter from Dublin, did not vote. On some occasions they were not there. On another occasion the only voice from Ireland apart from my own &mdash; he is a member of the Labour Party and the Seanad &mdash; was Senator Flor O'Mahony.</P>
      <P>There was a report on defence which dangerously points to what we are dealing with now.  There was a Spinelli report which was supposed to be harmless.  The Community are years behind on all those issues.  They converge and the convergence now is the Single European Act.  There was the Dooge report and the Adenauer report.  Taking all those reports together if we take out what is between the lines we get the Single European Act.  It has taken years but they take their time.  Time is of no importance to them.  Having conceded the Six Counties to the British we are now saying to the European Community, you can have the other 26 counties.  Whatever else this Government may not have done they will be responsible for those two actions for the rest of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast asked for assurances from the Minister.  While not in the slightest doubting the Minister's assurances, his good faith in giving the assurances or that he has got the best advice, legal and otherwise, in the circumstances, I say to Deputy Prendergast and any other Deputy in the House what a Minister says in the best of good faith and with the best knowledge available to him is not worth the paper it is written on. We have found that out a number of times.  The spirit of what we decide in this House often coloured its passage through the House.  The spirit does not come into <Col N="2610" /> question when the bewigged gentlemen get down to looking at the strokes, the placement of letters and words and which comes before the other until you are so addled that it is somewhat similar to being in the European Parliament after they have received something that the Council wants them to do.  They ask Parliament to do it in a certain way and then try to make them believe that they recommended it.  That is the manner of their procedure and this is where we have been trapped many times but nowhere more so than in the Single European Act.  It is being put through the House in the same way as we are putting through this Bill.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that we have a one page Bill we are giving power to an outside body over which we have no control.  In many instances we no longer have any veto except where the vital national interest is concerned.  Who will determine what is the vital national interest?  We have not the right to do so. We may claim that something is of vital national interest and therefore the veto can come into operation.  There are 11 other countries in the European Community and I do not feel in any way inferior to them.  I do not go along with the Taoiseach who talks about it being a display of our inferiority to feel that we will be obliged to do something through the actions of the Community with which we do not agree.  That is foolish talk.  It is only a man as foolish as the Taoiseach who would talk that way.  He will not face the reality that 11 important and powerful countries want it this way.  We are saying to them, operate the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>We, as a little country in that Community, feel that we will be able to divert or thwart the wishes of the big powers within it.  We are telling them that we trust them.  I trust them as far as I can throw them and no further.  Anybody who trusts them is a fool.  It has been put to the test and it has been proved how foolish our actions have been.  Once bitten twice shy.  We should stop the clock, go back to our European counterparts and lay it on the line as to where <Col N="2611" /> we have been wronged, by our own omission or by their commission.  If we pass this Bill we can forget about redressing the position thereafter.  The one and only weapon of defence and protection we had during the years was the veto.  We are now giving it up voluntarily.  This is very sad, taken in the context of the Taoiseach talking.  It is seen as a sign of weakness for anybody to think there is any danger. There is grave danger and it can be disastrous for us.</P>
    <P>We are given to understand that great things will come from this Act.  We tend to think about how much national dole we will get from Europe.  We tend to think about what size the European Regional Fund or Social Fund will be in future and how much we will get.  These two funds are merely financial instruments that have been brought into being to try to fill some of the holes where the operations of the European Community in other regards have failed to make any impact.  We are widening and deepening the problems and depression in this country. If the fund gets bigger that does not mean that we are doing well.  The bigger the fund that is required the worse condition we and also the other countries who receive it are in.  While there is special mention of the European fund, there is not mention of there being any obligation on the members of the Community to provide additional funds through their budget.  Their budget is as cramped today as it was last year.  There is nothing in the Single European Act that obliges them to raise the budget.  If they do not raise the budget where will we get our extra funds from?  Where will the Regional Fund and the Social Fund get their money?  If they get it then it must be from somewhere else.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Common Agricultural Policy is the cause of all the financial difficulties in Europe; it will be trimmed down to size and more money will be saved with the result that there will be bigger Social and Regional Funds. That is a delusion.  The Common Agricultural Policy with its attendant quotas and proposed quotas is a licence to the <Col N="2612" /> huge farming enterprises on the mainland of Europe to continue for all time to draw huge wealth from the coffers of the Community to the disadvantage of the ordinary farmers throughout Europe, particularly small farmers here.  We got a lousy deal and we are largely to blame for that.  We have been too concerned about being gentlemanly in Europe, about being good Europeans and doing all conventional things uniformly.  We would never dream of introducing any type of national outlook in our dealings with the Community.  That is not done by the Irish but it is done by the big countries in Europe when it suits them.</P>
    <P>I can recall the many difficulties that arose about lamb going into the French market and the pressure that was put on. The rows finished up in the European Court of Justice.  Those involved in that dispute insisted on importers using the port of Dieppe, travelling with their documents to the heart of France to have them completed and reporting back to the port of entry for clearance before delivering the produce in Paris.  Did we ever try anything like that?  No, we would not do that but other member states did. Tonight I was reminded of a report of the Council of Europe which showed that 150 tricks by other member states to avoid commitments had been adopted by them. The tricks were all legitimate but none of them was ours.  Of course, we are far above that; we are a lot of clowns; we do not look at things like that and we consider them to be beneath us.  That would be a fine attitude to adopt if we were dealing with people who feel the same way but other countries are not as naive as we have proved to be in our dealings with other members, particularly in regard to directives.</P>
    <P>Last night we were told there is a logjam of directives waiting to be distributed. I understand that the Commission have 300 directives ready.  I ask Members to recall the problems we had in the House dealing with one directive in recent months, the equality directive.</P>

      <P>I am not objecting to that but I am asking the House to contemplate what will happen when 300 directives are showered upon us over night as soon as the valve is opened.  After some shuffling around, the Council will instruct the Commission to prepare the directives which, in accordance with the terms of the Single European Act, will be implemented in co-operation with the Parliament.  It should be noted that the Commission will not have to consult with the Parliament.  I ask Members to bear in mind that the term, &ldquo;in co-operation with the Parliament&rdquo;, is used in every change that is made.  The word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; has been replaced by the term, &ldquo;in co-operation with the European Parliament&rdquo;. I have not discovered any new power being given to the European Parliament where we might have some chance as a small country of garnering support on some issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be with his Council of Ministers while the Taoiseach will be with the Heads of Government.  He will be one of 12 but if a military issue arises he will be on the outside.  Anybody with experience of the European scene, like our Ministers and their officials, who tries to get it across to the House that we are dealing with childish or naive people in Europe should think again.  I do not know where we are going when we say we should give away the power to do things.  The effects will be disastrous for us.  Deputy Taylor is worried about the market.  The market will write &ldquo;finish&rdquo; to industrial development here.  That was the price we undertook to pay in 1972 for the protected industries we had by allowing tariffs and barriers to be removed.  We have paid the price in full but having done that and <Col N="2614" /> not fared that well on the other side of the coin, in the area of agriculture, we are prepared to give the Commission the authority under the Act to go for the internal market without the slightest indication that they will help the peripheral regions by transport support.  That support is needed to put those involved in that industry on an equal footing with those on the mainland.  That has been referred to time and again in the European Parliament and at meetings of transport committees.  Such support has been recommended by the Parliament on many occasions but those recommendations have been scrapped by the Council of Ministers.  I have not heard any mention of that today.  If we got a transport subsidy our industries, particularly those in the west, would be put on a competitive footing with their counterparts in central Europe.</P>
    <P>Unless we got a guarantee like that written into the Single European Act we will be passing a recipe for disaster as far as industrial development here is concerned. We are daft, mad in the head, and yet we are adopting this measure with all the aplomb of people who are confident of their own beliefs.  It is tantamount to arrogance.  It is nonsense for the Government to think they can adopt this Act and expect that the country will survive.  It makes nonsense of the performance of the House.  In future there will be very little business for the House; it will be done for us in Europe.  We probably will not get even to the stage when there will be any procedure for us to go through, when the directives keep pouring in; when the Commission and the central bureaucrats in Europe will have dealt with things their way at the dictates of their masters, the Chief Ministers of the Council.  They will be calling the tune and the Commission will dance accordingly.  Directives will pour out and our interests will be far down the line.  If they are up front, it will be by accident rather than design.</P>
    <P>I despair when I see the sort of approach we continue to have in our innocence or arrogance or ignorance.  It <Col N="2615" /> is sad and it will be a disaster.  People will live to regret the night we put this thing through.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Nothing in this Act shall affect the jurisdiction or powers heretofore vested in the Courts established by law pursuant to Article 34 of the Constitution in any matter of domestic law.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to incorporate into Irish domestic law those parts of the Single European Act which amend the original Treaties which established the Community.  That was the procedure followed in the case of the original Treaties when we joined but the 1972 referendum and the Article it inserted in the Constitution ensured that as part of our domestic law it could not even be challenged as being unconstitutional.  The question we now have to face is whether this new Treaty, when it is incorporated into our law, also will be above constitutional challenge.  If it is not, then it is only a matter of time until some person or corporation affected by its provisions will challenge it in our courts.</P>
      <P>This Bill sets out to confer new lawmaking powers on the Council of Ministers, and the Council would be empowered to establish a new court with jurisdiction to hear and determine in the first instance certain classes of action and proceedings in Community law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution vests the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State in the Oireachtas. Article 34.1 of the Constitution provides that justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges <Col N="2616" /> appointed in the manner provided by the Constitution.  If there were nothing else involved then this legislation would clearly be repugnant to both those Articles.  But of course there is the other factor, which is, the change made in our Constitution by the referendum of 1972. That referendum inserted a new provision in the Constitution, namely, Article 29.4.3 which authorises our membership of the Communities and goes on to declare:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions, thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>The terms of that paragraph are wide but the question is, are they wide enough to cover what is actually a new Treaty?  Is ratifying this new Treaty something which is &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of membership&rdquo;?  In the explanatory guide, the Government express the opinion that the incorporation of this new Treaty into our law by this legislation comes within the terms of Article 29.4.3 because this new Treaty is an obligation of membership of the Communities as it contains limited amendments of the Treaties by the common agreement of member states.  In this regard the explanatory guide refers to Article 236 of the EC Treaty and the corresponding Articles of the other Community Treaties which expressly envisage the possibility that the Treaties may be amended and established procedures for that purpose.</P>
    <P>However, unlike previous amending Treaties, the Single Act does not refer to Article 236 of the EC Treaty and the corresponding Articles of the other Community Treaties.  In the absence of the authoritative interpretation by the Supreme Court of Article 29.4.3 it is difficult to assess whether the opinion of the Government is correct.  Given that this Article deprives the citizen of the right <Col N="2617" /> to invoke the fundamental rights guaranteed by other provisions of the Constitution the courts may take a strict view of what is meant by &ldquo;obligations necessitated by membership of the Communities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A finding of unconstitutionality after the enactment of the legislation would have serious consequences for the State. The State would be in breach of international obligations.  An embarrassing conflict would arise between the Irish courts and European Court of Justice which is obliged to ensure the uniformity of Community law in all the member states.  In these circumstances the question must be very seriously posed if it is wise for the Government to proceed with this Bill without putting the matter beyond doubt by way of referendum.  The Government are apparently prepared to take a chance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment involves two amendments to the Treaties dealing with the European Court of Justice. The first amendment provides that the Council of Ministers may attach to the European Court of Justice, a court with jurisdiction to hear and determine, in the first instances, certain classes of action subject to a right of appeal to the Court of Justice on points of law. Limitations are set on what those classes of actions might be, specifically.  It excludes the possibility that it could be proceedings brought by Community institutions &mdash; an action could not be initiated by a member state &mdash; and it excludes the possibility of references going to the court.</P>
      <P>The second amendment to the Treaties deals with the question of delays and rules of procedure.  The object is to streamline procedures and to reduce the length and the complexity involved in relation to the status of the courts.  It is clearly set out in the Act that the implementation of the Article is subject to a unanimous decision by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of more fundamental importance is that the new court will be an inferior tribunal, a tribunal from which an appeal <Col N="2618" /> will lie to the Court of Justice.  Therefore, any suggestion that this inferior tribunal could have a jurisdiction wider than the existing courts of justice is clearly nonsense. It is unthinkable in any legal system that you could have an inferior tribunal with a jurisdiction greater than the court to which an appeal lies.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the new court involving any supranational judicial control over the Treaties.  From the beginning, the Treaties required a judicial arm. They had that judicial arm in the European Court of Justice.  Involved here are two technical amendments to make that court work better, specifically, to hive off some of the more routine cases, such as proceedings brought by staff members. unions and so on, against the institutions. and have them dealt with by a court of first instance from which an appeal will lie.  In those circumstances I have to say that Deputy Gerry Collins's fears are quite exaggerated and the amendment quite unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 33 to 34, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister for Foreign Affairs shall by Order appoint a date for the coming into operation of this Act, provided that such date shall be subsequent to the deposit by the Government of the following declaration in the archives of the Government of the Italian Republic with a request to remit a certified copy to each of the Governments of the States which are signatories of the Single European Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2625" />&lsquo;Declaration by the Government of Ireland on Article 13 and on Title III of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Ireland considers that the completion of the internal market must have full regard to the terms of Protocol 30, agreed at the time of accession, which recognises that there are certain special problems of concern to Ireland, and that there is a Community interest in the attainment of the aims of Ireland's policy of industrialisation and economic development designed to align the standards of living in Ireland with those of the other European nations and to eliminate underemployment while progressively evening out regional differences in levels of development.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Ireland states that the provisions of Title III do not affect Ireland's long established policy of military neutrality and that co-ordination of positions on the political and economic aspects of security does not include the military aspects of security or procurement for such purposes and does not affect Ireland's capacity to act or refrain from acting in any way which might affect Ireland's international status of military neutrality.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During the course of our negotiations on our Treaty of Accession to the European Economic Community in 1972 we were deeply conscious of our economic position at that time.  We also had to bear in mind our geographical location on the north-western periphery of Europe. Having regard to the circumstances which were there for everybody to see, the Government of the day wisely decided that Protocol 30 would be annexed to the Act concerning the conditions of accession and the adjustments to the Treaties of 22 January 1972.</P>
    <P>Protocol No. 30 states:</P>
    <P>THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2626" /> DESIRING to settle certain special problems of concern to Ireland, and</P>
    <P>HAVING AGREED the following provisions,</P>
    <P>RECALL that the fundamental objectives of the European Economic Community include the steady improvement of the living standards and working conditions of the peoples of the Member States and the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the lessfavoured regions:</P>
    <P>TAKE NOTE of the fact that the Irish Government has embarked upon the implementation of a policy of industrialization and economic development designed to align the standards of living in Ireland with those of the other European nations and to eliminate underemployment while progressively evening out regional differences in levels of development;</P>
    <P>RECOGNIZE it to be in their common interest that the objectives of this policy be so attained;</P>
    <P>AGREE to recommend to this end that the Community institutions implement all the means and procedures laid down by the EEC Treaty, particularly by making adequate use of the Community resources intended for the realization of the Community's above mentioned objectives;</P>
    <P>RECOGNIZE in particular that, in the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the EEC Treaty, it will be necessary to take into account the objectives of economic expansion and the raising of the standard of living of the population.</P>
    <P>Thirteen years later, having enjoyed the benefits of Community membership and despite considerable progress including investment in modern industry, agriculture, infrastructure and in the less well off regions, unemployment in Ireland has quadrupled to nearly 250,000, disparities <Col N="2627" /> in the living standards between the different regions of the Community have widened and the Regional Fund has not been given sufficient resources.  The Government's foreign indebtedness has increased 70-fold in the same period partly because of the need to bring Ireland's infrastructure up to European standards.</P>
    <P>The principles of the Common Agricultural Policy which were the principal reasons for Ireland's membership of the EC have been seriously eroded with a loss of livelihood for many farmers.  Bearing in mind that no coherent economic policy with a view to co-ordinating economic recovery and reducing unemployment has been conducted at Community level, the continuing commitment to the Community must be tempered by adequate safeguards for Ireland's vital interests.  Having approved the terms of the Single European Act we, therefore, now take the necessary steps which are there to protect us and to ensure that our situation is fully understood at Community level.</P>
    <P>Nobody can take me to task for the picture I have presented on the economic situation which exists at present.  There is ample evidence to show that the situation in 1986 is worse than it was in 1972.  These facts have been given to the House by a number of speakers during the course of the Second Reading of this Bill.  I might also add that there are fears for other concerns because, sadly, it is all too self-evident that we have a weak economy at present.  Because of our geographical location on the periphery of Europe, there is nothing we can do except to make sure that all the difficulties which our geographical position creates for us are recognised by our partners in Europe.</P>
    <P>The White Paper, produced most reluctantly by the Government almost at the very end of this year and just three weeks before this debate started, does not in any way spell out for us the difficulties we may or shall experience on the completion of the internal market. There is nothing in the Government documentation which would help us to <Col N="2628" /> understand the difficulties and problems we will face on the steady and sure dismantling of the CAP.  As regards the harmonisation of taxation I agree that unanimity is required but if we agree in principle to something I am not sure if we will be in as strong a position as we would like to be to prevent the harmonistation of taxation by using the veto. We cannot do that forever.  We would have agreed in principle to something and our position would be weakened considerably. The economic considerations should have been spelled out clearly for us.</P>
    <P>Hopefully this area does not harbour anything that would do us harm.  We cannot be too sure about it.  The Government seem to think that there is no reason to worry or be concerned.  Of course, there is.  Much that has been said in the course of the debate shows that the picture is not as rosy as it is made out to be. We must take the necessary precautions and ensure that our partners know the real position.  All we are asking for is that Protocol 30 be restated and brought to the attention of our European partners.</P>
    <P>We must have a base and something to fall back on.  There is no need to convince anyone in the House of our position. Sadly we all know what it is and it is a tragedy that it is this way but we must ensure that our Community partners know it.  That is why we consider that the completion of the internal market must have full regard to the terms of Protocol 30, agreed at the time of accession, which recognises that there are certain special problems of concern to Ireland, and that there is a Community interest in the attainment of the aims of Ireland's policy of industrialisation and economic development designed to align the standards of living in Ireland with those of the other European nations and to eliminate underemployment while progressively evening out regional differences in levels of development.</P>
    <P>Even though this is what was agreed in Protocol 30 which was agreed during the Treaty of Accession in 1972 the gaps are still widening.  I use that word deliberately because it was said earlier this <Col N="2629" /> evening that the gaps had narrowed. Even with this safeguard which we are seeking there is no guarantee that the gap will be narrowed because the weakness is that funds have not been provided. There is a commitment to expand and develop policies but until such time as the Heads of Governments realise that despite what they might want to do, they must give the wherewithal to do it and allow our own resources to be increased, we will not have an economic Community in the sense we were led to believe we would have or in the sense the founders of the EC envisaged.</P>
    <P>The Community is turning out to be less of an economic Community and more of a military and political Community. There are plenty of plans and schemes but the money is not provided to implement them.  The attitude of the major partners is one that arouses a certain suspicion in us, as it should, that not sufficient is being done in this area.</P>
    <P>There are many Members who wish to contribute so I shall not delay on the first part of the amendment.  As regards the second part of the amendment, Ireland is a sovereign independent nation.  We are not aligned to any power bloc or attached to any military alliance.  This is the wish of the great majority of people. That wish must be honoured and respected.  In recent times members of the Government in their most peculiar fashion, cast doubts on our neutrality and on whether we should stay out of NATO. Whether or not they were misinterpreted I do not know but the impression given led to a state of confusion.  There is no doubt as to what the people want in this area: they want to remain neutral and unaligned to NATO or any other western European union.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why we cannot or should not tell our partners in Europe in the strongest way what our stand is on this issue.  There is no reason why we should be ashamed to do so.  The Danes did so.  They are members of a Nordic alliance.  The Danish position was very similar to ours on the question of neutrality. The Danish Parliament felt that it was very important that this issue would <Col N="2630" /> be brought before their European partners. They put in a declaration and saw no reason why they should not do so. I fail to understand the arguments put forward by the Government as to why we have backed away from such a declaration. I am asking that our position be spelled out clearly.  There is good reason for it.  We must never forget that 11 of the 12 members of the EC are involved in military alliances.  That is their decision.  We are the only country which is not so involved.  On occasion I have had to say that such and such a discussion should not take place as it did not come under the umbrella of the European Community, political co-operation or not.  I have said that if they want to discuss military matters it should take place in another forum.</P>
    <P>It does not help us to hear the statement made by Mrs. Thatcher when she visited the Parliament this week.  She urged most strongly and in a forceful fashion, as she can do, that Europe should get closer to NATO.  It is not good enough for the leader of a large state in the EC to push this point of view at the Parliament. It was exceptionally wrong of her to do so and the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs should take the matter up with her and demand an explantation.  Whether or not we like it, we are being inched along the way and being sucked into these things.  We should make the views of the people quite clear. I know it is difficult when we are sitting with them and when discussions take place but we must ensure that they respect our position.  On occasion they have forgotten it.  I am sure it is an error on their part.  I see no reason why the Government cannot do what the Danish Government did and ensure that our position regarding neutrality is brought to the attention of our partners.  That would help them to understand our position.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the arguments put forward by the Minister for Foreign Affairs during the course of his speech rejecting our amendment to the motion <Col N="2631" /> of ratification &mdash; that it lays down a condition to our acceptance of the Single European Act.  That is not so.  If it were so in our case then it would surely have been so in the case of Denmark.  It does not follow.  It is not a good argument to make.  It falls flat.  The view of the people on this issue is well known in the country and is very clear.  The Tánaiste took a personal pride in proposing the motion that we recognise our neutral position. There was no question about that in the House.  The only place where it is at issue is within the EC when at times we are sucked into the discussions which take place.  It happened only last weekend when the Taoiseach, as head of Government at the summit in London, found afterwards that he was brought into these discussions and he should not have been. Indeed, the statement issued afterwards with regard to the last paragraph, No. 4, had to do with matters outside the ambit of the European Economic Community. I would urge the Minister and the Government to accept our motion.  There is much that I could say but I do not want to repeat myself.  There are others who want to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the Government's position on this matter.  We are rejecting this amendment.  We think it unnecessary.  I gave the reasons last night in response to a similarly worded motion in the name of Deputy Vincent Brady.  The House last night passed a motion in my name setting out this Dáil's position on neutrality and cohesion.  I undertook last night to lodge that when we ratify the Single European Act with the Italian Government and I shall do that.  There is absolutely no necessity for what Deputy Collins is trying to do here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment and thereby my colleague.  The Single European Act is designed to accelerate the process of European integration. What remains unclear is the kind of integration that is envisaged.  Are we to have an integration based on the <Col N="2632" /> Treaty of Rome's commitment to balanced development between the different regions of the Community with the aim of closing the gap between richer and poorer regions of the Community or are we to have the form of integration where the stronger regions and stronger enterprises prosper at the expense of the less developed regions and enterprises?</P>
      <P>We must acknowledge that economic integration and the achievement of the internal market hold considerable potential benefits for Ireland as an exporting nation.  However, we must point out also the potential pitfalls.  Indeed, the failure to achieve a single internal market within the European Community has especially serious effects for small and medium sized firms who do not have the resources to grapple with a plethora of different regulations, tests, certificates, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
      <P>The provisions of the Single European Act have potentially both positive and negative implications for Irish industry. At its Milan meeting in June 1985 when the White Paper on the internal market was presented to the European Council, the Heads of Government instructed the Council of Ministers to draw up a precise programme of action based on the White Paper, to achieve the internal market by 1992 &ldquo;in accordance with stages fixed in relation to previously determined priorities and a binding timetable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We share the aim of completing the internal market of the Community. When we contemplate what has been achieved by Japan and the United States in the realm of fighting unemployment and creating jobs through fully exploiting all the advantages of their huge markets and contrast the achievement of our competitors with the lack of action and hesitations in Europe, there is indeed much cause for regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC's record on jobs has been dismal.  Improved economic performance through the achievement of a fully integrated Common Market, the upgrading of Europe's technological capacity through co-operation between the member states and R and D &mdash; all will help to boost jobs.  Ireland has a potential internal market of 320 million, compared <Col N="2633" /> with 235 million in the United States and 120 million in Japan.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a growing and expanding market based on the free movement of capital, persons and goods has enormous implications for economic buoyancy in Europe.  It is clear that the paralysis afflicting the EC's institutional machinery has held up progress on completing the internal market and on promoting economic convergence and balanced economic development between the wealthier areas of the Community and the less favoured peripheral areas, such as Ireland.  It has led to growing disenchantment among the citizens of the Community, which was evident in the small number of people who voted in the second election in many of the member states.  The Treaty of Rome included provisions aimed at.</P>
    <P>the creation of a single integrated internal market free of restrictions on the movement of goods;</P>
    <P>the abolition of obstacles to the free movement of persons, services and capital;</P>
    <P>the institution of a system to ensure that competition within the Common Market is not distorted;</P>
    <P>the approximation of laws as required for the proper working of the Common Market;</P>
    <P>the approximation of indirect taxation in the interest of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>While the establishment of the common customs tariff was a very positive achievement, non-tariff barriers multiplied during the recession impeding a step forward in the process of achieving the internal market.  The Commission now maintains that the adoption of about 300 proposals-directives aimed at removing the physical, technical and fiscal barriers will contribute to the completion of a unified Community market.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act provides for changes in the Community decision-making procedures; the achievement of the internal market will be speeded up, it says, by increased use of qualified majority voting.  Qualified majority <Col N="2634" /> voting is to be extended through amending the relevant Articles in the Treaty to the areas of customs duties, decisions affecting the right of establishment of bankers and the pharmaceutical and medical professions, freedom to supply services including insurance, restrictions on capital movements and exchange policies and sea and air transport.</P>
    <P>Unanimity is to be retained in regard to the harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a new Article, which allows the Commission to grant temporary derogations from the provisions establishing the internal market to certain of the weaker economies in the Community is an important provision from Ireland's perspective, although it would be helpful if there were more precise clarification of the powers of derogation contained in this Article.</P>
    <P>Important aspects of current Irish legislation, such as our level of corporation tax, or the taxation of oil exploration and production, cannot be overturned by the qualified majority vote.</P>
    <P>As the EC's Economic and Social Committee have pointed out, a plan for the completion of the internal market needs to be accompanied by policies dealing with growth and employment and must be accompanied by policies promoting a reduction in the gap between the affluent regions and less prosperous economies of the Community.</P>
    <P>As the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the UK pointed out in June:</P>
    <P>This would imply a definitive commitment to the implementation of structural policies, especially regional policies, to accompany the realisation, since otherwise some member states such as Ireland would not be in a position to accept and bear such a degree of liberalisation.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act lays special emphasis on the completion of the internal market but it also stresses the need to strengthen the economic and social <Col N="2635" /> cohesion of the Community as a necessary balance to the liberalisation of the internal market.  It must be a matter of some concern, however, that the provisions for economic and social cohesion are unaccompanied by any solid proposals on promoting economic convergence. Completion of the internal market, in the absence of such measures, could increase both regional disparities and unemployment within the Community.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a flexible market of persons, materials, investment and capital will mean that resources will flow into the areas of the Community of greatest economic advantage.  The Community will need to be resolute in pursuing coordinated economic policies to ensure that no one sector or region would benefit at the expense of another sector or region.</P>
    <P>That is the subject matter that is included in our amendment.  It is relevant when we face certain special problems of concern to this country.  The Commission's proposals for greater liberalisation and transparency on the public purchasing front would be attractive for Ireland, in particular in the information, technology and health care sectors.  As the joint committee pointed out, Community-wide access to public purchasing contracts has important implications for industrial development policies, as it can overcome pressures on industrialists to locate their operation in the main national market to be supplied in order to avoid obstacles to supplying that market.</P>
    <P>In regard to the financial services industry, it is significant that the Commission's proposals for liberalisation in such services as control at foreign branches of financial institutions would be exercised by the authorities in the home member state subject to controls &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo; in the host member state. The introduction of this principle in these areas has yet to be agreed and the Department of Finance find the principle unsatisfactory because supervisory authorities in home or host countries could <Col N="2636" /> find it difficult to achieve sufficient familiarity with the legal and other requirements of other member states.</P>

      <P>The amendment says that Ireland considers that the completion of the internal market must have full regard to the terms of Protocol 30, agreed at the time of accession, which recognises that there are certain special problems of concern to Ireland in relation to our policy of industrialisation and economic development designed to align the standards of living in Ireland with those of the other European nations and to eliminate underemployment while progressively evening out regional differences in levels of development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if that is the case because I have no difficulty in relating my remarks to it.</P>
      <P>The Protocol attached to the Act of Accession to the European Community signed by Ireland in 1972 is more relevant now than ever.  It recommended that the Community institutions should implement all the powers in the EC Treaty to close the economic gap between Ireland and the rest of the Community. Fianna Fáil feel that positive recognition by our partners of our economic vulnerability must accompany ratification by the Dáil of the Single European Act.  Failure to secure this recognition would be tantamount to failure to do our duty as the elected representatives of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater competition as a result of the moves towards an internal market will provide opportunities for Irish enterprise. It also poses certain problems, especially for small enterprises, which form the bulk of our industries and which <Col N="2637" /> are frequently characterised by inadequate capital resources and inadequate technological capacity.  It is absolutely vital that Ireland is not hamstrung in its attempts to build up an industrial base. Upon our success or failure in this area will depend our prospects for job creation, economic growth and putting the public finances in order.  If necessary, let us remind our partners in Europe that Ireland's unemployment rate, which is continuing to rise, is now more than 50 per cent above the EC average which, by contrast, is declining.  We cannot abdicate our responsibility to manage our economy and, therefore, Fianna Fáil have advanced their reservations on the Single European Act in a positive spirit, which has potentially significant political, economic and social implications for this country.  It would be abdicating our responsibility if we failed to outline the realities posed by this legislation, its advantages and disadvantages, the positive benefits and possible pitfalls.</P>
    <P>We should ask our partners, in the spirit of solidarity upon which the Community was founded, to recognise that Ireland has special difficulties.  The exodus of tens of thousands of our young people over the past three years, the massive unemployment which is about twice the EC average, the need to develop a strong indigenous industrial sector and the urgency of developing our agricultural industry must be taken into consideration.  Doubts and uncertainties have been varied in relation to the effects of the provisions of the Single European Act on our policy of military neutrality, which is part of the amendment.  It is because we wish to safeguard this policy, which receives the support of the overwhelming majority of the people, that Fianna Fáil wish to append a declaration to the Act affirming our neutrality and, therefore, deflect any challenges to our neutral stance which may be posed under the Act.</P>
    <P>This affirmation is vital because, notwithstanding the Government's claim that the Single European Act protects and recognises Irish neutrality for the first time, the reality is that it commits us <Col N="2638" /> to a position of clear co-operation on questions of European security.  For our partners in NATO, the military and security aspects of security are indivisible. It is, therefore, almost inevitable that, like it or not, Ireland will be put under pressure in moves by our partners with the aim of co-ordinating all aspects of security, including the military ones.</P>
    <P>The European Council meeting last weekend highlighted this pressure when an attempt was made to include a statement covering military aspects of security. It would be unrealistic to ignore the fact that this pressure is likely to intensify rather than diminish.  The Fianna Fáil amendment is based on the need to affirm our policy of neutrality and to signal to our partners our resolution to maintain our neutrality.  Indeed, this position receives the support of the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee who echoed Fianna Fáil's position when they called on the Government to reaffirm our position of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act includes provisions aimed at maintaining the technological and industrial conditions necessary for security.  The House will recall that on the motion on EUREKA, I indicated that I saw a connection between that and Star Wars.  In this case there may be a blurring of Ireland's position in that we may be drawn into an association with the activities of our partners connected with military aspects of security.  This must be faced, however much Minister Barry flinches from it.  We fully recognise that Europe's technological and industrial capacity must be modernised as it has fallen behind America and Japan. From the perspective of our partners who are members of NATO, it has serious implications for the security policy pursued by them within the framework of NATO.  In the Irish context, however, it is vital that we scrupulously ensure that our position of military neutrality is safeguarded at all times.</P>

      <P>I note with some gratitude that Deputy Lyons favours European integration and accepts that when we voted to join the EC in 1972 we voted <Col N="2639" /> for more than the Common Market as it developed.  We voted overwhelmingly for complete European integration.  I am not sure, however, what the official Fianna Fáil position is on this.  At I pointed out earlier, Deputy Haughey said quite clearly last night that he had misgivings about the completion of the Common Market.  It is on the record that he said that in relation to certain matters it had gone too far.  My main purpose for waiting to speak to this amendment was to try and tease out what Fianna Fáil mean when they refer to &ldquo;Ireland's long established policy of military neutrality&rdquo;.  As a Member of the Oireachtas for the past five years, I noticed that when our neutrality was raised, it was a very sensitive and touchy subject.  On one occasion a couple of years ago, I took the opportunity to search the records of this House in the belief that somewhere I would find the source of this long established policy of neutrality we hear about.  Most people would acknowledge that the single greatest act of neutrality we ever engaged in was not participating in the Second World War.  Mr. de Valera, who essentially made that decision and proposed that policy at the time, indicated that it was not a matter of fundamental policy but his decision, and the decision of the Government at the time, was made simply on the basis that this country was a partitioned State.  He said if the State were not partitioned, his consideration of the matter would have been entirely separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Mr. Lemass became Taoiseach he said in this House: &ldquo;There is no neutrality and we are not neutral&rdquo;.  He accepted the desirability of NATO.  He regarded NATO as protecting not just the member states but also this country. If people care to look at the record of this House they will see that.  Many years ago, Deputy Haughey as Minister for Finance, in a debate in this House argued that political union necessarily implies the formulation of a common defence policy and the working out of common defence arrangements.  He asked what was wrong with nations getting together <Col N="2640" /> and deciding to have a common bond of defence between them.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Lynch was Taoiseach in 1970, he told this House:</P>
    <P>We can make up our minds as to our neutrality in the light of the circumstances prevailing.</P>
    <P>When the President, Dr. Hillery, was Minister for Foreign Affairs, he declared in this House &ldquo;we have never adopted a permanent policy of neutrality&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some, but not all. As time moved on and we were considering the prospects of our entry into the Common Market Minister after Minister in Mr. Lynch's Government made it absolutely clear that even though we were not involved in any military alliance at that time, it was inevitable, if we joined the EC and committed ourselves to European integration, that that would have to be done.</P>
      <P>On 11 March 1981 speaking in this House, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey said:</P>
      <P>....  This country stands for certain values, enshrined in the Constitution. Our place is with the Western democracies, and we share common concepts of human rights, freedom under the law, individual liberty and freedom of conscience.  Our economic interests also are tied in with the Western industrialised world.  We are, therefore, neither ideologically neutral nor politically indifferent.</P>
      <P>In the event, therefore, of the European States being organised into a full political union, we could not, and would not, wish to opt out of the obligations and aims inherent in the achievement of the ideal of European unity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach, said on 11 March 1981 and I repeat:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could not, and would not, wish <Col N="2641" /> to opt out of the obligations and aims inherent in the achievement of the ideal of European unity.</P>
    <P>Speaking to the Royal Irish Academy, Deputy Lenihan, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, said on 21 November 1980:</P>
    <P>There are certain historical reasons why we were neutral in the Second World War and have remained outside alliances since.  But this does not mean that we are ideologically neutral or politically indifferent....  However, it has been recognised by successive Governments that in the context of political union in Europe, Ireland, as a member of the Community, would be prepared to participate in arrangements for its defence, if called upon to do so.</P>
    <P>After his famous summit with Mrs. Thatcher in 1980, when the totality of the relationships between the two islands was being put on the table, security <i>à la</i> Deputy Haughey was being put on that table, too.</P>
    <P>Looking back at the records of this House, I find it very difficult to find any source of the claim being made this week and in recent times, that there is a long established policy of neutrality.  I asked Deputy Collins to tell me where I can find the source or evidence of this claim. My own view is that this long established policy of neutrality which is spoken of so much in this Parliament stems from the popularity of neutrality in popular opinion polls.  I honestly believe it is not based on anything more than that.</P>
    <P>I take the view that our neutrality will have to be decided by this House and by the people.  The Tánaiste's suggestion that we have a referendum may be a very good idea.  But before we have any referendum we need to have a very good debate over a long period, teasing out precisely what we want for the future. Deputy Lyons and other members of Fianna Fáil can stand up here and say they want an integrated Europe, but they have not spelled out how their ground has changed from what Mr. Lemass, Mr. Lynch, Dr. Hillery, Deputy Haughey, <Col N="2642" /> Deputy O'Kennedy and every Fianna Fáil Taoiseach or Minister for Finance said before and since we went into Europe.  They made it perfectly clear that part of European integration, to which that party were committed, involved a commitment on defence.  That is what they said and I have put it on the record tonight.  If there is a change in the Fianna Fáil position, I would like to know what it is.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Haughey said he had misgivings about the completion of the Common Market and that he had grave misgivings about the Single European Act.  I believe he realised they could not find themselves off-side going into 1987, an election year, on a subject like that.  Fianna Fáil should clarify their position and let us know what they want.  If they do not want European integration, then let them say so, but let them also say what type of status they see for this country in the context of our opting totally out of Europe, or in some sort of associate membership, a two-tier Europe or whatever.  It is naïve to believe that we can continue to get from Europe the transfer of funds we have been getting for the past number of years, currently running at about £1 billion a year, and demand more under the Regional Fund for structural aid and still expect to opt out of Europe.  By all means we can decide to get out of Europe, or to have our participation in Europe limited, but if that is the case we have a duty, and the party who propose such a limitation of participation or who propose that we withdraw from the EC have an obligation, to explain to the people what the likely consequences will be.</P>
    <P>I believe this amendment is completely unnecessary.  I am satisfied from listening to the debate and from reading what has been published on numerous occasions over the last few weeks about the Single European Act, that our position as neutral militarily is clearly written into that legislation.  We have nothing to fear from it.  It is time we stopped codding around about this whole question of neutrality. Deputy John Kelly was right in saying that this so-called policy is a sham.  It is <Col N="2643" /> the truest comment that was made by a backbencher in this debate.  If the Irish people want neutrality they are entitled to it.  Maybe that is the position we should adopt.  If we are going to propose it to the Irish people we should tell them the full story.  If Fianna Fáil want to tell them that if we want to be neutral we will have to opt out of Europe, then they should do so.  That is more or less what Mr. Haughey said on Tuesday.  We should let the Irish people decide what we should do.  Between now and the next election some time in 1987 it might be possible for a committee of the Oireachtas to deal with this matter.  It may be better that a debate go on for two or three years on a subject such as this because the implications involved are quite enormous.  We should play fair.</P>

      <P>I have restrained myself from participating on Committee Stage of this debate so far.  I do not propose to contribute at length now because I had a considerable amount of time to express my views on this matter yesterday and I thank the House for that opportunity. I want a number of points clarified and I have a number of questions I would like the Minister to answer.  I, and The Workers' Party, have not argued for withdrawal from the EC, nor have we questioned the correctness of our being in the EC at present.  In the past we opposed our entry.  The country decided to enter the EC and we have been a member for the past 13 years.  That does not deprive us of the right to question EC proposals to make major changes in its structure, its decision-making process and the development of the formalisation of European political co-operation.  That is what I and The Workers' Party have been doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molony raised some very important questions in relation to neutrality. Like him, I feel that debate should proceed in a very detailed way.  It was made clear to me in recent times that there is a distinct difference between the neutrality I speak about and the neutrality which the Minister and which <Col N="2644" /> Fianna Fáil speak about.  If you examine the statements made recently by the Minister, by the Taoiseach and by Fianna Fáil spokesmen, there is a very large similarity. In that sense I differ also with Fianna Fáil in what I mean by neutrality. Regardless of the genesis of neutrality and the allegiance of the people to neutrality, however they understand it, the reality is that we have two nuclear armed camps and any country, large or small, that adds to either of those two camps is not doing the world any service by saying they are in favour of NATO or of the Warsaw Pact.  I define neutrality as being non-aligned.  I do not want that to be defined as sitting on the fence or as not taking a position on what is right or wrong.  It is non-aligned in the sense that we will not take sides in disputes that arise between east and west.  Our good offices and whatever influence we have in international forums should be used in relation to disarmament, denuclearisation, the reduction of tension and so on.  I know the Minister and most Governments in the past attempted to do that.  I would argue that in aligning ourselves more closely under the terms as they exist in the section on European political co-operation in the Single European Act with 11 other members of NATO, we are in effect taking sides.  We are strengthening the reaction and placing ourselves firmly in one camp.</P>
    <P>I said we do not oppose the principle of European political co-operation.  I find no problem in sitting down and discussing matters on European political co-operation with members of NATO or any other member of an alliance.  Does the Minister not see as I do, taking the definition of neutrality I offered as being an active and a positive policy, that Clause 6C of Article 30 restricts Ireland's function in influencing the direction in which the EC may go in the future in relation to denuclearisation and disarmament? It does not say we recognise Ireland's neutrality or Ireland's right to do A, B or C; it says nothing in this Title shall impede the Western European Union and NATO from doing whatever <Col N="2645" /> they choose in their own way.  It is unfortunate that that section is included in the Single European Act.  It is one of the aspects of the Single European Act on which we argued for renegotiation.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister about the whole question of cohesion and the regional disparities.  In the explanatory guide &mdash; the Minister complained on Second Stage that no one had taken up the challenge of this and answered any of the points in it &mdash; there is an admission that the disparities have not been eliminated from regions of the EC despite all the aid and the money pumped into them. Will he not accept that the provision in the Single European Act which says that once the Single European Act is ratified the EC will then sit down and discuss the question of coming up with a regional policy will obviously take into account the various problems in the region?  It does not make any commitment in relation to resources, to the structures or the type of regional aid or policies which Ireland would need in order to survive economically in an open and free market.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that we are not just talking about an internal market where there will be no frontiers but also about a free market where there will be no obstacles to competition.  As a result of that, unless there is very specific assistance in aid, in particular for industrialisation in Ireland, before the internal market is completed we will have very serious difficulties.  I want to emphasise that.  There are other peripheral things in the Single European Act about which we are concerned but we are concerned about those two specific areas in particular. I was irritated to say the least at the tenor of the debate today with Members trying to bring in matters like abortion and so on.  I find it irritating because the State has a law against abortion and has even changed the Constitution to prohibit abortion but we will have 4,000 Irish women leaving Ireland to have abortions in England.  It is a head in the sand approach to this question and it is demeaning the House to go through that charade again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Single European Act.  The Committee Stage has been divided into a discussion on neutrality and economic aspects.  I accept that bona fides of the Minister and some aspects of neutrality have smoke screened some important economic details of the debate.  My concerns relate to our ecomomic future in Europe.  I am firmly of the belief that we have no future if we are to depend on a consumer population of 3,500,000 Irish people.  We have to depend on 320 million Europeans. However, I have seen some industries being devastated.  The flour industry is one example of an industry that could not stand up to competition.  In terms of decisions by the Community we have seen that the relative stage of development of any sector within the Community bears no relationship to overall Community needs.  Irish agriculture made the case that we have only reached half the stage of European development but when it came to GATT and the import of cheap foodstuffs we were told that they were more important to the Community than Irish agricultural productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to turn my comments to industrial policy because there is a great deal of ignorance about Irish industrial performance.  We have had a lot of success but most of them have been through the successful importation of international mobile investment by the IDA. If that is taken away, if the black hole is taken away and we are left with Irish indigenous industry we will find that there are 5,000 small manufacturing firms. About 90 per cent of them are small and 80 per cent of all Irish manufacturing firms do not export at all.  We have the lowest R and D expenditure <i>per capita</i> in terms of GNP in the Community.  We are 17th on the OECD table of competitiveness of 22 states.  If we are talking about full and free competition and we are entering a Formula One race we are in a Morris Minor heading into 1992.  We have got to be honest about that and face up to it.  At the same time we must say that our only future is in the context of a European consumer market.  I would like <Col N="2647" /> those major deficiencies in Irish industry to be recognised in this debate.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (3) deals with the operational date of the Act while Protocol 30 sets out special terms of reference for Ireland to be laid in Rome.  I have confidence in the Minister and, therefore, I will not support the amendment.  However, I would like the Minister to put across three specific points because of industrial weakness with Irish firms.  The small and medium sized industry policy in Europe defines a small firm as one employing from one to 500 people.  That suits large concerns in the Community that are by no means small but it is downright unfair to us.  If there are limited resources they must be targeted to assist those in greatest need. If we look at research and development in new technologies we will see that the only way that we will create the jobs in the nineties will be by adopting technology. For example, bio-technology here is now at the stage that micro-electronic development was in the fifties. What we must get in Europe is preferential treatment for bio-technology so that in the nineties we will be the source of the job creation.  In the same way that the disadvantaged areas scheme has worked in agriculture we should get R and D preferential treatment for our industrial policy.  The area of greatest ignorance is competition policy.  It is seen in a narrow context of consumer interest which is fair but most people have not read the OECD report on buying power which clearly illustrates that the large multiple retail chains could wipe out small traditional businesses in the same way that Irish businesses can be wiped out by the multinationals of Europe without reference to any type of competition.  We are talking about a free market here.</P>
    <P>I am all for removing tariff barriers that are costing in excess of £5 million per year but I am not in favour of unfair competition, expecting Irish people to compete at prices of raw materials which cannot equate because of economies of scale.  We need to alter our competition policy to cater for the needs of small producers.  At the end of the day our goal <Col N="2648" /> must not be to copperfasten our position as the begging bowl of Europe.  We must say, as Kennedy said, do not give us fish; give us a rod.  We need the support now to develop our industrial infrastructure, to develop a strong indigenous Irish industrial base that can produce our way into the future, that can utilise the opportunities provided in the Single European Act and build upon them.  Without that aid we are very vulnerable.  I appeal to the Minister to pay particular attention when the developments are taking place between now and 1922 not only to our global industrial performance but the performance of indigenous Irish industries because they are quite different.  If that is studied and pursued fully we should bring about the specific changes I have asked for.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few comments on the question of neutrality dealt with in section 3 and take up from where Deputy De Rossa left off. We have to be serious about this.  I would welcome a full scale debate on neutrality in the House.  Such a debate has never taken place.  There has been reference to it after meetings of the Heads of Government. The fact of the matter is that this country is about as neutral as an Orange-man on 12 July.  We are not a neutral country although we pretend to be neutral. We go on with this nonsense about being neutral, outside a military alliance. I say it is nonsense because we have not debated it or heard the arguments for and against it.  If any Member dares to raise his or her head and asks us to consider the arguments for and against NATO and the WEU that Member is shot down immediately and condemned.  We should try to have a debate in the House so that we will know the tenets on which our neutrality is based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seán MacBride, one of the greatest proponents in latter days of neutrality, said that Ireland would become a full charter member of NATO the day after partition ends.  No other reason has been given for our neutrality since that declaration was made.  Seán Lemass is on record as having said when Taoiseach <Col N="2649" /> that he could never remember the matter being discussed in Cabinet when Mr. de Valera was head of Government.  We hear people talking about our neutrality during World War II and looking back it is easy to have a certain view on that but I would not be proud if we remained militarily neutral while six million Jews were grasping their naked children as they were being sent to their death.  We have to face up to it that as a member of the European Community we have a right to defend the Community if it comes under attack.  Do we not have a duty to defend the Community?  We should spell out our position on this.</P>
    <P>In the Naval Service in 1985 there were 942 officers and men, in the Air Corps there were 879 while in the Army we had 12,523.  We spent £247 million on those services in that year.  In 1986 it is estimated we will have to spend £650 million to be able to defend our neutrality.  We are not in a position to defend our neutrality. I have heard people compare us to Austria, Switzerland and Finland but those countries make substantial provisions for the defence of their neutrality. We should not mistake neutrality for passivity.  Many of those nations manufacture and export arms and some of their industries are involved in the manufacture of arms components.  Let us not mistake neutrality for hostilities: many of those nations export arms.  They manufacture armaments and those that do not are engaged in the manufacture of components for armaments.  If people compare us with those so-called neutral countries they are saying &ldquo;Let us be neutral and get into the export arms business&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We would be doing a public service if we publicly set down the premise on which our neutrality is based.  We should be given an opportunity here, with the Whips off, to give our honest viewpoints on Irish neutrality.  On a number of occasions I have asked for the establishment of a full committee on foreign affairs &mdash; there is a motion in the Seanad in that regard at the moment.  There have been many suggestions put to Ireland regarding our international alignments, <Col N="2650" /> apart from the approach in 1949 to join NATO.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to the House to know that in the papers in UCG of the late Paddy McGilligan, S27/9, there is a copy of a detailed note from John A. Belton, the Minister Resident of the Irish Legation in Madrid, outlining a proposal made to him on a personal basis, with the consent of the Spanish minister and the director of the foreign political section of the Spanish Foreign Office, in which he was asked: &ldquo;What would Ireland's attitude be to the creation of a neutral/Catholic bloc, consisting of Portugal, Spain, the Argentine and Ireland, whose objectives would be to defend Catholicism and resist Communism?&rdquo;  I am glad we did not join a bloc like that. That document marked &ldquo;Secret&rdquo; is dated 8 April 1948.  There have been many approaches to Ireland to become involved in alignments.</P>
    <P>A Fianna Fáil Government, led by the late Mr. Lemass, approved the servicing of US military aircraft here, flown into Ireland by US military personnel.  Is that an indication of a neutral country?  We give lip service to our neutrality and it is time we made our minds up and debated critically what our position is.  The late Mr. de Valera strongly criticised a Cosgrave Government for being equivocal on the position of neutrality, but the same Mr. de Valera became President of the League of Nations, presumably embracing its conventions with vigour. How can a nation signing an agreement promising financial assistance to another country or countries in time of war call itself neutral?  That is what happened.  I am afraid we are very selective in our historical recollections in regard to these events.</P>
    <P>The late Mr. Frank Aiken said, &ldquo;Partition dominated Ireland's approach to all questions of external policy&rdquo;.  That is verbatim what he said.  Why do we not spell it out?  I regret this continuing debate since we were asked to join NATO in 1949, this persistent debate about neutrality.  Of course, it has not been a debate: it has been a personality <Col N="2651" /> assassination campaign in which if anybody stuck his head up he was shot down. It is time we debated this.  We should decide if there is more to it than Partition. It would be a good thing for the House if we had such a debate.</P>
    <P>In March 1979 Deputy Haughey said: &ldquo;In the event, therefore, of European states being organised into full political union we would accept the obligations even if these included defence&rdquo;.  Time and time again Deputy O'Kennedy is on record as making similar statements.  The Taoiseach himself is on record as following that line.  Let us not get into the argument of one being more neutral than the other.  We would be doing a very good service for the public if the House were to come back, by agreement, to have a full-scale debate on neutrality.  Some countries are not neutral by design but by force almost, because of proximity to eastern neighbours.</P>

      <P>Other European countries have declared themselves neutral because they are compelled to be neutral through their proximity to their eastern European neighbours who spend such enormous amounts on arms.

The Minister made a very generous offer in reply to a question by me last week which I hope the Opposition will take up &mdash; a free, Whipsoff debate here on neutrality.</P>

      <P>I have only four minutes. I will take this point about neutrality first. Many people have been quoted about neutrality in the last 50 or 60 years.  I think Deputy Mitchell said I might be annoyed with him for dwelling on this.  I am not in the slightest bit annoyed.  I have said on a number of occasions here and outside that if we achieve political union in Europe it is inconceivable to me that we would not take part in the defence of that political union.  If our attitude was to be otherwise the logical thing for us to do would be to disband our Army, to stand it down.  I repeat the offer I made about the Government providing time for a debate on neutrality if the Whips were removed.  I have some doubt about some parties in that respect but, as Deputy Mitchell said, we would be doing a service to mankind.</P>
      <P>I regard the contributions tonight from most of the speakers as being extremely good.  Deputy Lyons said he had deep suspicion of EUREKA and its connection with &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo;.  There are at least three neutral countries contributing to EUREKA.  Evidently he does not know that, or he thinks their neutrality is tainted in some way.  The Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, will be attending the ministerial conference of EUREKA in Stockholm next week. Deputy De Rossa spoke about Article 6C.  He must read the Article as a whole. Eleven of the European states who are members of the Community embrace another aspect of security which does not suit us, and the Taoiseach came in on this.  I agree with many of the points made by Deputy Yates and I suggest that his contribution and some of those from the other side of the House clearly show the difference in attitudes between this party and Fianna Fáil towards Europe.  Fianna Fáil think the bottle is always half empty while we see the opportunities that can accrue for us.  That is what the Single European Act is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy John Browne has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment of the House the serious overcrowding problem at Gorey CBS.  Deputy Browne has nine minutes and the Minister has five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for <Col N="2657" /> allowing me in on the Adjournment and I would like to share my time, even though short, with my colleagues Deputy H. Byrne, Deputy D'Arcy and Deputy Yates, all from Wexford.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the terrible conditions at the primary school, Gorey CBS.  It is well known now that the parents, students and teachers are up in arms because of the way they have been treated by the Department for the past 11 years.  They have been ignored and as a result the people of Gorey have lost faith in both the Department and the present Government. Over the past few years they have got nothing but false promises and so they have decided to take action.  They arranged public meetings.  The students aged from four to 11 or 12 or whatever age they are in primary school went on strike for a week.  Yesterday the Dáil was picketed by parents and a Christian Brother.</P>
      <P>In 1976 they were promised a new school.  Now, almost in 1987, 11 years later, they have not got even an extension. They have ten teachers, five suitable classrooms, one toilet, no facilities for PE or Art and no library or medical room.  Two cloakrooms and two prefabricated buildings are being used as classrooms.  There are dampness and condensation and problems with heating, windows, <i>et cetera</i>.  The problems affecting that school are serious.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to give us a commitment here tonight and to tell us the truth.  Will Gorey primary school extension go ahead?  If so let him stitch that into the record of this House tonight. The parents of Gorey are tired of waiting and receiving letters from the Department stating that it is intended that the work will go ahead.  They do not want to hear what is intended, they want to hear that it is going ahead.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment here tonight that work on this school will proceed early in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving us time to debate the issue of the necessity of an extension to Gorey CBS <Col N="2658" /> national school.  I sought permission to raise this matter a few weeks ago without success.</P>
      <P>Gorey CBS National School has an enrolment of 275 students and, as Deputy Browne has said those pupils and their ten teachers are trying to operate in six classrooms, two 11 year old prefabricated rooms and two cloakrooms.  There is no staff room, no library, and no medical room.  How can it be expected that the proper educational programme could be carried out in such circumstances?  Poor heating obtains not only in the prefabricated rooms but throughout the school and that is not conducive to good education.  This school, the Christian Brothers, the teachers, pupils and parents in Gorey are being discriminated against.  The local parents' association collected contributions long ago and they have been led a merry dance particularly over the past three years.  With Deputy Browne I ask the Minister tonight to come clean and to tell us the truth.  When will the new school be built?  When can the people of Gorey expect fair play?  As is well known in this House and outside, the Christian Brothers over the years have been the backbone of the Irish educational system and I boast proudly that I attended the Christian Brothers' school. Surely because of their contribution they deserve better treatment.  Every excuse in the book has been thrown at the people in Gorey and still they have a school which is below standard.  I detest strikes but I am not surprised at the present unpleasant situation.  By refusing to build the extension we are teaching the children about the advantage of strikes.  It is a pity that it had to go that far.  The parents feel cheated and think that nothing is being done.  It is dangerous even to talk about that extension in Gorey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would ask the Minister to allow the extension for the CBS national school in Gorey to proceed at the earliest date.  Existing accommodation is completely inadequate.  Because of the lack of facilities there has been enormous pressure on teachers, pupils and parents. <Col N="2659" /> The provision of this extension has become a major issue in Gorey.  One of the existing classrooms has an asbestos roof which is a danger to health and it has been in use as far back as the early 'fifties.  That is a scandal.</P>
      <P>A long time has elapsed, something in the region of 11 years, since this programme was first initiated.  I am aware of the problems in obtaining a suitable site. Having decided against a new school the board of management looked for an extension.  Having got a suitable site for the extension it was found that the foundation was built on a quarry and special engineers had to be brought in to assess the suitability of the foundations, and this created further delays.</P>
      <P>A letter has been received from the Minister of State dated 13 November 1986 which says that it is the intention of the Department to start building the school before 1 March 1987.  I call on the Minister to reaffirm that commitment and give an absolute guarantee that the building will commence before that date. Such a commitment would defuse the situation and satisfy the local people.  The local contribution is available.  There is £25,000 lodged in the bank in Gorey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for facilitating this debate and I compliment my colleagues for articulating the case so ably.  No words could amply convey the level of frustration among ordinary people because of the delays.  Unfortunately, now when the Oireachtas Members from Wexford say that it will go ahead, it is not believed because of previous difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenders have been in since 7 July of this year.  It was made clear to the people that there was not any money for the school to be started this year.  We were informed twice when Deputy Kenny visited the school that the first £200,000 available in 1987 would be committed to the extension in Gorey.  A request for a small two roomed extension is a reasonable, modest request.  The Minister now has the opportunity to relieve the feelings of not only the <Col N="2660" /> Oireachtas Members but the whole community in Gorey who are extremely concerned about this and to bring the matter to an end and to say that work will commence on the site prior to 1 March 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>After a few years in the House one has to resist the temptation to be cynical about questions such as this but it is a temptation I can easily resist on this occasion when we have an all-party approach.  I am certain nobody wants to make political advantage out of this.  There can be four contributions in the local papers next week to show a proper concern for this pressing local problem.  I share the Deputies' concern for the state of this school.</P>
      <P>As Deputy D'Arcy said, there were unusual complex engineering problems associated with the planning of this extension. The site was a disused quarry and it was necessary to engage structural engineers at consultant level to advise. These things take time.  There has been no undue delay in this instance.  The planning has proceeded apace, it has been completed and we are now ready for a contract to be placed.  I would reiterate what Deputy Kenny said in his letter of 13 November 1986, that it is our intention that the contract will be placed not later than 1 March next.  The commitment has been given in writing.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Byrne's views about the lack of propriety in having children as young as four years of age engaged in strikes.  I deprecate that action.  I can understand it and I can understand the circumstances in which it was taken. Those circumstances will obviously go some way towards mitigating the inspiration for that action but they do not excuse it.  It is a local issue of some intensity and I can understand local feelings.</P>
      <P>Those protests might be an unseemly example to the community and to the children involved.  There is no need for those protests to be continued because a commitment has been given by my colleague, for whose absence I must apologise as he is on official business.  My colleague gave that commitment a month ago and I now reiterate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2661" /> I have every confidence that the contract will be placed not later than 1 March in the coming year.  I acknowledge the generosity of the local community in providing the local contribution.  It is sometimes forgotten that the State do not own the schools of the nation but that they belong to the communities.  The State merely subvents them and supports them to the greater part of the cost involved. There are many communities with claims on the State, communities with schools in as bad as and in a worse condition than the Gorey school but they have recognised that there is a widespread demand <Col N="2662" /> and that through the taxpayer there is a limit on what the State can be called upon to pay.  In the scheduling of these extensions and repairs the turn of the Gorey school is imminent and I am glad to have the opportunity this evening to reiterate the commitment that it is our intention that this contract will be placed not later than 1 March next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that any individual who wishes to have his-her certificate of tax-free allowances modified for the current year to take account of a reduction in those social welfare benefits which are taxed on an actual basis namely, retirement pensions and contributory old age pensions, should advise his or her inspector of taxes (preferably by means of the <Col N="2486" /> Department of Social Welfare notification &mdash; PEN 65) of the total amount of the reduction in benefit in the period to 5 April 1987.  An amended certificate will then be issued for 1986-87.</P>
      <P>Certain types of social welfare income are taxed in the current year on the basis of the amounts received in the preceding year.  The only social welfare payments in this latter category which are likely to be affected by equalisation are invalidity pensions.  No adjustment of tax-free allowances would, therefore, be due for 1986-87 in these cases.  The pensioners concerned should, however, advise their inspectors of taxes of the amount of the reduction so that the necessary adjustment may be made for the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the difficulties facing the Border counties.  In so far as taxation policies are concerned, the high level of taxation in the country generally, not just in the Border areas, is recognised by the Government.  We are doing our best to rectify this in the context of the public finances generally.  Specifically in relation to excise duties the Government took direct ameliorative action in October 1984 by reducing the level of excise duty on spirits by £1.75 a bottle.  Of course problems other than taxation apply in the Border counties, for example, the fall in the value of sterling and the difficulties north of the Border.  Another factor is smuggling and the Government are doing all in their power to control this.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the various areas of the public service other than the Civil Service is as follows.</P>
      <P>In the education sector, teaching vacancies in national, secondary, community, comprehensive and vocational schools may be filled as they arise, subject to the regulations.  The schemes for the employment of clerk-typists in national schools and secondary schools and caretakers in national schools are being phased out as posts fall vacant and no new posts are being created.  The filling of vacancies in the non-academic staff area of vocational education committees is operated on the basis of the Government policy of filling one in three vacancies as they arise.</P>
      <P>Numbers employed in the health services are controlled through the budgets made available in respect of pay costs contained in the allocations to agencies in respect of non-capital expenditure and any vacancies arising are filled in this context.</P>
      <P>The number of cadets, nurses and &ldquo;other ranks&rdquo; recruited to the Permanent Defence Force each year is determined primarily by the annual financial allocations in the Defence Vote.</P>
      <P>The Government decided, in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>, to fix the upper limit on numbers in the Garda Síochana at 11,400.  Present policy is to recruit to maintain the force at that level.</P>
      <P>The policy in relation to the filling of vacancies in the local authority service is that measures at least equivalent in effect to those in the Civil Service are to apply to local authorities.  Appropriate targets are set for the reduction in officer numbers.

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to the business expansion scheme operated under Chapter III of the Finance Act, 1984 (as amended), and the scheme of relief for investment in research and development provided for in Chapter III of the Finance Act, 1986.</P>
      <P>I am indeed satisfied that these schemes, in conjunction with the other tax incentives introduced or extended in the Finance Act, 1986 for the promotion of wider share ownership and employee participation, are effective.</P>
      <P>Although the business expansion scheme was provided for in the Finance Act, 1984, investments under the scheme were not eligible for relief prior to 1 January 1985.  Despite this restriction, investments of some £1.5 million qualified for relief in the income tax year 1984-85. Further investments of £3.7 million were given relief during the income tax year 1985-86, bringing total investments during the first 15 months of operation of the scheme to £5.2 million.  These investments were made in 39 companies.</P>
      <P>Since 6 April 1986, a further 45 companies have obtained approval for investments of £4.1 million.  Inquiries from another 106 companies are at various stages of processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of relief for investment in research and development does not come into effect until 1 January 1987. However, I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have already had a number of inquiries from interested parties. A strong research and development capability is essential if we are to develop a sound manufacturing base to provide jobs for the future.  The level of research and development activity in this country <Col N="2490" /> is disappointingly low by international standards and I am confident that the incentive scheme will be an effective means of encouraging investment in qualifying projects.</P>

      <P>The youth employment levy was introduced from 6 April 1982.  The health boards are responsible for collecting the <Col N="2491" /> levy from full-time farmers for the two years ended 5 April 1984.  The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for collecting it from part-time farmers and other self-employed for those two years and from all farmers and self-employed for subsequent years.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Department of Health that all the health boards have taken or are in the process of taking legal proceedings to recover amounts which are outstanding from full time farmers for the two years ended 5 April 1984.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioner that demands and reminders are issued to those who are charged with payment.  The next step in collecting outstanding payments would be to have collection enforced either through the courts or the sheriffs.  The arrears for the youth employment levy represent only a tiny fraction of the arrears which arise in the collection process under all tax heads. The resources devoted to the collection of any particular arrears must necessarily reflect the scale of those arrears in the context of all arrears of tax.  Available resources have had to be deployed in the enforcement of much larger sums of tax ourstanding.  It has accordingly not proven practicable up till now, because of overall limitations on staff resources to, at the same time, commence enforcement proceedings in the case of the youth employment levy.  I am having the situation reviewed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware of the press release which I issued yesterday which dealt with the problems in the tax collection system.  As indicated in the press release I am considering proposals in this area as a matter of urgency with a view to improving tax collection.  The objective is to improve the position in relation to all tax collection, including the youth employment levy.</P>

      <P>The task of compiling figures of the amounts of taxes outstanding is undertaken annually by reference to the position at 31 May for publication in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Appropriation Accounts.  The most recent report is for 1984 and the schedules on pages 14-20 of that report show the position as it was at 31 May 1985.  A copy of the 1984 report is available in the Library.</P>
      <P>The amounts of tax, estimated as likely to be collected at 31 May 1985, which had been collected up to 31 May 1986 is £94 million in the case of directly assessed income tax and £117 million in the case of corporation tax.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank and the Economic and Social Research Institute forecast a rise in investment next year.  The expectation is confirmed by other independent forecasting institutions.  This recovery is consistent with the trend in recent years showed a considerable slowing down in the rate of decline.</P>
      <P>The adjustment policies pursued by the Government have contributed to this recovery.  These involve cost efficiency measures including pay moderation as well as public expenditure measures aimed at stimulating investment leading to sustained employment.  In addition, the Government industrial strategy as set out in its White Paper on Industrial Policy and the initiatives already taken are contributing to this recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have devoted considerable resources to the promotion of efficiency and innovation in the economy. Industrial and tourism policies have been re-orientated.  Measures have been introduced, such as the enterprise allowance scheme, to bring unemployed people back to work.  Venture capital is being provided through tax incentives and the newly established National Development Corporation.  Education and training are vital to employment and there has been <Col N="2495" /> significant resources devoted to these areas in recent years.</P>
    <P>Within the public capital programme expenditure has been reallocated to concentrate on investment which leads to sustained additional employment.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that high interest rates are a serious constraint on fixed investment formation.  The progress in reducing inflation and the current balance of payments deficit together with the Government's policy of halting the increase in its debt have created a facourable underlying interest rate climate. When the present market pressures abate, this favourable interest rate climate should again allow domestic interest rates to fall to more normal levels.  Further progress in reducing interest rates will depend on how quickly we reduce the present excessive level of Government borrowing.</P>

      <P>The latest external trade data available relate to October 1986.  Exports in that month were valued at £790 million and imports at £784 million.  There was a trade surplus for the month of £6 million. For the first ten months of 1986 exports and imports were valued at £7,698 million and £7,153 million respectively.  There was, therefore, a trade surplus of £545 million in the period compared with a surplus of £229 million for the same period last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results for this period represent a continuation of the favourable balance of <Col N="2496" /> trade trend of recent years and confirm the Government's expectation of a further significant improvement for this year as a whole compared with 1985.  There has been a substantial improvement in the balance of trade since 1981 when the trade deficit reached 16½ per cent of GNP. This was virtually eliminated by 1984 and in 1985 there was an actual surplus of 2% of GNP.  The 1985 surplus was the first recorded in 40 years.</P>
    <P>Improvement in the terms of trade was a major factor underlying the increased trade surplus to date in 1986.  Import prices have declined sharply under the influence of lower oil prices and the appreciation of the Irish pound against the US dollar and sterling.  Lower imported input costs together with keener competition on export markets have led to a decline in export prices, but of a lesser magnitude, resulting in an overall terms of trade improvement of about 3½ per cent.</P>

            <entry>(x) No project should be considered for inclusion in the PCP unless it satisfies the criteria of Circular 1/83.  There should be more stringent controls and less discretion allowed to Departments in interpretation of the guidelines laid down therein.</entry>
            <entry>The guidelines are by their nature flexible instruments designed to allow the bodies to which they apply to put them into operation in a way that best suits particular programmes.  The circular acknowledges that the size and nature of projects must inevitably influence the extent to which the steps outlined in the circular are applied.  The Committee's emphasis on a much more central role for the Department of Finance in capital project appraisal seems to be both inflexible and unwieldy and unnecessarily and excessively bureaucratic.  In addition it would undermine the important principle that line management in spending Departments should be accountable for implementation of the guidelines.</entry>

      <P>It was decided by an appeals officer on 22 May 1986 that the persons concerned are not entitled to old age pensions as they do not fulfil the statutory condition with regard to means.  The assessment of their means each consisting of the weekly value of ? intestacy share in a holding exceed the statutory limit of £48.00 weekly for entitlement to pensions.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is receiving invalidity pension at the rate of £72.35, that is £47.10 personal rate, a special temporary rate of £20 and an increase of £5.25 for one qualified child. His wife is receiving disability benefit and under the equality provisions for men and women in social welfare matters he is no longer entitled to be paid for her as an adult dependant and he is only entitled to be paid half the child dependant allowance. He is however, being paid an additional temporary payment of £20 on a transitional basis.</P>
      <P>His wife now has an equal right with him to claim for their child and her disability benefit has been increased from £41.10 to £45.80.  The rates of disability benefit payable to married women were increased last May under the first phase of the equal treatment provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the national fuel <Col N="2517" /> scheme in Dublin, that the application for a fuel allowance of the person concerned has been refused on the grounds that he does not fulfil the living alone condition.  A person must be either living alone or with a qualified adult dependant or any other person who is in receipt of a qualifying payment under the scheme. His wife is in receipt of disability benefit which is not a qualifying payment under the scheme.</P>
