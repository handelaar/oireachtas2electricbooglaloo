      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 33 and 2.  Private Members' Business, No 53, motion No. 72, shall be taken between 7 p.m. and 8.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not agreeing with the Order of Business.  I do not propose to dwell on it at any length, but we were anxious that No. 33 should be taken first this morning, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985, Second Stage.  That Bill has been before the Oireachtas since February.  It deals with a very urgent social problem, namely, homeless persons.  We do not award any particular priority to item No. 1, the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill, 1986, because we feel that has been introduced for the purpose of gaining political kudos more than anything else.  We are pressing the Government to take No. 33 first because there is a serious social problem, particularly in urban areas, in regard to homeless persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have proposed business in this way, sharing the Opposition's concern to get rid of business as rapidly as possible.  When we have dealt with <Col N="644" /> No. 1 we should be able to get on with No. 33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a debate on this.  I gather from what has been said that there have been discussions between the parties and that agreement on how the business should be taken has not been reached.  In these circumstances the matter is governed by and I am bound by Standing Order No. 25 which reads:</P>
      <P>Every sitting of the Dáil shall be governed by a printed Order Paper which shall be prepared under the direction of the Ceann Comhairle.  The Taoiseach shall have the right to determine the order in which Government business shall appear on the Order Paper and, by announcement at the commencement of public business, the order in which it shall be taken each day.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will see that the Chair is bound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Our complaint is not with the Chair but with the Government. It is quite clear that if this Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission piece of nonsense is taken first the Housing Bill will not be reached today.  Am I right in thinking that the House has to agree to this Order of Business which is not in conformity with normal Standing Orders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Order No. 25 governs the matter.  It is quite clear, but I will repeat the relevant portion of it:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach shall have the right to determine the order in which Government business shall appear on the Order Paper and, by announcement at the commencement of public business, the order in which it shall be taken each day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>So your ruling is that the matter is entirely one for the Government and that if the Government persist in this Order of Business that is the Order <Col N="645" /> of Business.  I would make one final point. I appeal to the Government, in the interest of homeless persons, to reverse the Order of Business and take No. 33 first.  That is a suggestion to the Government and if they do not wish to take it that is not my fault.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could explain Standing Orders to Deputy Haughey.  The allocation of time for Private Members' time is a matter for him and his party, not for me, or for you, or for the Taoiseach.  Therefore, there is no reason for him to oppose the Bill unless he opposes its concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My position on the matter is quite simple.  The amount of Private Members' time is strictly limited. It is the only opportunity the Opposition have to deal with urgent economic and social matters.  I have no idea what is proposed in this Bill and I cannot at this Stage agree to six hours of Private Members' time in a very short session going to something I know nothing about.</P>

      <P>It is most regrettable that the House does not have agreement on the Order of Business.  It is most unusual and unfortunate.  Could I ask the Taoiseach whether it is the Government's <Col N="648" /> intention to conclude Item No. 53, Motion 72, at 8.30 p.m. this evening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to a report which appeared in the Sunday newspapers with regard to the reorganisation of Dáil committees.  When these committees were first set up, they were set up by agreement following negotiations between the Opposition and the Government.  Apparently, the Minister of State has had second thoughts about this procedure and in an interview with <i>The Sunday Press</i> he indicated that a document has been prepared for the Government which recommends abolishing all the existing House committees and reorganising the system in favour of three or four new committees.  That is most unique.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It should arise now, a Cheann Comhairle, because the committee system has been put across as a very important part of Dáil reform.  Now, the system is being abolished and we have not been consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If this legislation is passed, it can be raised here.  Would this <Col N="649" /> not be analogous to the promise of legislation to effect a major reform of Dáil procedure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on the Order of Business.  I have explained not once but on numerous occasions what may and may not be raised on the Order of Business.  If everything that was sought to be raised on the Order of Business were allowed, the House would never get past the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, a Cheann Comhairle.  You know we are always very attentive to your rulings on these matters but this is something slightly different.  It does not come within the normal realm of our procedures.  It is a purported proposal by the Government to abolish all committees of the House.  Surely, there must <Col N="650" /> be some way whereby I can ask the Government about the matter.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasingly in recent years, concern has been expressed by many representative bodies and individuals regarding the degree of urban decay in Dublin city centre.  The Government <Col N="652" /> have recognised this problem and have responded by launching a special programme of tax incentives to promote urban renewal not only in Dublin but in designated areas in all our major cities. In Dublin large areas of the quays, north and south, as well as a considerable portion of the north inner city have already been designated as urban renewal areas with special incentives designed to promote investment in the construction and reconstruction of buildings.  In addition, the Custom House Docks Development Authority will be established on 17 November next to develop this important site on the north quays.  Further details regarding each of those major initiatives were given by the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, at a conference in Taylor's Hall yesterday afternoon. These are regarded as extremely important initiatives and I am convinced they will have a major impact in arresting the decay in these areas.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one area above all others which for very many people is synonymous with Dublin, that area is O'Connell Street.  This street, and the other main shopping thoroughfares, are the areas by which most people, Dubliners and visitors alike, identify our capital city in their minds' eye.  This area is their yardstick for forming their opinions of Dublin.  Regrettably much of this central and important area now shows visible signs of decay, of insensitive and thoughtless development and change of use, of tasteless advertising and a continuous growth of ugly plastic facades.  Problems of litter, of lack of security and excessive traffic have all contributed to a degradation of the environment of this area.</P>
    <P>It is now time for all concerned to take a hard look at what has been happening to the centre of our capital city.  The area should be a showpiece of architectural sensitivity and environmental awareness but we have instead created a soulless environment which is neither attractive nor pleasant.  The present condition of the city centre leads to a general attitude of carelessness and lack of concern on the part of developers, commercial interests and the public generally and a fall off <Col N="653" /> in business in the area.  I believe that enlightened thinking and imaginative decision making is badly needed to revive the heart of the metropolis and to make the surroundings in Dublin city centre area more pleasant for visitors and tourists, as well as for Dubliners themselves.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before this House was first published last June and received a widescale welcome and support from a variety of bodies, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the Dublin City Centre Business Association and Bord Fáilte, to name but a few.  I think it is worth recording for the House exactly what some of these bodies said concerning this initiative.  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce said and I quote:</P>
    <P>Dublin Chamber of Commerce welcomes unreservedly the announcement by the Minister for the Environment of a Metropolitan Streets Commission for Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Chamber urged the establishment of a city centre authority as far back as 1978.  Focusing resources in a specific problem area such as this is an imaginative approach to environment management.  The Commission's integrated brief could well provide a model for tackling other infrastructural problems.</P>
    <P>The Dublin City Centre Business Association said about these proposals and again I quote:</P>
    <P>Our Association believes that something must be done to get the people involved together in the City and we have fully welcomed your proposals. We shall be doing everything possible to try to persuade all those concerned to look on your proposals in a nonpolitical manner and as a genuine effort to get something done for our national capital.  We also believe that it is necessary to encourage both public servants and those involved in private enterprise to work together to try to solve the problems which are bedraggling our city.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to have the legislation enacted before the summer recess but this target was frustrated for reasons <Col N="654" /> which, I am afraid, baffle me and, as a result, valuable time has been lost.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission for a three year period.  The general duty of this commission will be to secure an improvement in environmental conditions, in the level of civic amenity and in the standard of civic design in the metropolitan central area.  This area is defined in the First Schedule to the Bill as that part of the centre of Dublin running from O'Connell Street through Westmoreland Street, D'Olier Street and College Green to Grafton Street.  It is an area which provides prime shopping facilities but should also be a suitable place for Dubliners and visitors to congregate for the simple purpose of enjoyment.</P>
    <P>Anybody familiar with the occasional efforts by Dublin Corporation and other organisations to provide concerts, street carnival or lunch time recitals in the area will appreciate how people can be attracted to come to the centre of the city and use its facilities but we need to do far more than this to revive the area.  In particular, we must restore the physical fabric of the area to a condition that befits its status.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, for many people, O'Connell Street is synonymous with Dublin but this fine thoroughfare has, unfortunately, quite steadily declined over the years.  Some of its famous old landmarks have disappeared and the frontages of many of the buildings are, I am afraid, living proof that planning control does not always work.  We have failed to make the best use of the enormous 150 foot width of O'Connell Street where the central median or island has enormous potential.  The importance of this median was emphasised in my own party's 1981 policy document on Dublin which proposed the development of a magnificent pedestrian mall in the centre of O'Connell Street, running from the Parnell monument to the O'Connell monument, and adequately protected from traffic.  This mall would be tastefully landscaped and planted and contain shopping kiosks and open air cafe facilities. There would be carefully designed <Col N="655" /> street furnishings and special decorative lighting to encourage the night time use and enjoyment of this new leisure mall in Dublin's city centre.  In addition, a fountain or other special feature was proposed as a focal point.  All of this can and I hope will be achieved, and within a reasonable time scale, under the special provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to set up the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission is a recognition of the fact that urgent action and a concentration of resources is needed if the revitalisation of the city centre area is to be successfully achieved.  The commission are being established for a three year period with a mandate to secure an improvement in the general appearance and condition of the metropolitan central area.  Their functions will relate to pedestrianisation, traffic and car parking arrangements, road repair, streetscapes, building facades, advertising signs, street cleansing, litter, amenity facilities and street furniture generally.  In effect, the commission will assume the litter prevention and road cleansing and repair functions of Dublin Corporation and the traffic management functions which were to be assigned to the Dublin Transport Authority for the area.</P>
    <P>The commission will have power to require property owners to remove or alter any structure, or any structure of a particular class, and to provide suitable replacements, if appropriate.  They will have power also to require property owners, where this is in the interests of the amenity and general improvements of the area, to discontinue any use and to remove, alter, repair or tidy any advertisement or advertisement structure. These powers will enable the commission, having assessed the quality of the architectural fabric in the area, to deal with buildings whose facades produce functional and visual conflicts which impinge on the appearance of the area or to tackle uses which are inappropriate in the area.  These are important powers as changes in some structures and uses seem inevitable in order to upgrade the area <Col N="656" /> generally.  However, I should like to emphasise that this power is not likely to be widely used and there need be no fears concerning needless closure of premises or putting people out of business.</P>
    <P>I expect that many of these changes will come about through a process of discussion and negotiation and that property owners will come to accept that it will be of direct benefit to them to co-operate in early implementation of the commission's improvement scheme.  I also anticipate that the effect of peer pressure will be considerable, as it has been in certain other areas where attempts have been made to improve the fabric of inner urban areas.  Compensation will be payable, where necessary, for loss suffered as a result of the removal or alteration of an authorised structure or the discontinuance of an authorised use.</P>
    <P>The commission will have a duty to prepare an improvement scheme for the area outlining the measures needed to renew and improve the area.  This scheme will re-inforce and complement the planning system.  All development in the area, whether carried out by the commission or by other persons, will be exempted development for the purposes of the Planning Acts where it is certified to be consistent with an improvement scheme prepared and approved under section 6. For other developments, Dublin Corporation or An Bord Pleanála, in determining a planning application relating to development in the area, must have regard to the provisions of an improvement scheme and permission for a proposed development may not be granted without the consent of the commission, if it would materially contravene the provisions of that scheme.  The consent of the commission may also be required before permission is granted for development which is of a class specified in regulations made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The commission will have up to seven members.  It will receive up to £10 million from State funds over the three years of its life.  It will also receive a contribution in lieu of expenses which would normally <Col N="657" /> have been incurred by the corporation in the area, for example, on litter prevention or street cleansing.  After three years, the commission will be dissolved and its functions will transfer back to Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Transport Authority.  It is the intention, however, that the area should retain a special status and with that in mind the provision in section 2 (3) of the Bill will remain as a permanent feature of the law. Under this section, Dublin Corporation, in the discharge of their functions, must have regard to the special importance, in the national interest, of the metropolitan central area and to the need in that interest to ensure a high environmental standard and a high standard of civic amenity and civic design in the area.  In this way, the work of the commission will endure and be preserved.</P>
    <P>There has been already a suggestion that the Bill poses a threat to local democracy. I am satisfied, however, that it presents no such threat and would like again to take the opportunity to clarify matters concerning the role of Dublin Corporation.  The corporation carry a heavy burden in generally administering local services in the county borough as a whole.  It is a multi-faceted authority which has a variety of responsibilities and I see great merit in establishing a single purpose, single function authority with a clearcut mandate, budget and timescale and in transferring to that authority from a multi-purpose authority such as Dublin Corporation particular tasks in order that a specific objective can be attained.</P>
    <P>The Metropolitan Streets Commission is needed to give a once-off boost to the area and provide the necessary concentration of resources.  This part of the city is a national asset &mdash; going well beyond the needs or concerns of Dubliners alone &mdash; and deserves immediate and special attention if progress is to be made towards the desired regeneration. The corporation will have a major part to play in assisting the commission in the implementation of its functions and specific arrangements can be made for co-operation between the two bodies. Indeed while I am on this point, I have <Col N="658" /> already stated my intention to invite the Dublin city manager to become a member of the commission in order to bring his expert knowledge and wide expertise to the deliberations of the commission and to encourage a good working relationship between the commission and corporation.  There is also no question of a permanent erosion of powers: after three years, the powers assigned from the corporation to the commission will be transferred back to Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the proposal to establish the commission has been welcomed by business representatives in the area, by tourist and environmental groups and by the public at large.  I hope &mdash; and indeed feel confident &mdash; that these groups, particularly the business community, will co-operate fully with the commission.  Their response will be a crucial factor in securing the objectives of the improvement scheme for the area. But the response of the public at large will be equally important and if the right ambience is created it will heighten respect and awareness for this area and it will generate a momentum for urban renewal and pride in the city.</P>
    <P>A detailed explanatory memorandum has already been circulated with the Bill and I do not therefore propose to deal at this stage with all of the individual sections.  It is appropriate, however, to draw attention to the main operative provisions in sections 6 to 12.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the commission shall prepare an improvement scheme or schemes for the area.  The scheme or schemes will be a blueprint for action and will require the approval of the Minister. All development that is carried out in the area by the commission itself and all other development which is certified by the commission to be consistent with an improvement scheme prepared and approved under the section will be exempted development for the purposes of the Planning Acts.  Other development in the area requiring planning permission must not materially contravene the provisions of a scheme made and approved under the section unless the commission consents.  The section also provides that <Col N="659" /> the Minister may prescribe certain types of development for which permission may not be granted without the consent of the commission.</P>
    <P>In preparing an improvement scheme the commission will consult with Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Transport Authority, have regard to the development plan made by Dublin Corporation under the 1963 Act and make arrangements for the making of submissions by interested persons in relation to the scheme which will be considered by the commission.  There is, therefore, a reasonable opportunity afforded to Dublin Corporation to influence development in which the commission is involved and also the views of other interested persons will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the transfer from Dublin Corporation to the commission of all functions in relation to the construction, maintenance and improvement of public roads in the metropolitan central area.  This will, for example, enable the commission to introduce pedestrianised areas, with special paving or better quality footpaths if they consider these to be needed.  Section 8 provides for the transfer of a variety of traffic management functions in the metropolitan central area from the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Dublin Transport Authority to the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 9 will confer on the commission the powers available to local authorities in relation to refuse collection and litter prevention and control.  This is an important provision as it is imperative that whatever measures are needed should be taken to counter the litter problem and to provide a refuse collection and removal service more appropriate to conditions in the area.</P>
    <P>Section 11 will enable the commission to serve a notice requiring the removal or alteration of a structure, the discontinuance of a use, or the removal, alteration, repair or tidying of an advertisement structure or advertisement where this is provided for in an improvement scheme which has been made and <Col N="660" /> approved under section 6.  In the event of failure on the part of the owner to comply with a notice under the section, the commission may enter on the land and carry out the specified works itself and, where the structure is unauthorised, recover the cost from the owners.  Continuance of a use in contravention of a notice will be an offence, the penalty for which, on summary conviction, will be a fine not exceeding £1,000.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in section 11 in relation to compensation are based entirely on corresponding provisions in the 1963 Planning Act and are the minimum necessary having regard to the constitutional provisions relating to private property.  Compensation will only be payable where a person who is an owner or occupier of a structure in the metropolitan central area is served with a notice under section 11 and suffers damage by compliance with the notice.  Compensation will only be payable in the case of authorised structures or uses.  There will be no payments in respect of premises outside the area.</P>
    <P>I do not expect that there will be great need for the use of section 11 as I expect that there will be a good deal of co-operation from owners in improving premises at their own expense.  I do not, therefore, envisage that a significant proportion of the commission's resources will be absorbed by compensation payments. However, as a safeguard against the likelihood of large compensation claims, I will be using my powers under sections 10 (8) and 12 of the Bill to give a directive to the commission on the need, in operating section 11, to consider the possible consequences of their actions and the limited resources available to them.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the making of grants of up to £10 million to the commission, to cover the costs of improvement works in the area.</P>
    <P>In addition, the commission will, under section 12 (3), receive an agreed contribution from Dublin Corporation in lieu of expenses that would otherwise have been incurred by them in the metropolitan central area.  This would be in <Col N="661" /> respect of, for example, litter control or refuse collection activities in the area which would be carried out by the commission instead of the corporation.  There is provision for the determination by the Minister of the amount involved in the event of any disagreement.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill and one which I believe should be passed into law as quickly as possible.  There is an urgent need, recognised by virtually everybody, to enhance the quality of the centre of the capital city and I am convinced that the establishment of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission is the best way to achieve this.  It is long past the time for action to replace words and I consequently strongly commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As a party, Fianna Fáil have always supported any and all practical plans for the improvement of the Dublin region.  We see the region as one whose character has dramatically changed especially over the past 15 years. The development of the so-called &ldquo;new towns&rdquo;, and the changing character of the inner surburbs and inner city have brought special problems to this region. When we add the region's soaring unemployment and emigration, we see the Coalition's dismal failure in the Dublin region to renew our city and to give hope to its people.</P>
      <P>Part of the reason for this failure is reflected in this Bill.  The Bill proposes a commission for the Grafton Street-O'Connell Street spine.  In itself, we believe it is essential that the area is improved but it is unrealistic to improve this area in isolation from the other areas of Dublin.  This central area does not exist in isolation from the others and unless and until plans for this area are integrated into plans for the region as a whole, improvement will not only be piecemeal but lopsided.  It is unrealistic to propose that this central spine has a function which is isolated from the city and county as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This streets Bill must be examined against the background of the continued refusal by this Coalition to allow Dublin's <Col N="662" /> local authorities to prepare an integrated development programme for the region. In October 1984 a draft application for the grant of financial assistance by the European Commission in respect of a preparatory study for an integrated operation relating to the Dublin sub-region was prepared and submitted to the Department of the Environment.  A reply was received to the effect that the submission of an application for aid for a study proposal would not be appropriate at that stage, the position regarding the concept of integrated development operations having been restated in Dáil Éireann by the Minister for Finance on 31 October 1985.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply followed on a question from Deputy Niall Andrews. Deputy Niall Andrews asked the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes in view of the reply by the Commissioner of the European Parliament on 23 October 1984 indicating that he was favourably disposed to any submission from the Government to an integrated development plan for Dublin, if he would now put before the commission proposals for such a plan as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
    <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a question put by Mrs. Lemass, MEP, in the European Parliament answered by Commissioner Burke on 23 October, 1984.  I have considerable reservations regarding the introduction of an integrated development plan for Dublin, or indeed for any limited geographical area of the country, as I have already indicated in my reply to similar questions.  Ireland is treated as a single region for purposes of Community regional policy and the financial assistance received from the Community under the Community's European Regional Development Fund is used mainly to finance national programmes of infrastructural expenditure which benefit the country as a whole.  The development needs of a particular area of the country must therefore be considered in the context of overall national priorities.  Integrated development <Col N="663" /> plans of the type in question would have the effect of diverting scarce financial resources from other expenditure programmes and would lead to serious distortions in the pattern of public expenditure which is based on these priorities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the financial participation by the Community in integrated operations of this kind would be by means of existing Community funds and would not result in an increase in assistance to Ireland from those funds.  I am certainly aware of and I share the Deputies concern regarding problems which Dublin is facing at the moment but I consider these problems have to be dealt with within the context of the Government's overall national priorities.</P>
    <P>In other words, in no way would Dublin's local authorities be allowed to make application for funds even to carry on the study.  Despite that reply in the Dáil, the matter was further pursued following the passing of a resolution by the city council on 10 June 1985, following which the Department reiterated the position of the Department of Finance and stated that an application for funding could not be pursued at that time.  Following the March 1986 visit to the EEC headquarters by the then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alderman Jim Tunney, myself as Chairman of Dublin County Council and Councillor Bill Harvey as Cathaoirleach of Dun Laoghaire, the matter was again taken up with the Department of the Environment, particularly since there now appeared to be a strong emphasis in Brussels on the desirability of integrated operations.</P>
    <P>I could not emphasise enough to the House this morning the change that had taken place and the emphasis placed in Brussels on the whole concept of the desirability of integrated programmes.  It was really frustrating to listen to the European representatives on the regional fund policy with Mr. Mathysen, Director General, and other officials telling us that they were quite prepared to assist Dublin financially in the preparation of a study for an integrated programme but they <Col N="664" /> could not get the sanction of our Department of Finance for such a study.  Let me put this in context.  The cost of this study, when the original application was made to the Department in 1984 was £160,000. The study today would cost approximately £200,000.  There is available 75 per cent finance from the EC for the cost of carrying out the study for an integrated programme.  The EC were asking us to get our Departments and our Government to unplug the block they had for the application for the study, that the EC would pay three-quarters of the cost and all they would ask the Department of Finance to put forward would be £50,000 to carry out this programme.  We still have not secured the sanction of the Departments of the Environment and of Finance, or this Government, just for the cost of this study not the programme itself.</P>
    <P>When we came back from Brussels we prepared a report, a copy of which was forwarded to the Department of the Environment with a request to have the matter reviewed so that any necessary approvals to the undertaking of a preparatory study on the basis proposed would be obtained.  No action was taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil believe that all funding, whether local, national or European, should be spent on projects within the structure of an integrated operation, as opposed to the haphazard way in which things are done at present.  This haphazardness is the root of Dublin's problems and is going to be further exacerbated by the Bill we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil cannot welcome the implications of the Bill.  If any policy is to work it must have the people with it.  It will fail if it cannot inspire confidence from the people on the ground.  By shutting out Dublin Corporation, the Coalition are once again proving their contempt for the local community and their contempt for local democracy.</P>
    <P>Last week we saw this Government deny the people of Donegal their democratic right to representation in Dáil Éireann.  Here in this Bill we again see <Col N="665" /> this Coalition denying democracy, this time in relation to Dublin Corporation. We have ludicrous proposals whereby Dublin Corporation will have first, to cede their functions in relation to road traffic and litter.  Already it has been proposed to devolve the road traffic element of responsibility of Dublin Corporation to the Dublin Transportation Authority. A chairman has been appointed have not yet authority but the authority have not yet operated.  However before they get going their powers are, in turn, to be taken over by the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, heaping confusion on confusion. That is what this legislation is about.</P>
    <P>The corporation will also have to cede the use of its premises, equipment and the services of its employees to the commission. Again, it is an insult to the corporation to requisition its facilities and staff, regardless of the corporation's own functions and responsibilities.  Moreover, the Minister makes no mention of who is going to pay for these &ldquo;borrowings&rdquo;. Does he expect the hard-pressed local authority to pick up the tab for his grand designs?  These grand designs worry me, given the Coalition's previous record.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, referred to a policy programme that was issued by his party when he was spokesman for the Environment prior to the 1981 elections. I was surprised to hear him mention that. I thought that as it has been buried for the past five years and there was such embarrassment about it it would never be mentioned on his side of the House again.  In 1981 the Minister was promising a Tivoli gardens in central Dublin and also a water boat service along the river Liffey.  These are the sort of proposals that were given in the grand design in 1981.  Against such a background of the gondolas for the river Liffey it is even more desirable that this Bill must allow for an input by the corporation into the decisions of the commission, whether they relate to its policy or planning.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of this Bill, after the life-span of the commission, the corporation will be expected to assume the liabilities, including outstanding legal <Col N="666" /> proceedings, to which the commission is a party, but for which the corporation has not been responsible.  The corporation is also expected to cede to an unelected commission taxpayers money, again without the corporation having any input into the projects on which these revenues are to be spent.  Indeed, the Minister is going a step further by proposing that where there is disagreement between the commission and the corporation, the Minister shall determine the corporation's contribution.  So, what we have here is not only the superseding of the corporation in relation to both policy and finances by an unelected commission, but the assumption by the Coalition of the responsibilities and prerogatives of local government while, at the same time, leaving the corporation to carry the can if things do not work out.  At that time when local government is already being driven into the ground by the Coalition, Fianna Fáil opposes the Minister's proposals to intrude further on corporation finances.</P>
    <P>This question of financial arrangements is of paramount importance in relation to whether or not the direct payment of a special grant of £10 million or thereabouts &mdash; over the lifetime of the programme &mdash; to the commission will affect the rate subvention grant paid to Dublin Corporation.  It is ludicrous for the Minister to say that he will give £10 million to Dublin Corporation when he and his Government already took back between £8 million and £9 million from Dublin Corporation in the 1986 Estimates. Will this £10 million affect the rate subvention grant paid to Dublin Corporation? Will Dublin Corporation be paid the same level of grant as county councils in the future or will the corporation's grant be less the amount allocated to the commission?  The Minister should reply to this.</P>
    <P>Section 11 enables the commission to serve notices for the removal of structures, the discontinuance of use or the removal or tidying of advertisement structures.  There is no reference to enforcement or to the sanctions which may apply in the event of non-compliance. <Col N="667" /> If it is intended to confer by order the enforcement powers of Dublin Corporation on the commission, then the planning position becomes even more complex as the planning authority will still be Dublin Corporation but the enforcing authority for some matters may be the board.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Bill takes a very flippant attitude to planning in that the proposals will have an existence over and outside existing and potential development plans.  There is no reference anywhere in this Bill to the existing development plans of Dublin Corporation or to the ongoing reviews of such plans.  It is hardly flattering to Dublin Corporation and to the experience and expertise of its officials and elected representatives merely to send them a copy of improvement schemes, without the right to consultation or to modification within the corporation's carefully assessed overall plans for the city.</P>
    <P>In regard to the overall plans for the city I ask the Minister to let us know about possible compensation claims.  This is a very important area.  For example, if the sole reason for the refusal of a planning application was that the development would be at variance with the commission's improvement scheme, a compensation claim could be lodged against Dublin Corporation and not against the commission.  It is not clear whether it is the intention that the commission carry the liability of such a claim out of their Government grant or whether the claim would slip back to Dublin Corporation.  The whole question of possible compensation claims arising out of the difference between the commission's strategy and the overall development plans of the corporation is a very grey area.  It would be beneficial if the Minister expanded on that area.</P>
    <P>The intent of this Bill is not only to give the corporation a back seat but to completely shut out the democratically elected corporation of the city.  If the Minister is intent, which he obviously is, with proceeding with this cosmetic measure, let him include among the <Col N="668" /> nominees to the commission representatives from the corporation.  By that I mean representatives of the elected members of the corporation.  The Minister said in his speech that he is inviting the city manager to be a member of the commission.  Members of the local authority should have the right to nominate a number of members of this commission.</P>

      <P>The precedent is there in the proposed structures of the Dublin Transport Authority.  I know it may be inconvenient for Deputy Kelly that there is such a body as Dublin Corporation and that the electors in this city decided to elect a corporation.  Maybe he would prefer that the affairs of the city would be run by just one overlord with no responsibilities and in no way liable to the controls of the democratically elected members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was unsatisfactory then and what Deputy Kelly is suggesting now would also be unsatisfactory.  I suggest to the Minister that the future of local democracy depends on the inclusion of nominees of the elected members of the corporation.  If he wants to elect the city manager as well that is his business. The precedent which the Government set by the establishment of a Dublin Transport Authority should be followed.  The elected members of the corporation should have the right to nominate their representatives onto the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the ordinary citizen is also put into a limbo state through this Bill.  The Bill states that if a particular structure does not conform to the commission's diktat for the area, the owner is liable to change course in accordance with the commission's wishes.  There is no provision for appeal; neither is there any provision for consultation with the residents from the area.  The businesses of this area are established and many reflect their own particular history and <Col N="669" /> development.  Surely their commitment and attachment to this area should not be dismissed in such a cavalier fashion. There should be a provision for consultation with the people involved as well as with the local authority, Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>In relation to both policy and finances, therefore, the thrust of this Bill is to create a cocoon-like commission, divorced from the local authority and reflecting ministerial directives, as is clearly stated in section 12.  The Bill is an example of a good idea that has been compromised by a flaw that is fundamental to this Government: a total disregard for local government and a total lack of encouragement to people on the ground to get involved in developing their local area.</P>
    <P>The reality of this Bill is an affront to both the citizens of central Dublin and to their democratically-elected corporation. As well as that it is very much a PR hype on behalf of the Minister.  Nothing illustrated that more clearly than the fact that last week we on this side of the House indicated clearly to the Taoiseach &mdash;and he took note not only of the observations of this side of the House but of those of one of his own backbenchers &mdash; that the priority Bill from the Department of the Environment in this session should be the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, being, as it is, on the Order Paper now since early 1985.  As we are only part way through Second Stage and in view of the fact that hundreds of people are living in homeless conditions in this city, our priority on this side of the House was that we should do something constructive in an administrative way to help those people by passing the Homeless (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  Last week the Simon Community sat outside this House trying to highlight the plight of the homeless of this city, but this Government are more interested in the PR hype of this cosmetic legislation than in giving the priority to those who are very badly in need, the homeless.</P>
    <P>When I mention PR hype let us not forget what the Minister brought up at the time he introduced the Bill in June <Col N="670" /> last, the various welcomes given to it.  As part of the PR hype he mentioned we were going to have Garda kiosks on O'Connell Street.  Of course, in the last week or ten days I read that the Garda authorities emphasise that any question of providing Garda kiosks or boxes or points along the street was being investigated but that investigations were at a preliminary stage.  Anybody in this House who has been involved with administration knows that when something is at a preliminary stage it will never see the light of day, and that is what is happening here.  Cosmetic legislation is all this is; it is a PR hype.  Our view is that this proposal, which consciously replaces the people on the ground by a group of ministerial appointees, will serve the interests of neither.  Dublin will not be revitalised by isolated proposals such as we have in this Bill.  It will be revitalised only by adopting an integrated plan for the whole of the Dublin region and by ensuring a direct role for the people and their local authorities in such a plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister's speech with interest and agreement for the most part, though I could not help a wry smile when I heard him refer to the O'Connell Street area as a national asset. It must be the only physical national asset in a capital city that I would drive two miles out of my way to avoid if bringing a visitor from the airport.  It is the centre of a crumbling, decaying, revolting dog's breakfast of a capital city that would make you weep on your return to it from even the humblest town on the European continent &mdash; I will not say in Britain because British standards are not a great deal different from ours in that regard although I think not even the British have anything to show comparable to this capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Minister's Bill is praiseworthy and I support it fully in spirit &mdash; not altogether in the letter &mdash; in that he intends to make this national asset what the words suggest it should be.  I will admit, as Deputy Ray Burke seemed to want the House to admit, that the Bill is a vote of no confidence in Dublin Corporation. <Col N="671" /> It is an invitation to the Dáil &mdash; the Seanad has already accepted the invitation &mdash; to vote no confidence in Dublin Corporation in their planning and enforcement procedures and in their ancillary functions in regard to litter and other more marginal matters.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to say something which is provoked by what Deputy Burke was saying.  In so far as the Minister proposes to exclude the corporation from the task of making what should be a national asset into a national asset he is absolutely, unquestionably, 100 per cent right.  I do not want to be unfair to officials of the corporation or to individual members elected to the corporation.  I have no doubt that many of them &mdash; I am willing to say most, nearly all of them &mdash; mean well and would like to produce a capital city of which this country could be proud, and I do not mean just the people living in Dublin but also the people living in Ballinskelligs, Farranfore and Eyeries because it is their capital city too.  In trying to do that he has excluded the corporation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unfair to anyone in the corporation.  Any dealings I have ever had with corporation officials have been marked on their side always with courtesy and goodwill, but who is the average citizen to blame when he looks around and sees the desolation which this capital city contains?  I suppose you can blame the Irish people themselves for being insufficiently sensitive to the fact that they are ankle deep in their own litter or to the decay of buildings or to bushes and trees, the seacha growing out of the top of 18th century buildings.  They do not mind these things or are willing to live with them.  In a broad sense one can say we are all to blame because we are willing to put up with this.  We do not like to speak the hard word, we do not like to tell somebody not to smoke in a non-smoking area or not to drop litter when we see somebody emptying an ashtray out of a car.  None of us likes to do that.  There is a general disinclination to adhere to standards, a general cowardice about insisting on their maintenance.  To that <Col N="672" /> extent we are all to blame.  Focusing it to a somewhat narrower lens it could be said that successive Governments are to blame.</P>
    <P>The Stalinist monotone that is Deputy Burke's usual method of declamation &mdash; quite different, let me say before I make an enemy of him, from his very agreeable persona to meet and talk to outside the House &mdash; of his blaming the other side and patting his own side on the back was seldom seen to be less appropriate than this morning.  He squarely blamed the Coalition for the decay of Dublin city.  So we have been complaining about this city ever since I was a student, and probably long before, except I was not conscious of it.  Many of the things which are the most shocking and strident examples of official vandalism, and not merely carelessness or litter dropping, are directly attributable to official decisions taken during periods of Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I do not want to answer Deputy Burke back in his own coin, but let me remind him that that &mdash; as I think I formerly called it in here &mdash; capsized egg box in Fitzwilliam Street which contains the ESB headquarters was put up in the teeth of the peaceful advice and campaigning &mdash; no one held a pistol to the Government's head &mdash; of every conservationist group, of every association of architects and people in the county who might be expected to know something about these things, and they were simply walked on.  When the thing finally went up, remorse began to set in.  The softer hearts on the Fianna Fáil benches began to relent.  Deputy Lenihan, when he was Minister for Power, or whatever the thing was then called &mdash; one has to grasp at the title of the Department quickly these days before it is changed &mdash; paid an official visit to the building.  Even he stood appalled by it and, humble though his contribution in aesthetic terms may have been in trying to ameliorate the situation, at least he made it.  He said: &ldquo;Would you think of putting a lick of whitewash on it?  Would you think of taking a bucket of whitewash and see could you brighten it up that way?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> When I hear Deputy Burke going on about the sins of the Coalition in this regard, that is only the tip of the iceberg. I am not going to answer him back in his own coin.  I could spend the rest of the morning here doing so.  I could go through the list of buildings and of planning permissions dating back to the grim days of former Deputy Kevin Boland, and I suppose beyond, right up to and including the new Dublin municipal offices, which have contributed, each in its own small way, to destroying this city, robbing it of the character that it still had when I was a child or even later, and making it something which other people pity us for living in.</P>
    <P>In a general sense the Irish people can be blamed.  In a less general sense successive Governments can be blamed, Fine Gael just as much as any other.  But the people who are really in charge of the appearance of a city are their elected representatives and the officials who undoubtedly in some respects have a wide ranging independence of them, but not in every respect.  Although I do not want to be unfair to individuals, I cannot blame anyone really for the condition of Dublin city if it is not the corporation.  If the Minister has now decided to put his own weight and considerable brains behind this official vote of no confidence in Dublin Corporation, I am solidly behind him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke seemed to think it was terribly undemocratic of us to be taking this line, to be carving out a bit of the city and putting it under a special commission instead of leaving it with the Corporation. I want to remind Deputy Burke of a little bit of the history of local government in this country.  It was started off by the British in 1898 in much like its present form as part of their then campaign to kill home rule by kindness.  They got a shower of gombeens and little hacks into the councils throughout the country which made the local government system at the turn of the century into a laughing stock which is richly parodied and saturised in the books of Somerville and Ross. The combined incompetence and corruption <Col N="674" /> of local government in this country, and the misuse of local government functions in order to debate matters which were not within their competence at all, were such that Mr. de Valera, in 1940, stripped the local authorities of nearly all their formal powers and handed them over to managements, to the faceless dictators Deputy Burke was foaming at the mouth about half an hour ago.</P>
    <P>That was Mr. de Valera's contribution, and I cannot bring myself to say that he was wrong.  He left behind a certain number of functions, including the striking of a rate and including also, at that time, functions which have otherwise since been whittled away from them, but the large end of local government was taken away from elected representatives in 1940 because they had proved incapable of discharging them properly. That is what Mr. de Valera thought.  That is what the whole Fianna Fáil Party that trooped into the lobbies behind him then thought.  I cannot dissent from it.</P>
    <P>I used the word &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; a moment ago.  I want to make it clear that what I said about that was applicable to the very early days of local government and what I said was applicable in the very early nineteen hundreds I do not in any sense want to be understood as applying in regard to the modern local authorities. But certainly even if that is not longer a feature of them and has not for many years been so, certainly incompetence, combined of course with impotence after the 1940 Act, has rendered their contribution, particularly to areas like this, an entirely negative one.  The gowns and the chains and the coaches are maintained; the foreign visits are encouraged. I have no doubt that in Dublin Corporation at the moment there are many people who have been on trips abroad in order to look at urban renewal and the revival of city centre areas and the provision of pedestrian zones in other cities and that their experience there might perhaps have been of some value had they demonstrated before now that they had the faintest interest in putting it into practice in their own city.</P>
    <P>I remember back in the sixties, or it <Col N="675" /> may have been after the 1967 local elections, there was a Coalition majority on the Dublin Corporation and that majority survived until last year or whenever the last local elections were held.  I have often complained about the petty hogging, which of course both sides went in for, of nominations to the chairmanships of local authorities or the lord mayoralties or the nominations to subordinate committees, and I would like to complain about it again in passing.  But the Coalition majority, Fine Gael, Labour and a few independents with them, in the late sixties refused on one occasion to strike a rate.  As far as I understand, the elected representatives in a local authority have no discretion in this matter.  The rate is presented to them as a financial calculation and was, in those days when we were still paying rates, intended to sustain local expenditure from what could be raised in local taxation.  There were no two ways about it.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation decided that they would not strike a rate.  That was clearly outside their legal powers and the former Deputy Kevin Boland, then Minister for Local Government, often though I had fault to find with him and still find fault with what he then did in his office, quite rightly suspended the corporation for a plain breach of their duty and replaced them with a commissioner.  A so-called democratic body cannot complain about its functions being taken from it if it refuses to discharge those functions.</P>
    <P>That is an element of law right through the whole system, from the President downwards.  The President, if he declines, or fails, or neglects, or defaults in his duties can be replaced.  So can a judge.  The idea that there is something out of the way about this flies in the face of all practical experience.  It is possible for some little demagogue to rant about how democratic rights are being set at naught but a democratic right carries a democratic responsibility &mdash; and this is a point which Deputy Burke does not seem to appreciate.  One must be willing to shoulder the burdens and the unpopularity which one's responsibility imposes <Col N="676" /> on one as well as taking the kudos, as well as swanking around in the gowns and going on the trips and being addressed as councillor and having one's letterheads paid for and so on; one must be willing to shoulder the responsibilities as well. That is something which the local authorities here, in particular of late since the last election by their refusing to exact water charges anymore, have signally failed to do.</P>
    <P>To describe Dublin Corporation or any other local authority as a democratic body is plainly wrong.  They are not democratic bodies because a democratic authority is willing to do its duty as well as to reap the benefits of its position, and the privileges and the prestige attached to the fact of election.  It is a privilege to be elected in a Dáil constituency or in a local government area.  It carries prestige and a certain degree of power for the people who value such things; but it carries responsibilities too.  A local government system which is all privileges and no responsibility could not be described as democratic.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it will go some distance towards assuaging any abrasion or contusion I may have raised on Deputy Burke's skin, not that I suppose that is too delicate, when I say I am disappointed that this Government have not made any serious progress on the local government reform they promised four years ago.  All we have seen is a tinkering with boundaries and the upgrading of the chairman of Galway Corporation to Lord Mayor from Mayor with an increase in the number of people exercising this deeply undemocratic function, whereby it is all privileges and no responsibilities in the Dublin area.  I am sorry that the opportunity for radical local government reform has not been taken and that my own hobbyhorse is limping far behind the field, that the opportunity to incorporate in that local government reform some structure whereby responsibility for economic development on a community scale was not taken.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on this legislation. This is an experiment, which is all too rare in legislation here.  We are <Col N="677" /> terrified of experiments.  If an idea has advantages, although there may be disadvantages and perhaps unseen snags, why not try it out?  Are we too ashamed to come back later and admit that something has not worked?  Can we not admit that we did something in good faith but did not anticipate some type of difficulty and say we are willing to try something else or preserve a modest silence on this subject from now on?  The attitude of being afraid to try something for fear that it will fail is far too prevalent and has meant that chances to try something new even at the risk that it will not work have been thrown away.  This legislation is a very rare example and could be termed a collector's item by a specialist in legislation. It is comparable to a penny black on which the head is printed upside down, because it is an experiment, limited to three years, with a limited budget which I fear will not be adequate for the demands which are likely to be made on the commission. I am sure the Minister's officials had for once to fly by the seat of their pants because I doubt if they had the usual resource open to them of looking to an English precedent to make the drafting simpler.  I gather that this legislation has been put together largely by the officials and that it may have problems which are not obvious to me especially as I have not got the local government expertise that many other Members here have.</P>
    <P>I will make a few general comments on the Bill and I will go into detail on Committee Stage.  Deputy Burke urged that the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission should consist of a chairman, and not more than six ordinary members and he was very anxious that these six ordinary members should mainly be members of the existing corporation. I urge the Minister not to give in to such a loony idea.  It is to get away from the corporation that this has been tried.  I do not insult the individuals who are members of the corporation but we want to get the elected corporation mentality out of this thing.  I hope the seven members on this commission will be people who are proven friends of general <Col N="678" /> conservation without being necessarily members of what I know is often contemptously referred to as the bourgeois middle class, sherry-swilling set, anxious only to preserve what standards of beauty or interest will keep the amenities of their life to an acceptable level.  They should be people who have a sense of and a feeling for Irish streetscapes and for what an Irish town used to look like and could still look like.  There are people who have written books and taken terrific interest in Irish towns and the appearance of Irish streets and I hope they will find a place on the commission.  Very often a person who treats this sort of subject in an academic way is not easy to work with in the practical context and that would probably be the case if the Minister were to fill the commission with the sort of people I have in mind.  I only ask that at least one of that sort of person should be on the commission. People who have written on the subject of visual urban amenities, particularly Dublin amenities or disamenities might be considered, so as to have one on the membership of the commission.</P>
    <P>Roadstone, a big company here have been making a habit, for the last eight or ten years, of printing calendars showing architectural drawings of Irish buildings and these are of an extremely high quality. I know that some years ago the same firm subscribed or subsidised the carrying out of people, in respect of the town of Ballinasloe, an architectural audit.  This was a survey of the town, drawing attention to buildings which deserved maintenance, and drawing attention to the possibilities which the town contained.  I do not know who carried out that audit but I suspect that in the files of Roadstone and in the part of that firm which has shown an interest &mdash; naturally not an altogether altruistic interest, but at any rate an intelligent and civilised interest &mdash; is a note of the people involved and if the Minister's advisers were to contact the people in that firm they might get a few hints as to the possible membership of the commission or about how the commission might go about their job.</P>
    <P>The reason I am apprehensive about the wrong people being put on this commission <Col N="679" /> is because people who are ostensibly well qualified in such areas can perpetrate awful atrocities.  It does not seem any time at all since my student days, 30 years ago.  I remember the beginning of An Tóstal during that time.  It was basically a good idea and a lot of thought and enthusiasm went into it.  It has faded out since but it has left some valuable things behind, notably the tidy towns scheme.  It also left some abominable things behind, including in this city, the traffic island in the middle of O'Connell Bridge which was converted into a structure or a plaza that somebody christened the tomb of the unknown gurrier, in the middle of which, until a public spirited student had the gumption to throw it into the Liffey, was a slowly revolving plastic flame called the bowl of light.  That was done at great expense and no doubt with a lot of thought, and certainly somebody well qualified in designing such things was responsible for its design, but it should not have been put up there.</P>
    <P>The handsome Victorian bracket street lamps which had stood there for 20 years or thereabouts disappeared. I want to give the corporation credit for the fact that they did not scrap them because they were ultimately re-erected and everyone was glad about that.  I mention that episode because it was an attempt, by the standards of the fifties, to spruce up, I must say, to tart up, the centre of O'Connell Bridge but it was an absolute aesthetic disaster.  Even in 1953 the people recognised it as that at once.  I hope the people associated with that are not offended by my speaking so severely about this.</P>
    <P>We do not want any bowls of light.  We do not want any tricky gimmicky nifty little plazas or fountains or clusters of lamps.  They are all right on a brand new German shopping centre, but we are talking about O'Connell Street, a street which was originally a formal, very broad eighteenth century street and its character, even though much repaired, ought to be respected.</P>
    <P>I would not be qualified to sit on a <Col N="680" /> commission of this kind and I cannot say what I would do, but I know that the dangers of doing the wrong things are very great.  The personnel of this commission are extremely important.  I understand the Minister has made some announcements about them already and the details I have are very encouraging.  I hope the work of this commission will justify the trouble he has put into his choice.</P>
    <P>In section 6, which deals with the improvement schemes, the Minister has a list of exempted developments for the purpose of the Local Government (Planning and Development Act) 1963.  Subsection (6) (a) reads:</P>
    <P>In the determination of an application for permission under Part IV of the Act of 1963 relating to development in the Metropolitan Central Area, regard shall be had to the provisions of an improvement scheme approved under this section, and a decision to grant such a permission shall not be made, except with the consent of the Commission, if the proposed development would materially contravene the provisions of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with that clause but others may have to the extent that no criterion seems to exist for deciding what will materially contravene the provisions of a scheme and, secondly &mdash; unless I have missed something in the Bill, which is quite possible &mdash; there does not appear to be any route of appeal from the veto which the refusal of consent on the part of the commission would imply.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the transfer of roads functions to the commission.  Subsection (1) says:</P>
    <P>The functions of Dublin Corporation in relation to the construction, maintenance and improvement of a public road and any other functions incidental thereto under the Local Government Acts, 1925 to 1985, the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1984, and under any other enactment shall stand transferred to the Commission in so far as <Col N="681" /> they apply to the Metropolitan Central Area.</P>
    <P>Here is an opportunity for the commission to co-ordinate the operations of public utilities in regard to underground installations.  As the Committee on Public Expenditure discovered over a period of three or four years 75 separate excavations were made in the roadway around this House and I saw another one recently not yet completed because excavations are very rarely completed.  A few spades of asphalt or tar are thrown into these holes and left there, and the footpaths are in a very dangerous state &mdash; cracked broken seamed and half repaired. So many tears are shed about this city that this is probably just a minor problem.  The Committee on Public Expenditure discovered at a meeting held six months ago attended by representatives of the corporation, CIE, ESB, the Gas Company, the waterworks and sewerage people, Bord Telecom and other utilities, that none of them consult with the others before they open up a street.  Each have their own battery of statutory powers for excavating a street. There is nothing to stop one authority from excavating a street and half filling it in and then for another public utility to dig the same or a contiguous area once more.  That should not happen.  There should be liaison because the public costs involved are huge.  The Minister might consider expanding section 7 to give the commission power to require public utilities, at the beginning of each year, to draw up a plan for proposed excavations to see if they can be co-ordinated so that the damage to the streets is minimised and the inconvenience to the public is reduced.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the transfer of traffic management functions to the commission. Subsection (8) reads:</P>
    <P>Any reference to an officer of the Garda Síochána in sections 85 and 95 of the Act of 1961 shall, in the application of those sections to the Metropolitan Central Area, be constructed as a reference to a person appointed by <Col N="682" /> the Commission.</P>
    <P>Is it intended &mdash; and this is something I would be very slow to fall in with &mdash; that the commission should have a separate traffic police?  The reason I would be slow to fall in with this is that I would not like a number of police forces.  One police force is enough and is likely to be more efficient than a proliferation of them.  I would also be apprehensive that if the commission propose to recruit people with a traffic police role, the net result would be more people on the public pay-roll, something nobody can claim more credit for fighting than the Minister before us.  He is the first Minister in the history of the State who made a substantial inroad into the numbers in the public service.  If there are personnel implications here, the Minister might look at them carefully.  If there are traffic problems in the area, the existing traffic powers of the police should be used.  I would not like to see a separate traffic police set up.</P>
    <P>I put down a question on this a year ago and got a very evasive answer, but I would like to say something about litter. It appears that, not only in the city centre but in the peripheral areas, it has got out of control.  The more Acts we pass about it the worse the situation becomes.  Under section 9 (1) (a) the commission will take over the functions of a local authority under the Litter Act, 1982.  That will be a fat lot of use if that Act is not enforced. I would like to hear from the Minister, if he has up to date figures on how many prosecutions and convictions under that Act have been recorded since its enactment. Can he honestly say that any improvement has resulted?  I cannot see that it has.  It seems to get worse every day.  It may be that I am getting older every day and less tolerant but, as objectively as I can look at this, it seems to be getting worse.</P>
    <P>Section 11 has real teeth which will bite if the commission do what they are supposed to do.  However, I worry about the political and financial implications and the fresh wounds which the commission <Col N="683" /> will inflict on businesses.  I am not saying that I do not support these functions but the Minister may find that he has a very hot potato in his fist.  The Minister said that the commission will have power to require property owners to remove or alter any structure, or any structure of a particular class, and to provide suitable replacements if appropriate. I should like the Minister to give a few examples of what he means.  My pet hate in regard to the defilement of historic city streets is the proliferation of plastic facias.  At the same time, I am not so sure that I would know how to fight that blight because if I were the commission and produced an improvements scheme requiring the removal of all plastic facias in O'Connell Street &mdash; a very salutary measure &mdash; I would then have to put myself in the position of some fast food proprietor who has put up a plastic facia at considerable expense.  He is offered compensation for the removal of the plastic facia but the fast food joint causes the problem because it is hard to imagine businesses of that kind with dignified, cut limestone facias or with carefully sign painted timber facias although they would be suitable in a street like that.</P>
    <P>Recently a very elegant fish and chip shop opened which, as well as serving hake and haddock, are offering about 25 other varieties.  This shop is located in the city centre in one of the designated areas. It has a facia which is a plastiche of an Edwardian shop and I do not imagine that anyone will object to it.  It does not seem to be in plastic; I have not seen it but, from a photograph, it seems to be acceptable.  There will be human, political and financial problems in cleaning up O'Connell Street and I doubt if it can be done in three years.  It would be more to the point if the commission were able to prevent any further joints of that kind being opened in that street.  According as they close or move to other areas, permission for a change of use should be given only to businesses which have a more sober, old fashioned presentation of the shop front.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> The improvements scheme also implies the discontinuance of any use of land or the imposition of conditions on the continuance of any use of land.  That sounds very brave but I would not like to be the official telling the proprietor of a fast food joint that he will have to open somewhere else.  If I was the proprietor in question I would be round in a flash to my accountant asking him to prepare a brief on the value which the loss of my position would mean.  A few of these instances will make short work of the £10 million which the commission can spend over three years for everything.  I do not want to throw cold water on this, the inspiration behind the scheme is wonderful and I am delighted that we are debating it.  I hope the measure is passed but I should like the Minister to say how he thinks the political problems will be solved.  Naturally the people affected will ask their local representatives to pressurise the Minister to pressurise the commission.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's powers in section 2 to extend the area within this special regime, it would have been right to extend it a little west along Aston Quary and back towards Dame Street to include Crown Alley and the Temple Bar area which now appears to be under threat from a colleague of mine on these benches.  If my colleague does not pull down buildings in these areas, the Minister should consider extending the area to cover them because they are showing signs of life in their own right.  Obviously the business population there will be anxious to co-operate with the Minister as they see themselves as the core of a Dublin left bank although, of course, in this case the right bank is involved.  The Minister might get quicker results more cheaply in trying to upgrade the appearance of the city in this area than he might in other parts of the metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>In regard to the orders which the Minister will make under section 2, I wonder if there is a precedent for providing only seven sitting days for annulling resolutions. I may have missed it but I thought that a period of 21 sitting days was more usual.  Perhaps that is too long <Col N="685" /> but a period of seven days is too short. After all, seven sitting days means that if the Minister made an order on a Monday night or a Tuesday the Dáil would only have that and the next week &mdash; assuming that it sat four days in one of the weeks &mdash; to annul the resolution.  Given that two of these days &mdash; if you were to insist on Standing Orders being respected &mdash; would have to go on the notice of motion for the annulment resolution, you could be down to a single week.  I do not want to introduce any element of delay into the mechanisms of the Bill but seven days seems too short a period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that increasingly over recent years concern has been expressed by many representative bodies and individuals about the degree of urban decay in Dublin city centre.  This debate allows the House to focus on Dublin city and its surrounding areas which happens all too rarely.  I will outline my reasons for disagreeing with the Bill; nevertheless it is useful to discuss the city centre as we often have long discussions on other regions.  Of course that is desirable but we should also discuss the problems of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned surveys and submissions by interested groups and public representatives.  I have access to these files and there is an enormous amount of documentation in this regard. As the Minister said, it is long past the time for action to replace words.  I agree with that but I am sure he acknowledges that over the last four or five years Dublin Corporation made great strides in regard to housing and park development in the city centre.  It is unfair to imply, as Deputy Kelly did, that nothing has been done.  It is peculiar that a Dublin TD continues to knock the city in an unconstructive way.  Parliamentarians in other cities try to boost their cities and to be enthusiastic about them.  Constructive criticism is helpful but Deputy Kelly continually runs down the city.  It is a pity that he never spent time on Dublin Corporation as he would have gained experience of how the system works.  It is not the best city in the world but neither is it <Col N="686" /> the worst.</P>
    <P>Reports have shown why Dublin, willy-nilly, has been decaying over the years. A city decays because there has been loss of confidence in it by the business community.  All over the world, city law and order problems stem from dereliction. People move out of city centres, there are traffic problems during the day and no activity at night; very few people continue to live in city centres; there are very few local authority tenants and very little residential housing of any nature. That leads to more dereliction, more law and order problems and social deprivation.</P>
    <P>Dublin over a number of years has suffered from this, though in the last three years the tide seems to have turned somewhat, slowly in some areas and more quickly in others.  In his opening speech the Minister referred to some proposals which I, as Chairman of Dublin City Council, have been promoting as best we can.  Some months ago, during the recess, the Minister saw fit at the launching of the commission, to make a speech which upset me.  The city manager was in attendance and the Minister launched an attack on Dublin Corporation, for not promoting inner city development. He criticised corporation delays&mdash; he was speaking at a CIF function, not the launching of the commission.  The CIF held their function after the corporation had launched theirs: the CIF changed their date from the date I had personally fixed &mdash; I have the correspondence to show how they leapfrogged the corporation date.  The Dublin Corporation document had been printed.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister attacked the corporation for not selling their proposals. That was particularly unfair because the Minister's sale packet was launched only yesterday.  That is neither here nor there in regard to the rejuvenation of the centre city, a matter on which we all must co-operate, both public representatives, the corporation and the Department of the Environment.  The Minister's speech did not deter the city council from going ahead with their work. I will now refer to what the business <Col N="687" /> community are saying about our proposals.</P>
    <P>Always in matters of this kind there is difficulty about where the lines should be drawn, and in the case of Dublin inner city the area is too narrow.  I ask the Minister to extend the incentive schemes to the entire quays and to take in Dorset Street.  The lines were drawn on electoral wards.  They included Upper Gardiner Street but omitted areas likely to be developed.  I have given a number of examples of this, but by order or by amendments to the Bill there could be small increases in the areas.  Areas could be taken in where there is considerable interest from the business community.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, there is very little interest in most of the four sites advertised by Dublin Corporation.  There has been no interest at all in some of them, not one letter showing interest. Four sites were advertised: there has not been any interest whatsoever in two of them and very little in a third.  There has been substantial interest in Parliament Street near the quays, and that proves the difficulty about the development of the quays because only one out of about 30 interested people can get the Parliament Street site.</P>
    <P>We are asking business people to move from their present locations in the city centre to adjoining areas and they will not do that because the law and order provision in some areas listed would mean business people could not get insurance.  Business people will not move into such areas.  As I have said during law and order debates, this problem is acute and this is well known to the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <P>The Liberties area has an extensive scheme; Stoneybatter has detailed proposals; city centre traders have a number of proposals; the Dublin Port and Docks Board have put out a number of documents in recent years, and various documents have surfaced from the Urban Development Act, 1982.  We now have the Custom House Docks Authority which will be launched on 17 November; the Dublin Chamber of Commerce have <Col N="688" /> put forward detailed proposals; the chartered surveyors put out a document during the summer recess; we have had a document from the Prices Conference, from An Taisce and from the environmentalists We will have documents from the Dublin Streets Commission. These proposals are dotted throughout the city centre between the canals, now generally recognised as the city of Dublin.  This is recognised here and in the local authorities as the city centre. We are no longer talking about the city as being bounded by St. Stephen's Green and Parnell Street-Frederick Street.</P>
    <P>All these proposals are gathering dust in the local authorities and various Departments.  Until, as Deputy Burke said this morning, we get a proper integrated plan for the city, nothing concrete will happen.  It may take 15 years to implement.  That may seem a long time for politicians but we must appreciate that we need a proper development plan for the city.  I have no doubt about the Minister's will to see proper development. It can only be done by a substantial input of funds in a 15 year period.  There is no short way.  All of the plans on the table today and being debated will be updated in five years, and there will be no action; they will be updated in ten years and 15 years and there will still be no action.  There must be proper incentives for the business community to take away the dead face of the city centre. There are institutional funds which could change the face of the city; and the stigma on certain sections of the city must be lifted before money will be invested in the city centre.</P>
    <P>This year I have the honour of being a member of the chamber of commerce who were quoted at length this morning by the Minister.  The chamber of commerce comprise very powerful individuals who can change the city.  They have great vision, plans and proposals. They will tell you both formally and informally that in the present climate it is better for those who have sites in the city to leave them derelict until 1996 rather than get involved now in speculative risks which are unlikely to give them a better <Col N="689" /> return than if they invested in Government gilts or bonds outside the State.</P>
    <P>The reasons the city is not being developed are not because we have not got a Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission and not because the planning officers and inspectors of Dublin Corporation are not full of activity &mdash; they do their best under the circumstances &mdash; but because those who have vast amounts of money are not investing it.  If there is to be an integrated plan for the city it should carry attractive incentives which will encourage people to invest.  Deputy Burke gave the reasons why we have not got an integrated development plan. Whether the officials in the Department of Finance influence the Minister or the Minister influences them I do not know, but correspondence received by the chamber of commerce and other organisations which I have seen from the Department of Finance has been signed by senior officials and not by the Minister. They feel that because the country has done well from the EC fund packages, Dublin cannot be taken as a region on its own.  They refuse to accept that Dublin has lost out.  Commissioner Peter Sutherland, if one reads his speeches closely, has pointed out that Dublin has been losing out under the present system.  IDA policy as brought in by my own colleagues worked against Dublin.  Areas like Dublin port and Dublin dockland which should have been developed lost out because industrial development grants were for outside the Dublin region.  That has tended to change over recent years. The IDA are obviously in a dilemma at present.  They realise they must change. They have spent £300 million.  The Government say they are going to put a 15-year package together to try to revitalise Dublin.  Dublin will be 1,000 years old in 18 months time.  Therefore, 15 years is just a drop in the ocean when one talks about revitalising one of the best traditional cities in Europe.  People in the future will look back to see if we were serious about our city and ask what did we do.  A Dublin streets commission or an urban renewal plan are not what are <Col N="690" /> required.  They are a waste of time.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Custom House Docks Development Authority which were set up as a separate authority. Why do we on this side of the House distinguish between the role of democracy in the Custom House Docks Development Authority and the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission?  The Custom House dock site is a unique site. It comprises 27 acres down the road from O'Connell Street.  Whatever happens there is vitally important as to how that corner of Dublin will develop.  The only creditable development in the past 30 to 40 years has been the Irish Life Centre. That development which started in 1972 has only just been completed which goes to show how long it can take.  The Custom House dock site has got to be developed right.  There has to be close co-operation between all those involved.  Dublin Corporation have built new houses in Oriel Street in an effort to do away with the urban blight of dereliction.  Developers and planners have to concentrate on trying to put together an innovative package which will give a social mix of local authority housing, private apartments and housing, shopping areas, restaurants, libraries and services which can be used by people coming into the city.  There has been a proposal that this would be an ideal spot for a marina.  The depth of water is ideal.  The location and the street space is right to develop the area professionally. That is why I see it as fair and reasonable to set up a Custom House Docks Development Authority.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission are doing the work of junior planning officers who decide whether a sign is legal and who sweep the streets.  If one goes along with the idea of a commission, you have to say &mdash; Deputy Kelly, a former Minister, has answered for the Government today &mdash; that this Bill is about a vote of no confidence in Dublin Corporation.  I am sure Deputy Kelly has been at parliamentary party meetings when that subject was discussed at length and in detail.  Therefore, I have to take it that what we are debating is that Dublin Corporation are not capable of cleaning <Col N="691" /> the streets, that they are not capable of dealing with minor planning applications, that they are not able to look after double yellow lines, that they cannot run the city and because the area from O'Connell Street to Grafton Street is very important it must be taken away from them.  We are not debating the revitalising of the city.  We are talking about where the power should lie to sweep Grafton Street and who should grow plants on O'Connell Street. The other Bills have got to do with incentives, urban renewal and so on.</P>
    <P>The Bill arose from a document put forward by Dublin Corporation.  In 1984 when the position I held last year of leader of the majority group in the city council was held by my colleague Deputy Doyle, he asked that the management of Dublin Corporation bring forward proposals in an effort to revitalise the city. They drew up a document dealing with schemes.  I propose to go through this document to show that it was from it that the officials picked up the points and put them into this Bill which deals with revitalising Dublin.  We can show that this is nothing more than a PR exercise.  As Deputy Kelly has said, when we take the vote on Second Stage it will be on whether this House has confidence in Dublin Corporation.  That is what this debate is about.</P>
    <P>Report No. 185 was presented by the city council by members such as Deputy Doyle.  The city council members requested a report on the proposals to improve and extend pedestrian areas in the city and improve the gardening and recreation facilities.  It stated:</P>
    <P>The corporation are engaged on a number of activites designed to improve the general environment of the city centre area.  One of the most important of these is the pedestrianisation of streets, the special treatment of the street/pavement surfaces, the critical examination of items of street furniture and their renewal or replacement as necessary.  The tasteful treatment of streets in this fashion will have a spinover effect into adjoining <Col N="692" /> areas, and, it is hoped, will likely encourage owners of premises fronting on to them to take a special interest in their immediate environment and to reflect this by way of improvement in the treatment of their own frontages, sympathetic material in shop fronts and sign writing, window displays, floral displays in window boxes etc.</P>
    <P>If the terminology used in the Bill appears similar to that in the report I should ask the House to remember that my statement to Dublin Corporation was prepared 18 months before the Bill was published.  A question about the wording should be put to some other person.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>The general objective should be the creation of a pleasant pedestrian environment with appropriate road and footpath surfaces, environmental lighting, planting and surroundings likely to give a general attractive ambience for shoppers and other pedestrians. It is hoped that our efforts (the efforts of the corporation) will encourage the business community, in addition to improving premises, to consider extended opening hours, early morning deliveries to stores and, perhaps, special events and promotions.</P>
    <P>The Chamber of Commerce, of which I am a member, rather than getting excited and giving unreserved approval to the Minister's proposals should consider adopting some of the suggestions put to them by the public representatives on the corporation.  Those suggestions, if adopted, would revitalise the city faster than sweeping the streets or opening the shops on Wednesday and Thursday nights in competition with supermarkets in suburbia.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The corporation are pursuing this objective in the main shopping and pedestrian areas, i.e. Henry Street, Mary Street, O'Connell Street and North Earl Street on the north side and the Grafton Street area on the south and the creation of attractive pedestrian links between these areas via the Ha'penny Bridge or via College <Col N="693" /> Green, Westmoreland Street.  At the request of the corporation the operations group of the Dublin Transportation Task Force are at present examining the feasibility of extending the pedestrianisation of North Earl Street into a portion of Talbot Street.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at Deputy Kelly's remarks about that task force.  We asked that group to investigate the feasibility of extending the pedestrianisation and I am sure that if the Deputy checked with his brother who has a role to play with the transportation authority he would be made aware of the position.  Two years. ago we put to his brother the question Deputy Kelly put to us this morning. A family chat would help the Deputy understand what is taking place in the city.  Deputy Kelly attacked us for wearing chains and gowns but, as I have made it clear on many occasions, officials find it difficult to get me to wear chains and gowns.  This is the sixth occasion in the last 18 months that Deputy Kelly has referred to chains and gowns and I suggest to him that he use his influence in his own club to get rid of the wigs and gowns that are a carry-over from periods before members of Dublin Corporation started wearing chains and gowns.</P>
    <P>The report went on to point out that the work on Henry Street and Mary Street was finished.  With my colleagues, Councillor Doyle, Alderman Tunney and Alderman Mac Giolla, I look forward to opening that project soon.  It is fair to point out that work on that stretch did not receive much assistance from the Government.  The £8 million we had stored in our coffers to implement that plan was taken from us this year.  Today the Minister told us that the Government's contribution would not be £10 million annually but £10 million for the three years of the plan.  Members of the city council are aware that this year the Minister took away £8.4 million.  He is most generous in giving us back £3.3 million of the £8.4 million he took away.</P>
    <P>Many people have made favourable comments about that project which the former Lord Mayor, Deputy Tunney, <Col N="694" /> officially opened last year.  The corporation undertook that work in conjunction with the city centre businesses association but they did not receive any assistance from the Government.  We are grateful to the businesses association for providing financial assistance.  We have very good relations with that group and we do not need a commission to help us build up good relations with the Chamber of Commerce or with them.  The report states:</P>
    <P>In addition much preliminary work, such as tree planting and floral displays, has been done on the central mall in O'Connell Street and the metal bridge has been refurbished, painted and floodlit and period lamps have been erected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly told us that he does not like those lamps although almost everybody else in this city does.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The programme of works is, of course, subject to budget constraints and must be geared towards the available moneys.  The work must be of a standard which is appropriate to the centre of the capital city.  This is especially true of the principal thoroughfare, O'Connell Street, where the eventual treatment is likely to be very costly.  The programme as envisaged... will be related mainly to availability of finances.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation are prepared to undertake the work if they are given the money.  I note that some streets were not referred to by the Minister.  I should like to give details of them in case the Minister missed them when deciding to establish the commission.  With regard to Henry Street and Mary Street, where work has been completed, decorative lighting columns have been erected and the community and environment department of the corporation have examined the possible planting of shrubs for the street. Newly designed litter bins were introduced. In association with this environmental improvement, the Henry Street Traders have had a survey of shopfronts <Col N="695" /> undertaken with a view to future improvement.  They are also actively pursuing the idea of introducing floral window boxes in the street.  It is heartening to report that the present works, although as yet incomplete, have been the subject of much favourable comment by both the business community and the public alike.</P>
    <P>The report went on:</P>
    <P>In association with the Henry Street improvement scheme it was decided to continue the surface treatment into Mary Street, to the junction with Jervis Street.</P>
    <P>We have also been involved with the city centre business people about highlighting the church where Wolfe Tone was baptised, St. Mary's.  During the summer, lunchtime concerts were held in that area and there are plans to carry out more work on the public park at Jervis Street. The report also states that decorative lighting columns have been erected and other environmental improvements similar to Henry Street will be effected.  That work will stretch from Henry Street to Little Strand Street and up to the Hector Grey corner at the start of the Ha'penny Bridge.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Grafton Street and Henry Street link, it is interesting to note the order of the roads in the plan because they come up in the Bill and in the Minister's statement.  The plan states that Henry Street, south Mary Street and Grafton Street, the main shopping streets in the Dublin city area, have been pedestrianised for some years.  Considerable pedestrian movement takes place between these two areas mainly via Westmoreland Street, and foothpaths among this major traffic route are frequently congested.  An equally direct pedestrian route exists using the Halfpenny Bridge as the River Liffey crossing point, namely Henry Street, Liffey Street Upper and Lower, the Halfpenny Bridge, Merchants Arch, Crown Alley, Central Bank Mall, Dame Street, Trinity Street, Saint Andrew Street, Suffolk Street and Grafton Street.  The route is <Col N="696" /> in general free from traffic and will offer pedestrians an attractive alternative to the more congested Westmoreland Street route.  That plan was fully documented, fully costed, and we had an excellent contractor, whose men will be unemployed unless he gets work from Dublin Corporation, ready to carry it out.  The drainage scheme and all of the survey work were done.  It was all done well over 15 months before this Bill was drafted, giving all the same roads, all a direct cog like a school child's examination cog.  All of that was taken directly from that document and hyped into this Bill which represents a no confidence vote for Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The plan was that the proposed scheme for this route would include footpath widening and improvements at Liffey Street Lower and Temple Bar, Trinity Street, Suffolk Street, Saint Andrew Street and Wicklow Street.  Both the Minister and Deputy Kelly are very interested in that scheme, a scheme which will implement if we survive Deputy Skelly's attempts to ruin our plan and if somebody gives us the necessary money.</P>
    <P>Tenders had been invited for these works and it was hoped that reconstruction work would begin without delay but we never got approval for that.  Our colleagues, particularly Deputy Doyle, will remember that we never got approval for any of those works.  We were seeking that approval before the Bill surfaced. When the construction work was completed a number of pedestrian crossings at Liffey Street, Lower and Middle Abbey Street, Cope Street, Temple Bar and Saint Andrew Street were to be installed on a phased basis.  Environmental improvements were also effected throughout the route.  An example of such improvement was the recent refurbishment of the Ha'penny Bridge by the Corporation, not the commission.  It was felt that Crown Alley offered great potential for special treatment &mdash; as the Minister said this morning &mdash; as part of this walk-through route.  This street had in recent years been revitalised and was now developing as a popular pedestrian <Col N="697" /> street.  It was proposed that it be closed to vehicular traffic for certain periods to facilitate pedestrian movement.  It would be noted that the sewers had already been renewed as part of this improvement scheme by Dublin Corporation.  The chief civic and amenities architect, in association with the Dublin planning officer, was considering possible treatments with a view to an early report to Dublin Corporation on the matter.  That was undertaken as well.</P>
    <P>The plan stated that a pedestrian route had been identified to link Grafton Street to South Great Georges Street, two important south city shopping streets. The route is Grafton Street, Johnson's Court, Coppinger Row, Powerscourt Townhouse Centre, Castle Market and South City Markets to South Great Georges Street.  The main features of the route provided for an upgrading of some of the pavements, the pedestrianisation of Castle Market and the provision of uncontrolled pedestrian crossings at Clarendon Street, South William Street and Drury Street, The pedestrian crossings had already been installed and work was expected to commence on pavement reconstruction when we received money, when we got back the money which we had had already.  Once the necessary works were completed the community and environment departments had plans to undertake environmental improvements by way of planters etc.</P>
    <P>In Moore Street, which, unfortunately, is left out of the Dublin Streets Commission plan, the possibility of the introduction of pedestrianisation was examined in our plans.  In the course of a recent survey a number of shop owners in the street indicated opposition to pedestrianisation. It was intended that officers of the roads and traffic department would meet with the Moore Street traders in the near future with a view to resolving the matter.  That was over 18 months ago. It has been resolved and a number of questions on partly pedestrianising it, improving the colourscape of the streets and getting a standardised canopy for all the legal traders in the area, a third paid for by Dublin Corporation, a third by the <Col N="698" /> traders and a third by the Centre City Businesses Association have already been agreed and are to be debated by Dublin Corporation, on, I think, next Monday night.  Again, there will be no movement on that until we get back the money we had in the development fund.</P>
    <P>A plan to extend the Henry Street-Mary Street pedestrian zone was almost complete and in Liffey Street there was a similar plan.  There is no need to talk about that here.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials might have got some wording of their own in their Bill and document.  This was written 18 months before the Bill surfaced.  The major project scheduled for the south side was a complete upgrading of Grafton Street.  Appropriate technical staff were to prepare an agreed scheme during that year &mdash; last year &mdash; which they did, so that the necessary improvement to the pavements and carriageway could proceed in 1987 if funds were available.  A special effort was to be made to achieve the highest possible standard of paving, environmental lighting and planting and special treatment was to be considered for adjoining streets and traffic islands where possible.</P>
    <P>The report states that North Earl Street has been pedestrianised for some years and is now a very popular pedestrian street.  It was desirable that we treat this street to an equally high standard as that of Henry Street and Mary Street, not to mention the Dublin streets commission.  The report stated that the dimensions of the street may, however, lend themselves to a different type of treatment from that then under way in Henry Street which would accentuate the atmosphere of a pedestrian zone.  It should be mentioned that this would lead to some criticism as to why there are footpaths in the pedestrian areas that Dublin corporation have undertaken.  It is because of the old tunnels and vaults underneath the street.  They come out in front of the buildings and it is not possible to pedestrianise over that with the heavy trucks.  That is why it is done as it is in Henry Street and not as it is done in some <Col N="699" /> continental cities.</P>
    <P>In all of these streets the traders have worked in conjunction with Dublin Corporation, the President of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Donovan, Mr. Tom Coffey, who is the director of the Centre City Business Association, and all the key business groups.  I chaired a meeting some months ago of the key people in O'Connell Street to get their views on the detailed plans that were in front of them.  We did not launch that off to the high notions in Kerry because we said that it would upset the Minister if he thought that in some way we were upstageing him.</P>
    <P>All these plans are there costed and ready to be implemented by Dublin Corporation's technical engineers and architects. We have the best planning department and civic and amenities department in Europe.  The Minister will be aware that when he took office he did not get the Board of Works to do what was required in regard to the Custom House; he got Dublin Corporation's department to do it for him, so he must feel as we do about it as members of the local authority.</P>
    <P>In our plan for O'Connell Street and O'Connell Street Mall it was intended to have a design for this major national street &mdash; that has been prepared &mdash; with a view to undertaking major renewal in a phased programme as funding became available.  The Central Mall had been identified as having real potential as a pedestrian route.  It must be widened; otherwise people cannot walk around the monuments that are there.  The engineers have drawn up that plan.  Our report stated that while pedestrian operated signal facilities had been installed at the junctions there was serious concern at the level of accidents recorded at the two major pedestrian crossing points at Henry Street-North Earl Street and Upper and Lower Abbey Street.  Unfortunately, it appeared that it might be necessary to erect guard rails at these locations.  The surfacing of the centre mall and the installation of period lighting and seating were to be commenced when <Col N="700" /> North Earl Street and Grafton Street had been completed &mdash; that was when we had the money.  The east and west footways including street furniture and lights were to follow, probably in 1988.  A special treatment to the carriageway &mdash; toned in colour to match or contrast with the paved areas &mdash; was to receive particular consideration.</P>
    <P>I could go on, because of access to many of the records, to point out the plans and levels that Dublin Corporation's engineers have reached, the documents showing all the illegal signs that are there, the powers in the Act under section 11 and the powers that Dublin Corporation have that notice can be served.  Any of us who were ever on a local authority will know the difficulties. You do not just serve a notice.  You must go into long legal battles.  Our plan was to try persuasion.  We have the business community in.  We have given them documents relating to illegal signs.  We have tried to convince them that we have organised competitions for the best shop in O'Connell Street, and have co-operated with the environmental week plan by the Minister to get people to take pride in their shop fronts and lift the level of the city.  We have tried extremely hard, through our senior planners, to bring proper development into the city and are glad that that is being done in a number of our streets.  Unfortunately, there are many plastic shop fronts as in London, Paris and New York.  A good example of what should be done is the <i>Irish Press</i> former office in O'Connell street in which a well known international name did a good job, co-operating in endeavouring to improve the area.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation bring on street cleaners at 6 a.m. in this and other main shopping areas and the streets are cleaned during weekends.  There is an adequate bin collection.  The Central City Business Association have complained; not so much about the cost as the services. When there was criticism, this association came to the rescue of the cleansing department, whose workers <Col N="701" /> they knew by name.  Why all this criticism? Where have Dublin Corporation fallen down on the job?  Who is really criticising the corporation?  The central city businesses, chamber of commerce, individual small shopkeepers and residents of these areas, are working with the corporation.  Our planners and the various members of the staff are known to them.  Is it that the corporation plan was so good that it seemed a good idea to give somebody else the credit?  Did it seem wrong to let that bunch over in City Hall implement such a good plan?</P>
    <P>In replying to the Second Stage debate, will the Minister tell us what will happen to the Dublin Corporation staff who, according to this Bill, are incompetent &mdash;and Deputy Kelly spelled that out in detail?  The Minister said that the corporation were taking this up wrongly, but Deputy Kelly said that they were correct. The Bill says that Dublin Corporation must hand over to the commission the money they have for the streets named in the Bill.  The only way in which Dublin Corporation can hand over this money is by firing the staff if the unions agree to this.  Will the staff resign and take up new employment with the commission?</P>

      <P>If Dublin Corporation staff are going to become agency workers, I am sure that the municipal workers will not be very glad.  I am sure that the Labour Party workers will not be glad to know that they will be working on an agency basis with the Dublin Streets Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is unnecessary.  We all agree with its spirit, to help in an overall plan to revitalise the city.  The policy of Fianna Fáil and all the bodies who submitted proposals in recent times is to get an integrated plan so that the Government of the day, on a phased basis, will pay so much per year to the city council to carry out a proper renewal project for the entire city, not just a few streets.  That would enable the corporation to work with the chamber of commerce, business people and public representatives to try <Col N="702" /> to achieve that aim, to get the institutional funds to put heart into the city, of which we can all be proud.  It is no use setting up an authority here, there or in another spot.  We need Dublin Corporation running the city with resources to do so and proper and adequate staff. The corporation are very proud of their staff.  They may have differences with local authorities, but the corporation are in existence since 1100.  They have done a fairly good job.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the financial climate in the city, the investment climate and confidence in regenerating that city. The corporation will work with that.  Our planners and developers have worked extremely hard to get people to develop the city.  We may have too many food joints in the city centre because nobody else wanted to set up business in O'Connell Street.  Why did Deputy Kelly not praise our planners for encouraging Aquascutum, one of the top businesses in the world, with premises in the best streets, for example, Baker Street in London and Fifth Avenue in New York &mdash;the finest streets in the world.  They came to Grafton Street, just outside Leinster House.  Our planners were instrumental in encouraging them to come there.</P>
    <P>It is the easiest thing to down one's city, be negative and derisive.  It is easy to say that we cannot sweep the streets and do not know how to plant flowers. However, we are receiving international awards for our ability in these areas.  It is a shame that public representatives should make the kind of speeches that we have heard this morning.  The Minister and his colleagues should consider calling back the City Manager who was mentioned in the Bill as about to be honoured with a position.  He is a man for whom we all have a great respect.  He is doing an extremely good job.  The Minister should ask for his plans and proposals and not continue with the Bill.  He should be asked what he has in mind for the streets and should be given £3.4 million so that when the contractor finishes in Liffey Street in three week's time, he will not have to lay off his men but can continue <Col N="703" /> with some of the agreements tediously worked out by city councillors and traders in O'Connell Street about widening the mall and the footpath and extra plantations, sewerage work, improvement of the standard of the pavements and the taking down of illegal signs.  Let him do the job and give him the power to do it. This Bill derides him and his staff.  This legislation ignores the people who have for 700 years looked after the city.</P>
    <P>The tone of this debate was set by Deputy Kelly this morning.  This Bill is about a vote of confidence in Dublin Corporation. This should be remembered by people elected to Dublin Corporation and who have worked hard.  I am not sure who Deputy Kelly is censuring, but as I was one of the few involved people in the House at the time, I must take his criticism personally.  That will not stop the corporation from carrying out their job.  It is a pity that the Deputy did not serve on that body for some time.  He would have realised their difficulties.  He said this morning that the corporation should be abolished and that there should be one person running the city and that local democracy should have no input, that we should have somebody in the Custom House deciding which area to pedestrianise and so forth.</P>

      <P>He sees no room for local input or consultation in the Dublin Development Plan.  This plan is a very detailed document, concerned as it is with inner city renewal, social mixed housing, the policy on refurbishing local authority flats, on zoning, on planning aspects and preserving the city.  These are all included in detailed submissions with videos, slides, documents, maps and charts.  Yet the corporation are told that they are not competent to do the job.  I am glad that we are in this House to defend that body.  Section after section of this Bill says that they are not competent or capable, that the job they are doing is not sufficiently good, even with the miserly resources that they have. <Col N="704" /> Money has been taken away from that body every year since 1983 and still the local authorities managed to do the job. Tomorrow, Dublin Corporation open one of the largest schemes ever done in any city in Europe, the greater Dublin drainage scheme.  This will be carried out by Dublin Corporation, city council engineers and planners.  This is hailed by our management as one of the best schemes of all.  Yet, it appears we are not capable of cleaning the streets of Dublin or to grow tulips.  If it was not so incredible you could laugh.</P>
      <P>This Bill derived from the Frank Feely report which was published 18 months before the Bill was drafted.  All the documents and the maps were copied.  It was supposed to be a Government plan but it is not.  It is a Dublin Corporation plan that was picked up by a Minister and sold through a PR hype.  During the summer people said that Fianna Fáil are against it.  We are in favour of everything that is in that document but we want the people who have carried out that work for many years to continue doing so, namely, the Dublin Corporation.  The Minister has considerable say in local authorities and he used his position as chairman of the local authority to great effect.  He developed Malahide Castle and would like praise for it.  Is he saying in this Bill that Dublin Corporation cannot do this type of work?  I recommend to the House that it be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill which we are debating is a measure introduced by the Government which will give a facelife to the centre of Dublin and will win the support of every Dubliner who visits the centre of the city regularly.  It is imaginative and long overdue.  There was a time, and thousands of Dubliners will remember it, when O'Connell Street was a street to be proud of and to be enjoyed. The commission may not be able to restore the elements of a long lost Dublin but they may at last succeed in getting rid of much of what has been defaced in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Dublin crisis conference was held in <Col N="705" /> the Synod Hall last February.  One of the conclusions was that the city is poised at a critical point in its history.  With the Government's package of tax incentives for inner city renewal and now an announcement for a commission to take charge of the city centre, these are real signs that the tide is turning in the right direction at last.  It behoves this House to support this measure.  Deputy Burke said this morning that the Bill is an erosion of local government and said it would take powers away from the democratically elected citizens and transfer them to non-elected boards or political appointees. This will not be the case.  The commission will act as a medium for upgrading the area of our capital city which has national significance and needs a once-off boost. The commission will have a very limited life and will perform a task which would be beyond the capacity of Dublin Corporation in normal circumstances because of the rate of demands and services to be provided in the entire borough area.  There is no question of taking away any powers.  After three years all the powers assigned to the commission, many of which will be carried out by Dublin Corporation on an agency basis, will be transferred back to Dublin Corporation. I hope that the desired improvements in the character and appearance of the city centre will be completed by then.  I am satisfied that the commission represents no threat to local democracy.  Its establishment is necessary to preserve and improve the metropolitan area in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Dublin is not just a capital city but it is also the flagship of the nation and it is important that everybody should realise that.  I fail to understand the arguments put forward by Fianna Fáil.  The Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982, which was established by the then Fianna Fáil Government proposed the establishment of urban development commissions to secure the regeneration of designated urban areas.  The Bill provided that these commissions would have power to acquire land for the purpose of carrying out their functions.  Any development carried out or approved by the urban <Col N="706" /> development commission within its area would be exempt from planning permission. The Bill provided for the establishment of the Dublin walled city development.  It appeared that there was to be no end to the lifespan of this commission as there was no provision for the dissolution of the commission within a verified time scale.  Therefore, this Bill was likely to be far more damaging to local democracy than any measure proposed in the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill, 1986.  When Committee Stage of the Urban Renewal Bill was debated in this House on 28 May the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Burke, moved an amendment proposing the establishment of a development authority for the Dublin medieval walled areas in order that the areas be developed.  I will quote from his speech because I fail to understand the arguments put forward by Fianna Fáil.  He said in Vol. 367, column 320, of the Official Report dated 28 May:</P>
    <P>... but Dublin Corporation have failed miserably over the years to give this area the consideration it deserves ...</P>
    <P>From listening to speakers today it would appear that when Fianna Fáil introduce a measure such as this they attack Dublin Corporation, as they did in the instance I quoted, but when we introduce a measure to improve the city they fall over praising Dublin Corporation.  They are playing politics with the city and the environment which people enjoy so much and in which they take such a great pleasure. This is a sad aspect of this whole operation.</P>

      <P>That might not last for ever.  I hate to see the notion put forward in the House that the passing of this Bill will be a vote of no confidence in Dublin Corporation.  That is a disgraceful attitude to adopt.  There are many good measures in this Bill.  I am sorry that some <Col N="707" /> of the Fianna Fáil Deputies on Dublin Corporation have left the House.  Deputy Lemass will remember the struggle we had for many years in order to get parked buses off O'Connell Street.  CIE had a habit of parking empty buses in the middle of O'Connell Street.  There are many such problems in the city which need the assistance of a commission to help Dublin Corporation with their plans. Deputy Ahern read out a list of proposals of Dublin Corporation.  They will need support in implementing them and they will get this support from the commission. They will get the extra finance that is needed.  I would like to see the commission and Dublin Corporation acting as a joint venture in uplifting the city centre.  This is badly needed.  The Bill gives strength to the enforcement of laws. Deputy Ahern referred to the fact that when somebody puts up a sign illegally in the city it takes years for the planning authority to have them removed.  I am glad that this Bill will give assistance in that area.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the professional staff of Dublin Corporation, the administrative and the engineering staff.  They do an excellent job.  We have seen tremendous progress in recent years with the repaving of Henry Street, Mary Street and Liffey Street and the pedestrianisation of certain sections of the city.  We are making very good progress. This Bill has come at an appropriate time to give Dublin Corporation the impetus they need to renew the centre of the city. There are a number of problems in the city centre and if they are left to Dublin Corporation alone, it will take them a long time to come to terms with them. This Bill will help to expendite the work that needs to be done and I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about two different things in this debate.  We are talking about a short-term policy for the centre of the capital city and also about the Dublin region.  In recent times we read headlines in the papers &mdash; we have to take notice of them even though we do not always believe them &mdash; such <Col N="708" /> as &ldquo;Dublin in a state of crisis&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dirty Dublin&rdquo;, &ldquo;City falling apart&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dublin a city built on promises&rdquo;, &ldquo;Outrage at city decay&rdquo;, &ldquo;Expenditure on our roads lowest in Europe&rdquo;.  One cannot but come to the conclusion that there is something definitely wrong.</P>
      <P>I served as a member of Dublin Corporation for ten years and I would agree with Deputy Ahern that they do an extremely good job to the best of their ability.  The parks in Dublin city are the best in Europe and the Parks Department of Dublin Corporation are the best in the whole world.  Street furnishing in the city centre was always well looked after.  They have a problem with litter and planning permission for various aspects of shop fronts.  I give due credit to the city managers we have had in recent years and to the officials, as well as the elected members of Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>There have also been newspaper headlines announcing an £8 million facelift for the Phoenix Park which is, of course, under the jurisdiction of the Office of Public Works.  We also hear that there is to be a £10 million facelift for the city centre, while £58 million is to be spent on development of the port and docks. There is talk of a £5 million busway in Harcourt Street and £10 million for sewage treatment for Dublin Bay.  A facelift is not enough; a transplant is required.  A person who gets a facelift may find it does some good but it does no good if the disease is terminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must plan ahead for the region of Dublin.  There has been much talk about overall design concepts, proposals for general redecoration or action in relation to trees, shrubs and other flora.  That is a very important aspect of the city and its environment and the local authority are the body who should look after that aspect.  But the region of Dublin needs a lot more than pot plants and flowers. Dublin is the capital city and almost half our population now live in the greater Dublin area.  Of that population, 50 per cent are under the age of 25 and in parts of the region the unemployment rate is 20 per cent.  There are problems of unemployment, drugs, vandalism and crime. <Col N="709" /> The whole of the Dublin region is under threat and we must plan ahead.</P>
    <P>Dublin needs more than a lick and a promise.  The centre city now has gambling arcades, take-away food places, derelict sites, gaudy neon lights and declining inner city industries.  The only bright sport is the housing which has been provided in recent years by Dublin Corporation. This has helped to change the face of the city considerably.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke spoke this morning about an integrated development plan for the greater Dublin region.  He quoted an answer to a question to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes.  The question was put down by Deputy Andrews and the Minister referred in his reply to a question I had asked in the European Parliament.  The question asked in this House was a follow up to my original question.  The subject of my question was a new integrated development operation for Dublin.  I asked if the Commission would take immediate steps to initiate aid for a new integrated development operation for Dublin under the heading already provided for in the general budget of the European Communities in view of the major unemployment and infrastructural crisis affecting the city.  I received a lengthy reply from Commissioner Richard, some of which I will repeat to the House.  Commissioner Richard said:</P>
    <P>The Commission is aware of the seriour social and economic problems in Dublin.  It is always prepared to consider jointly with the national and local authorities in Ireland any proposals for the improvement of the situation in Dublin.  Such joint consultations may be within the context of an integrated operation for the area or within the framework of existing aid, whichever approach offers the greater benefit to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Regarding the future development of the Dublin area, including the possibility of an integrated operations feasibility study, Commissioner Richard went on to say:</P>
    <P>The Commission is not yet in a position <Col N="710" /> to make formal proposals to the Council for utilisation of the special budget line for Dublin due to reservations on the part of the Irish national authorities as to the benefits of the integrated approach.</P>
    <P>I was then in a position to ask a supplementary question, as follows:</P>
    <P>Would the Commissioner not agree that it is highly regrettable that the budget line which specifically mentioned Dublin in relation to an integrated development plan should have been deleted, and that it is particularly regrettable that this should have happened during the Irish presidency?</P>
    <P>This happened during the Irish presidency and I and my colleagues had an amendment to the budget reinstating the line about Dublin.  Now it is under threat again because nobody in the Government here is interested in making any kind of proposals to Brussels for money for Dublin.  The Commissioner answered me again as follows:</P>
    <P>The Commission has taken a generally favourable line about the possibility of an integrated operations feasibility study for the Dublin area.  It is very much a matter, I think, for the authorities in Ireland to decide whether that is a procedure that they wish to explore further.</P>
    <P>Obviously they do not want to explore it further.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked the Minister for the Environment about the £10 million allocated by him for sewage treatment schemes in Dublin Bay.  I asked was it paid from EC funds.  He said that projects are not submitted for EC funding until they are under construction or about to commence.  Why not put a whole package together for the greater Dublin area and include all the schemes that are now being spoken about, as well as additions?</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke this morning about the beautiful mall we may have in the city centre and said that pedestrianised areas attract people to them.  I cannot see many people from Tallaght being attracted into <Col N="711" /> the city centre because there is not proper public transport to enable them to get there.  They have only one bus per hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This decision was taken by the Minister of State with responsibility for arts and culture after consultation with the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Since responsibility for the National Museum was transferred in 1984 to the Department of the Taoiseach, various measures to improve and develop the museum have been under consideration. The museum is in need of considerable financial investment if long standing problems in relation to staffing and accommodation are to be resolved and if the museum is to function effectively and provide the service expected from a national cultural institution.</P>
      <P>In the present state of the public finances, the investment required for the proper development of the National Museum needs to be supplemented by resources generated by the museum itself including modest entrance charges and sponsorship.  These two elements have been introduced in the current treasures exhibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of entrance charges to the museum generally, it is intended to introduce a charge for the <Col N="712" /> museum of decorative arts now being developed at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. Major renovation works are due to be carried out in other museum locations, including Kildare Street, during the coming years.  The question of applying an entrance charge generally will be considered when this work is complete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there were major problems in our National Museum.  It needed attention across a whole range of areas &mdash; accommodation, preservation, display and so on.  We are giving it that urgent attention so there have been major developments. Most of the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham has been given over to the decorative arts.  I hope to be able to invite Dáil Deputies to see the new display in the treasury.  It is as good as anything that exists in Europe and has an audio-visual room.  There are also new developments in Kildare Street where a graphical collection will be put on display in a new room, and we want to develop the central court as a gold room.  All of these developments cost a lot of money.  It is necessary to augment the Exchequer contribution in some way such as through sponsorship &mdash; we have a very good example of that in the treasury &mdash; through augmenting the shop which is becoming a major source of income for the British Museum and through charges.  In the interests of progress the introduction of charges will be a good thing.  Contrary to what the Deputy suggests, I believe that proper presentation and display will result in increased attendance at the museum.  I know there has been a fall off in some of the museums in Britain.  But charges are commonplace in virtually all <Col N="713" /> of the European museums.  Britain, despite their experience, recently introduced charges to the Natural History Museum.  Anyone visiting the treasury now would be quite amazed at the difference display and presentation make. In order to improve those areas we must have funds and I believe we will get extra visitors rather than a diminished number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's desire to improve the presentation of our cultural heritage but I do not share his desire to charge the common people for seeing their own national heritage. Would the Minister not regard these charges as a tax on learning?  Do the Government intend to extend this to our schools which are also badly in need of funding?  Does he intend to charge students for entry to our primary schools? Will the Minister not back off and cancel the charges to the treasury?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one free day. There is no admission charge for old age pensioners and for the unwaged.  The charges themselves are very modest &mdash; 30p for children, 20p if they are in a group, £1 for adults, £2 for family tickets and families can bring whatever extended family they wish.  I believe that the good that will flow from this will offset the difficulties the Deputy refers to.  In the general interests of the development at the National Museum these charges are a good thing and that is the reason they are being introduced.  In regard to general charges for the museum that is something for the future.  By that time I hope there will be legislation to have the museum run by a board like the National Gallery or the National Concert Hall, and it will be up to them to make decisions in regard to charges generally.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think the gain is worth a candle?  After all, free admission to museums and galleries is a very old tradition.  As Deputy De Rossa points out, what the Minister is doing is charging for culture and learning.  Is it not a bit artificial to try to justify his position on the basis that it will improve the museum?  Can we have any guarantee that this paltry sum that is expected to be raised will in fact go towards improving the circumstances of the museum?  Will it not, as always happen in these cases, be snaffled by that other treasury, the Department of Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the latter point, we have arranged that all of the funds collected will go towards the development of the museum.  There is no question of their being returned to the Department of Finance.  It is universal practice in continental museums at the moment to have charges.  The Deputy rightly points out that traditionally there were no charges here or in Britain but in those circumstances we allowed our museums to be neglected and fall into decay, and is constantly commented on by the board of visitors.  We had to do something about it.  We will try to get all the tax we can from the Exchequer but we should also seek to augment it.  We are doing that through sponsorship.  We have very handsome sponsorship for the new treasury at the moment.  We also augment it through the new charges.  The charges are modest and we will keep them as low as possible.  The £70,000 or <Col N="715" /> £80,000 will make a handsome contribution to various activities within the museum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): In recent years the CSO have considerably accelerated the production of the annual balance of payments statement and have significantly improved the quality of the estimates.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need for sub-annual estimates of the balance of payments, a quarterly series was introduced by the Central Statistics Office in May 1985 after considerable exploratory work.  Consideration of a monthly set of balance of payments estimates raises major practical problems both of data availability and quality sufficient to produce a consistent month-to-month set of estimates.  The issue of providing the financial resources to produce a monthly series must also be faced.  Only a limited number of countries publish monthly estimates and the evidence from their experience is that this would prove a costly and difficult exercise.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the authorities in assessing developments in the external accounts and formulating policy in relation thereto are not reliant exclusively on the published balance of payments statement.  A wide range of indicators of the evolution of the balance of payments is available to the authorities on an ongoing basis in advance of the CSO estimate.  The trend of the official external reserves is a key element in this assessment and, as the Deputy will be aware, monthly reserves figures are published by the Central Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that as a result of the absence of the <Col N="716" /> publication of these figures on a regular basis all sorts of estimates are made, some of them widely exaggerating the position and some wildly understating the position?  Is the Minister of State further aware that the quarterly figures published are published substantially in arrears and that so far as the public are concerned they are of limited use?  In view of the fact that most other countries seem to be able to produce monthly figures for the balance of payments, which in the last resort are more important than the balance of trade, would he not think it advisable particularly in our circumstances of apparently large outflows both on the current and capital side that these figures be provided here and now?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> Within the next few issues the estimates will be produced within about eight weeks from the end of the quarter in question which is resonable.  In the EC, only Germany produces a full balance of payments statement each month.  Of course the CSO would respond if the policy-making department, the Department of Finance, felt it was necessary.  It is important to take into account the cost factor and the availability of other information, plus the fact that any facts and figures produced should be as accurate as possible.  There is no point in producing figures that, because of the inability to get other information, would not be extremely accurate. That is why it was felt that the issue of quarterly balance of payments statements was sufficient.  As the Deputy is aware that started in May 1985.</P>

      <P>In support of Deputy O'Malley, will the Minister of State say if it is not a fact that the Department of Finance would have very good figures month-by-month?  Does the Minister of State recall that on one occasion here the Taoiseach indicated to us that he has such monthly figures but because it was not the practice he would not disclose them? Will the Minister of State not agree that whereas a final and complete account of all transactions might not be available, key indicators could be given?  The Central Bank certainly would have indicators available to them and the Department of Finance would have reliable figures on a month-by-month basis.  It would be absurd to suggest that the Department of Finance did not know until five or six weeks after the end of the quarter the exact position in regard to the balance of payments.  Are we not dealing simply with the reluctance of the Government and the CSO to publish the figures and not about their availability?  Is it not a question that the figures are available</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> The question table here applies to the Central Statistics Office.  The monthly reserve figures are published by the Central Bank <Col N="718" /> and this is a key element in the assessment. If Deputy Haughey has a question of a policy nature it would be more appropriate to table it to the Minister for Finance.  If the CSO are requested to produce adequate figures or to carry out any survey they will endeavour to do so.  Of course, they would advise on the wisdom of producing them at certain intervals but they will produce figures provided the cost of supplying those figures is met and their advice is taken, but it is really a question for the Department of Finance as to the figures that should or should not be disclosed.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): I propose to circulate a statement giving the information requested by the Deputy in so far as it is available.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>The only reliable estimates of migration are those for net migration between successive censuses of population, that is the difference between the inward and outward flows in the period. The estimate for a period is obtained as the difference between the actual intercensal population change and the natural increase, total births less total deaths.</P>
      <P>In the five year period between the 1981 and 1986 censuses, births exceeded deaths by 169,000.  According to the provisional 1986 census of population figures, the actual increase in population in the same period was 94,000.  The difference of 75,000 is taken as an estimate of net emigration, that is, the extent to which outward migration in the 1981-1986 period was greater than inward migration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> As indicated in the published Preliminary Report on the 1986 Census, following the availability of the provisional population figures and a review of the various indicators of population changes since 1981, population estimates for mid-April 1982-1985 were revised slightly. Using these revised population estimates in conjunction with appropriate 12 monthly data for births and deaths, the estimated net outflow for each year (to mid-April) of the intercensal period is estimated as follows:</P>

    <P>Information in respect of the destination of emigrants is not available.  In the absence of comprehensive documentary or other administrative procedures relating to the movement of persons into and out of the State, there is no way of determining the actual number of inward and outward migrants in any period or the destination of those emigrating.</P>
    <P>In respect of county population movements, estimates can be made using the method already indicated.  By relating the intercensal population changes for a county with corresponding data for births and deaths, an estimate of net migration can be compiled for that county.  In the context of the county estimates it should be clearly understood that the net migration figure reflects movements into and from other counties as well as movements into and out of the State.</P>
    <P>The following table shows the estimated net migration (inward less outward) in the 1981-1986 intercensal period for counties and county boroughs.

    <P>* As information on Births and Deaths cannot be compiled retrospectively for the new Dublin Counties and for Galway County Borough (as defined in the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985) the natural increase and net migration for the 1981-1986 intercensal period are not available in respect of these areas.</P>

    <P>On the advice given to me by the Central <Col N="722" /> Statistics Office on the setting up of a monitoring system, I am satisfied that, especially in view of the problems associated with surveying among the large number of people entering and leaving this country, the comparatively small number who are actually permanent migrants, the accuracy of the results that would be obtained could well not justify the cost of any monitoring system that would be acceptable.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The merger referred to by the Deputy was not the subject of a notification to my Department under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  The criteria for the notification of a proposed merger are set out in the Act which also provides that title to any shares or assets involved in a notifiable merger cannot pass in the absence of a decision by the Minister for Industry and Commerce allowing the proposal to proceed or unless the relevant period under the Act expires.  Given the nature of this sanction, it would seem the companies in question were satisfied that a notification pursuant to the Act was not required.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The obligation is on the company, not on the Department.  The Act is self-policing because shares cannot pass and mergers cannot take place unless the law is complied with.  If companies are required under law to notify and they do not do so then the merger cannot take place.  It is like selling your house; the legal advisers must be satisfied in regard to the title and if that is wrong, regardless of what the monitoring agency says.  the sale cannot be completed.  This merger occurred and there is plenty of circumstantial evidence to indicate there was no obligation to <Col N="726" /> notify because it did not come within limits of the 1978 Act.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Substantial efforts continue to be made to persuade car manufacturers selling their vehicles in Ireland to manufacture components in this country and also to increase their purchase of components made here.  To date, three car manufacturers or their distributors have established manufacturing plants in Ireland employing in excess of 1,000.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority are actively encouraging other car manufacturers to set up manufacturing facilities here and maintain regular contact with these companies as part of their ongoing activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>) There <Col N="728" /> has been a perception that employment in the manufacture of auto components here has not been great.  That is not correct. There are more than 7,000 people now employed in 100 firms in the country. More than 50 of the firms, mainly German and American, are supplying original equipment manufacturers, and that accounts for more than 80 per cent of the Irish employment.  As well, exports are currently running at £250 million per annum.  This has been increasing steadily since 1978.  We are talking about 7,000 jobs, 100 firms, many of whom are supplying the home market, and £250 million worth of exports.  That is very significant. The second part of the question suggests we should try to get involved in counter-trade pressure.  We, more than any other country, depend on free trade in Europe and we will not go into barter or counter-trade or anything like that.  However, we will promote the auto components sector very actively, but not on the basis of counter-trade with people who are exporting motor cars into Ireland.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister for a comment on the Japanese car exporters whose products constitute a major portion of our imports.  The major Japanese car exporters are providing employment in Ireland by the manufacture of components here, but are there negotiations or discussions under way with any of these firms that might induce them to participate in providing more employment here, having regard to the enormous value of our imports of Japanese cars?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): German and American companies are mainly involved in the manufacture of auto components here, but there are significant sales to Japan.  One motor vendor here, Toyota, are involved in technological transfer with some companies, not in the auto components sector, but the goodwill that has been generated by the activity of selling Toyota cars here has resulted in a very significant technological transfer by the Japanese company involved, in the <Col N="729" /> formulation of plastic pallets.  It is very advanced and very technically desirable. The IDA are now concentrating more on Japan than they were previously. although they never neglected Japan. The move in Japan now is to set up in Europe to a degree not envisaged by them a few years ago and we hope there will be further results from that, particularly in regard to exports to Japan.  We hope we can manufacture components for some Japenese cars here, but we are particularly interested in technological transfers from Japanese companies exporting to Ireland.  I repeat that the goodwill generated by the sales of cars here can provide the stimulus for that activity as it has done in the past.</P>

Has any pressure been put on that company to set up component manufacturing facilities in Ireland in view of the fact that they have withdrawn from assembly here, having replaced it with a slick manufacturing effort to try to put across their patriotism.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): It is very difficult to relate liquidations or receiverships to job losses.  It does not necessarily follow that because you have a large number of liquidations that you have a large number of job losses.  In 1983, there were 522 liquidations; in 1984, 584 and in 1985, 632.  In that context, 384 liquidations to date this year is not a massive number of liquidations.</P>

I would like to point out that in the United States whose economy is very buoyant at present they have never had as many liquidations.  It does not necessarily follow that an economy is going down when you have liquidations.  Very often, when people are trying to establish new businesses there are many liquidations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 16 together.  The accounts of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland for the two year period ended 31 December 1985 which were prepared by the administrator and subjected to detailed audit by the statutory auditors disclose a net balance sheet deficiency of £226 million.</P>
      <P>As I already stated in this House on the occasion of the Adjournment Debate on 10 June last, no part of the cost of administration will fall on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> The cost of arranging the £100 million loan already advanced is being borne by the banking sector in line with the Central Bank's statement of 4 October 1985.  If any further funds are required in the medium term to finance working capital these will be arranged on the basis of commercial borrowing, the cost of which will be serviced by the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give details of how this £226 million deficit occurred?  In reply to a similar question of mine in May last the Minister told me that the deficit amounted to £164 million.  At that time the Minister felt that with a deficit of £164 million the £100 million was adequate and that the Central Bank could deal with the matter.  In view of the extra net deficit of £100 million that has been disclosed, will the Minister state if he believes the £100 million from the Central Bank will be adequate?  How can he give an assurance that either the Central Bank or the taxpayer will not have to throw in another £100 million?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £164 million quoted by the Deputy was arrived at by the administrator after a short time in the company and was based on the best actuarial and legal advice available to him at that stage.  The audited accounts of ICI up to 31 December 1985 reflect the administrator's judgment of the company's financial position in the light of further adjustments and more detailed examination.  On the question of the adequacy of the £100 million loan I should like to tell the Deputy that according to the balance sheet of 31 December 1985 the liquidator has liquid assets to the tune of £173 million.  The company is continuing to operate well and is generating a cash flow.  I am confident that should there be a requirement for further working capital it will be arranged on the basis of commercial borrowing by the administrator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the £226 million is the deficit according to the balance sheet as of 31 December 1985 and it allows for the auditor's estimates of liabilities he will have to meet over a period of years. It takes into account the assets he has on hand in the company.  It is a net figure, netting out the liabilities expected to occur over a number of years and the existing assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>There were losses of more than £300 million prior to Mr. McCann taking over.  Is it true that there were further losses of £85 million since then?  If that is so, the losses of the company would be of the order of £400 million.</P>

As I explained earlier, the £164 million was the provisional figure arrived at by the administrator after a relatively short period in the company.  Insurance some time is required by the administrator to get a firm hold of the figures.  The figure he has produced is the net balance sheet deficit at the end of December 1985, based on a detailed examination.  That figure has been confirmed by the auditors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware of the position concerning the towns mentioned by the Deputy.  I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that they are continuing their drive to attract new overseas industry to the area, to stimulate further growth of indigenous industry and to provide a solid foundation on which a thriving and enterprising small business sector can grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These efforts have brought about the recent announcement that Tatung Company of Taiwan have now signed agreements to establish a new consumer electronics facility in Drogheda.  This project is expected to provide 200 new jobs within the first two years of production and this is scheduled to commence in the middle of next year.  It is <Col N="743" /> hoped that a further 400 jobs will be created over the following three years if the project proceeds as planned.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year IDA approved grant assistance for a major development plan by Ecco Limited in Dundalk, involving an investment of £17 million and expected additional employment of 280 by 1990.</P>
    <P>Also during 1985 other projects including Keytronic Limited, Riverside Manufacturing, C.  Step and Panex were approved grant assistance and commenced production in the area.  In addition the establishment of the North East Region Small Industries Board has given a local impetus to the promotion of small industry.  The board approved 20 such projects in County Louth during 1985 with estimated total employment of 200 at full production.  To date in 1986 it has approved 15 such projects with an estimated employment of approximately 80 at full production.</P>
    <P>The IDA will, through its comprehensive range of incentives for manufacturing industry continue to promote County Louth and its resources as a location for new industrial projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the difficulties being experienced by indigenous exporters because of the exchange rate situation; and the steps now open to him to see to it that there are no further closures and job losses in these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The effects of the exchange rate situation are difficult to quantify and are not all negative.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a member of the European Monetary System; the UK is not.  While that situation continues sterling is free to fluctuate without limit in relation to EMS currencies.  The present exchange rate of sterling has enhanced the competitive position of Irish firms which import raw materials and capital goods from the UK. Those imports which are significant, are now substantially cheaper.</P>
      <P>Th recent devaluation of 8 per cent of the punt in the European Monetary System has provided a competitive advantage to Irish exports to continental EEC countries which now account for a greater share of total Irish exports than the UK.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the competitive position of Irish Exporters in the UK market has been enhanced <i>vis-à-vis</i> those of other EMS countries whose currencies have strengthened against sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is precisely because of exchange rate difficulties that CTT launched, in September 1986, a major initiative to help indigenous exporters to direct their efforts away from the UK and US towards markets where no such difficulties exist.  This initiative seeks to reap the benefits in European markets arising from the recent devaluation of the punt against EMS currencies.  I am glad to <Col N="745" /> report that about 300 firms have already committed themselves to taking part in the campaign.  The new initiative is, of course, supplemental to CTT's existing range of services to exporters.</P>
    <P>I might add that, in common with wages, quality, marketing, delivery and after sales service, exchange rate fluctuations are but one of a variety of cost elements which affect the competitive position of any firm.  It follows that firms must adjust the balance of these elements as best they can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand the Minister's continued complacency in this matter.  Does he realise that two-thirds of our total trade is outside the EMS anyway?  Does he really believe that indigenous Irish industries manufacturing and exporting, and without the import content from outside our own jurisdiction, are in grave difficulty?  Does the Minister accept that to be the case?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy is probably aware of a survey of Irish industry carried out earlier in the year where people were asked to nominate their preferred exchange rate against sterling.  Speaking from memory, it ranged from about 78p to the pound right up to 126p.  There is no possibility of having an exchange rate with sterling which satisfies all manufacturing industry because they do not have the same constraints or the same objectives.  I accept that certain companies have had difficulty and that the devaluation of the punt last August has helped them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the study indicated that 80 per cent of those involved stated that their preferred rate was less than 85p to the pound?  Is the Minister aware that some 80 indigenous exporting firms employing about 7,000 people are in danger of closing in the immediate future because of the difficulties of exchange rate control?  Has the Minister undertaken any industrial cost relativity study in this area?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My Department constantly monitor the difficulties of Irish industry and use the resources of the State agencies in so doing.  Obviously the exchange rate with the pound sterling is a major factor in the cost competitiveness of Irish industry especially exporting to the United Kingdom, but there are swings and roundabouts.  Those who are importing substantial amounts of raw material, especially from the UK, are gaining. Those who are trading into the EMS countries are at an advantage due to the devaluation of the punt.  People competing with European exporters in the UK markets have also gained as a result of the devaluation.  We are monitoring the situation.  I appreciate the difficulty of some firms but the difficulties of some are not the practice of all.  Is the Deputy advocating a devaluation?  There will be no devaluation of the Irish pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am advocating something entirely different.  I am advocating that the Minister might take some steps to bring about an improvement regarding basic input costs.  This is a matter directly under the Minister's control but he will not do anything.  Is the Minister aware that by his inactivity he is forcing Irish exporters to source their inputs from outside this jurisdiction and that this is causing grave difficulty?  Will he accept that half of the output of indigenous exporters goes to the UK?  That is the market where there is greatest difficulty.  Only one-third of our total exports goes to the EMS countries.  I am not recommending devaluation &mdash; the Government made a botch of it the first time they took that step.  They were forced into it and everything went wrong.  However, there are areas related to basic industrial inputs which the Minister could adjust, thereby saving 7,000 jobs.  Will the Minister take the initiative?</P>

As far as my Department have power &mdash; and I still have all the powers under the Prices Acts &mdash; the benefit of declining energy and import <Col N="747" /> prices is being transferred as rapidly as possible to industry.  The Deputy seems to want it both ways.  We cannot be tied to two different currency systems: we cannot be tied to sterling and to the EMS. It was the administration from the other side of the House who took the decision to enter the EMS and I regard that decision as right.  When we are part of the club we must keep the rules.  As well as being tied to the EMS we cannot be tied to a currency which is constantly swinging up and down.  It cannot be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the effect that the cost of employers and public liability insurance can have on production and employment levels.  The root cause of high insurance premiums is the high cost of claims.  Concerted action is being taken to bring claims cost under control.  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Justice has introduced a Bill to abolish the jury award system in cases of personal injuries and that the Minister for Labour has established a new board for occupational safety and health and will shortly introduce legislation to promote occupational safety.  In addition, an inter-departmental committee, chaired by my Department, have been established to bring forward specific recommendations to bring about a real reduction in the cost of employers and public liability insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that all of these measures will go a long way towards at least stabilising the cost of insurance.  I must, <Col N="748" /> however, emphasise that the people with the greatest opportunity to reduce premiums are employers and employees themselves, by demonstrating a greater awareness of the importance of safety in the workplace.  A reduction in the level of industrial accidents is guaranteed to reduce the cost of employers and public liability insurance as the level of accidents determines the level of claims paid which, in turn, directly determines the level of premium which must be charged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Minister's benefit, the figure is about 3 per cent of manufacturing payroll and our competitors have only to pay 1 per cent.  Therefore there is a 2 per cent disadvantage for a start.  Is the Minister aware that in the heavy industries sector premiums in PL and EL for Irish manufacturers run anywhere from five times the average for the United Kingdom and other EC countries to 15 times?  Does he recognise that that is causing great difficulties as a basic primary cost to the manufacturing industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problems of high employers' and public liability. The figure quoted by the Deputy of 3 per cent average is higher than one I have heard quoted by the CII, which was 2½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the discrepancy between the figure for Irish manufacturing industry and our competitors, and particularly with regard to the United Kingdom, stems from the high level of claims we are now experiencing. <Col N="749" /> For the period from 1979 to 1985 the number of claims increased by 35 per cent, despite a stable level of employment. The cost of claims between 1981 and 1985 doubled from £46 million to £96½million.  The problems we have here are due to a high percentage of claims and also the fact that pay levels here are automatically three to four times those of the United Kingdom.  However, I am satisfied that we are taking steps, as I have outlined in my reply, on the question of eliminating the jury system and improving safety in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <P>As price control was abolished in early 1986, I no longer approve increases in premiums.  Instead, insurance companies notify my Department of proposed increases and these are queried if they appear excessive.</P>
      <P>This year 14 notifications of increases in motor insurance premiums have been received.  The increases applied to general motor accounts were in the main in the range of 5 to 10 per cent.  Increases applied to commercial and other particular segments of portfolios ranged in the main from 8 to 35 per cent, reflecting larger losses on these classes.</P>
      <P>Loadings on drivers aged under 25 years vary from company to company. They range from 50 per cent to 150 per cent depending on the company and the age involved.</P>
      <P>The distribution of different categories of motorists among insurers depends on their portfolio and marketing strategies. Some companies specialise in particular segments.  I am not aware that any particular category is being turned away by insurers generally.  As the Deputy is aware, cover is available for every category of motorist if necessary via the declined cases agreement.</P>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board were given, as their main task, the establishment of a statistical base which would yield comparisons of and a basis for the rates being applied to various categories of driver.  This complex work is well advanced and the statistical returns from insurers will enable the board to give informed advice on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been speaking about an integrated development plan for the city of Dublin.  The only way to tackle the problem of the greater Dublin area is as a unit.  Many thousands of families who lived in the central city are now living on the outskirts and feel isolated.  They also belong to the inner part of the city.  We cannot begin to think about the inner city without considering these areas.</P>
      <P>An integrated development programme for the Dublin region would include infrastructure and transport which would include the extension of the DART to Tallaght, Lucan, Clondalkin and Clonsilla.  It would include provisions relating to pollution of the air and to pollution in Dublin Bay because there are problems in that respect.  It would also include the revitalising of inner city industries and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly mentioned this morning that when bringing guests or visitors from the airport he went two miles out of his way so as not to go through the inner city.  That is a very sad reflection on the inner city and on everybody who has anything to do with it.  I agree that the inner city is not a place to bring tourists at the moment.  That is a great pity because we have a very historic and noble city.  It would be a great venue for tourists if we <Col N="846" /> could get our act together on this matter.</P>
    <P>An integrated development programme would produce greater results than would be obtained by carrying out different measures separately, one after the other.  In addition, there would be priority access to the Community's various structural funds and finance instruments and it would enable the maximum rates of assistance for the project.  I cannot understand why we are not going about this in the right way.  As I said already and it was mentioned earlier today, a feasibility study could be carried out and would be funded by the EC.  The EC would give 75 per cent of the total cost without any problem whatsoever. They are only waiting to be asked and they cannot understand why we are not asking for that money.  The feasibility study would have to have the support of the member state which obviously this has not got.  It would have the support of the local authorities but the Government of the member state has to initiate the project.</P>
    <P>The integrated approach was adopted by the Commission because it was considered to be the most effective way of using Community funds particularly in regions affected by serious problems.  I regard Dublin as a region with serious problems.  In 1981 the Commission introduced priority treatment for operations jointly financed by two or more of the Community funds.  The integrated approach is now the method which is considered to be by far the best way of making the most of the available moneys from Europe.  It only stands to reason that if you get moneys from the Regional or Social funds or by way of FEOGA grants and loans from the EIB, or from the bank in Luxembourg and if you pool all that money together and have an intergrated approach you will get far better value and better results from the moneys available.  The Commission would seek to facilitate and encourage &mdash; these are their words &mdash; the access of all member states to the integrated approach.  Their implementation would become progressively more feasible as community, national, regional and local authorities <Col N="847" /> would gain from the experience of working together in such a framework.</P>
    <P>We have all heard about the first integrated development programme and the projects that were carried out for Belfast and Naples.  The integrated development operation in Belfast began in 1981.  In this context an extra £58 million sterling was allocated for urban renewal in the area of Belfast covered by the integrated development operation.  The total amount paid out from the structural funds was £41.3 million and the EIB loans amounted to £22.6 million.  Approximately two-thirds of the investments envisaged in 1981 have been realised in Belfast.  Several large structural projects have been completed with Community aid.  These included roads, Belfast docks and a hospital.  The most important progress was made in urban renewal of the poorest sections of the city.  The sectors developed included infrastructure, tourism, trade and development.  These are the kind of developments we need in Dublin.  The only way to go about this is by doing what the Community is now suggesting.  I feel very strongly about this. There was no feedback whatsoever from the Coalition Government over the past two years.  I asked questions in the European Parliament and questions have been asked of Ministers in this House but they were met with a blank wall.</P>
    <P>I decided recently to take a motion for resolution on an integrated development programme for the Dublin area to the European Parliament. This document is now with the European Parliament.  It will be circulated to the Commission, the Council and to the Government here.  It is at present with the Regional Policy and Planning Committee.  My reasons for doing this were, (a), having regard to the preamble of the Treaty of Rome which calls for a reduction in the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions; (b), I was aware that the most deprived and least favoured regions include all peripheral and island regions of the Community; (c), Dublin city and <Col N="848" /> county is experiencing very great difficulties at present; (d), 35 per cent of the nation's population live in this area; (e), I was concerned about the grave economic and social problems of the region where unemployment averages 20 per cent, where 50 per cent of the population are under 25 and where crime, vandalism and drug abuse reached alarming levels; (f), I was deeply concerned that the decline of the inner city where many buildings lie derelict while families live in inadequate housing or are homeless has become a serious problem; (g), the lack of adequate infrastructural transport and recreational facilities to serve the area; (h), I was concerned about the levels of pollution caused by smoke and exhaust emissions and the discharge of pollutants into Dublin Bay estuary; (i), those engaged in market gardening in north County Dublin face grave difficulties because of the lack of appropriate marketing and processing structures; (j), I was aware of the need to provide greater incentives to boost tourism in the area; (k), I stressed the importance of large scale integrated programmes combining applications for regional and social investment &mdash; note that the greater efforts required to set up these measures are rewarded by the improved uses of Community, national and regional expenditure &mdash;; (1), I recalled the success and dedicated commitment involved in setting up integrated development programmes for Naples and Belfast; (m), I considered that the difficulties of the area justified special support and action by the Community and (n), item 5412 of the European Community budget for 1986 makes a commitment of 1.3 million ECU's to be used to finance specialised sections in the framework for integrated operations in areas of the Community affected by exceptionally high levels of unemployment and an absence of basic social and economic infrastructure, for example, Dublin.  That is on the line in the budget.  Dublin is specifically mentioned. (1) The Commission are called on in consultation with Dublin city and county council authorities to draw up proposals for an integrated development <Col N="849" /> programme in the area.  (2) It is recommended that the proposals and objectives of such a study should be to consider long term unemployment, the improvement of housing, transport and regional and social infrastructures and the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>You will see that I have taken into account all aspects of the greater region of Dublin.  They are all important, and if this capital city of ours is to improve, if it is to become an area where we can be proud and not ashamed to bring our tourists through O'Connell Street, as suggested by Deputy Kelly this morning, we will have to tackle the problem of Dublin as a development area in the long term, not over three years but over a period of ten to 15 years.  I believe that it will take six months at least to get this commission even working.  I go home along Cuffe Street through Kevin Street in the evening and recently any evening that I have been going home around five o'clock there is a traffic jam there because at the corner of Cuffe Street and Wexford Street road widening is in process.  It is only a matter of about 40 yards but there have been traffic jams there for the last three or four months and the red and black oil cans are still sitting down in the centre of that road.  There is one line of traffic where there should be three.  If it takes three to four months to take a small corner off a roadway, what on earth can you do with the city of Dublin or the streets that have been mentioned in three years, because that is the time this commission will have?</P>
    <P>As I said, Dublin needs more than a few pot plants and flowers.  I agree with the city being decorated and beautiful.  I agree with window boxes.  I have seen some European cities which are absolutely beautiful with their window boxes and flowers.  I agree with a face lift if the rest of the body is in good health.  I hope that when this report is formulated by the regional policy in Dublin and when it goes before the European Parliament for discussion, which should be in the next couple of months, it will be accepted by that parliament.  The report should not be just about Dublin and I hope that it <Col N="850" /> will be integrated into a programme of development operation for the rest of Ireland.  It is not just in Dublin that we should see this happening.  I want to see it happening in the west, the north west and the south west.  When you put a whole package together you get an area moving much more rapidly and efficiently.  This report will cover the whole of the country and one section of the legislation will be about Dublin.  I look forward to the outcome of this report.  I hope that when it is finished and passed by the European Parliament the Government of the day will take note of it and will consider seriously the programme for this capital city of ours which we should be proud of and which we should be encouraging all the people from the rest of the EC to come and visit, and we should not be ashamed to go down O'Connell Street and see derelict sites and the very bad situation as at the moment.</P>

      <P>It is not often that a Deputy from Dublin has the opportunity to stand up here and welcome a Bill which is so positive and completely designed to meet a very special need and which has been so universally welcomed by the people of Dublin who will be affected by the consequences of this Bill when it comes into operation.  I am astonished at the reaction from the Opposition benches to this proposal.  The criticism has been firstly that we should do nothing until there is this great integrated plan for all of Dublin, or else it has been carping, talking about face lifts, flower pots and cosmetic changes, when this Bill is designed to meet a very specific problem, a crisis in that part of our city which is familiar to the entire population of Dublin, familiar on a day to day basis to people who live and work in the areas affected by this Bill.  It is familiar to the people of Dublin as a whole who on a weekly or a monthly basis will be in the city centre and it is familiar to the vast number of people who come to Dublin from the county at different times.  This Bill is designed to deal with a problem of crisis proportions which is obvious to all <Col N="851" /> the people I have mentioned.  There is no need to labour the point.  All of us are familiar with what some have described in colourful terms.  The decline of Dublin has been rapid and almost unrestricted because of the weakness of our planning powers and the absence of a co-ordinated body with sufficient powers, because of the strength and constitutional protection of private property, the far too great protection of private property in our Constitution. Because of the scarcity of money it has not been possible in the past to attack this problem in a unified, energetic and imaginative way.</P>
      <P>The reason has been, as has been pointed out here from all sides of the House, that of individual developments, a city where there has been no overall concept of development, a city centre which has great potential which all of us recognise but which the city itself and the powers of the city have never been in a position to develop in the way they should, a city centre about which it is difficult to feel any great sense of pride. Thirty, 40 or 50 years ago the people of Dublin were very proud of O'Connell Street, of Nelson's Pillar, of the widest street in Europe, as it was often called, and were proud to show it off to those who came to the city.  Today those who take visitors around Dublin will get around the city centre as quickly as they can and take those visitors out to Howth or Killiney but as far from the city centre as possible.</P>
      <P>When the Minister published this Bill last June there was an immediate reaction from the Opposition that it was not possible to take this Bill in the time available, and so for political reasons the Bill was set aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech this morning quoted a very positive reaction from the business people and the tourist groups in Dublin city.  They saw what this Bill was designed to do.  They knew how badly it was needed.  The public, the ordinary people showed a great deal of interest in what was being debated.  Many whom I spoke to were astonished at the reaction to the fact that Dáil Éireann was getting <Col N="852" /> down to tackling a problem which had not been tackled for many years beforehand. The proposal caught the imagination of the general public.  They were aware of the extent of the problem because once more people in this city want to have a city centre of which they can be justly proud.  They want to be able to show it off, to have that possibility become a reality.  They were delighted that a real start was at last being made to tackle this problem.  The ordinary people could not understand the attitude of the Opposition in this matter.  Many members of the Opposition found it difficult to understand why this was being taken in their name.  Urban decay or increasing tattiness are not unique to Dublin.  Every great capital city has had to face up to the problems brought about by rapid cultural, social and economic changes, by changes in the classes of transport and by changing lifestyles.</P>
    <P>In some cases the attempts were drastic and unsuccessful.  I believe there are very few Parisians who will forgive the late President and Prime Minister Georges Pompidou for what his Government did to large parts of Paris in their interests of greater traffic mobility and of property developers.  But right across Northern Europe and America there are many examples of cities faced with the decay of the grand centres of the cities but which tackled with imagination, with boldness and, in the process, not just transformed the city centres but harnessed the energy and the gratitude of their own citizens.  There are many examples of cities that have tackled this problem with both taste and imagination. We now in Dublin have the opportunity to be another such city.  As the Minister said this morning, we have an opportunity to take a very hard look at what has happened and the opportunity to translate our findings into action and reality.  We have the opportunity to do this not over a period of decades or years but in a very short timespan.</P>
    <P>At this stage I must take issue with some of the strictures of my colleague, Deputy John Kelly, about Dublin Corporation and their role.  Before I became <Col N="853" /> a member of the corporation I was frequently, in an uninformed way, critical of their work but having, over the past year and a half, seen the work of the corporation at first hand, seen the quality of the officials, their extraordinary sense of commitment to the city of Dublin and the commitment of members in all sides and in all parties on the corporation.  I think that the strictures of Deputy Kelly are very seriously misplaced.  The corporation are not a soulless, bureaucratic, tasteless institution.  They are one of the most genuinely personal institutions I have ever had the opportunity to see in action, and there can be no questioning the extent and depth of their commitment at all levels.  Where they have had the opportunity to use their imagination, where they have been given adequate funds, they have done extraordinarily good work.  One only has to look at the housing developments in many parts of the inner city to see just what the corporation can do when they are given the opportunity.  I believe that the parks department of Dublin Corporation is probably one of the best in Europe, if not in the world.  I certainly do not know of any city which can boast of parks which are so well designed, so well kept, so ornamental and enjoyable as are the parks of this city.  More recently, the plans of the corporation to develop Bull Island are another example of what they are capable of doing when they have the opportunity.  I certainly resent any suggestion that the streets commission Bill is a question of the Minister and the Government, through the commission, taking on the corporation.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a question of the commission working with the corporation towards the achievement, in a short space of time &mdash; and using perhaps more direct methods than are normally possible &mdash; of an end which is profoundly to be desired both by the corporation and by the members of the new commission and by all those who would support this Bill in this House.</P>
    <P>One important aspect of this Bill is that it does not just seek to improve the level of taste and design in the areas which <Col N="854" /> come under its control.  It does not just seek to improve them in a functional way. It sets out to make Dublin a living, enjoyable city, to make that part of the city a place where people will want to come, where people can relax, where there will be restaurants and side walks, where it will be possible to have music played, to make it a centre of enjoyment which will attract people for its own sake so that the city will be capable of generating the type of leisure and enjoyment which we have seen in so many other cities but which never seems to have been a part of our way of looking at things or part of our major urban development in this country. It is a very welcome feture of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated the obvious this morning when she said that we had not made the best use of the enormous 150 foot width of O'Connell Street, and especially that we had not made use of the centre island there.  O'Connell Street does not need two five lane highways. The point of such highways is missed in any event because of the fact that traffic is funnelled into and out of O'Connell Street at each end.  So O'Connell Street could be just as efficient in traffic terms with two or three lanes on each side.</P>
    <P>Also, in the development of O'Connell Street and the areas around it I hope that the commission will pay attention to the very large numbers of young and imaginative and artistic people who have become such a feature of various parts of city centre life over the past number of years.  These people are there with ideas and I hope that when ideas are being drawn up for the embellishment and development of this new area that attention will be paid to the less conventional, less &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; figures, that the ideas of many of the people who have already enlivened many parts of the areas around Temple Bar and other parts of the city &mdash; which, as Deputy Kelly mentioned this morning, might disappear if a certain plan were put into action &mdash; will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the legislation can impose its will on property owners to remove or alter any structure and to provide <Col N="855" /> suitable replacements where necessary. The use of this power will need commonsense application.  I am quite sure that the vast majority of property owners will welcome it because they are the people who will suffer most from the presence of garish, badly designed signs or advertisements, part of the plastic culture which has become so much a feature of that part of the city.  It would be intolerable if any group, small or otherwise, could retain the power to flout the common good in this matter.  Property has its duties as well as its rights, though I do believe that the pressure from the other property owners and the public generally would ensure that this power is one which would have to be used rarely and sparingly.</P>
    <P>Finally, the need for this Bill is obvious to all.  I am astonished that there should need to be any principled opposition to it.  It is imaginative; it is welcome; it is doing something which none of the existing institutions, no matter how well-intentioned they are, can do on their own. The only realistic way to tackle our problem has been to establish a single-purpose, single-function authority with a clearcut mandate, a definite budget and a definite lifetime.  This development is welcomed by the vast majority of the people of Dublin and, with a bit of luck, all of us will, in a few very short years, see and enjoy the fruits of this particularly imaginative innovation.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to compliment the last speaker on an excellent contribution.  Deputy Manning understands the workings of Dublin Corporation, which is more than can be said for his colleague, Deputy John Kelly, who has never missed an opportunity of attacking Dublin Corporation.  Yet it seems that the gentleman was always too good to go for the city council and see how local Government actually works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Manning referred to principled opposition to the Bill.  There is no principled opposition to this Bill.  We welcome any works that can be carried out <Col N="856" /> in the centre city area.  What we find reprehensible and objectionable is that the Minister knows, and we know, that most of the plans which will be implemented over the next three years already exist.  For example, I have seen plans which have been prepared by the traffic department of Dublin Corporation for the redirecting of traffic from O'Connell Street down to the quays, and the narrowing of that part of O'Connell Street which carries traffic in order to widen the centre of the street referred to in the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to draw up plans and have them approved and completed within three years.  The plans are already there.  The members of the corporation are resentful of the Government's attitude but the members of the Minister's party have to go along with it because it is the way politics work.  Most of the plans which will be implemented already exist. I completely agree with everything Deputy Manning said about the efficiency and dedication of the officials of Dublin Corporation.  What has been missing over the years was the will in the Department of the Environment to implement the legislation which would allow the local authority to do their work.</P>
    <P>The planning committee have been frustrated over the years by their inability to refuse permission to people who wish to build amusement arcades in O'Connell Street.  It was my proposal that all such applications should be brought before the planning committee when we realised we had the power to stop at least the slot machines element of those amusement arcades, although we could not prohibit the ordinary amusement machines which were not involved in paying out money to people.  Under the Constitution if an area is zoned for business progress, we could not determine the type of business that could occupy premises.  That is one of our difficulties.  The corporation should have been granted the power, by changes in the planning laws, when we saw that things were going wrong.  In a period of high technology the law has not been quick enough to prevent the proliferation of gaming machines. <Col N="857" /> O'Connell Street has become like a poor man's Las Vegas and other areas such as Rathmines have been ruined by these amusement arcades.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the fact that 1988 is the millennium of Dublin and to the fact that the Minister wants to be able to put his seal on it and to say that certain works have been completed in that time.  The Government have little to show for what they have done so they are now &ldquo;cogging&rdquo; the plans which were already there and saying that they are Government plans by putting their signature on them.  It is a little like a Minister in a new Government opening a factory with which his Government have had nothing to do.</P>
    <P>The problems affecting the centre of Dublin have been aggravated by the lack of commitment in respective Governments in having bypasses built.  If the eastern bypass and the southern bypass were built, a lot less traffic would have to go through the centre.  I remember former Deputy Joe Dowling saying that in order to get out of Dublin one had to go into Dublin.  Even in those years we were calling for ring roads.  The chamber of commerce welcomes these plans as we do.  We welcome anything that will reduce the problems of the inner city and the problems in the planning laws.</P>
    <P>An interesting question arises.  Does the authority of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission exceed the authority of An Bord Pleanála?  Apparently, Dublin Corporation or An Bord Pleanála will have to apply to the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission for permission. The Minister in his speech this morning said:</P>
    <P>For developments, Dublin Corporation or An Bord Pleanála, in determining a planning application relating to development in the area, must have regard to the provisions of an improvement scheme and permission for a proposed development may not be granted without the consent of the Commission, if it would <Col N="858" /> materially contravene the provisions of that scheme.</P>
    <P>Who controls who?  Maybe the Minister would let us know in his reply.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála because of the confines within which they have to operate are powerless because of the planning Acts which say no to certain policies.  In relation to bad advertising signs, hoardings and so on, the corporation have made attempts to get people to comply with the law and many times cases have ended up in the courts.  Deputy Burke, our spokesman, speaking in the House on the use of the corporation's premises, equipment and the service of their employees by the commission, said:</P>
    <P>Again, it is an insult to the corporation to requisition its facilities and staff, regardless of the corporation's own functions and responsibilities. Moreover, the Minister makes no mention of who is going to pay for these &ldquo;borrowings&rdquo;.  Does he expect the hard-pressed local authority to pick up the tab for his grand designs?</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech answers that question when he said:</P>
    <P>In addition, the commission will, under section 12 (3), receive an agreed contribution from Dublin Corporation in lieu of expenses that would otherwise have been incurred by them in the metropolitan central area.</P>
    <P>In other words, the salaries of all the engineers and staffs of the corporation. He continued:</P>
    <P>This would be in respect of, for example, litter control or refuse collection activities in the area which would be carried out by the commission instead of the corporation. There is provision for the determination by the Minister of the amount involved in the event of any disagreement.</P>
    <P>I do not know, at the end of the day, how much the commission might have of corporation funding and how much action will come from the Department of <Col N="859" /> the Environment under the pretext that that money would have gone to Dublin Corporation anyway.  It seems that the elected representatives will have very little say in how the money they are responsible for collecting in striking the rate will be spent.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said the commission will have power to require property owners to remove or alter any structure, or any structure of a particular class, and to provide suitable replacements, if appropriate.  Where do An Bord Pleanála come in?  Will they have an overriding veto in this regard or will the commission override An Bord Pleanála?  It is very important to know the position.  We would welcome any changes in the planning laws which would allow the commission to do this, provided responsibility will revert to Dublin Corporation in three years' time.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>After three years the commission will be dissolved and their functions will transfer back to Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Transport Authority.  It is the intention, however, that the area should retain a special status and with that in mind the provision in section 2(3) of the Bill will remain as a permanent feature of the law.  Under this section, Dublin Corporation, in the discharge of their functions, must have regard to the special importance, in the national interest, of the metropolitan central area and to the need in that interest to ensure a high environmental standard and a high standard of civic amenity and civic design in the area.</P>
    <P>We have always regarded that area as very important and have been utterly frustrated by the lack of commitment by the Department of the Environment to fund the kind of changes we know are necessary and for which plans have been drawn up.  I am sure the Minister has seen these plans; I would be very surprised if he had not.  The commission should really need the minimum of meetings because all that is required is for the plans to be implemented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> The Minister also said that business representatives and tourists have welcomed this move.  Of course they do but they should realise that the plans have not been implemented because of lack of funds and because of the control of An Bord Pleanála who seem to be the ultimate planning authority.  Perhaps the Minister will ensure that local authorities have more control, especially Dublin Corporation.  It will be interesting to see the examples of pedestrianisation areas for which we have plans.  However, the irony is that members of all parties in the corporation have been frustrated for far too long by the lack of will on the part of the Department of the Environment to implement them.</P>
    <P>When bypasses are built they will take unnecessary traffic out of the city centre. There are also plans in relation to having seats in the middle of O'Connell Street, tea and coffee in the open and so on.  It would be like the continental scene if we could arrange the weather to go with it but bearing our climate in mind perhaps such an area should be covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. T. Cosgrave Mr. L. T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I regret it was delayed for so long. The Opposition have a whingeing, knocking attitude to anything proposed by the Government.  If they had come up with something better or tabled amendments I am sure the Minister would have taken them on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the proposals in the Bill can be implemented without undue delay.  In relation to the urgent action needed for the city centre area, it is clear that that area is in need of revitalisation and change.  It is quite clear that the proposed commission have been welcomed by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the business houses association, Bord Fáilte and the Dublin eastern region tourist organisation. They all recognise that you must have a flourishing capital.  The vast majority of country people come to Dublin from time to time but, unfortunately, certain areas of the city have been downgraded.  I refer particularly to areas north of the Liffey and even O'Connell Street has deteriorated.  I hope the <Col N="861" /> Bill will result in repairing and revitalising parts of the city which have decayed. That will ensure a business boom.  People do not come into O'Connell Street at night, partly because of the incidence of crime, but also because of the lack of facilities.  There are too many fast food restaurants and amusement arcades in certain areas.  I do not object to a certain number in an area but there should be a balance and I hope the commission will provide it.</P>
    <P>The proposed extension of footpaths and development in certain areas is to be welcomed.  Henry Street is a good example of what can be done.  Too much traffic goes up and down O'Connell Street.  There is probably a quicker route now to the south side by way of Butt Bridge or the East Link Bridge.  There are two lanes running from Parnell Street to O'Connell Street which has four lanes. As the Minister said, perhaps a large pedestrian mall could be provided in the centre of O'Connell Street or footpaths could be extended.  I hope the commission will consider some of these aspects to ensure that people come back into the area and that the best possible shops are provided.</P>
    <P>Tourists coming to Ireland, whether by boat or plane, must arrive in the city centre, O'Connell Street, Grafton Street, Westmoreland Street, the main areas covered by the Bill.  It is important, from that point of view alone, that this part of the city should be the subject of a crash programme in the months ahead so that people will be encouraged to go there. We should provide a proper bus service to these areas to convenience people. We all remember that some firms put on buses to St.  Stephen's Green.  This should be extended and cars should be kept out of this area altogether.  Grafton Street has been a pedestrian area for some time and people find it easier to walk from the GPO to St. Stephen's Green than to drive.  Therefore, special regulations should be made in regard to the parking of cars.  This is a city centre problem mainly, and we must try to solve it, possibly by encouraging people to use public <Col N="862" /> transport.  We must provide an adequate system of public transport.</P>
    <P>Improvement schemes are dealt with in section 6. Reference was made to the Planning Acts.  Once an area has been designated a special area, with certain types of buildings allowed and others prohibited, we should ensure that neither the planning section of the corporation nor An Bord Pleanála are allowed to override such proposals.  We all know that building preservation orders have been overridden. Some such orders have not been worth the paper they have been written on when proposals for replanning occurred.  If an area is designated as a place in which there can be only certain types of development, that should not be overridden either by the local planning authority or, on appeal, by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The Minister might indicate that the commission to be appointed by this Bill will be able to see copies of planning applications before the Dublin Corporation planning section and the planning board so that the commission will be advised at all times about what is going on in regard to planning in the city.  The same should occur in regard to zoned areas in which only a certain type and number of shops will be permitted.  It would be unfortunate if the Dublin planning authority could overturn decisions made by the commission.</P>
    <P>The commission can play a major role, in conjunction with the various bodies, for instance, who are digging up roads and streets.  We see diggers moving in, barrels being put up all over the roads and streets and we see these barrels left there sometimes months after the jobs have been completed.  Sometimes the roads and streets are left in a very bad state.  We must have co-operation between bodies involved in digging up our roads, whether they be the ESB, the gas company, An Post or the corporation. This has become a problem throughout the city because of lack of co-operation between the various bodies engaged in this work.  I hope there will be co-operation with the commission so that we can have all these jobs done <Col N="863" /> simultaneously by the different bodies so that streets and roads will be open for traffic without delay.</P>
    <P>The commission will have three years in which to operate and I hope they will make much progress in that time. According to one of the early sections in the Bill, the corporation will have to take certain precautions.  Without criticising Dublin Corporation who have done so much excellent work in this field, I hope they and the other public bodies concerned will work in co-operation with the commission.  I hope that when appointing the members of the commission the Minister will get the best team available so that the commission will achieve the best results for the designated areas, taking all interests into account.  I hope the members of the commission will be practical people with the interests of Dublin at heart and that they will look at the problems of the inner city from the point of view of tourism, business and so on, and that people visiting the city will be able to see the results.  Many of us who have visited London have seen the designated shopping areas and in Paris we know that the Champs Elysée is a main shopping district.  We hope that people arriving in Dublin in large numbers will be able to identify the main shopping area.</P>
    <P>It is important that we all work to improve the city centre area.  The area from Westmoreland Street down O'Connell Street has to be looked at.  We should consider lessening traffic in O'Connell Street with a view to pedestrianising some more streets in the area.  This has worked well in Henry Street.  Obviously practical difficulties are involved in cutting off a road on which there has been a good deal of traffic.  There are other roads which could take extra traffic.  Some more traffic could use the east link bridge and other bridges.  I would hope that the establishment of the commission in conjunction with measures announced previously by the Minister in relation to areas further down the quays which it is hoped to redevelop will get people back into Dublin.  One used look forward to going <Col N="864" /> into Dublin to visit some of the bigger stores which are not in the greater Dublin area even though there has been a large escalation of shopping centres.  There should still be an attraction for Dublin as regards getting people back to the centre city.  The large majority of cinemas, theatres and some of the best hotels are in this general area.  The benefits to both the capital and the country cannot be underestimated if this commission work successfully.  I hope the commission can get off the ground.  I do not know whether the Minister indicated when the commission will be up and running but they probably would have been in existence now but for circumstances outside his control.</P>
    <P>It is important that all of us in this House who have suggestions or amendments to make in relation to the Bill put them forward.  The commission may need tightening up in one area or another. We should not be whingeing and knocking every proposal put forward.  It is in all our interests.  Dublin is the capital of the country.  By and large, nearly every tourist visits this city.  There are enough attractions in this area even as it is to attract tourists but I hope the commission will work well and improve this general area.</P>

      <P>A lot of nonsense has been spoken today, particularly about O'Connell Street.  People have this romantic image of Dublin in the rare old times as if O'Connell Street was once a marvellous boulevard admired the world over.  The Minister referred to the visible signs of decay, of insensitive thoughtless development, change of use and tasteless advertising, etc.  Deputy Manning had the same to say but all he could think of was Nelson's Pillar.  I doubt if the Minister intends the commission to restore Nelson's Pillar, maybe it is part of the £10 million investment but it would not be what Dublin city council have in mind.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, the Minister <Col N="865" /> has that in mind.  Deputy Manning seems to think it will be a marvellous thing.  That is all he can seem to remember that is missing.  People are talking about what Dublin was like 30 or 40 years ago but it is only O'Connell Street they are talking about.  Nobody has mentioned D'Olier Street or Westmoreland Street as nobody can think of anything we might do with those two streets.  They all talk about O'Connell Street being the widest street in Europe and all that nonsense.</P>
      <P>What was in O'Connell Street?  I remember O'Connell Street 30 or 40 years ago.  From the Green Rooster down there was nothing but ice cream parlours, Cafollas and Palm Grove.  It was a purely entertainment and food city centre.  All you had were Clerys, Kingstons and Madame Nora's.  Both Kingstons and Madame Nora's are now gone.  Clerys will probably go in a few years and no commission will stop it.  If people see there is no business there, they will just get out.  What else was there?  There were cinemas: the Metropole and the Capital which was referred to in the song &ldquo;I met her in the Capitol&rdquo;.  They were marvellous. What put them out of business? Commercial interests put them out.  The commission are not going to stop that.  If the Savoy closes down because of a lack of business, the commission will not be able to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not talking about changing the businesses.  Deputy Cosgrave said we must bring people back to the city centre and that they will not come in unless the facilities are there.  The facilities are there.  There are the cinemas in O'Connell Street and where do people go afterwards? They go to the fast food joints whereas before they used to go to the Elite Cafe, to Cafollas or to the Palm Grove.  Why all this romanticism about O'Connell Street?  It was never a shopping street.  It never will be.  The new commission will not make it a shopping street.  Fair enough, we will now have the power to make them take down their advertising signs but the big red monstrous Burgerland is the only one that is out of place simply because it is on the wrong side of the street.  If it was on the <Col N="866" /> other side of the street one would not notice it.  I do not like any of the plastic signs and it is a good idea to take them down.  Burgerland might go out of business if they could not put up their big sign.  We do not know.  What I am saying is that it is the commercial interests who will decide what O'Connell Street will be used for.</P>
    <P>The corporation have been fighting to keep slot machines out of O'Connell Street.  But for the very tough and stiff fight they have carried on over the past six to eight years in particular O'Connell Street would now be full of slot machine joints.  That is where people want to go, it is the entertainment street.  People want to have the slot machines, the fast food joints and the cinemas.  If there were to be sex shops in Dublin, they would be in O'Connell Street.  That is where the business of entertainment is.  If it is not to be an entertainment street but is to be a shopping area let us know that.  Where is the entertainment street then going to be?  Let us not talk about changing an area of fast food joints to a shopping area.  By all means make those fast food joints look a bit better.  Cafollas always looked dreadful with their bare tables and chairs.  One nearly had to walk out on the street when passing the Pillar Cafe with the smell of DDT and with fleas hopping out of it.  This is the O'Connell Street they are regretting that is dead and gone.</P>
    <P>The suggestions put forward by the corporation are excellent and I am sure the commission will try to implement some of them.  It is an excellent idea to improve the centre of O'Connell Street.  I noted the suggestion of Deputy Manning that traffic on either side should be reduced to two lanes.  That is what makes me wonder about the commission.  Will it be their intention to keep cars and, possibly, buses away from O'Connell Street as much as possible?  That is a wonderful suggestion for O'Connell Street but where will the traffic go?  They will be put on the inner tangent ring road that the corporation have been developing for the last 20 years and which is <Col N="867" /> destroying the heart of Dublin city.  City councillors are trying to stop that project but it is being banged through just the same.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members noticed that in the last three or four weeks Parnell Street which is within the ambit of the Minister's new commission has been wiped out.  The Commodore and Peats have gone and the corporation are moving to the lower end of the street.  We can rest assured that by the time the commission commence operations, roadworks will have banged through Capel Street, through Brearton's Pawnbrokers, because that is the way it is proposed to take cars away from O'Connell Street.  The intention is to drive through Parnell Street, on to Nth. King Street, knocking down Green Street and everything in the way.  On the south side something similar will be happening with the inner tangent ring road.  The Minister is implementing his proposal in regard to the commission, fully aware that the corporation will continue to knock down as many buildings as possible to take traffic away from O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>The Minister is giving £10 million to a commission consisting of people appointed by himself and not elected by the people, without any reference to citizens or the need for planning approval. That could be very dangerous.  Citizens have a big say in every move the corporation make and they should have the same say in regard to the commission but they will not because the commission do not have to apply for planning permission. We would all love to see the city improved but we must accept that nothing fabulous will occur as a result of the setting up of the commission.  In my view things will be as bad as they have been down the years.  Parnell Street has gone in anticipation of the commission being set up and the same will occur on the south side in Cuffe Street, Sth.  King Street, Kevin Street and on through to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Following protests last year people understood that the motorway proposed for that area had been shelved but it is going ahead just the same.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> The new commission will be given £10 million over the next three years and many additional powers but Dublin Corporation have been left without money and power for years.  They do not have any power to insist on people changing the front of their premises or remove signs like the commission will have. Dublin Corporation would love to have those powers and I should like to know why they cannot be given them.  That authority are responsible for the entire city and they could be implementing this type of planning all over Dublin if they had the necessary powers.  We must remember that O'Connell Street is not the city of Dublin.  Most people simply drive through it.  Many areas adjacent to O'Connell Street may as a result of this move be choked up with traffic because of an effort to do something about O'Connell Street.  Many of the proposals in regard to signs and so on please me because signs ruin the appearance of the centre of the city but major destruction has been done by private developers, those responsible for the erection of office blocks.  The reason the north side of the city has been in decay is because office accommodation has been knocked down and businesses have moved to new blocks on the south side.  It is the private sector that will decide how the city of Dublin develops.</P>
    <P>It is nice to think that the commission will have power in regard to shop frontages and the widening of the centre of O'Connell Street but that will not change O'Connell Street from an area of fast food joints to one of big jewellery and drapery shops.  The face of the street will change and that is a good thing but I cannot understand why in order to do that the commission must take over from the corporation responsibility for cleaning the streets in that area.  Dublin Corporation have an excellent street cleaning service and those who visit the centre of the city early in the morning will realise that.  Dublin city looks beautiful early in the morning.  It appears that a new service will be provided by the commission but I wonder if that will result in layoffs in the cleansing department of the corporation. Will the commission propose bringing in <Col N="869" /> outside contractors?  In my view that is what they will propose.  The intention is to have private contractors doing the roadworks and other works that have been done by Dublin Corporation in other pedestrian areas.  That worries me.</P>
    <P>The real dirty kick in the pants to the corporation is that having been told they cannot move into O'Connell Street and on up to Grafton Street they are told they must pay the commission the amount it would cost them to do that work.  The corporation will have to hand over to the commission the money for cleaning and maintaining the centre of the city.  That is crazy and is worrying.  When this starts one does not know where it will end.  It is not a problem for the Minister to appoint a commission.  Former Ministers abolished the entire corporation and established a commission.  A commission can be made look efficient if they are given lots of money and power and the corporation can be made look stupid or fumbling if they do not have the money or the power to do the jobs thay are supposed to do.  That is the position at the moment.  It will be easy for the commission to look good after three years and then people may suggest that the commission should be responsible for the entire city.  That worries me.  Local democracy is being eroded by the Government as it has been by previous administrations.  In the past four years the Department of the Environment have exercised a lot of control over local authorities. Powers have been taken from Dublin Corporation through the Dublin Transport Authority Act because the control of traffic in the city is not their responsibility.  The Custom House docks area was taken from the corporation in the Urban Renewal Bill and now this new commission is to take the heart of the city away from the control of Dublin City Council and Dublin Corporation.  This is an erosion of democracy and the very reverse of what this Government said they intended to do.</P>
    <P>Deputies are surprised that people in Dublin city and the corporation are so incensed about this commission.  They should not be at all surprised.  When it <Col N="870" /> happens in their own areas such as Cork and Galway &mdash; and it certainly will happen &mdash; they will see that it is an insult to people and a total erosion of democracy. There will be commissions all over the place as a result of this Bill.  That is the most worrying feature.</P>
    <P>As far as O'Connell Street is concerned I wish them the very best of luck.  I do know that if the corporation had got the money they had planned to do this sort of job in O'Connell Street.  They need more planning powers for every street in Dublin.  The planning laws are an absolute disaster because people who are refused permission can seek compensation. The corporation are prevented from refusing planning permission where they know that planning permission should not be allowed.  There are restrictions from beginning to end and the private developer gets away with it.  More powers are needed for local authorities.  If the commission are established, I wish them the best of luck in making O'Connell Street look better but I do not fancy their chances of changing the area from entertainment and fast food joints into a major shopping street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It brings much-needed innovation and new thinking to tackle the problem which we have all seen and lived with in Dublin for far too long.  It is too easy for Members opposite to blame this Government and protest that the problems we now have are the fault of this Government or could be remedied within our existing local authority system.  The reality is that successive Governments, Dublin Corporation and private developers are all responsible for the problems we have in the centre of Dublin.  There is no body which bears individual and sole responsibility. In effect, Dublin has been allowed to develop on a piecemeal basis with no overall concept of what the central area off our main city should look like.  We have failed dismally to bring to bear on our planning procedures the type of approach that has been applied in places like Amsterdam, Paris and a variety of other European cities where they fought <Col N="871" /> through government and local authority legislation to ensure that a particular character in a city was maintained and that a particular lifestyle was possible within a city centre area.  They have ensured that modernisation does not destroy the heart of the capital city.</P>
      <P>While recognising that within Dublin Corporation there are good planners, people who have devoted their lives to the city, there have been serious mistakes in the planning procedures and in the application of our planning laws as they applied to the centre of the city.  Successive corporations, regardless of whether Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael councillors were in the majority, have during the past 20 or 30 years presided over the decay and destruction of Dublin city centre.  I do not think that anybody who lives in Dublin can disagree.  O'Connell Street is dominated by plastic take-away hamburger and chip shops.  This is a street which should essentially be our Champs Elysée.  Every tourist passes through this street on arrival from Dublin Airport and is shocked to learn that it is the main street of the capital.  The corporation have dismally failed in this area.</P>
      <P>I accept to a degree some of the things Deputy Mac Giolla says.  Commercial consideration will determine in effect what type of commercial outlets there will be in any street in any city, but those considerations are also affected by the planning procedures which determine what type of structures one can erect.  It was within the capacity of Dublin Corporation within the existing planning laws to curtail some of the more monstrous apparitions we have seen erected in the centre city.  There are exceptions to this. If one compares Grafton street today with the way it looked three years ago, one can see an improvement taking place in a street which had deteriorated.  This is as a result of the input of individual shopkeepers in the street.  This type of improvement is still not evident in major parts of the city centre which are covered by this Bill and over which this commission is to take up jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> Dublin Corporation must accept some of the criticism which have been voiced about Dublin and their involvement in the city.  I will not accept an approach where ideologically one always blames private developers or always blames public authorities.  Both public authorities and private developers have contributed to our problems but Dublin Corporation have contributed in inexcusable ways.  Two gigantic and offensive phallic symbols erected on the Wood Quay site symbolise the planning failures of Dublin Corporation.  There they are, standing erect looking at everybody who drives by, contributing nothing of aesthetic value, seeking to conceal one of the city's major buildings, Christchurch Cathedral.  They are not merely architecturally offensive; they are offensive to anyone who wishes to see the city improved.  People come to this country from abroad and see those two gigantic phallic symbols.  They learn that these are the new civic offices planned and provided for by the local authority who govern the city of Dublin and who have a responsibility in the area of planning. These foreign visitors cannot understand how any local authority could have seen fit to erect such monstrosities.  That is an example of a local authority building being a monstrosity but there are other examples.</P>
    <P>There is the monstrosity of the Central Bank building in all its garishness, standing out in the landscape and destroying the look of the street in which it was built. Dublin Corporation granted planning permission for that building.  It was built originally to a greater height than the planning permission allowed and had to be modified somewhat.  That does not take from the appalling structure the corporation planning department permitted to be built on that site.</P>
    <P>Then one has the irony of Dublin Corporation seeking to ensure that private developers when building office blocks or other structures provide adequate parking for people who might use those buildings. Of course, that is correct.  It should be a requirement on the developers, but <Col N="873" /> it is extraordinary how Dublin Corporation, while requiring private developers to abide by particular standards in some areas, could not themselves abide by those standards.  One of the caricature examples of that failure on the part of the corporation is the Motor Taxation Office beside the Four Courts building opened by Dublin Corporation many years ago.  A motor taxation office, by implication, has people going in to get taxation certificates and driving licences for cars.  One does not need either of these if one does not drive a car.  By definition, anyone going there is looking for a licence or tax disc for his or her car. What do Dublin Corporation do?  They do not provide any parking facilities whatsoever and yet provide traffic wardens who stand outside that office, in effect taxing the citizens of Dublin additionally by ensuring that they automatically get a parking ticket as well because there is no adequate parking anywhere in the vicinity of that office.</P>
    <P>I hear Deputies lamenting that some of these powers are being taken away from the corporation and saying that if they were given extended powers they could do a better job.  As somebody who was born in and has lived in Dublin practically all his life, I have seen no evidence of any nature of Dublin Corporation having the capacity to do a better job within the statutory powers they have at present.  That is a valid point to make. What is needed is innovation, a new approach, and I hope this commission will provide it.</P>
    <P>I take up the point made by my colleague, Deputy Kelly, who earlier this morning commented that the personalities and expertise of the people appointed to this commission will be crucial in determining whether they succeed. That is something the Minister will have to take note of in the context of appointments made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ray Burke, chief Opposition spokesman for the Environment, expressed the view that the Bill was not adequate, that we needed a more integrated plan.  Noteworthy in this context is the fact that Fianna Fáil previous to <Col N="874" /> the summer vacation sought to prevent this measure being debated in this House at all.  That Deputy, as Minister for the Environment, made no contribution of any nature whatsoever towards resolving any of the problems of the inner city of Dublin that this Bill seeks to tackle.  His main contribution when last in the Department of the Environment was to move trees during the Dublin West by-election. He provided overnight a series of trees in that constituency for 24 hours, which were moved out again after polling was completed.  The extent of his contribution towards trying to provide the new look to the city of Dublin was limited. That must make one somewhat cynical as to what we would have to offer to us today in his comments.</P>
    <P>Everybody who lives in Dublin will acknowledge the need to re-establish the character of this city.  On occasions when this issue is brought up it is traditional, for people to talk about planning blight and dereliction in the city centre.  Some of the areas covered by the proposed commission will deal with the problem of dereliction.  It is also traditional when dealing with the problem always to blame private developers for creating the problem of derelict sites in Dublin centre.  I have no doubt that a goodly proportion of that problem has been created by private developers.  However, it is time it was said that Dublin Corporation in their own way have also contributed to these problems of dereliction and planning blight in that there are portions of Dublin in relation to which Dublin Corporation have had long term road widening plans which go back one or two decades, plans which possibly will never be implemented, which they have long since within their administrative structures decided to drop but which would still appear on maps and are still, in theory, in existence.  Those plans of themselves created dereliction and planning blight. Private owners whose property is falling into disrepair see little point in investing in those buildings if a possibility remains that they may be demolished within a short period because the corporation have decided to reactivate their road <Col N="875" /> widening plans which have been on paper for many years.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the corporation in the context of that issue to speed up their procedures. They are heading now into a new developing plan process and they should see where they have added to the problems.  Presumably the new development plan will sort out some of these problems but it should be an established policy of the corporation, if a road widening plan which is going to result in the demolition of properties in portions of Dublin is subsequently axed and if it is two to four years before the new development plan can be adopted, that there be a procedure in existence whereby the corporation can make known their decisions on such issues.</P>
    <P>Another issue in the context of the city centre, its appearance and how traffic flows through it, is one which I was pleased to see raised at a Dáil committee during the course of the past few days. This is the crazy lack of co-ordination on the part of An Bord Telecom, the Gas Company, Dublin Corporation, a whole series of different bodies who regularly, one after the other, pile into a particular street or road and in a crazy and unco-ordinated fashion dig up holes, fill them in, dig them up again and refill them.  It is almost as if some official hiding away in an ivory tower has a great desire to ensure that there is a certain ratio of holes in roads at any particular moment and a certain number of roads and pathways are always being dug up.  I do not understand that approach.  Anybody who ran a private business on that philosophy would rapidly go bankrupt.  It is the people who pay for this unco-ordinated, slap-happy approach to dealing with these problems.</P>
    <P>There is not only the financial cost of this extra work.  There is the massive inconvenience caused to pedestrians and road users; there are the massive traffic jams unnecessarily created and the ugliness of continual roadworks being carried out in centre city areas by one public body after another.  It should not be beyond the bounds of human ingenuity for someone <Col N="876" /> to co-ordinate the carrying out of this type of roadwork.  This should not be an issue of which the time of the national Parliament is wasted.  It is almost ludicrous to have to raise such an issue here. Perhaps an administrator for co-ordinating holes in the road could be appointed, or a grandiose title in the first national language used which does not make it sound quite so ludicrous but ensures that, at the very least, the administrator performs a function that saves the taxpayer money and provides for a more co-ordinated approach by the various services.  Either because of the carrying out of continuous roadworks, or due to dilapidation or dereliction, portions of the city resemble post World War II London at the latter end of the forties when that city was seeking to recover from the German bombings.  There are landscaped portions of this city which make one wonder if we have entered a twilight zone and been carried back 40 years to the middle of the city of London as I imagine it would have looked during the course of the Second World War.</P>
    <P>I hope this commission can ensure that the type of co-ordination that is necessary will be brought to bear on these services and the manner in which our local authorities and other State bodies and companies approach the provision of services in Dublin and also such tasks as road digging operations.  I hope that Dublin Corporation and the other bodies who will continue to exercise jurisdiction outside the area of this new Dublin metropolitan commission will get together and co-ordinate their operations.  That should apply to every local authority.  If the elected representatives have not the capacity to do it the county or city manager in those local authorities should take on the managerial responsibility to provide a co-ordinated system to deal with these areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Burke talked about taking away powers from local government.  It is about time Members of this House who are members of local authorities, and I am honoured to be a member of Dublin County Council, realise that if local authorities want to <Col N="877" /> exercise power they must exercise the responsibility with that power.  Fianna Fáil have embarked on a course of action in which they seek to spend money wildly on all sorts of half-brained schemes.  They want central government to provide the money and dare the council suggest that local funding should be raised for local schemes.  That apparently is something which should not be tolerated.  You cannot have power without responsibility. The overwhelming majority of finance spent by local authorities is derived from central government.  If the local authorities are not carrying out their functions in an efficient way, if they are not able to resolve problems such as those in the city of Dublin, it behoves central government to provide an alternative means to ensure that the job is done properly and that the taxpayer gets full benefit for the money that is spent.</P>
    <P>I urge the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, when it comes into being, to deal with one issue.  We currently have in the city and county of Dublin the ludicrous position whereby the local authority unions are preventing Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council from taking on additional employees through the social employment scheme. They are denying the long term unemployed people in the city and county of Dublin the opportunity of taking up employment and thus carrying out work that badly needs to be done.  At present there is no personnel to undertake that work. This has not been highlighted to any great degree.  It is a gigantic scandal that when we have so many unemployed people who wish to take up employment, when we have a social employment scheme that has provided a considerable number of jobs outside Dublin, the city and county of Dublin local authorities are being prevented from taking on additional employees to carry out services in Dublin.  I call on the trade unions to clarify their attitude to this.  Do they want to face up to the unemployment problem and tackle it or are they content to allow people to remain on the unemployment register without allowing them the opportunity <Col N="878" /> to take up employment through the social employment scheme?  If Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council are not able to break the logjam with their unions on this issue, if they are afraid to confront them due to the industrial dispute that would arise from so doing, I hope the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, when it is established, will not be afraid to consult unions who are seeking to prevent jobs being created.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with this measure. I am glad it is before the House today.  I regret that Fianna Fáil did not allow the Second Reading of this Bill to take place before the Dáil went into summer recess.  I hope the Bill will be speedily passed and people appointed to this commission.  I hope we will very rapidly see the benefits of the work of this commission on the streets of Dublin and that as a result we will have a greatly enhanced city, a city that all of us who live in will be proud of and that our visitors will grow to admire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic when debating a Bill of this magnitude that only last Monday people from all over Ireland were driving in their thousands to Newry and Belfast to do their shopping.  No matter what attitude we have towards trying to instil a desire to shop in Dublin and its environs, those people who are the vehicle to generate business within the city are not prepared to avail of the facilities that are there already.  This has become such a serious problem that the habit which has been developed over the years of shoppers travelling vast distances to the North to do their shopping will be very difficult to break.  It will be very difficult to stem the tide and to reinculcate the habit of shopping in Dublin again.  That is a very serious situation that has developed and one which the Government must take cognisance of. Shopkeepers are feeling a very great strain as a result.  Previously it was a problem in Dundalk and other Border towns but now it has spread all over the country.  Busloads of people drive up north to do their shopping.  We are debating <Col N="879" /> a Bill to try to regenerate a small area of what was the heartland of Dublin.  The problem should be treated with grave concern.  Millions of pounds are being spent in the North and consequently thousands of jobs that could easily be created in the Twenty-six Counties are being lost as a direct result of that alone. Where is the national spirit and the confidence I am sure the Minister is trying to call on in the commission or whatever to get this type of regeneration within the city?</P>
      <P>When we look at the city of Dublin we must realise it is a city that has been decaying for very many decades, some say centuries, even since its development. It was a city that was developed by architects with wide-ranging powers. They did not have to consult anyone. They designed a city with a very small population and virtually no traffic.  It has its main street, not, let me say, the widest street in Europe.  Many people look upon O'Connell Street as being the widest street in Europe but there are examples of streets that are wider, the Avenida Liberdada in Lisbon for one.  However, it is a beautiful street but it could be improved very greatly.</P>
      <P>Much talk has centred around Dublin Corporation today and rightly so, but this legislation, I would say to the Minister in a nutshell, is finger-pointing Dublin Corporation as the senior local authority, saying they cannot do this job and we are going to do it for them.  That is what it boils down to, no matter how it is couched.  Section 9, for example, concerns the control and prevention of litter. In 1982 I was involved in the Department of the Environment and we put a great deal of work into that, incorporating fines of £800.  That was four years ago but that Act has fallen into disrepute.  Litter fines are just not being levied on the perpetrators of crimes of that kind.  In other words, nobody is enforcing the law here. There is a whole plethora of rules, regulations and laws that should be obeyed but we do not seem to be a nation prone to abide by the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commission of this kind when set up <Col N="880" /> will be in conflict, though certainly not in deliberate conflict, with Dublin Corporation who set themselves up with a degree of pride as being able to do their job.  However, the Minister is saying: &ldquo;For three years we are going to freeze your powers and if you stay away from this locality we will do the job for you&rdquo;. A serious situation is developing because if that is allowed to spread throughout, say the local authority in Dublin, a lack of confidence in the ability of the local authority to do the job will develop very quickly.</P>
    <P>I want to look on this Bill in the most constructive manner I can.  What comes through to me is the fact that there is a huge gulf between the powers of the Minister and how he translates those powers to local authorities.  We are talking about Dublin Corporation here but there is a feeling in local authorities that they do not really have to get on, there is no sense of obligation to enforce the rules and laws that come from the Department of the Environment.  I cite the Litter Act as one instance because it is recent in our minds.  It is just not seen to be enforced in any way.</P>
    <P>We also have an Air Pollution Bill coming in, another lost opportunity. Instead of it being a Bill that will control air pollution in Dublin, all it will be in effect is enabling legislation enabling the local authorities to set up smokless zones or whatever.  The prime flaw in this Bill is that the Minister is taking a particular power away from the local authority in an area instead of bringing in the local authority and saying, &ldquo;We demand that this be done; this is the blueprint, this is something you can get done&rdquo;.  You can talk around the whole question for a long time.  Dublin Corporation in themselves have become a very unwieldy body.  They are really not capable of identifying the areas of blight to the extent that they can follow through to correct these areas.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker made reference to Wood Quay.  That development was forced through against the will of the people at the time and quite wrongly.  It was the planning authority operating in <Col N="881" /> Dublin at that time against the wishes of many thousands of people.</P>
    <P>What can we have in a city the size of Dublin that has not even a city architect? Our senior local authority have not had a city architect since the early or mid-sixties. During the developing years, we had a city architect but during the boom years of the seventies we had no city architect.  Now in the recessionary eighties we still have no city architect.  It is urgent that an overall city architect be appointed for Dublin.  I go so far as to say that with the state of Dublin at the moment, a city of its size with one-third of the population of the country living in it, it has outgrown the local administration structure and now needs a Government-appointed Minister for Dublin to represent the city at the Cabinet table.  We are talking about a huge number of people living in this city.  A Minister with special responsibility for the capital city could take an overview of the city's needs and problems, list the priorities and co-ordinate the current activity of Dublin Corporation.  There is not the direct link that is needed between the local authority and the Government. Much of the legislation is pushed out to the local authority without the necessary accountability to the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area concerned, let us take O'Connell Street and Grafton Street with some streets running off.  If that is to be designated, as will happen under this Bill, what of property in the immediate locality?  Quite obviously, there will be speculation and artificial elevation of values in that area, with many people endeavouring to adopt a get-rich-quick policy where they buy up these sites and so on and then try to sell them at a quick profit.  What about the areas that are just beside those locations? You cannot consider any capital city without realising that you have the entire city and its environs to consider.  Just to take out a small entity within its entire framework strikes me as being just a little dangerous in that it could create some type of ill-intended elitism within that area and could cause blight around the <Col N="882" /> area.  That has happened in localities that have been given a fillip to their development. I read in this morning's paper &mdash; I thought the figure was not quite as high as this but I will have to take it as being a fact &mdash; that 160 acres of dereliction within the inner city, that is seven times the size of St.  Stephens Green, could be developed.  These sites are being held by very selfish people who are biding their time and waiting to make a rich strike when their property goes up in value as soon as the areas around fall into dereliction and are later needed for houses or parkland.</P>
    <P>The Minister should encourage the local authorities to do their job more efficiently.  The lack of efficiency in certain areas of Dublin Corporation is horrendous. I am not making comparisons between local authorities.  Generally speaking people who are working can only be as efficient as those who train or supervise them, whether in the public service or in the private sector.  The degree of absenteeism in our senior local authority is quite incredible.  I realise that there are some aspects of outdoor work which are difficult in certain weather conditions but in one calendar year, 5,000 employees lost 320 calendar years.  This is incredible.  It can be translated as something like 20,000 medical certificates issued for that number of employees. Something is very wrong with the level of efficiency.</P>
    <P>Are we getting the best from our local authorities?  I contend that, in the case of Dublin Corporation, we are not.  If that great institution were looked at very carefully in regard to cost efficiency and so on &mdash; and that is going on at present in other areas of government &mdash; efficiency could be improved.  The employees of Dublin Corporation would welcome that sign of confidence coming from the Department of the Environment, because it would secure many of the jobs there and, in the long term, create more jobs in local authorities.  If there is a level of inefficiency, only stagnation can follow and, consequently, loss of work all round. If there is an increased efficiency, more <Col N="883" /> jobs will be created as a direct result.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not here because I wish to draw to his attention the fact that four years ago Fianna Fáil, in government, brought before this House the Urban Areas Development Bill.  The system envisaged in it would have provided a tremendous advance in preventing urban decay from spreading at its present rate.  It was imaginative legislation and it is a pity that it has not been followed up by this Government.  It is not too late for the Government to reenact that Bill, and I appeal to them to do just that.  The legislation is printed and ready and can be put forward.  Basically the idea of the Urban Areas Bill was to designate particular areas for urban renewal work directly through the local authorities.  At the time I met the city manager and made it quite clear that, under no circumstances, would any usurping of the powers of the local authorities take place under that legislation. There was a lot of talk at the time that it would take away the powers of the local authorities but the idea was to work in harmony with local authorities and that is the way I would wish to see our urban areas being revitalised and regenerated.</P>
    <P>In this Bill little provision is made for any system of appeal in the event of the commission wishing to force a particular viewpoint on a group of business people or residents in an area.  Basically this is quite wrong and undemocratic.  It will provide a field day for the lawyers.  It will be a question of sitting out and waiting for three years before any judgments are made.  The legislation is quite flawed in many ways.  Much of it could be challenged for a wide variety of reasons related to property ownership and so on. I do not think it is the way the Government should be moving at present.  The Government say that if they had had their way this would have been put through before the summer recess.  Anybody who has studied the legislation that came out at the eleventh hour before the summer recess realises that it was very sharp practice to try to float out legislation as important as this without proper debate in the <Col N="884" /> House.  That is a reasonable stance and speakers should refrain from that inaccurate line of criticism that Fianna Fáil have adopted.</P>
    <P>It will be very difficult to offer amendments or constructive ways of changing this legislation because it is a particularised, strait-jacket type of Bill. There is very little flexibility in it.  In that respect it lacks imagination.  It is isolating a very tiny part of Dublin.  I wonder what the motivation behind that is.  If it is just the desire of the Minister to improve O'Connell Street, Grafton Street and the few streets around and hope that that will act with some catalytic force to other areas of the city, it would certainly be a good motivation.  But I cannot see it in that light, because when one reads the Bill it is obvious that it is a question of improving an area and then shutting down the commission and that will be the end.  That is like a festival approach to organisation rather than the overall plan that is needed for the entire city, and that must be done through proper attitudes at government level.  Consideration ought to be given to the appointment of a Minister for Dublin.</P>
    <P>At local level, Dublin Corporation should put their house in order.  They should set about appointing a city architect in the planning department.  There are architects but there is no overall figure within the architectural department with responsibility for the capital city.  That leads to a very dangerous situation of paper passing responsibility rather than facing up to the responsibility.  That is a serious criticism of Dublin Corporation but it can be put right.  The reason for it is financial in that there is no financial enticement to bring in an overseer or an architect who would actually command the necessary salary to do the job.</P>
    <P>Our city is very rich in its archaeological treasure heritage.  There is no provision in this Bill for archaeological investigation or archaeological accountability for any treasure that might be found during this face lift that goes on right in the heart of the city.  I would encourage the city manager to appoint a <Col N="885" /> city archaeologist for our capital city.  We have a farcical situation here given the breadth of our heritage from Viking through Norman, Georgian architecture and the archaeological treasures in the city in that we do not have an archaeologist. We have just debated some legislation on the use of metal detectors. People are actually engaged in purloining our national treasure and exporting it. What next?  What is up for grabs?  We have not got our priorities in order.  Legislation of this kind is almost pointing to the local authority and saying &ldquo;you failed and now we are going to get somebody who we hope will be interested, who have not actually gone through the process of being elected to the local authorities or the national parliament, and we are going to give these people the power to do the job for you&rdquo;.  Why not just say to the local authority &ldquo;we are going to dissolve you, you cannot do the job&rdquo; instead of trying to cloud it in very nebulous legislation of this kind?</P>
    <P>The aspiration and the hope to try to get traffic out of this area will be impossible. This has been tried before in many other cities.  Unless we can provide the infrastructure to get the traffic across the city, it cannot work.  Would the Minister consider providing some type of minimal cost transportation in the city which would be of tremendous help to Dubliners in affording them free movement? The legislation is flawed and must be either radically amended to take cognisance of some of the points made by speakers on this side of the House or else it will just have to be shelved.  It is misdirecting the intention of urban development.</P>
    <P>I was in Lisbon recently which has a population twice the size of Dublin and it has many parallels with Dublin in its architecture, the wide centre street, and many similar buildings.  It is also a very busy port, but a decaying port very like Dublin.  Many of its buildings are undergoing a lot of radical change, are suffering from air pollution, dense traffic and an appalling amount of graffiti and so on.  I took the opportunity to speak to <Col N="886" /> some of the planners about what they intended, to improve their situation.  The feeling came through that if one looked at a city one had to look at the whole city and not just at a small centre zone. Planning has to be done across the board. Obviously Dublin Corporation needs a shaking up and a lot of new ideas.  Dublin Corporation, perhaps like our capital city are running out of ideas.  They are not implementing the laws and are perhaps setting a bad example in their planning. The most flagrant example of that is the Wood Quay building which was a serious mistake, a serious error in planning.  I only hope that a lot of that can be undone in the minds of people as time goes on. It was an example of the bureaucratic bungling of a kind that no one wants to see happening again.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention of the speakers on this side of the House to condemn this legislation for the sake of condemnation. We have looked carefully at this and we feel that it will isolate a small area of the city.  That is very wrong and it can lead to an imbalance.  It can act in a manner in which it is not intended and there could be such a loss of revenue to the centre of the city as a result that the money could be spent in the wrong way.  I cannot support the legislation.  I have tried in every possible way to see if it could even act as a springboard for future development but I cannot see it that way.  The Minister will be obliged to widen this legislation.  The Minister should look at the Urban Areas Development Bill again and he will find in the framework of that legislation that he will be able to look at the entire city. In that Bill in the context of Dublin, the Minister can look upon the entire city as a unit rather than a small section of development.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take the opportunity now, because we have gone through phases of looking upon urban blight before, back into the late seventies when this question was first addressed in Dublin in any degree of seriousness.  This opportunity should not be lost but it will be lost unless the legislation is amended and widened to include the entire city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few brief points in relation to the Bill.  The Fianna Fáil approach and position, from the date of the public announcement of the proposed streets commission, does them no credit.  It is an extraordinary mixture which I have had the opportunity to view at city council level as well as in the Chamber, a combination of arrogant and infantile behaviour.  The level of feeling which this has provoked in the Opposition seems to be based on the fact that it should be done by them their way which, as Deputy Brady said, was set out in their Bill dealing with urban areas. However, that Bill contained a provision for exactly the same sort of mechanism for dealing with specialised areas.  They also suggest that it should be run by the local authority which, until recently, was run by Fianna Fáil.  They seem to feel that this is a direct political attack on the Fianna Fáil run city council which has blinded them to the fact that it has been welcomed in other circles as a long over-due-initiative which is worth trying.  They do not seem to be able to deal with it rationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city manager was berated and insulted by the leader of the Fianna Fáil group in the council for having attended the function at which the commission was announced.  He said that the city manager had let himself be wined and dined by the members of the Government.  I am glad that those extraordinary remarks led to apologies being made afterwards. During the meeting, initial details were considered and the city manager was asked for his view.  He said that he saw merit in a proposal which would allow a concentration of energy and skills on the Dublin city centre area.  Those are the views of a man who has unparalleled experience in the complexities of managing a city the size of Dublin with its 101 demands and crises screaming equally for attention.  The city manager gave the proposals a cautious and moderate welcome and I will not list all the organisations who welcomed them also because other speakers have done so.  I regularly visit the area in question and people have told me spontaneously that they think it is a <Col N="888" /> great idea and that they hope the proposals will soon be undertaken.  The reaction of the Opposition is seen by the people of Dublin in a very negative light. Indeed the attitude of the Opposition has meant delay in implementing the plans which could have been started in the recent good weather.  They will answer to the people in the months to come.</P>
    <P>The essential proposal is to set up a specialised commission and anyone who has dealings with organisations, big or small, knows that the most effective way to deal with anything is to have a specialised group dealing with certain areas.  It is extraordinary that the Opposition claim that you cannot single out an element of the city for special attention.  We have already done so in regard to two other sections of the city, the port and docks and the canals.  I know it was a different type of package and proposals but they were aimed at specific areas in Dublin and other parts of the country to generate redevelopment and to lift the blight of dereliction from such areas.  Something special is needed in the city centre and in every country the centre of a city exudes a particular atmosphere.  How it is presented and organised will have a knock on effect on the rest of the city.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other proposal though there is much to criticise in the attitude of Dublin Corporation to managing the city.  I speak as someone in my seventh year of service and I was involved in the Wood Quay disaster.  The buildings in that area are a constant reminder of how wrong officialdom can be in relation to what the city needs.  Maintaining the <i>status quo</i> is no assurance that we will preserve much of what is good and beautiful in Dublin because it is being destroyed at a rapid rate.</P>
    <P>Many officials in the planning department of Dublin Corporation have excellent ideas and are committed to preserving the city.  The organisation of the city council and their functions and the many demands made on them hinders their ability to make a substantial impact on any one area.  They must, as required by planning laws, spread their attention over small domestic extensions to major <Col N="889" /> planning applications.  In that context, the city manager indicated that there could be merit in having a specialised commission to speed up their plans, to make an impact on the city and to return it to Dublin Corporation who will continue to manage it in its improved form with substantial physical and environmental improvements in place.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the suggestion that we should deal with Dublin as a whole. We are talking about restructuring and reorganisation of local authorities and the immense task that will be.  I have my own views, it should be more highly politicised and much more in line with other major European capitals where you have a political mayoralty which is elected directly by the people.  They serve a term in office and are responsible for the city's budget. It is unsatisfactory to have a city run essentially by bureaucrats with councillors who can nudge, force or act as a lobby to influence certain matters.  There should be direct political responsibility and that is the direction in which I would like to see reform in future.  It would mean direct accountability, a degree of responsiveness and power.  The checks and balances of our managerial system at present often lead to an unacceptable level of inactivity and no clear responsibility in many sensitive areas.</P>
    <P>As a member of the city council I accept the criticism that Dublin has not been looked after as it should have been. The approach adopted in this Bill should at least have been tried in regard to a major portion of the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady raised a valid point when he said the local authority should look at how we have been organising our planning affairs.  Our planning decisions are made by bureaucrats.  No special training is necessary.  The planners with experience in practice and who gain from attendance at international conferences are purely in the role of advisers.  Deputy Brady identified a great gap, the lack of a position of city architect with full managerial powers.  There should be such a post in Dublin.  While the commission are in operation, Dublin City Council should look at this critically.  I put this to <Col N="890" /> the majority group in the city council. The Fianna Fáil group should accept responsibility for the city in which they are now a large representative group. They should accept the challenge and bring in some of those reforms so that action of the kind proposed here will not be necessary in the future because the structure and management of the corporation will be capable of responding to these problems.</P>
    <P>The powers this commission will have are welcome and necessary.  We have failed to set standards in a way that should shame us when we travel abroad.  I do not refer particularly to cities in Britain but to rural areas there where even the colour of the paint people put on their windows is directed by the local authorities. There is no reason why active local authorities should not look for and demand standards for the major streets in this city.  I hope this Bill will provide the start, that it will offer to the local authorities here an opportunity to look at themselves in the future so that we will see other areas which may become targets for our attention and vigilance, so that when basic development work has taken place we will maintain the management of the developed areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a welcome response to the frustration and anguish felt by many people who care about Dublin.  Even in my comparatively short period here I say that what has been done about Dublin has been scandalous.  This Bill is a response to the feelings that have informed people like those in the crisis conference: we must act to protect, and there are other areas that we should be looking at carefully as a result of the Skelly proposals, those north and south of the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady reflected on the dereliction throughout the city and he chastised those who had taken property with a view to selling it off in future, and allowing it to go derelict.  As Deputy Brady should know, many such offenders include CIE and local government bodies; Dublin Corporation, for instance, own some such property.  To suggest that this problem can be solved possibly by it going away is not an <Col N="891" /> adequate response.  This legislation is a realistic, dynamic and imaginative attempt to make an impact on the image of our city and I hope Fianna Fáil will stop playing politics with Dublin city, wish it well and get this work under way as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to continue the politics play and indicate what has happened here, but it might divert me from the important points I wish to make, so I will avoid it.  There is no doubt that the Minister is playing politics of the worst type.  What we are discussing here is completely unnecessary.  We are taking up the time of the House discussing something that was prepared by Dublin Corporation years ago &mdash; the whole essence and spirit of this legislation was there already but there was no money forthcoming to the Government parties in the corporation at that time: it was not a Fianna Fáil controlled corporation in those days.  In deference to the fact that Dublin is the administrative, executive, judicial and financial capital of the country and that it is the main centre of population, education, culture and everything that affects the country so much, we agree that a situation had arisen over the years through which Dublin had been neglected to the point when plans had to be prepared to take Dublin out of its misery.</P>
      <P>That plan was prepared by Dublin Corporation and it has now been transferred verbatim by the Minister.  While referring to playing politics, one wonders whether, if the people of Dublin in the last local elections had returned more Fine Gael and Labour councillors this Bill would now be before the House.  Instead, one wonders if the money would have been made available to the corporation whose members over the years have shown their capacity to deal with all problems requiring resolution when they got the resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is shameful that we should be wasting the time of the House. I was not here to listen to that great <Col N="892" /> interpreter of the wishes of the people, that man who has such regard for the people of this House, for Dublin and for all our democratic institutions, as to make little of the people of Dublin by criticising in the way he did those people whom they returned to membership of the corporation.  Are we to take it now, because he disliked what people did in the elections, that he makes little of those who were elected?</P>
    <P>I am not aware of having heard Professor John Kelly castigate Dublin Corporation when his own brother was a member &mdash; he was a good member.  I do not recollect Professor John Kelly castigating the Lord Mayor of the day for driving in the coach when his own colleague, Alexis FitzGerald, would have driven in the coach; when members of the Labour Party would have driven in the coach.  I have no recollection of Professor John Kelly criticising members of the corporation for having worn their gowns when Fine Gael were in control or when Fine Gael and Labour controlled the corporation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, people will understand when I take his contribution here as more of what has been described by one of his students as &ldquo;this great gas&rdquo;.  He is great gas, but he should not be wasting the time of the House making little of some of the great institutions we have, our local authorities, which we are all anxious to preserve.  I think the learned professor was a candidate for the Seanad, and he should know that local authority members form a big part of the electoral body for the Upper House.  He cannot dismiss them all as being beneath contempt, of wasting time and resources and not capable of performing their duties in relation to the streets of Dublin or looking after the general needs of the city when, simultaneously they are entrusted with the election of Members of our Upper House.  His references really amuse me.  I know his lack of sincerity because I have not heard or seen written any castigation by him on that great profession of which he is a member, dating back to Magna Carta and sustained here <Col N="893" /> by countless charters from across the water: all the time he pays deference to that great legal system that has come to us in gowns and wigs.  I have not heard him castigate that great profession on those grounds.  Consequently, I take it his contribution was in keeping with what he delivers in other establishments and which have been interpreted for me by one of his students as &ldquo;great gas&rdquo;.  I suggest he should continue to enjoy the freedom and docility enforced on the students who are obliged to listen to him and who cannot retort.  However, when making his contributions in this House, he should see beyond the flippancy of his utterances and recognise what he is doing.  It is shameful that an elected Member of this House, especially since the change of fortune has occurred in respect of Dublin Corporation, should go on record so often to make so little of the voice of the people.</P>
    <P>I could not care less what Professor John Kelly says about me.  Actually, I am at the stage now where I am looking forward to criticism from him because I regard it as a compliment.  However, I am concerned that he, as an elected Member of this House, makes so little of the people of this city by criticising in the fashion he has the people whom they have returned to membership of Dublin Corporation.  I must assume there is only one reason, namely, that in the littleness of his mind, his judgment changes in accordance with the personality and the two little letters he sees behind the names of the people who were elected.  He is not a great admirer of the Labour Party except in so far that they contribute to prop up his own party and are prepared to continue on as the political party prostitute they have been.  That is the party politics we see being played in this House, especially in respect of this legislation. I am equally surprised at the Minister, Deputy Boland.  He is a man who came from the local authority to this House, and I am surprised that he should make so little of the elected members of Dublin Corporation that he would take from them what they had planned, present it as his own and then go back to Dublin <Col N="894" /> Corporation to pay for it.</P>
    <P>The Government have neglected making submissions to the EC.  This has been confirmed to us and I would not say it if it were not true.  The Government have been sadly neglectful on the submission of plans that could have brought additional moneys to this city and country. They are happy to get the lump sum from the EC and spend it in any form they like.  Last year, Dublin City Council and the county council went to Brussels where they were astounded to be assured that the Government had failed to make submissions in respect of plans and proposals for which there was money available, initially for the survey and subsequently for the plan itself, if acceptable. It was indicated to us that what we had talked about would fit admirably into that but, no, the Government did not bother.  Even though as a member of the Cabinet he was aware of the submission which had been made to the then Minister for Local Government in respect of this plan, he did not bother.  When he took over himself he wondered what he might do &mdash; again, this is the same Minister who some years ago had another grandiose plan &mdash; but he did not bother.  Then, we hear about the virtue of what they are doing.  They castigate us for playing politics. We play politics because we see in this the greatest affront ever to the elected members of this great city.  We have plans for Dublin and when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I am talking about councils which were controlled by Deputy Kelly's friends.  They prepared them also because they had the correct interpretation of what was best for the city. We are now expected on behalf of the citizens to applaud a Minister and a House who make little of the elected representatives.  Why does he not do away with the council altogether?</P>

      <P>This is another indication of the ignorance and arrogance of the Deputy who would break Standing Orders by speaking from a part of the House where he is not entitled to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> That is the &ldquo;great gas&rdquo; that Professor John Kelly is and we get a typical example.  It is real L and H stuff.  I know that as well as he does: I know his style and attitude.  He is a great man for the cheap laugh at the expense of this House and oft times at the expense of his own leader if he thinks it would ingratiate himself with the student population.  We should expect a little higher than that from him.  He is not going to intimidate me from behind my back.  I would be much happier if he had stayed in the House.  I would repeat some of what I said about him in his absence and would be prepared to add to it if he were present.</P>
    <P>What does this Bill do for Dublin that the elected members of Dublin Corporation, together with their excellent management and planners were not capable of doing?  Absolutely nothing. Rather it has delayed what we were preparing and were anxious to do.  This is all because one little bit of credit &mdash; a foolish interpretation of it &mdash; might go to the new Fianna Fáil control, although it is not controlled entirely by Fianna Fáil at present.  It has been made to appear that it has come from the Minister.  If the Minister gave a guarantee to the House that he was putting up the £10 million in additional moneys I might have some regard for what is proposed.  The Minister might remind the House that with regard to last year's finances Dublin Corporation were docked £8.5 million or £8.6 million. Dublin is in need of the attention which is envisaged here.  Nobody but a fool would deny that, but what annoys and angers me is that the need has been delayed so that it would appear it was being done by the Minister and the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously, there is the affront which has been thrown at the elected members.  How can the Minister for the Environment expect that people should continue to have respect for the members of the corporation in circumstances where he advertises they are not capable of performing their functions?  One would not mind at all if there was any evidence <Col N="896" /> that they had been neglectful.  His conscience should be at him knowing, that what he has here is a &ldquo;cog&rdquo; from what Dublin Corporation had planned.  I do not know and it is because of my regard for people, and their right to elect whosoever they please, that I would here or anywhere else defend their right to do that and defend the people they return to represent them.  It was because of that that I endured as a member of the corporation for about 15 years a Coalition-controlled corporation saying that no member of the Fianna Fáil Party was good enough or entitled to be Lord Mayor of this city.  That remark was made by the people who now preach tolerance and tell us how we should regard all the voices, small, tiny and delicate.</P>
    <P>From 1967 to 1986 it was agreed policy of the Coalition parties, even though at times Fianna Fáil had a greater representation on the corportion, greater than all others, that no Fianna Fáil man or woman should serve in the highest office.  That was ordained by those parties and now they tell us that we should not be preaching politics.  I am not going to take that from them.  They have succeeded in other areas by dastardly repetition of other things that were accepted for a short while but, thankfully, the people have seen through the old veneer of virtue and the hypocrisy.  They have seen that all the greats and the goods they were supposed to have have now turned out to be flops and frauds.  They have seen that other people who were being attacked by them have survived, will survive and will lead the country presently.</P>
    <P>When I was Lord Mayor the Taoiseach of the day visited the Mansion House and sat among people who were castigating Dublin Corporation because of what they described as a lack of proper treatment in respect of planning and so on.  He pledged solidarity to people who were attacking Dublin Corporation.  To a large extent those attacks were groundless but that was the card to play, the card of the lobby at the time.  It did not do much for democracy.  It was not great leadership. The Taoiseach knew that the problems that are attributed to Dublin Corporation <Col N="897" /> derive from a miscellany of other difficulties and omissions.  It is not the members of Dublin Corporation who decide that a developer, who is able to employ the best legal and architectural services available can within the law build some appalling edifice on the side of our roads.  The corporation have endeavoured at all times to protect what is desirable. The character of Dublin in its best form.  However, they have not had the legal or financial resources to do so.  Why should we be joining with lobbies that would blame members of Dublin Corporation for all the inadequacies of the city, especially when simultaneously one is expected to be giving leadership in the democratic process?</P>
    <P>It grieves me when I travel through O'Connell Street to see the hurdy-gurdy frontages we have.  When I was Lord Mayor I contacted business people and indicated to them, where appropriate, my concern for the damage they were doing to our city.  However, I could only appeal to them because those people had the protection of the law.  How does one change the law?  Dublin Corporation, in deference to what is in the master plan, co-operated with the shopkeepers in Henry Street and Mary Street and invested our money with theirs in the pedestrianising of those streets.  We engaged the services of architects who co-operated with us and the shopkeepers and companies concerned to improve the general appearance of the two streets. We achieved great success and the only limitation on us was finance.  We would have proceeded further were it not for the fact that last year the Minister of the day left us £8.6 million short.</P>
    <P>All members of Dublin Corporation, The Workers' Party, Sinn Féin, Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil, have demonstrated that they are committed representatives. We give of our time and effort to try to make Dublin a better place for those who live in the city, work in it or come to visit it.  Now we are expected to accept that there is some special reason why a commission has to be established to do the work we had planned.  This is only a political gimmick, an attempt by <Col N="898" /> the Minister in the dying days of the Government to make it appear that at last they have done something.</P>
    <P>What we have now is not very different from what occured at the Ard Fheis when the leader of the country, who during the four years since his election saw the country move from disaster to disaster and unemployment figures rise from 127,000 to 250,000, not including those who have emigrated, made the great discovery that our problem was unemployment. He challenged anybody else to say differently as if we, or anybody else, were saying it.  He made that great discovery too late.  We have now this discovery that Dublin cannot be improved unless the Minister offers this affront to the elected representatives.  As I read the legislation it appears that the commission will be given £10 million but Dublin Corporation will have to pay.  That amount will be stopped from them or they will be required to pay it over.  How can anybody justify wasting the time of the House on something as vindictive, futile and petty as this?  How can one justify delaying something that is necessary so as to create the impression that &ldquo;A&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;B&rdquo; is doing something?  I know what politics are about but when I hear the perpetrators of this accuse us of their own sins it is natural that I get annoyed as would any normal person.</P>
    <P>We are blessed that we have a city manager who is second to none and I venture to say that he has a high regard for the elected members of his corporation. It was through him that our plan was submitted to the Department. He would have known of submissions he made in respect of Dublin Corporation getting money from the Regional Fund. He was told by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, that it was not possible.  The Government got the lump sum, gobbled it up and distributed it in any fashion they thought appropriate.  I can imagine his position when presented with this and invited to serve.  Because it is in the interest of the city and confirms what he himself knows to be necessary, naturally he would agree to membership of that commission.  I do not entirely take <Col N="899" /> the point made by my colleague, Deputy Flaherty, that he would have wished it to be that way.  As I see it, it was imposed on him and he could not move away from it.  If he were here I would ask him if he would not have the same faith in his own officials, planners, engineers and professional people and in his own council to carry out this work if the resources were made available.  If that question were put to him I am quite sure the answer would be in the affirmative.  The same applies in respect of other bodies which will accept membership.  They are not defenders of democracy and they are happy enough to think that the work will take place.  My deep complaint is against any Minister of Government who would make so little of the elected representatives of this city as to indicate that they are not fit to carry out a programme which is so essential to the life of our city.</P>
    <P>I have sat in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's chair and have been conscious of speakers being repetitive, but a point as important as this cannot be made too often, especially in this House.  What will happen in a few years' time if some person is in a position to make little of this House in respect of its duties and obligations?  Might we be told that we are not fit?  We get some elected representative of the calibre of Professor John Kelly coming in to make his skitty remarks about people who are elected under our democratic system.  Suppose it is decided that this place is no longer necessary to discharge its functions.  Will we be happy about it?  Will we come back and say that when the electoral system was under attack in respect of local government there was nobody there to defend it?</P>
    <P>This Minister came into politics through Dublin County Council and I know that he was an esteemed and forceful chairman of that body, always ready and anxious to assert his position as chairman, even in respect of demarcation positions in the city concerning his area of jurisdiction as against that of the Lord Mayor of the day.  He was rightly conscious and respectful of his position.  I <Col N="900" /> feel similarly.  I have the same respect for an elected member of Dublin Corporation or Meath County Council, Offaly County Council or Cork Corporation as I have for this House in so far as he or she has been deemed fit, in the wisdom of the people required and entitled to vote, to carry out his or her duties.  Yet here we have the Minister who should be the leader in that area usurping the role of the elected representatives in carrying out the functions, duties and responsibilities which are theirs.  More especially, he adds to it by taking from them the plan they had prepared.  Deputy Bertie Ahern, the current Lord Mayor, read it out word for word today.  The spirit of the Minister's plan was already in a plan prepared more than 18 months ago in Dublin Corporation. The Inner City Draft Review Plan contains all the material in this, except that it moves beyond the backbone of the city.</P>
    <P>The Minister has succeeded in getting one or two people to come into the House to support him.  I was attracted to the rather short and unenthusiastic contribution made by my colleague, Deputy Joe Doyle, a decent man and a member of Dublin Corporation.  I was attracted too, with one or two reservations, to the contribution made by my colleague, Deputy Mary Flaherty.  They know that the affront is to them.  The main speaker brought in, someone always good for a laugh, was Deputy John Kelly.  He was the man engaged to make little of the elected representatives of Dublin Corporation, to make little of their gowns and wigs and forget his own.  He is always good for a laugh, great gas.  The great gas would be acceptable if the learned professor were not, as I would see it, doing so much damage to our democracy and our system of electing people who, in the opinion of the electorate, are those best fitted to carry out the functions of Dublin Corporation.  It is playing politics to make little of them, having hogged their plan and presented it as one of the achievements of this Government.  If that is not playing politics, then I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> The strategy of this Government is as follows: when conscience is at you, attribute whatever is annoying you to the other fellow.  That is the policy of the handlers, the policy which has carried this Government in the four years of wobble which we have endured to date.  Thank heavens it is now coming to an end.  Dá thaide a théinn an sionnach, beirtear air sa deireadh.  It is regrettable that it has taken four years to catch this particular sionnach, but better late than never. While the Minister may say that the Fianna Fáil group are not anxious to join with him in helping to improve our city, the people of Dublin will know that over the years the elected representatives, given the necessary resources, were capable of so doing.</P>
    <P>What we are getting here is party politics at its meanest, a new type of approach that has come following the change in the numerical strength of the Fianna Fáil Party in Dublin Corporation.  Like every other gimmick which this Government have indulged in, it will not work.  The sooner the better we have an opportunity of demonstrating that.  The sooner the better the opportunity comes to the people of Dublin to show that they do not wear this gimmickry from the Minister and the Government and, more importantly, they do not wear this Government in anything they presume to do.</P>

    <Title>EC Equality Directive: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann requests the Government to amend the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, to ensure that no family, or individual, will suffer a loss of income as a result of this implementation of the Equality Directive on 17th November, 1986.</P>
      <P>The EC directive on equal treatment in social security ruled that women and men be treated equally in employment and related social security schemes.  Now, almost two years after the deadline for its implementation &mdash; 22 December 1984 &mdash; the Government are finally completing the process for implementation of this directive in a shabby and disgraceful fashion which totally distorts the spirit underlying the principle of equal treatment in matters of social security between women and men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> It is intolerable that some 20,000 families who are barely existing with the help of social welfare payments should suffer a loss of income because of the means chosen by the Government to implement the Equality Directive.  The Government's abysmal response in this matter has stripped away the mask of social concern and enlightenment assumed by the posse of poseurs who make up the present Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The directive, in the true spirit of equality as envisaged by the Treaty of Rome, provides for regulations to be drawn up to protect low income families who might otherwise lose out when the directive comes into effect, especially families who would suffer a significant loss of income due to the revised conditions relating to dependancy.  Yet the Government have shamefully failed to provide adequate measures to ensure that low income families will not be disadvantaged further as a result of the coming into force of phase 2 of the equality provisions relating to social security.</P>
    <P>The austerity policies pursued by the Government in relation to social welfare and the social services, in general have led to an increase in poverty, social deprivation, and delinquency, with all the consequences these imply for society. This further blow to 20,000 of the most vulnerable families on this island represents a further erosion of the social welfare system by the Government and further marginalisation of the have nots in our society.</P>
    <P>The Government are under no obligation to implement the directive in this miserly fashion.  The European Commission lays down the principles of the directive, leaving it to the discretion of each member state to implement the legislation, the only stipulation being that the principle of equality be respected.</P>
    <P>This Government have attempted to confuse the public and even some of their own backbenchers about the Equality Directive, they have misrepresented and confused the issue so as to imply that whatever losses that may be incurred are not of their own making; that it is an essential part of the Equality Directive; <Col N="905" /> that the EC are to blame and not themselves. This is not so and it is high time that this misrepresentation and misconception was finally nailed.</P>
    <P>Since May of this year the essential equality elements of the directive have been in operation but now this Government, in typical sleight of hand, three card trick style are, by labelling the next stage the second stage or phase 2, attempting to claw back some $17 million from social welfare recipients in a full year.  This has not been the accepted procedure in other EC countries but this heartless monster of a Government will resist no means to inflict their penny-pinching policies on our shattered society.</P>
    <P>The Court of Justice of the European Communities has ruled that the principle of equal treatment is one of the fundamental principles of the Treaty, but the improvement of living and working conditions is equally a fundamental principle of the Treaty.  If both are to be observed, then it is only right that governments seek to attain equal treatment along with social progress.</P>
    <P>The action of the Government in relation to implementing equality in the social welfare code ignores this option and, as a result, it is clear that the financial distress being experienced by thousands of families will increase.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act of 1985, which aimed to give effect to equality of treatment in social security, amendments tabled by myself, as spokesman for the main Opposition Party, in an attempt to protect the incomes of vulnerable households were disallowed.</P>
    <P>I think a majority of Deputies will agree that where a wife works, part time or whole time, for a very low income, her husband, if he is in receipt of any type of social welfare benefit, should not lose his dependancy claim for her.  There are some 3,000 families where the income of the wife is on or below £50 a week.  This leaves 9,000 families, where the wife is working and the husband is receiving welfare payments of one kind or another, with an income of £50 or upwards.  In at <Col N="906" /> least 50 per cent of these 9,000 families, the wife is earning between £50 and £100 per week, which by any standard is a relatively small amount.  Yet the Minister, in setting the parameters of this legislation, ruled that only a spouse whose weekly wage is less than £50 per week would be regarded as a dependant.  This figure, as I pointed out in the debate last year, is much too low and as a result many families will be severely hit with the introduction of the Government's phase 2 operation.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, in tabling this Private Members' motion, are giving the Government the opportunity to minimise the hardship which will affect some 20,000 families with the introduction of phase two in its present form.</P>
    <P>From July 1985 I pointed out to the former Minister for Social Welfare that the changes should not be made in one fell swoop, since it had taken since 1978 to implement the directive.  I pointed out that it would not be unresonable to expect that a loss such as that which will be incurred could be compensated for, in a percentage fashion, on a phased basis over perhaps a six year period, which would constitute a real mitigation.  Such a course of action would moreover reflect the spirit and intentions behind the equality directive.</P>
    <P>Some 8,000 families will lose from £20 to £30 per week as a result of these provisions. This is a considerable number. These are families where both parents are on social welfare payments in one form or the other and the husband will now lose his wife's dependancy allowance. To force them into a position in which, for one year, they will incur an average loss of £10 to £20 per week, after which they will have to bear the full brunt of what would be a loss of £20 in real terms is not availing of the provisions of the directive in its fullest meaning.  The Minister should aim the measure to fully mitigate the loss resulting from the implementation of the directive in all of those cases where both parents are receiving social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Second Stage <Col N="907" /> of the legislation implementing the equality provision in social security, the then Minister commented last June that &ldquo;the resolution of inequalities can be approached in a number of ways&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, as we know, equality can be brought about in a number of ways.  This Government sought to do so by bringing the standards of living of families downwards rather than by bringing them upwards.  I pointed out last year, that the redefinition of dependency adopted in the legislation piloted through by the Minister's predecessor, unless stronger alleviating measures were taken, would result in misery and suffering for a large number of families, to whom each pound note is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>In a large number of cases, where the earnings of the wife are very low, the reduction in the benefit entitlement of the husband will represent a substantial loss of income to the household.  The former Minister, in referring to this state of affairs on 25 June 1985 pointed out that the legislation &ldquo;contained the necessary power to enable me to provide alleviation in such cases&rdquo;.  The losses will be quite staggering for literally thousands of families unless the Minister is persuaded at this late hour to increase her use of such powers.</P>
    <P>A man on disability benefit with three children will have a cut in his dependants' allowance of £24.15 per week.  Even if his spouse receives an increase of £4.50 per week, that will not compensate for the loss.  In the case of an elderly man whose children no longer live at home his depenant's allowance will be cut by £27.50 per week, whereas his wife's increase may be only £5.10 per week.  A man on disability benefit with three children, whose wife's take home pay is £50 or more, could see a reduction of £40.90 in his flat rate welfare payment.  Where the husband is on benefit and the wife is at work, with a family of three children, the result could be a loss in flat rate benefit of up to £37 per week.  The effect of such a loss where the wife is low paid will be traumatic.</P>
    <P>In the case of a disabled man, in receipt <Col N="908" /> of an invalidity pension, with four children, and a wife at work whose take home wages are £80 a week, the pension entitlement of such a person will be reduced by about £48 per week in respect of his wife and children.  This will mean a reduction in the household income from about £200 to £150 a week.  The bottom line is that families will suffer enormous losses of between £20 to £60, if the Government go ahead with implementation of the directive as planned.</P>
    <P>It is therefore highly regrettable that the progressive implementation suggested in the EC Equality Directive on social security at the outset should have been ignored, and that the Government should not have availed of the past four years to gradually effect the reforms. Instead low income families will be expected to bear relatively very heavy losses overnight.  What we seek is a mode of equalisation which causes the minimum hardship to social welfare families. We cannot accept the Government's chosen means of implementing the directive. The fact that it will cause enormous financial hardship to thousands of families at present in receipt of social welfare payments distorts completely the fundamental principles underlying the Directive and the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The concept of equality between the sexes is fundamental to Fianna Fáil.  We aim to end discrimination towards women in all areas, including social security and employment.  Especially in relation to the latter, there remains considerable room for improvement.  It was in this spirit that we unreservedly welcomed the implementation of the directive last May.  It is only right and proper that women in receipt of social welfare payments, in particular married women, would receive the same payments as men and for the same period of time, and that women have gained admittance to the unemployment assistance scheme, subject to means testing.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget however that the extra benefit to some 46,000 married women since May is quite small.  The figure amounts to some £4.75 increase per week.  This benefit must be set against <Col N="909" /> the fact that some 9,000 families will not receive compensation for the loss of social welfare payments, which will result from the redefinition of dependancy as defined by the Government.  The plight of social welfare families has been documented exhaustively.  It is increasingly difficult for them to live on the existing level of payments as is clear from increasing recourse to supplementary welfare payments to cover the minimum requirements of life.</P>
    <P>All of us have been shocked and horrified to hear that in recent times many families on social welfare payments had to seek the aid of the lowest forms of reptiles in the money lending business to help them to finance essential family needs.  I am sure the Minister is aware of that.  I ask you how many more families will now be forced because of absolute necessity and dire financial need to have recourse to such methods with all its consequent hardships.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to pause and reflect on what a loss of between £20 and £60 a week in social welfare payments will mean to families who are on the brink of destitution and at present are barely able to provide the necessities of life.  I would ask the Minister herself, the mother of a family, to consider the implications of going ahead with the introduction of this claw back phase of the directive, as planned, and to consider what it will mean for many thousands of men, women and children.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be all too well aware of the impact of the Government's approach to social welfare on the population. On the one hand, the Government has given paltry increases in social welfare since it came into office.  On the other hand, the Government take away these benefits by halving the food subsidies and by increasing VAT on clothes and fuel.  This year this heartless Government gave absolutely no increase at all to child dependants or families dependant on social welfare.  This was another sorry saga in this Government's anti-family policy.  They cruelly, callously and unapologetically made a saving of £10 million in this year's budget and the sufferers <Col N="910" /> were families with child dependants. One has to wonder where will the assault on family income support end. This Government seem to be obsessed with the introduction of methods and measures specifically designed to create family destruction and social deprivation. This Government are shameless, arrogant and totally irresponsible.  Now, with the implementation of the EC directive we see a repetition of this pattern.</P>
    <P>The Government are running true to the form displayed over the past four tragic years.  Underprivileged families are to suffer a further erosion of their incomes.  Poverty and destitution are rampant and this Government have heartlessly pursued in relentless fashion their policy of making the poor poorer. With this savage attack on the less well-off, this calculated further erosion of the supports provided by the State, where lies the credibility of the present Government on social issues?  Where is their much vaunted commitment to social justice?</P>
    <P>The Minister commented on 20 June of this year during the debate on the 1986 Estimates of her Department, that improvements in expenditure &ldquo;ensured that the incomes of those dependent on the social welfare system are maintained in real terms&rdquo;.  That is fiction.  Not alone have the Government failed to halt and reverse the upward trend in unemployment, they have failed miserably to provide adequately for the families suffering from the consequences of their failure.  The losses currently facing thousands of families as a result of the Government's draconian and savage approach to the implementation of the equality directive on social security is the last straw.</P>
    <P>On 14 November 1985, in a wide-ranging public lecture entitled &ldquo;Ireland and Social Reform Today&rdquo;, in the Milltown Institute, the Taoiseach commented that &ldquo;dignity of the individual is central in the delivery of public services whether social welfare payments, hospital care or psychiatric care&rdquo;.  He stated:</P>
    <P>The very depth of the recession can intensify social problems and exacerbate <Col N="911" /> inequality in our society.  Large scale unemployment creates a society where poverty, alienation, crime, drug abuse and marriage breakdown are likely to increase... So, social reform becomes more, not less urgent in harsh economic times.</P>
    <P>One can concur with the sentiments expressed by the leader of the Government that any worthwhile social reform programme must involve serious efforts to tackle the jobs crisis, a redistribution of income and wealth, and increased resources for some individual social programmes.</P>
    <P>One can only point, however, to the yawning gap between aspiration and achievement and the failure at the most basic level of this Government to protect the most vulnerable and the weakest sections of society.  Once again, the Taoiseach as his colleague.  Deputy McGahon, once said of him, &ldquo;in racing parlance has flattered to deceive&rdquo;.  The Government's approach has been in stark contrast to the achievements of Fianna Fáil in this area.</P>
    <P>The long-term unemployed with families remain at the lower end of the social welfare spectrum in terms of benefit levels.  Despite the Taoiseach's pious platitudes on increasing the standard of living of such families, they are to be savaged by the Government's blunt and unimaginative approach to equal treatment under the social welfare code.  Disallowing the adult dependant allowance for married men who are on social welfare if their wives are working only part-time must be seen in the context of a situation where women are unequal in the employment sphere.  They enjoy neither equality of opportunity nor earnings.  At present, women's average earnings in industry are still only two-thirds of men's earnings.</P>
    <P>In the debate on this legislation on 25 June 1985 the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach stated that only 44 per cent of the married women at work are in full-time, jobs: nearly 40 per cent of all female part-time labour is <Col N="912" /> accounted for by catering and cleaning industries and retail businesses, with very low basic pay levels.  Such families will suffer an enormous loss in incomes if the Government proceed as they have been proceeding.</P>
    <P>In an election document entitled &ldquo;Where Labour Stands&rdquo;, it was stated:</P>
    <P>Labour utterly rejects any policy that makes the poor, the unemployed, the sick, the homeless and the young bear the brunt of corrective measures.</P>
    <P>The Labour-Fine Gael programme for government stated:</P>
    <P>Unemployment and disability benefit will be kept in line with take-home wages and salaries.  Expenditure on social benefits will be maintained in the light of inflation, so that even if a drop occurs in the immediate future in the purchasing power of better off groups in the community, the living standards of the sections of the community dependent on social welfare payments will be maintained.</P>
    <P>What is happening?  These pledges have turned to ashes as the most vulnerable sections of society have constantly been disadvantged by the policies of the present Government.  The Government are now being given an opportunity to retrieve themselves somewhat by amending the Act.</P>
    <P>The Department estimate that the cost of implementing equal welfare benefits would be £18 million in a full year.  It seems to me that this Government are fiddling these figures as they have done in the past, particularly in their projections earlier this year for next year's budget deficit when they stated that the overrun would be just £60 million and when they underestimated the cost of unemployment payments last year by £40 million.  Their credibility in the figures department leaves much to be desired. Some of them should go back to school and learn to add.</P>
    <P>I believe that the total cost of increased payments to married women, some 46,000 of them at £5 per week, will be in <Col N="913" /> the region of £11 million, that the cost of paying the extended duration of 13 weeks to some 19,200 married women on UB will be in the region of £10 million and that this Government intend this scheme to be almost self-financing by clawing back some $17 million or more from families on social welfare payments from 17 November next.  It is a classic example of robbing Peter to pay Paul and in this case of robbing the family to pay the mother.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been throwing around figures like peanuts in an attempt to confuse the issue.  The suggestion that it would cost £100 million to implement our demands is quite wrong and misleading and is a deliberate falsification of the facts.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been throwing around a figure of £100 million. It is misleading many people and leads to a falsification of the facts.  This top-of-the-head figure has been arrived at by suggesting that to implement our demands that husbands should not lose dependency rights for their wives or their children, wives on social welfare payments should be granted full dependency payments for their husbands and their children.  This is absolutely ludicrous. This concept was never entertained by us and is purely a figment of the Minister's imagination.</P>

    <P>I realise the Minister has been under enormous pressure because of this measure and the second phase which he will introduce in November.

I implore every Deputy on the other side of the House who has any form of social conscience to vote for this motion.

      <P>Equal treatment for men and women in respect of social welfare benefits, allowances and treatment generally is something we all support in this House and have done so consistently. The worsening of existing conditions concerns me.  Many thousands of people will be worse off as a result of this measure. In regard to this EC directive, it seems there is nothing equal or right in deliberately and for set purposes reducing the living standards of some 20,000 families in this country, many of whom will suffer a serious reduction of income of up to £40 or £50 a week.  I can say without fear of contradiction that the EC in issuing this directive on equal rights for women never intended that it be used by the member states, or Ireland in particular, to reduce incomes or lower the living standards of our people.  This is surely a serious violation of the spirit and intention of the EC directive.  By all means let us have equal rights for men and women but surely not at the expense of the old age pensioners, the sick, the disabled or the unemployed, who are already forced down to a subsistence level of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal, therefore, in its present form has become a grievous worry and a horrible nightmare for many thousands of people who stand to lose substantial amounts each week.  This proposal represents a vicious attack on family life. The reduction of one shilling a week in the old age pension by the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government pales into utter insignificance when compared with the massive reductions in this proposal.  A wife may gain £5 a week and the husband is quite likely to lose £40 or £50 a week in the process.  As an example of that it has been quoted many times here that we will see that a married man with four children on unemployment or disability benefit with a wife earning over £50 per <Col N="915" /> week, that is to say £51, would lose £45.20 per week.  A married man on, say, a contributory old age pension with a wife on unemployment benefit or disability benefit would lose £34.10 per week.  With the Minister's special subvention of £10 per week that old age pensioner would lose £24.10 per week.</P>
    <P>Massive reductions in incomes are involved here and the Minister's proposal to cushion the impact on living standards is totally inadequate in the circumstances. Therefore, I appeal to the Government to think again.  They will be forced to realise and recognise that far more inequality is involved in this proposal than equality and that it is bound to cause trouble and strife between husband and wife and create discord in thousands of homes.  The £50 limit on earnings will force wives to give up work altogether.</P>
    <P>We observe in this proposal that married women may apply for unemployment assistance.  That is of course if they fulfil the obligations of being ready, willing and available for work.  They must face the rigorous odious means test in which every halfpenny in the household will be reckoned against them.</P>

The Minister has done absolutely nothing to liberalise the means test or put a human face on it.  This proposal, in its present form, must be opposed by every right-thinking Deputy in the House.  It is clear that the damage it will do far outweighs the good intentions.  On that basis it must be rejected.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the measure <Col N="916" /> provided in the Social Welfare (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1985 as well as the regulatory measures announced by the Minister for Social Welfare in the course of the debate on the Bill, that the measures are necessary to give effect to the EEC Directive on equal treatment, that the measures were approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, that the discriminations against married women in the level of their personal rates of benefit and the duration of their entitlement to unemployment benefit were removed last May resulting in some 46,000 married women receiving increases of about £5 each in their weekly payments as well as a further 13 weeks entitlement in the case of those on unemployment benefit, the cost of which will amount to £18 million in a full year, that in relation to the remaining equal treatment measures, while there will be reduced entitlements in the case of some married men, there will be increased entitlements in the case of some married women, that in relation to those whose entitlements are to be reduced, alleviating measures are being taken at an annual cost of £9 million, that the vast majority of households receiving social welfare payments will not suffer any reduction in their entitlements and in the circumstances considers that the overall provisions are reasonable.</P>
    <P>The implementation of equal treatment in the social welfare system raises complex issues and I would like at the outset to give some background information to the House.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act 1985 provides for equal treatment for men and women in the Social Welfare system in accordance with the terms of an EEC Directive adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1978.  The directive applied to statutory schemes providing protection against sickness, invalidity, old age, unemployment and accidents at work and occupational diseases.  Social assistance, <Col N="917" /> in so far as it is intended to supplement or replace similar social insurance schemes is also embraced by the directive. It does not, however, apply to survivor's benefits nor to family benefits.  The directive requires that all sexual discrimination in the schemes in question, whether this is direct, or indirect by reference to marital or family status, must be removed.  The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act 1985 was designed to remove fundamental irregularities in the social welfare code affecting married women. Changes had to be made in four areas:</P>
    <P>1.  The rates of benefit paid to married women; 2.  The duration of entitlement of married women to unemployment benefit; 3.  The payment of increases in benefits to married women in respect of adult and child dependants; 4.  The admission of married women to the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>
    <P>In the past, certain married women received lower rates of benefit than men and other women in the schemes of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reading from notes. The married women so affected were deemed by the social welfare system to be dependants of their husbands and, in effect, therefore, any married woman living with her husband was deemed to be dependent on him whether working or not.  Second, the maximum duration of entitlement of a married woman to unemployment benefit was 312 days which is 52 weeks of benefit.  For other categories it was 390 days, a difference of 13 weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the first phase of the equal measures, which I implemented last May, two things happened.  First of all, the reduced rates of benefit paid to married women were replaced by the standard rates and this gave an increase of around <Col N="918" /> £5 a week to every married woman in receipt of unemployment or disability benefit.  The normal budget increase in rates payment was also given on top of this in July.  Second the duration of entitlement to unemployment benefit for married women was increased from 312 to 390 days thereby bringing it into line with that for all other insured workers. Some 46,000 married women benefited from these two major improvements at a cost to the Exchequer of some £18 million in a full year.  I think we should not lose sight of these major improvements in the system when looking at the effects of the equal treatment package as a whole.</P>
    <P>The remaining areas of discrimination against married women in the social welfare system will be eliminated by the implementation of the second phase of the equal treatment provisions in the week commencing 17 November 1986.</P>
    <P>Under the new dependency arrangements the existing presumption that any married woman living with her husband is automatically a dependant regardless of her own income status whereas a married man living with his wife and dependent on her earnings is not regarded as a dependant unless he is an invalid will disappear and for the first time a real concept of dependency will be applied. As a corollary of this any person, male or female, who is in employment or in receipt of a social welfare benefit in his/her own right will, in general, not be deemed their spouse's dependant for the purpose of qualifying for increases of benefit.</P>
    <P>The underlying concept in our social welfare code always had been that the husband was the breadwinner and head of household and the person to whom the full benefits of the social security system should be available.  Consequently, the husband was also deemed by social welfare legislation to be the person to whom increases in respect of dependants should be paid.  As I have already said any married woman living with her husband was automatically regarded as his dependant. Only where the husband was incapable of self-support through mental or physical infirmity could the wife claim him as her <Col N="919" /> dependant.  As a consequence the husband almost always qualified for increases in respect of his wife and children even where the wife was in employment or receiving benefit in her own right.  This approach was undoubtedly relevant at a time when it was most exceptional for a married woman to take up employment outside the home but in today's society this is no longer the case.</P>
    <P>What we are now doing is treating married women in the labour market as in principle financially independent in exactly the same way as married men and recognising, within the social welfare payments system, the role of married women in contributing to the support of their children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>At present only the husband can, in general, qualify for child dependant increases.  In future where either spouse whether the husband or the wife is the only one in the labour force, that person, when claiming a social welfare payment, will qualify for the full increases in respect of children.  Where both spouses are in the labour force each spouse will have an entitlement to 50 per cent of the appropriate increase when claiming benefit.</P>

      <P>Accordingly, from November a person who is entitled to get an allowance for his/her spouse will also get the full rate of benefit for children; half the rate of benefit for children will be paid where either spouse claims benefit but is not entitled to an allowance for <Col N="920" /> the other spouse; if a husband and wife are both getting benefit in their own right they will each get half the children's rate.</P>
      <P>At present, married women are effectively debarred from applying for unemployment assistance.  In order for a married woman to qualify, either her husband must be dependent on her &mdash; and under existing legislation this means that he must be wholly or mainly maintained by her and incapable of self support by reason of some mental or physical infirmity &mdash; or she must not be dependent on him.  Because the present definition of dependency provides that all married women are dependent on their husbands as long as they are living with them the vast majority of married women cannot apply for unemployment assistance.  This position will change from November and henceforth married women may qualify for unemployment assistance, subject to satisfying the means test and provided that the applicant is available for and is genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>The most complex aspect of equality of treatment is that relating to increases in respect of dependants and much of the current debate on the equality of treatment proposals &mdash; to the extent of overshadowing the major reforms implemented last May &mdash; has been concerned with the proposed new dependency conditions.  Demands have been made by the Opposition that all benefits must be levelled upwards and that no-one should suffer a reduction in entitlements. However, the present conditions which apply to men cannot automatically be applied to women.  To do so would imply that in order to achieve equality all married men should automatically be regarded as dependants of their wives claiming benefit, irrespective of employment or economic status.</P>

      <P>At the same time all wives would equally be regarded as dependants of their husbands.  This would be a totally illogical and unjustifiable situation and I am glad the Deputy sees that now.</P>
      <P>For example, in the case of a married couple where both were absent from work due to illness, the husband would receive an increase in respect of his wife as an adult dependant and he would also receive the full increases in respect of child dependants.  At the same time, the wife would receive an increase in respect of her husband as an adult dependant and she too would receive the full increases for the child dependants.  In other words a married couple with two children say, would receive payment of two personal rates, two increases for adult dependants and two full increases for child dependants. No reasonable person could say that such an approach would be anything other than wasteful and, indeed inequitable.</P>
      <P>Equal treatment on these lines could not be defended on rational grounds and would require a massive injection of financial resources.  Equal treatment as defined by the EC directive must, therefore, involve a revision of the present dependency conditions on a rational basis.  In future only spouses who are wholly or mainly maintained by their partners will be considered dependants and this will not be the position where a spouse is employed, self-employed or entitled to benefit in his or her own right. However, where the employment involves earnings of under £50 a week the spouse will continue to be regarded as a dependant and the full dependant increases payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reductions in the entitlements of husbands will occur but such reductions are inevitable because the present adult dependency arrangement is not defensible. As I stated earlier, it gives a husband an increase for his wife not alone where she is employed but even where she is entitled to benefit in her own right.  In effect the social welfare system is at present paying on the double for the same person.  There is no objective reason why <Col N="922" /> such families should receive more from the social welfare system than families where one spouse is dependent on the other.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 150,000 married men in receipt of benefit at present and the vast majority of these, 130,000, will not be affected in any way by the equal treatment provisions.  I want to stress because it is crucial to this debate that there are 20,000 cases who are potentially affected.  Of these, however, in about 3,000 cases the wife is in employment with earnings of less than £50 per week and that family will suffer no loss because of the £50 threshold alleviating measure which the Government are introducing.  There are a further 9,000 cases in which the wife is in employment earning more than £50 per week and they will suffer a loss of income varying by family size.  However, in many of these cases, the wives would have earnings in excess of £100 per week.</P>
    <P>In the remaining 8,000 cases, both spouses are dependent on social welfare and in such cases the husband will not receive an increase in payment in respect of his wife.  We would obviously wish to protect such families from any drop in income but it must be remembered that no permanent measures can be considered as any such steps that are taken are themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment laid down in the EC directive.  Section 20 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, passed by this House in July 1985 contains a general provision enabling temporary and transitional arrangements to be made on a limited basis.  It has already been stated on a number of occasions by myself and my predecessor that regulations will be made under this section to provide a special transitional payment of £10 per week to families where both spouses are entitled to a social welfare payment in their own right.  This transitional payment will continue to be made for the duration of the claim up to a maximum period of one year.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned, as all Deputies are, about those people who are totally dependent on social welfare <Col N="923" /> payments and the effect that the loss of income would have on those families with a regular financial commitment.  In those cases where the £10 alleviating measure may be inadequate, application for assistance may be made under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The Department will have discussions with the health boards on this and revised guidelines will be issued.  This is a transitional arrangement in the same way as the £10 and will only apply to existing claimants.  That applies to the 8,000 cases where both spouses are dependent on social welfare.  Deputies may not realise that many married women will benefit substantially from changes in these dependency arrangements also.</P>
    <P>In the case where only the wife works and her husband is a dependant &mdash; in a reversal of the traditional roles &mdash; she will be entitled to the full adult and child dependant increases as long as her husband is not on benefit.  At present she can only qualify if her husband is an invalid. This would give married women with three children in such circumstances a gain of over £55 a week compared with the present provisions, in addition to the higher personal rates to which she is now entitled.  In the case where the wife works and her husband is not a dependant, because he is either working or on benefit himself, the wife will now be entitled to claim half the child dependant allowances.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the growing number of misleading statements which are being made regarding the manner in which the equality provisions are being implemented.  There is a very clear and inaccurate suggestion that these provisions are being used by the Government in some fashion as a cost-saving exercise. Nothing could be further from the truth. Overall the cost of implementation of the equal treatment measures is £18 million in a full year.  More specifically, the £50 earnings threshold for dependency will cost £4.6 million in a full year while the cost of the £10 transitional measure is £4.3 million per year.  This means that the Government are spending about £9 <Col N="924" /> million per year above and beyond the minimum cost required to secure compliance with the directive.  The Government have made an effective response to the difficulties for certain families arising from the implementation of the EC directive particularly in the light of the current financial situation.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the genuine concern from Deputies on all sides of the House, I am disappointed that there are those within the House who have attempted to make political capital out of a matter such as this.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  I have heard rumours that some members of the Opposition are advising social welfare recipients not to return questionnaires which my Department recently issued in connection with the implementation of phase 2 of equal treatment.  As I explained already, the measures will not affect the position of 130,000 of the 150,000 married men on social welfare payments in any way.  My Department have to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that where changes have to be made they are made in time and where entitlements are to continue unchanged arrangements are also made to enable this to be done.  For this reason it is in everybody's interest that the forms are returned in time.  I should explain that my Department will be issuing reminders in the next few days explaining the necessity of having the forms returned promptly.  The vast majority of recipients will not be affected at all by the new arrangements and any Deputy who advises such a person to withhold the form is doing social welfare recipients a grave disservice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To summarise, of the total number of <Col N="925" /> 20,000 cases affected steps will be taken to fully or partially alleviate the adverse effects of the revision.  Debate on the alleviating measures should not obscure the main purpose of the 1985 Act which is the removal of fundamental inequalities in the present system.  The Act in its entirety is a positive and logically sound response to the provision of equal rights in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Previous Ministers for Social Welfare, faced with the problems arising from equal treatment came to the same conclusion as are provided in the 1985 Act. In 1978 the Minister for Social Welfare who is now the Leader of the Opposition required a statement to be inserted in the council minutes to the effect that the Irish delegation in accepting the adoption of the directive considered that nothing in the directive prevented arrangements being made to control dependency payments so as to avoid paying increases of benefit in respect of a spouse when that spouse is already receiving benefit or is in employment, or to control payments of increases for children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying it now.  We fully endorse the EC directive on equality for women.  I do not see equality for women in the regulations concerning unemployment assistance for married women as they state they must be available for work.  May we have an assurance from the Minister for Social Welfare that they will not be asked if they have children? Will fathers collecting unemployment assistance be asked who will take care of their children?  Let us settle it once and for all and ensure that there is equality for married women in their entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that in the process of seeking to implement this, the Minister has inflicted serious hardship on thousands of families and individuals, so much so that her cure is worse than the disease.  From 17 November thousands of families will suffer a serious drop in income.  To them, the most vulnerable section of the community, it is literally <Col N="927" /> catastrophic.  Many of these people are living at or below subsistence level.  We all know this as we meet them every day in our constituency work.  They are now being asked to accept a cut of as much as 25 per cent in their incomes.  In any other sphere if such a cut was imposed there would be social upheaval.  Can you imagine the trade union movement being forced to accept a 25 per cent drop in income?  The outcome would be a massive national strike which would bring about the downfall of the Government. Even the recent suggestion that certain trade union groups should accept a wage freeze brought about a public outcry, the Government ran for cover and the idea was abandoned.  These unfortunate people have no political clout or no trade union muscle and are being forced to accept a cut in income.  The Government merely say that the overall provisions are reasonable.  How callous and uncaring can you be?  The Government should be ashamed of the fact that over 10,000 families will suffer a serious drop in income. They think they can appease these people with the promise of a miserly sum of £10 per week for one year or until the end of their benefit entitlement.  How can the Government hold up their heads when so many of these people stand to lose £40 or £50 per week?</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy reminded us of the points made by Labour in their election programme that they would ensure that the poor would not suffer loss of income during their tenure in office.  I see that the previous Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Desmond, is the only member of the party here to defend them.  Compare the cavalier fashion in which the Government are bringing in this measure to the way they acted in all haste in bringing in emergency legislation to rescue the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank.  They gave a commitment to provide £120 million to rescue ICI and to save losses in AIB.  Deputy Desmond and his colleagues in the Labour Party supported that measure but he is silent now when a sum is called for to provide for these unfortunate people. <Col N="928" /> We are only asking for an interim payment to be made to these people until they get used to the change.</P>

      <P>The Government moved to make more than £120 million available to AIB and did not even give a commitment as to the total amount they would pay.  In the meantime AIB have reported substantial profits.  They are laughing, this House was the fool.</P>
      <P>The group who are to lose money are blameless whereas the trouble in AIB and ICI was as a result of lax business methods, irresponsibility and negligence. However, the Government had no qualms about providing money for them. The cost of compensating the people to whom I referred would be no more than £25 million.  Can the Labour Party renege on their promises to these people whose cause they profess to champion?  This is not a question of profligacy, it is a question of social justice.  When the EC prepared this directive they did not intend that individuals or families should suffer as a result.  The onus is on the Government to compensate these people and there are no restrictions by the EC in that regard.  We just want to ensure that these people have a minimum income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have chosen to ignore the pleas of many people on this issue.  Let me remind Fine Gael that their name was badly tarnished when they took a shilling off the old age pensions.  It was remembered for many years but it is nothing to what will happen now.  Their <Col N="929" /> callous attitude will tarnish their image even more because it will stick in the throats of these people when it comes to an election.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the Labour Party and their socially concerned Deputies.  I am sadly disappointed that they have reneged on their promises to these people because they profess to espouse their cause.  There are Ministers and Members in Labour who would find a happy home in Fine Gael but there are others who have a social conscience and who are concerned.  I ask those people, in conscience, not to support this measure.</P>

      <P>If this were not such a serious subject and if I had not intended to speak I would have found it difficult to listen to the pious platitudes from the other side of the House.  Fianna Fáil are the bleeding hearts club here tonight but, a few short months ago, I was here with my colleague, Deputy Barnes, and three or four other women talking about the removal of discrimination against women.  There was not a single Fianna Fáil Deputy in the House and at the last minute one Member sneaked in for a minute or two to take the bare look off the benches.  Where were the Opposition Deputies then to talk about discrimination against women?  I cannot find it in my heart to believe that their statements tonight and the statements of Deputy Seán McCarthy in June 1985 have any truth.  They do not ring true. They have not spoken on other measures to remove discrimination against women and I wonder if they are here because they can see political kudos in climbing on the backs of people who are the lowest paid section of the community.  Where are the Fianna Fáil women Deputies tonight?  Were they told to stay out so that the male Deputies could have a free run?  I do not expect many Fianna Fáil Deputies to undestand what it is like to be a woman and treated as a chattel in the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>Our concept of equality has been a basic commitment of this party since its foundation.  We have consistently stated that we are totally opposed to discrimination against women relating to their status, eligibility for employment or social security payments. That is why the Opposition had not the courage to vote against the legislation. Far from introducing this legislation in a grudging manner, the Government took time to find methods and voted money to alleviate the most damaging part of the legislation, which will undoubtedly affect some people.</P>
      <P>The discrimination that has existed here cannot be removed without causing hardship to some people. We women have suffered as people who were discriminated against by society, not because we were uneducated but because an accident of birth made us women.  It is as offensive to us as it would be to the gentlemen over there if they found they would not be allowed to claim social welfare, perhaps because they went bald prematurely.  They have no control over that; we have no control over our sex. Therefore, legislation should not discriminate against us because we are women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and her predecessor, Deputy Desmond, had the courage to introduce the legislation long after <Col N="931" /> Fianna Fáil reneged on it.  Deputy McCarthy said in a speech in June, 1985:</P>
    <P>I might stress the words &ldquo;the gradual application of equal treatment.&rdquo;  It is unfortunate that all of these changes, and the cost, should be inflicted on the public in one fell swoop.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy again of what the Minister has said.  Deputy Haughey was in Europe when this directive was implemented but he did nothing about it in 1979, 1980 and 1981.  Nothing was done by a Fianna Fáil Government when they had a huge majority here and when gradual implementation could have been commenced.  They did not have the courage to do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy McCarthy quoted the Taoiseach speaking about the dignity of the family.  It was not male dignity &mdash; it was dignity for both males and females in our society.  It is time the Opposition realised that there is more to getting rid of discrimination than mouthing platitudes about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell stood for the European Parliament in 1979.  I remember it particularly because I was standing in the local elections and I took a bit of interest in what was being reported in the newspapers: of course, as a newcomer I did not get anything like the lines of print Deputy O'Connell got.  He put himself forward as a champion of women and of women's causes: when he got to Europe he would work to get rid of discrimination even if it meant introducing changes at home.  To our shame, many pieces of legislation had to be introduced following court cases and now following an EC directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I find it sickening to have <Col N="932" /> to listen to some of the speeches from the Opposition.  They like to say these things and put them on their literature so that they will get what they call &ldquo;the women's vote&rdquo;.  The women of Ireland are much more astute and clever than the Deputy thinks.  They understand what Deputy McCarthy means when he makes speeches but does nothing about discrimination. Where are the women of his party tonight?  Have they been told to stay out so that there would be an all male line-up there to force the Government on something that was long overdue? Thanks be to God this Government have had the courage to bring it in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the three minutes available to me to point out that Ireland has no option but to accept the EC equality directive before 17 November next.  The directive is an important advance in ensuring that women will have equal treatment in regard to social welfare payments.  The most dramatic improvement is that married women can claim unemployment benefit for 15 months rather than 12 months back to last May, and thereafter they will get the full rate of benefit.</P>
      <P>However, there will be undoubted problems for certain sections of low income people.  Husbands on social welfare will lose allowances for their wives, or if the wives work for more than 18 hours per week or earn more than £50. The supplementary allowance regulations will have to be amended because otherwise many families will be victimised.  I wish to draw attention to the case of women who are being forced by assistance officers to try to find employment.  Under the Constitution, a woman cannot be forced to work and I hope the Minister will look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise another matter which is of great concern.  If the Minister does not reply to it tonight I hope she will make an announcement on it tomorrow or in the near future.  Is it true that a meeting of superintendent welfare officers from health boards together with departmental officials was held in Dublin on 20 October last?  I have learned that the <Col N="933" /> meeting broke up in disorder because the departmental officials were unable to clarify the workings of this directive.  I am reliably informed that community welfare officers and their superintendents are refusing to put this directive into operation and that they have so informed their trade unions, seeking the unions' support.  I do not wish to cause alarm or confusion but I ask the Minister, in fairness to everybody in receipt of social welfare benefits, to clarify this.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that this debate cannot be carried on in a responsible and mature way which recognises the importance of this directive and what it is going to mean for thousands of Irish women.  Forty-six thousand families are gaining and it suits the Opposition to ignore that fact and make petty political points on this debate.  They should be ashamed of themselves and I hope Irish <Col N="935" /> women remember this when it comes to the next election.</P>

      <P>I stand to speak to The Workers' Party amendment which calls for a review of the regulations implementing the equality legislation as it applies to persons in receipt of adult dependant allowance for their spouses. Deputy Fennell seemed to imply that because 46,000 women have benefited it is okay and that it is a petty matter to raise the fact that 20,000 women indirectly will be affected by the operation of this regulation. One complaint I made when the legislation went through this House and when I put down amendments is that it will severely affect the income of many thousands of families in such a way that they are going to be very badly affected financially and will not be able to meet their needs out of the income they have left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Hussey, stated that the supplementary welfare allowance system will act as a safety net to assist those who may be badly affected by this move.  I would ask her either here or on some other occasion in this House, perhaps tomorrow, to explain how this is going to work.  There are many community welfare officers who are not happy with the instructions they have received or the vagueness of the instructions they have received.  Despite the fact that this is being offered as an excuse for going ahead with the regulations as they stand, the position is that given the threshold over which one comes under the supplementary welfare allowance only a tiny minority of the 20,000 affected will come under the supplementary welfare allowance.  It is no answer to say that it is a safety net.  I would have expected much more from the Labour Party deputation which went to see the Minister yesterday than this paltry promise.  It was ludicrous to hear of the former Minister for Social Welfare who introduced the legislation going on a deputation with his party to see the Minister for Social Welfare to get it changed after he had <Col N="936" /> The opportunity when introducing it to change it.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about discrimination against women.  The way in which this legislation is being implemented is a direct discrimination against women in two ways.  First of all, it will force many women out of the workforce. A number of women have already come to me to say that they will give up work because it is not worth carrying on.  Secondly, a married woman will only receive &mdash; I raised this during the course of the debate &mdash; no matter whether she is entitled to it in her own right or otherwise the dependant allowance and no more whereas single couples will receive the full amount in both cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of making a brief contribution tonight.  Having listened to some of the speakers on the other side of the House it shows how much they are out of touch.  We have been saying that for so long.  The Minister and the Minister of State made a big play out of the 40,000 families who will benefit but they totally ignored the 20,000 families who are at the bottom rung of the ladder.  It is a sad night when Fianna Fáil have to put down a motion when we should be complimenting the Government that equal rights are in operation but because the Minister is out of touch and because of her attitude right throughout her term of office the less well off will suffer as a result of her policies.  The Taoiseach at the recent Ard Fheis said that it would be Fine Gael policy from here on in. Labour can either like it or lump it.  That is the way it is going to be from now on. The sooner the Labour Party get it into their heads that they have no contribution to make on behalf of the people the better for us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost one million people depend on social welfare in one form or another. Many families are barely managing to exist but even that standard of living is being threatened by the introduction of this measure.  Many people are now being asked to do with less than they were coping with up to now.  The timing of <Col N="937" /> this measure, coming as it does before Christmas, is another cruel blow to the unemployed and the less well off in our society.  These people have suffered the removal of food subsidies and the imposition of VAT on fuel, clothes and footwear. Many are now being asked to do with a reduction of a minimum of £26 per week.  Families where the mothers through necessity are forced to go to work to earn a living will be affected and family allowances will be reduced.  It will not be worthwhile for these persons to continue working.  In some cases brought to my attention in recent weeks it appears a working woman will be only £12 better off by working a 40-hour week even if we allow for a £10 allowance.  This means that the woman will be working for 50p an hour.  This is ridiculous but, unfortunately it is true.</P>
    <P>Many industries which employ skilled women will be threatened.  These women because of the injustice of this Act will now have to stay at home.</P>

      <P>There is one industry in my constituency which employs 150 women who have to get up early in the morning and go out again at night to work.  They will have to give up that job.  That will threaten their employer. Unfortunately, the Minister or the Minister of State or anybody on the other side of the House would not understand what that means.  They never had to go to the employment exchange to sign on and collect the dole or send their wives out to work in order to make ends meet. Once again, we see a cover-up by the Government and a public relations exercise. The Minister should do something for them but instead she has a callous <Col N="938" /> disregard for them.  She will not be forgotten by those people.  We would expect such action from Fine Gael because they have never been concerned about the less well-off but the discredited Labour Party who have always proclaimed their concern for the less well off will not be forgotten by the voters.  They have often expressed concern about the working class but when they have an opportunity of doing something for those people they turn to the left in the division lobby.  They should show their Coalition partners that they do not have anything in common with them and support our motion tonight.</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in supporting the motion moved so ably by Deputy Seán McCarthy.  I must question the timing for the introduction of this directive.  As Deputy Treacy pointed out the conditions under which people in receipt of social welfare benefits live worsen daily.  It is worth recalling that a few months ago the Minister for the Environment gave the necessary powers to county and city managers to increase the rents on local authority houses.  Now most of those people will suffer a reduction in their weekly income.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of comment this evening about the dignity of women and it is easy to do that in the House but it would be difficult to speak about the dignity of some women in constituencies like mine, Dublin South West, when some of those unfortunates have to trip many times during the week to see social welfare officers and officials responsible for supplementary welfare allowances in the hope of getting help to pay their bills and rent.  On many occasions I have asked the Minister, and the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Desmond, to make a trip to Tallaght to meet the local people.  Such a visit would be rewarding because the Minister would learn of the real problems those people face.</P>
    </Speaker>

Recently the Taoiseach told the people of Tallaght, when he visited them, that he cared for them but I wonder if he would describe the directive under discussion as caring. A Deputy asked tonight who would quibble about the loss of a few pounds per week but the unfortunate people who are striving to make ends meet stand to lose between £40 and £50 per week.  It is easy for some people to dismiss such a sum as irrelevant but people in my constituency, in Tallaght and Clondalkin, cannot afford such a drop in their weekly income.</P>
      <P>At Question Time today I was told that about 6,000 people are on the unemployed register in Tallaght.  Bearing that in mind I wonder why the Government have decided to develop a directive that will have the effect of cutting the income of some of those people.  All Members have had to plead for the unfortunate people who depend on supplementary welfare allowances.  I have no doubt that when the directive is adopted we will have to be making more appeals on behalf of those people.  It is surprising that we have not heard anything from the Minister about the payment of the double week benefit for Christmas.  Problems arose about the payments of that allowance last year but following pressure the Minister paid it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forecasts by Deputy McCarthy <Col N="940" /> when he introduced a Private Members' Bill on social welfare some time ago have been proved correct.  However, on that occasion, like tonight, we were accused of playing to the gallery but those of us who meet the people who are in distress realise that our statements are not wild.</P>
    <P>The position in my constituency has been allowed to deteriorate by the Government and nobody can deny that. What have they done to create employment there?  Factories have closed down and those anxious to set up industries have been steered clear of places like Tallaght and Clondalkin.  Those industrialists are driven through those areas at high speed and are not anxious to listen to the appeals of the local people or give them some hope for the future.  The directive will affect thousands of people in that constituency.  It is sad that we have to oppose it.  We should be in a position to compliment the Government on its introduction.  We have heard a lot of talk from them about their concern for the less well-off but they have yet to do anything to help them.  Prior to the last election the Labour Party told the electorate that they would ensure that the conditions of the people would not worsen while they were in Government but those conditions have deteriorated.  Where are the Labour Ministers tonight?</P>
    <P>The Government are wrong to adopt this directive a few weeks before Christmas.  Many families will be up to £50 per week worse off.  What does the future hold for them?  Deputy Haughey would never attempt to adopt a directive like this and, thankfully, he, or any Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, has never presided over a Government at a time when 300,000 people were unemployed and thousands emigrated.</P>

      <P>There is no legal bar to the allocation of sites by the corporation, other than to persons who are statutorily debarred from holding a casual trading licence because they have two or more convictions under the Casual Trading Act.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos.  19 and 20 together. I am aware of the claim by the Consumers' Association but am not convinced of its validity nor am I aware of the evidence on which it is based.  I understand that, since the abolition of detailed price controls, the oil companies in calculating their oil prices continue to operate on the basis of a formula which was set up by the National Prices Commission.</P>
      <P>The term cost of crude oil ex-refinery is built into the calculation of the formula to arrive at the basic product price.  Any reduction in this cost is automatically included in the progressive build-up of prices.  Information available to me indicates that price reductions have been effected in line with reductions in international oil prices including &ldquo;spot&rdquo; price levels for crude oil and that these savings have been incorporated into the cost of production and in large part into retail prices also.</P>
      <P>I am not considering the re-establishment of the National Prices Commission but I still retain the powers vested in me under the Prices Acts and will not hesitate to avail of them if at any time this seems necessary.  I also propose, within the next few weeks, to introduce a Bill which will extend the scope of other existing legislation to promote competition in the market place, thus keeping prices down and protecting consumer interests generally.</P>

      <P>The matter referred to by the Deputy will be covered in the commission's review and under the circumstances I feel it would not be appropriate to pre-empt the commission's report by making a statement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the light of the recent OECD survey which was very critical of Irish industry's overall approach to marketing, if he considers that it is essential to take action to increase the pool of skilled marketing personnel available to Irish enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I understand that the Deputy is referring to the European management foundation's world competitiveness report which was compiled with the assistance of 22 OECD member states and published in August. Based on the criteria adopted by the foundation, Ireland performed badly in relation to marketing.</P>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that these findings confirm the Government's own assessment in the last few years of industry's marketing shortcomings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1984 the White Paper on Industrial Policy identified the lack of marketing skills as a particular problem inhibiting the development of exports. <Col N="758" /> That view was further reinforced in the report of the sectoral development committee on marketing in April 1985 which considered that a strategic marketing capability was a fundamental requirement for successful export business operations.</P>
    <P>In general I accept that there is an urgent need for a strategic market-led approach by Irish industry to meet the needs of customers and the challenge of competitors in markets around the world.</P>
    <P>Accordingly resources were provided to expand the existing employment support scheme run by CTT which assists firms to employ full time overseas sales personnel.  In addition CTT, employing further additional resources which have been made available, has sought to redress marketing weaknesses by other schemes which include:</P>
    <P>(i)  a marketing manager grant scheme, which assists firms to employ marketing specialists to develop strategic marketing capabilities in those firms;</P>
    <P>(ii)  marketing training programmes organised by CTT and the IMI for existing managers in medium sized indigenous companies;</P>
    <P>(iii)  marketing traineeships involving work experience for graduates to help build up the marketing capability of firms;</P>
    <P>(iv)  The European orientation programme, organised by the CII and part funded by the financial institutions, CTT and the Youth Employment Agency, which is designed to improve the language proficiency and marketing skills of firms interested in the European market;</P>
    <P>(v)  country wide seminars and workshops on marketing to improve firms' awareness of marketing.</P>
    <P>In addition to the CTT schemes, the Irish Goods Council have introduced a marketplace scheme which offers Irish manufacturing companies, which do not have their own marketing staff, the full time <Col N="759" /> services of a marketing graduate for a one year trial period.</P>

      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board is continuing to monitor levels of radioactivity in the environment and in foodstuffs in order to <Col N="763" /> assess the contamination levels arising from the Chernobyl accident.</P>
      <P>The board collects and analyses samples of milk from dairies around the country. Levels of caesium detected are now in the region of two becquerels per litre compared with values of 300 becquerels per litre detected soon after Chernobyl. All traces of iodine have now disappeared. The board is also sampling a wide range of milk products including milk powder and butter for the home market and also for certification for export and purchasing into intervention. Levels of caesium detected in these various products were all below the levels laid down by the EC of 600 becquerels for foodstuffs and 370 for milk products for infant consumption.</P>
      <P>The board is continuing to monitor levels of radioactivity in beef, lamb and cereals.  The levels of caesium in beef and lamb are now considerably less than the levels recorded soon after the Chernobyl accident.  Levels of caesium in grain from this year's crops are barely detectable.  In addition levels of radioactivity in silage and in soils and pastureland are being examined.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of air filters at stations in Dublin and Valentia is continuing.  This programme is carried out with the assistance of the Department of Communications and the Meterological Service.  Levels of radioactivity have now returned to pre-Chernobyl levels.</P>
      <P>In addition regular monitoring of imported foodstuffs is also undertaken by the board.  Samples are taken at point of importation and random checks are made of products being sold in the Irish market. All of the samples taken were below the levels laid down by the EC and no control measures have been required.</P>
      <P>Additional staff, equipment and improved facilities have been approved to assist the board to carry out this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levels of radioactivity arising from the Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Plant are continuously monitored as part of the ongoing monitoring programme of the Irish marine environment operated by <Col N="764" /> the Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
    <P>This programme includes the measurement of radioactive contamination in seawater, sediments, seaweeds, fish and shellfish.  Sea-water and sediment samples are collected during research cruises of the Irish Sea using the research vessel. &ldquo;Lough Beltra&rdquo;.  Seaweed and sediment samples are collected from the Irish coastline, fish and shellfish from commercial landings at the principal Irish fishing ports.  The board has reported that the radioactive dose to the Irish public arising from an average consumption of fish would be less than 1 per cent of the European Community dose limit and less than 2 per cent of the dose from naturally occurring radiation.  The board has advised that there should be no concern about eating fish from the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>A joint Irish-Spanish cruise of North East Atlantic waters, partly funded by my Department and the board, to monitor levels of and distribution of radioactivity, and to see the extent of penetration of discharges from reprocessing plants at Sellafield and Cap de la Hague was undertaken this year.  Results of this study should be published next year. Arrangements with the Department of Defence to have naval vessels collect sea-water samples on behalf of the board are being finalised.</P>
    <P>The monitoring programme of radioactivity in the air carried out in Dublin has not detected an increase in levels arising from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>A copy of the board's report on its monitoring programme of the Irish marine environment from 1982-84 has been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>Representations which I have received concerning the recent events in Turin have made me aware of the difficulties encountered by the Irish athletes at the CSIT championships.  As neither the Department of Foreign Affairs nor the Irish Embassy in Rome were contacted by the organisers or by the Irish team regarding their difficulties, the question of an official intervention could not have arisen at the time.  Since the return home of the NACAI team, the issues to which the Deputy refers have been discussed at a meeting on 15 October between Mr. Seán Barrett, TD, Minister for Sport, and the officers of NACAI.</P>

    <P>2.  The latest information available to me on indigenous manufacturing input comes from an IDA survey based on a sample of 400 companies and shows the proportion of raw materials manufactured in Ireland for all sectors of manufacturing industry in 1985 to be 49 per cent.  It must be stressed that these figures are provisional, based as they are on a survey carried out in early 1986.  The next survey to be carried out in 1987 will provide detailed 1985 results and preliminary figures for 1986.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce given the fact that Irish industry is losing £900 million a year because it lacks a policy of systematic quality control, as estimated recently by the Irish Quality Control Association, and the urgency of raising standards of quality, if he will make a statement on his Department's approach to improving quality in Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> While there is no firm statistical basis for the figure of £900 million referred to, the Government recognise the pressing need for Irish industry to raise standards of quality.  This is primarily a matter for each individual firm but it has been a major policy consideration since the publication of the Government White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1985 the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) was established to ensure that a greater emphasis was placed on the use of quality standards and proper quality control procedures in industry.  The NSAI has published and is promoting Irish Standard 300 &mdash; the Irish Standard of Quality Management Systems. The authority has also increased the number of standards available to Irish industry and is active in promoting the need for higher standards of quality.  The authority administer a registration <Col N="767" /> scheme which provides recognition to companies with quality systems at the highest international level.  As a consequence of its work there has been a marked increase in awareness of quality control in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>In addition the IDA, SFADCo and CTT, when considering applications for grants, highlight the need for quality and seek to ensure that proper quality control systems are in operation in firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is satisfied with present advertising standards; if he is aware that many advertisements contain misleading information, do not indicate the actual price to be paid for goods or a service or have special conditions or clauses attached which are not readily identifiable; and if he will make a statement as to the changes he intends making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Legal controls on misleading advertising are provided by the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  Under this Act it is an offence to include in an advertisement a statement or description which is false as to, for example, the nature, quantity, origin, fitness for purpose, price, etc., of any goods.  There are similar provisions in relation to the advertising of services.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Act are enforced on a day-to-day basis by the Director of Consumer Affairs whose office was established by the Act.  The director's functions under the Act include prosecuting for offences under the Act and initiating High Court proceedings for an order to prevent or prohibit misleading advertising.  The director investigates all complaints brought to his notice in relation to advertising and a report is published annually on the activities of his office.  If the Deputy has any particular instances of advertising in mind which he regards as misleading I would be happy to bring them to the notice of the director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> I am satisfied that this legislation provides adequate legal protection for the public against misleading advertising.  I would, however, point to two legislative developments likely in the near future in relation to advertising.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I draw the Deputy's attention to an order I have prepared under the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  This order will require any advertisements or notices that make reference to the cost of credit to show the true cost of that credit by means of an annual percentage rate of charge (APR).  This will enable consumers to make an informed choice between the various forms of credit on offer.</P>
    <P>The order also requires that if an advertisement refers to the provision of goods or service on credit then the cash price and the price payable under a credit agreement must also be shown.</P>
    <P>The draft order has been placed on the Order Paper of the House as it requires the approval of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The second development I refer to is the introduction of a legal measure which is necessary to give effect in Ireland to the EC Directive on misleading advertising. My Department is currently examining the legal implications of the Directive but I would hope to be in a position shortly to consult with interested parties on the steps I propose to take.  I am satisfied at this stage, however, that most of what is required by the Directive is already provided for in Irish law by the Consumer Information Act, 1978.</P>
    <P>I should mention briefly that as well as the legal provisions in relation to advertising to which I have referred, the advertising industry itself seeks to promote higher standards in advertising by means of its code of advertising standards.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am informed by the IDA that it is actively promoting Clondalkin as a suitable industrial location for both small and medium-large industry.  Recently, IDA completed site development work on its 55 acre site of land at Collinstown, Leixlip which is part of the Clondalkin catchment area. The IDA will be actively promoting this site and its site of 14 acres approximately at Cloverhill, Clondalkin for industrial development.</P>
      <P>As part of its decentralisation programme, the IDA in June 1985 set up a full time team to deal exclusively with the fostering of small industrial projects in the Dublin area.  During 1985 200 small industry projects were approved for the Dublin city and county area and these projects are expected to create over 900 jobs over the next two years.  Included among these was the Coopers Animal Health project in Airton Road, which employs 39 people manufacturing veterinary products.</P>

      <P>Applications for assistance under the remedial works scheme were received in March 1985 from Tipperary (SR) County Council in respect of its rented houses at Castlequarter and Woodview.  I have received no application in respect of houses at Clerihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Castlequarter proposal involves the construction of an external blockwork skin and pitched roof and ancillary works at an estimated cost of £640,000.  The project was approved in principle on 28 February 1986 and the local authority was requested to prepare the necessary technical documentation with a view to <Col N="785" /> carrying out a pilot scheme.  This documentation is at present being examined in my Department.</P>
    <P>The works required to the houses at Woodview involve roof replacement, the construction of new gable walls and ancillary works at an estimated cost of £378,000.  The local authority's proposals to carry out these works required revision in light of experience with a pilot project on a similar scheme.  Revised documentation is being examined in my Department and I hope to make a decision in regard to allowing the authority to seek tenders in the near future for a pilot scheme.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals before my Department for the extension of the Dublin suburban rail system to Tallaght. Any such proposals will fall to be examined in the first instance by the Dublin Transport Authority, which I propose to establish in the very near future.  A priority task will be to assess transport needs of Tallaght and other areas in the context of Dublin's overall transport requirements.</P>
      <P>The authority's examination will not, of course, be confined to rail proposals and, given the low-density of residential development prevalent in the Dublin area and the inherent high cost of rail projects, there is a high probability that cheaper (e.g. bus-based) alternatives will be to the fore in the authority's evaluation process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the purpose of changing the system of valuation for the purposes of levying excise duty on motor vehicles which existed prior to 1 January 1985 (paragraph 19, S.I. No.  57 of 1979) i.e. the open market selling price, to a new system after 1 January 1985 i.e. the recommended retail price, (paragraph 6, S.I. 353 of 1984); the implications of this change for the State's revenue; the implications of this change for: (1) commercial importers and distributors of motor vehicles; and (2) private consumers who wished to purchase a motor vehicle in some part of the Common Market of the European Community other than the territory of the State and import such <Col N="796" /> vehicle into the State; the provision he intends to make with regard to the regular publication of the statutory list of recommended retail prices of motor vehicles as required by paragraph 19.2 as amended of S.I. 57/79; if he will indicate by way of a worked example how excise duty is levied on a motor vehicle imported by the main distributor for vehicles of that type; and in the example, if he will show the various elements that make up the retail price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The change in the basis of charging excise duty on motor vehicles was introduced on the occasion of the removal of import restrictions on motor vehicles from 1 January 1985 by the repeal of the Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Act, 1968.  The main purpose of the change was to facilitate the collection of excise duty on second hand vehicles because the former basis of charge (i.e. the price to a dealer) was unsatisfactory for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The change was designed to maintain the overall level of taxation on motor vehicles and, in general, the excise duty burden on vehicles was not altered.  As far as commercial importers are concerned the new system of charge represents a simpler method of charging the duty and ensures equality of tax treatment as between imported vehicles and vehicles sold in the State.  (Private consumers were not permitted to import vehicles prior to 1 January 1985.)</P>
      <P>Lists of recommended retail sale prices of motor vehicles are furnished to the Revenue Commissioners by distributors but there is no requirement for the publication of those lists.  The declared recommended retail sale price of any vehicle may be obtained by any member of the public by inquiry to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Price lists are also normally freely available from the larger motor dealers and are also regularly advertised by the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excise duty payable on a 1600cc motor car with a recommended retail sale price of £10,000, (which includes VAT) for example, is 21.7 per cent of the <Col N="797" /> recommended retail sale price i.e. £2,170.  VAT is chargeable at the rate of 25 per cent and accordingly the VAT payable would come to £2,000, (i.e. 25-125 of the retail price).  The balance of £5,830 would represent the trade elements in the price, save where the car was imported from a non-EC country when customs duty might also be payable.</P>

      <P>Government net borrowing in the first three-quarters of the current year was £1,749 million, equivalent to £6.4 million per day.  Of this £4.7 million per day is represented by the payment of interest on past debt.  Only £1.7 million per day is for non-interest purposes.</P>

    <P>This represents a considerable improvement on 1981 when 8½ per cent of GNP was being borrowed for new spending (i.e. non-interest purposes). Next year the Government plans a current budget deficit of 7.4 per cent of GNP and a total Exchequer borrowing requirement of a maximum of 11.8 per <Col N="798" /> cent of GNP, of which 0.4 per cent of GNP approximately will be for non-interest purposes.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 to 122, inclusive, together.  The provision and maintenance of court accommodation in Cavan is primarily the responsibility of the Cavan County Council. The Commissioners of Public Works have no funds available to them for such work.</P>
      <P>The county council had prepared in 1983 a scheme of works at the courthouse which houses the court accommodation and the county offices.  It was possible to finance the cost of the work related to court accommodation by way of loan from the local loans fund but problems were encountered in arranging finance for the county council accommodation &mdash; hence the delay in proceeding with the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 31 January 1986, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, <Col N="800" /> the Minister for Justice formally directed the Commissioners of Public Works to execute such repairs and do such work as may be proper to put the court accommodation at Farnham Street, Cavan into proper repair and condition.  The involvement of the Commissioners in the matter arose from an order of <i>Mandamus</i> which had been granted in the High Court.  This order dated 2 December 1985 made absolute an earlier conditional order.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the Minister's direction the proposed scheme of works prepared by the county council was examined by the Commissioner's architect who advised that the scheme provided a practical and economic solution to the accommodation problems of the courts and the county council.  The cost was regarded as fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>The county council indicated that if they could secure favourable funding terms they would be in favour of proceeding with the scheme directly.  The Commissioners' view was that in the event of the county council being in a position to and agreeing to proceed with the whole project they, the Commissioners, would be prepared to regard the county council as their agents for carrying out the works for the purpose of complying with the <i>Mandamus</i> order. The Commissioners would assume a monitoring role in respect of those works. The High Court would be advised accordingly.</P>
    <P>Negotiations regarding funding for the project between the county council, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Justice, the Department of Finance and the commissioners continued throughout 1986.  On 26 September 1986 the Department of Finance, in the exceptional circumstances of the case, approved the financing of the entire project from the local loans fund.  This decision has been put to and accepted by Cavan County Council and the way is now clear to proceed with consideration by the council of the tenders received by them.  The commissioners are keeping in constant touch with the county council with a view to ensuring that a contract is placed as early as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> I am aware of the inconvenience caused by the condition of the courthouse and I am satisfied that the course of action adopted by the commissioners was the quickest and most economical way of repairing the building and thus securing compliance with the Court Order.  Had they acted in any other way they could not have secured an earlier start to the work.  The lead-time for a separate scheme of works to provide court accommodation only would have been at least 12 months.  I am also satisfied that the works now proposed will not only meet the court's directive but will do so in an enhanced way.  The end result will be the restoration to Cavan town of the functions appertaining to the High Court and the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>Veterans of the War of Independence are not identifiable as such among the general population of medical card holders.  The information sought by the Deputy is not therefore available.  The determination of eligibility for medical card services is a statutory function of the chief executive officer of each health board under the Health Act, 1970.</P>

    <P>Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the CEO, could not provide general practitioner medical services for themselves and their dependants from their own resources without undue hardship.  The current income guidelines for medical card eligibility <Col N="805" /> make special provision for elderly persons and this would tend to be to the advantage of the veterans referred to.</P>

It will be appreciated that interpretation of statutes is a matter for the courts alone to decide.</P>

      <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned will reach age 65 in February 1988.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of retirement pension at age 65 or old age contributory pension at age 66 under the Social Welfare Acts requires him to have contributions paid in respect of at least 156 weeks of insurable employment since his entry into insurance.  He does not satisfy this condition on his Irish record as the Department's records show that he has only 63 paid contributions, plus credits in respect of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in accordance with EC regulations on social security his British and Irish insurance records may be combined to enable him to satisfy the qualifying conditions.  On this basis he will qualify for a <i>pro-rata</i> retirement pension at age 65 or a <i>pro-rata</i> old age contributory pension at age 66.  His record to date would entitle him to either pension at a rate of £43.75 per week, at the present rates. This would be increased to £44.85 per week if he has further credited contributions for the full period up to 5 April 1987 or to £45.15 per week if he has the full number of such contributions up to 5 <Col N="819" /> April 1988.  Alternatively, he could qualify for an old age contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts at the present weekly rate of £52.70 if he has contributions paid in respect of a further 93 weeks of insurable employment before he reaches age 66.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 6 August 1986. Accordingly, calculation of the 85 per cent limit in his case was based on his earnings from insurable employment in the period 6 April 1986 to 5 August 1986. However as he was in England and was not insurably employed during the period May to August 1986, his only earnings reckonable for the purpose of calculating the 85 per cent limit were from the period 6 August 1986 to 12 May 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 85 per cent limit was calculated at <Col N="821" /> £73.84 and as the weekly flat rate unemployment benefit payable in this case of £87.60 exceeds that sum, pay-related benefit is not payable.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 20 March 1986.</P>
      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  In order that a person may be considered permanently incapable of work, it is necessary for him to, <i>inter alia</i>, have been continuously incapable of work for a period of one year.  Therefore the earliest date on which the claimant can qualify for invalidity pension is 20 March 1987.  In addition it will be necessary to have him examined by a medical referee for an opinion as to his future capacity for work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>From mid-November 1986 men and women claiming benefit, assistance or pension under the Social Welfare Acts will be treated equally.  Up to now a married man claiming a social welfare payment automatically got an increase of benefit for his wife and children living with him irrespective of whether they were dependants of his but a married woman could only get an increase of benefit for her husband and children in very restricted circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From mid-November, the definition of dependency is being changed to make it the same for men and women thus removing the discrimination which has <Col N="828" /> heretofore existed against married women.  A spouse will be regarded as a dependant of the other spouse only where he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that person and spouses entitled to social welfare payment in their own right or with earnings in excess of £50 a week will not be regarded as dependants. In circumstances where neither spouse is dependent on the other, half the normal rate of increases of benefit for the children will be paid when either spouse claims benefit.  The person concerned is at present in receipt of invalidity pension at the personal rate of £47.10 plus an allowance of £31.60 in respect of his wife and £31.50 in respect of three qualified children.</P>
    <P>Since his wife is employed and earning in excess of £50 a week she will not be regarded as an adult dependant and consequently from 20 November 1986 he will be entitled to £62.85 weekly, that is, £47.10 personal rate and an increase of £15.75 for three children.</P>
    <P>However, should the wife of the person concerned claim and qualify for benefit on her own record, she would also be paid the full personal rate and an allowance for qualified children at half rate.</P>

      <P>While the pigmeat sector has been experiencing particular difficulties this year the situation has recently shown an <Col N="831" /> improvement.  In July, I introduced a number of measures designed to alleviate the difficulties.  These included a reduction in the veterinary inspection fee and the extension to pig producers of the scope of the exchange rate guarantee scheme, the provisions of which I have recently further extended.  In addition, a number of increases have been granted in the level of export refunds payable on pigmeat products.  These measures, combined with an upturn in the market for pigmeat products, have gone some way towards helping to lift producers prices since August.</P>
      <P>For lasting improvements, however, it will be necessary for the industry to tackle its long-standing structural problems. namely the need to rationalise slaughtering capacity and to modernise processing plants.  Allied to this is the need for aggressive market development to withstand growing competition on the home and export markets.</P>
      <P>On the question of a feed subsidy for pig producers, intervention stocks of cereals can only be released at current intervention prices which are at present higher than market prices.  To do otherwise would be in contravention of EC rules.</P>

      <P>There are five Garda divisions in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  Tallaght is part of the southern division which has its headquarters at Crumlin Garda station and there are no plans to move the divisional headquarters from there.  Each division is made up of a number of Garda districts and Tallaght comes within the district which at present has its headquarters at Rathfarnham station.  It is my intention to make the station at Tallaght the headquarters for his district as soon as the new station under construction there is completed.</P>
