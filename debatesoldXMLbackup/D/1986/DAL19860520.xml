      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline his proposals for Dáil reform; if he will say, in particular, when Friday sittings of the Dáil will be allocated to Private Member's Bills; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> As the Deputy will be aware, the Government have already introduced substantial Dáil reform measures such as the establishment of the new Oireachtas committees, new procedures for questions and new procedures for debating Estimates.</P>
      <P>A number of other reform measures are at present in course of preparation. These include a new system of explanatory and financial memoranda for Government Bills, new procedures for reports and the introduction of a new system for Private Members' Bills.  In connection with the latter, draft amendments to Standing Orders are being prepared and will be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> In addition to the foregoing, I am examining the possibility of other reform measures which will facilitate Deputies in raising matters of concern in the Dáil. I am also arranging for a review of the committee system to see how it might be improved.  I also intend to undertake a general review of Standing Orders to see how they might be updated or improved to streamline the business of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the review of Standing Orders and in particular with regard to Private Members' Time, would the Minister circulate the proposals on these matters to Deputies or to parties not represented on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> The Committee on Procedures and Privileges are a committee representative of all Members of the Dáil.  The make-up of the committee is established by long precedence as to how Members of each party are represented.  It is only reasonable that items of Dáil reform should be processed in the normal course through that committee. Where items are under consideration with that committee, it would be inappropriate for me to give exact details of proposals to the House in advance of a decision being taken by the committee. However, the Deputy can rest assured that the committee will be thinking of any amendments which are to the benefit of all Members not particularly of one side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister about some aspects on questions?  Is he aware that there are two factors which are combining to make it difficult to have questions relevant and contemporary?  If I wish to put down a question to the Taoiseach for the Tuesday of any week, I must put it down on the preceding Wednesday.  That makes things very difficult, because certainly it means that matters which arise urgently must wait until the following week.  The Minister might suggest that the situation can be dealt with by way of Private Notice Question. He would agree that there are severe <Col N="1469" /> limitations and restrictions on Private Notice Questions.  With all due respect to his lordship in the Chair, most of the time he takes a very restrictive view of what is allowable under Private Notice Question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps; nevertheless, the Chair would have to admit that it is a limited and restricted process.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously some way, through a change either in the precedure for Private Notice Questions or in the time scale which applies to putting down questions, to see if we can have questions asked in this House on important matters which arise suddenly and urgently and with which very often the Taoiseach or the Minister might wish to be in a position to deal and to answer in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I have tried to cover that aspect in my reply to the original question.  There are various systems of raising matters of immediate concern, for example, on the Adjournment or by Private Notice Question.  I am open to have discussions with the Opposition Whip in relation to this matter, but the problem with Question Time, as anybody who sits in the House will see, is that it is turning into more of a debate, as distinct from getting information by asking a question.  There is a need, and I have said in my reply, that I am looking for ways and means of trying to find a procedure whereby matters of immediate concern can be raised in the Dáil on the day in question or the following day, as they arise.  We have it here with the Ceann Comhairle every day on the Order of Business when Deputies attempt to raise matters which are immediate and need an answer but are ruled out of order, rightly so, because they do not arise on the Order of Business.  I am trying to find some way of dealing with that problem so that Deputies would get an opportunity to raise a matter of immediate importance.  I have written to the <Col N="1470" /> Opposition Chief Whip in relation to the present Question Time system and any concrete or constructive suggestions which can be made will be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, the Minister of State might consider two matters. First, a revision of the terms applicable to Private Notice Questions so that the Ceann Comhairle will not, very much against his wishes, time and again be forced into ruling Private Notice Questions of mine out of order which I know grieves him very deeply.  Perhaps, we could find some way of broadening the terms of urgent public business through the Private Notice Question.  Secondly, would the Minister of State consider a device which is used in another Parliament whereby the Ceann Comhairle will concede from time to time an emergency debate on issues which arise suddenly? Perhaps, with Deputy De Rossa's permission I might move on to the committee system.  Is there any way whereby the Minister of State could ensure that the committees are not used by particular individuals to secure personal sensational type publicity for themselves as chairmen of those committees?  The Minister of State knows who exactly I am referring to.</P>

      <P>The Chair is going to call on Deputy De Rossa now <Col N="1471" /> but might I suggest before doing so that we could have a very long discussion which would be inappropriate and which would be more appropriate for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?</P>

      <P>In response to my first supplementary the Minister of State indicated that all of the parties in this House were represented on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  He will not be annoyed, I am sure, if I remind him that The Workers' Party are not represented on that committee or on any of the other Oireachtas committees.  For that reason, I asked him if he would circulate to myself and other Independent Deputies who are not represented on that committee his proposals regarding changes in Standing Orders.  It is only proper that we should be involved, even at a distance, in the discussions which are proceeding in relation to reform of the House.  Could I also ask the Minister of State, in discussing or proceeding with reforms with regard to the introduction of Private Members' Bills whether he proposes to provide any kind of drafting assistance or expertise to Independent or other backbench Deputies in regard to producing such Bills?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> Deputy De Rossa may have misunderstood my reply to his first supplementary.  I did not wish to imply that all parties in this House were represented on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I did not say that.  What I said was that the Members who are on that committee represent all the Members of this House.  From my experience on that committee I would say that 99 per cent of the time we do not reflect the views of a particular party.  We are there acting on behalf of the good of the Members and for the good of this House.  I did not imply that all parties were represented on that committee but all parties are represented by those who are on the committee.  Their views are taken into account.  I would say to Deputy De Rossa if he has any suggestion he wishes to make, he should either put it in writing or have a chat with me.  I would <Col N="1472" /> be only too delighted to listen to any constructive views that he or any other Member of this House may have in relation to Dáil reform.</P>
      <P>In reply to his last supplementary, it is proposed to provide some financial assistance towards Deputies who wish to have Private Members' Bills drafted.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> The Government are at present looking at ways and means of having that matter dealt with in a constructive manner.  We are looking at some proposals.  One possibility is that we could use one of our committees to do that work.  That is why it is important that, after a couple of years in operation, the whole of the committee system should be reviewed, and we could see where we could improve on the system and, hopefully, have a better system for the next Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare her views on the anomaly which occurs in our tax and social welfare systems where a person (details supplied) in Dublin 7 who has been separated from his wife for a number of years and is now sharing a house with a partner of several years standing is not entitled to any social welfare assistance because his partner is earning more than £80 per week, but that she is taxed as a single person, getting no tax allowance for him; and the action she proposes to take in such a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison) Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxation aspects of this matter are appropriate to the Minister for Finance to whom I understand the question is also addressed for reply in the near future.  As regards the social welfare system the background to this particular case is as follows.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed and has been paid unemployment benefit as a single man since 8 March 1985.  Due to a clerical error there was an interruption of payment on 23 April 1986.  Payment, however, has now been restored and arrears due from 24 April 1986 will be paid less any supplementary welfare allowance advanced in the interim.  Current weekly entitlement is £39.50, which is the appropriate maximum rate payable to a single person.  His entitlement will cease by 9 June as on that date he will have drawn his full entitlement of 390 days benefit.</P>
      <P>He recently applied for unemployment assistance and his case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of his means.  During the course of the investigation he apparently declined on request to provide details of the earnings of the person with whom he is cohabiting. This information is required in order to establish the value of the benefit accruing to him from her earnings.  In the absence of such information any claim to unemployment assistance would have to be disallowed.  An officer will shortly revisit him to afford another opportunity to supply the relevant information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> The assessment to be done in this case is a statutory requirement to be found in section 146 (i) (e) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, which provides that means for unemployment assistance purposes must take account of the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by the claimant.  This legislation covers all such situations where, for example, a person derives benefit from the earnings or income of a spouse or partner or head of household in which the claimant lives.</P>
    <P>The criteria used to determine the value of any benefit or privilege are designed to ensure that each case is decided fairly having regard to the standard of living of the household.  In this context it is important to recognise that the scheme is designed to cater for people who are in need and the amount payable in any case is directly related to the applicant's financial circumstances.  The purpose of the means test is to achieve a degree of equity between applicants living in better off circumstances and those whose circumstances are poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I ask the Minister if he accepts that there is an anomaly here? The State cannot have it both ways.  Does the Minister accept that the lady and the gentleman involved are regarded as single people for tax purposes and do not get the benefits to which they would be entitled if they were married?  Yet for the purposes of the Social Welfare Act it appears that the person in this case is not entitled to assistance and is about to be penalised by virtue of an income in respect of the person with whom he is living although that person is being taxed as a single person.  It should be one way or the other.  If the tax liability was on the same basis as that for a married couple it would be fair enough.  They would have that advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that as far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned, there is no discrimination in the way in which the provisions of this section of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act are applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> By and large, those provisions have been there since the introduction of the social assistance schemes.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot answer for the Minister for Finance.  He will answer the question which the Deputy put down for him.  The provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act are being complied with here and there is no discrimination for any reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue this unduly.  I do not like putting down oral questions of a personal nature because there are other ways of getting the information.  There is a general principle involved here and I do not think my constituents or others are concerned with whether it is dealt with by this Minister or the Minister for Finance.  On the one hand, one Government Department categorise the parties involved as being, in effect, responsible to each other and having a joint income.  Therefore, they are disadvantaged from the point of view of the assistance to which this man would be entitled.</P>
      <P>However, another Government Department take revenue on the basis that they are not inter-related in any way. That contradiction has to be addressed. It is not a question of whether or not the Act is being implemented properly.  It is a question of an anomaly which has arisen.  It is costing people money.  I would be grateful if the Minister would investigate this in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to see whether or not they will be taxed as a couple who are in effect married for the purpose of assistance in this case, or they will have the benefits which normally apply to two separate people in terms of the Social Welfare Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of cases which are at present being granted invalidity pensions; the equivalent figures for each of the years from 1982 to 1985 inclusive; and if long-term cases on disability benefit are automatically examined and assessed for invalidity pensions after a prescribed period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for invalidity pension, a person must satisfy the contribution conditions, must have been in receipt of disability benefit for a year and must be permanently incapable of work.</P>
      <P>The usual practice is that in the normal control of disability benefit claims, the Department's medical referees suggest when claimants should be referred for further examination.  If the medical referee indicates that a person is permanently incapable of work after receiving disability benefit for a year, that person is informed of the right to claim invalidity pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> The number of persons receiving invalidity pension on 31 March this year was 24,026.  The average numbers receiving pension in the years from 1982 to 1985 were 20,395, 20,849, 21,981 and 24,112 respectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it usual for claimants on long term disability payments who are on monthly certification to have to wait years before they are called for reassessment by referees for invalidity pensions? Many of them will not opt for invalidity pensions because they are unaware that they may be entitled to them.  Is it not incumbent on the Department after, say, 12 months, to have such people examined and reassessed so that they may be qualified for invalidity pensions because of permanent incapacity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I have set out the usual practice.  There are many people in receipt of disability allowances who would possibly qualify for invalidity pensions but they would perfer to remain on disability allowances.  The Deputy will be aware that invalidity pensions are liable for tax deductions and if claimants for invalidity pensions have other incomes, which some of them have, they would be at a loss if they changed from disability allowances.  If a spouse has a social welfare allowance, the transfer of the other spouse to invalidity pension would mean a financial loss.  There is not automatic selection of people who have been long periods on disability benefits.  Medical referees who examine people at the end of a normal period on disability benefit either report that such people should be on invalidity pensions or should be reconsidered for them in six months or 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Though accepting that it may well be to the financial disadvantage of some claimants for invalidity pensions, there are others for whom it would be extremely advantageous because of the benefits in kind, such as free travel and so on, in the case of people eligible <Col N="1480" /> for invalidity pensions.  It is rather incongruous that the Department would not have a specific policy in this respect as in others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Department any specific policy in relation to giving directions to the medical referees to examine people on long term disability benefit to see if they are entitled to invalidity pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Many referees refer people for invalidity pensions if their medical conditions qualify them.  The Deputy should be aware that referees are working under severe pressure at present and that it is not always possible for them to go through claims of people on disability benefits to determine if they are entitled to invalidity pensions.  Anyway, claimants are much more aware these days of their possible entitlements and the vast majority of those who feel they are entitled to invalidity pensions submit claims for them.  Such claims are attended to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare when she proposes to implement the European Equality Directive; and the cost to the State of implementing this directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.  The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, provided for the changes necessary to introduce equality of treatment in accordance with the EEC Directive.  The abolition of the <Col N="1481" /> reduced rates of disability and unemployment benefit for married women and the extension of the duration of payment of unemployment benefit to married women from 312 to 390 days were implemented with effect from 15 May 1986. The estimated cost of these measures in 1986 is £10.6 million.</P>
      <P>The remaining matters in the equal treatment legislation which need to be implemented relate in the main to dependency provisions.  The revised definition of dependency contained in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, will cause some households to suffer a drop in income on implementation.  The revised definition is however a much fairer one and is based on the principle that one spouse will be regarded as dependent on the other only if he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that spouse. Certain households where the wife is in employment or is in receipt of a social welfare payment in her own right will be affected by this revised definition as an adult dependant allowance will no longer be payable in such cases.</P>
      <P>In determining dependency the Act gives power to have a certain amount of the dependant's earnings disregarded. The intention is that up to £50 will be disregarded.  Also in cases where both spouses are at present receiving benefit and would lose an adult dependant allowance under the new arrangements, a transitional payment of £10 a week for a period of up to 12 months will be made.</P>
      <P>These latter measures relating to dependency will be implemented later this year.  The date of implementation is dependent on the allocation of additional staff, the devising of new work procedures and the training of staff in those procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>She is examining the social welfare system in the US and she is extremely interested in getting the job well done.  I would remind the Deputy that we had a very prolonged debate on the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill a few months ago.  All the figures sought by the Deputy were given during that debate &mdash; I do not think I would be exaggerating if I said that the figures were given ten times on the various sections of the Bill.  More than 46,000 married women will gain substantially from this directive.  Of the 170,000 married men in the system at present, 150,000 will not be affected at all.  In other words, only 20,000 will lose to some extent.  Alleviating measures are being provided in about 11,000 of those cases.  It can be assumed that a large proportion of the other 9,000 would be cases where the spouses were earning above average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the figure in respect of the gain to married women but it was given on many occasions.  I think it was £4.80 per week.  When the dependency regulations are changed the spouses will lose one of their benefits.  At the moment where the wife is working and the husband is receiving benefit, he will get that benefit for himself and for his wife even though she is working.  That will continue if the wife is earning less than £50 per week but where the amount is more than that the social welfare benefit paid for her will have to be withdrawn.  However, there is a measure in the provisions to allow for the payment of £10 per week to alleviate that loss and this will apply for <Col N="1483" /> a period of one year or for the duration of the claim, whichever is the shorter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, such a person should go back to his or her employment exchange and inquire about entitlements.  It is quite possible that in many cases the person concerned could be eligible.  It depends on the entitlement in each case but where there is any doubt the person concerned should check with her employment exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on means and levels of payments are normally fixed at budget time.  In any particular case the rate of <Col N="1487" /> assistance payable is the appropriate maximum rate less the weekly means assessed, including in the case of single persons living at home the value of board and lodgings.  Statistics are not kept in such a way as would enable the average rate of assistance paid to single persons living at home to be determined.</P>
    <P>Despite the very difficult financial situation, the Government have more than fulfilled their commitment to maintain the value of social welfare payments and have in fact provided real increases in the levels of those payments.  In regard to unemployment assistance in particular, the Government made provision this year and in each of the past three years for higher levels of payment to people who have been unemployed for 15 months or more.</P>
    <P>In the period mid-May 1983 to mid-May 1987 the increase in the consumer price index is expected to be of the order of 23 per cent.  In that period the long term unemployed will have got increases of about 40 per cent, other long term recipients, such as pensioners, will have got increases amounting to 33 per cent and short term beneficiaries will have received increases amounting to 30 per cent.</P>

The medical referee cadre has been increased substantially, from 18 to 25 within the past year.  Enhanced clerical and computer back-up facilities have been provided in order to improve the selection of cases for referral to medical referees and to ensure that follow-up action is completed as required.</P>

      <P>New claimants are listed by computer programme for review after a standard interval, having regard to the nature of the certified incapacity.  The cases are then reviewed by the medical adviser who decides regarding examination by a medical referee.  He may write to the certifier for further details.  Cases listed for medical referee examination are first notified to the medical certifier who is invited to furnish details of the claimant's history and also to attend the examination if he wishes.  Certifiers' reports, where received, are considered by the medical referee and taken into account in conducting the examination. Medical referee reports, including any certifier's report and any previous reports, are then submitted to the medical adviser for approval before a decision is given.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a rent allowance payable to an old age pensioner (details supplied) in Dublin 3 has been discontinued, in view of the fact that his only source of income is a pension which has not altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>At a re-investigation of the claim of the person concerned in January 1986 it was found that his means, consisting of his contributory old age pension in respect of himself and his wife, his occupational pension and the yearly <Col N="1490" /> value of capital held by his wife, had increased since the previous investigation and exceeded the upper limit for entitlement to a rent allowance in his case.  The upper limit in his case is £110.51 a week.</P>
      <P>The rent allowance was accordingly terminated with effect from 16 February 1986.</P>
      <P>An appeal was lodged against the decision but the appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer.  The person concerned was notified of the appeals officer's decision on 24 April 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not normally ask questions of this nature in the House but unfortunately it is necessary on this occasion because of the unsatisfactory replies I have been receiving from the Minister's Department.  Is the Minister aware that these two old age pensioners living alone have been paying an additional £19.20 per week since the decontrolling of rents?  Until some months ago they had a rent allowance in the region of £6 per week but the Minister's Department apparently decided to do an assessment of income on a post office account belonging to one of these people. Is the Minister aware that the capital in that account is £2,100?  What income has been assessed on that and how is income assessed on such a small capital sum?</P>

      <P>In December 1985 the Deputy sought to have this case reviewed with a view to a possible increase in the rent allowance.  Consequent on the representations of the Deputy a social welfare officer was asked for a report.  That report, furnished in January 1986, disclosed that the means of the claimant had increased by £23.64 per week since the previous investigation.  Details of income included the old age contributory pension, including an adult dependant allowance, a CIE pension and a small account which was assessed in January 1984 as giving an income of £3.10 per week.  In January 1986 that income was assessed at £3.80 per week.</P>

      <P>The tenants' weekly means were assessed at £116.  The maximum allowance payable &mdash; the new rent of £20.76 less £3.80, came to £16.95.  The reduction on the maximum allowance on account of means is calculated by taking £5 for the first £10 in excess of £90 and £16 for the remaining £16, which gave £21.  That was more than the increase in the rent and consequently by the decision of the deciding officer the rent allowance was terminated with effect from 16 February 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a short question in comparison to the long, bureaucratic reply from the Minister which really makes no sense whatever.  It is a very simple question which should require a very simple reply.  The Minister pointed out there has been an additional assessment of £3.80 per week for this old couple.  That is in lieu of interest on Post Office savings of £2,000 and on an income of £3.80 a week additional which meant they were penalised to the extent that they lost their rent allowance which was more than twice the amount they gained in the interest.  They were originally receiving £6.75 in rent allowance.  That was discontinued completely when the Department assessed this couple's additional income of only £3.80.  Is the Minister aware that the rent increase in this instance is £19.20 and we are talking in terms of an additional income of £3.80 in interest on a Post Office savings account? It appears that any old couple with a paltry sum are penalised by the Department and prevented from getting benefits they are entitled to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

      <P>As I stated, the total income had increased by £23.64 per week between the time of the previous assessment and the assessment made as a result of the Deputy's representations and the amount of the rent allowance which they were receiving from 7 July 1985 was £8.96 per week.  Because of the increase of £23.64 in their income they lost the £8.96 rent allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the cognisance her Department's medical referees take of the detailed reports of family doctors and specialists who are attending the recipients of disability benefit; and if these are given serious consideration by medical referees before compiling their final report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of carrying out examination of claimants to disability or injury benefit medical referees examine claimants with particular regard to the cause of incapacity which has been certified by the claimant's medical certifier.</P>
      <P>In this connection they review the history of the illness and take account of previous illnesses.  They consider in particular all the certifier's and consultant's reports including the results of any clinical investigation given.</P>
      <P>Full consideration is given to the reports by the medical referees who find them extremely helpful in compiling their final reports on the claimant's fitness for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Department's medical referees, <Col N="1493" /> who now number 25, take account of the detailed reports of the family doctors and specialists who attend those people?  Why is it that so many are being deemed capable of work who are still under the constant care and attention of their doctors and continuing to see, on a regular basis, the specialists or consultants who are attending them and where, in some cases, operations to remedy defects in the long term are being contemplated?  These advices and reports seem to be disregarded and the claimants are deemed capable of work.  It seems irreconcilable with the statement the Minister made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a medical referee examination is decided on the certifier is notified and advised to furnish a report. These reports and the history of the claimant and any clinical requirements are received in an estimated 10 per cent of cases and in the course of examinations claimants are requested to give a general account of past illnesses and the history of the present illness.  Any report furnished by the certifier will help to put the illness in perspective.  The medical adviser considers that such reports from family doctors and the details given in some cases of clinical tests are very useful for examination purposes, particularly in view of the technical nature of the illness which claimants might not be able to describe.  The medical adviser is satisfied that due weight is given to such reports and that they are taken into account in arriving at a decision.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to cases of people waiting for operations.  It is not always the case that everyone waiting for an operation is unfit for work while waiting. Waiting for an operation is not, in itself, an illness.  I admit that most people waiting for an operation are suffering from some illness that has to be rectified but, of itself, a certificate stating that somebody is waiting for an operation does not mean he is ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the medical referees take into account the type of occupation which claimants may have <Col N="1494" /> had prior to their becoming ill and availing of disability benefit?  Are physical examinations undertaken by referees specifically geared to the determination of the assessment of the illness which is described?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 80,000 claimants are requested each year to attend a medical referee examination and some 50,000 of these are examined; about 14,000 or 26 per cent are deemed to be capable of work in the first instance. In the event of an appeal, these are normally re-examined by a different medical referee who may or may not confirm the first medical opinion.  But approximately 75 per cent of people who appear before medical referees are continuing in benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister was the occupation of applicants who appear before medical referees taken into account?  If a person is deemed capable of working that assessment must relate to the occupation he had.  I have a particular case where an applicant who was receiving an invalidity pension from the UK for a particular condition was examined by a medical referee of the Minister's Department and he decided that the applicant was now capable of work.  The report was duly sent to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  Before that tribunal the medical referee's report on this man who was aged 46 years stated quite clearly that the man was capable of work though he could no longer work as a labourer.  Is that man, at 46 years of age, now going to become a highly skilled worker, or a clerical worker, or a computer controller because the medical referee has decided, in Ireland even though he is obtaining a UK invalidity pension, that he is capable of working?  Can the Minister not see that this is quite outlandish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point is a difficult one to answer but, generally speaking, the concept of being capable or incapable of work is used in a very <Col N="1495" /> general way.  It would be very difficult to operate any system whereby one would have to relate the capability of a person to, strictly a particular kind of work.  In legal terms people are sometimes advised, in common law cases, to seek light work, and we find there is really no such thing as light work.  All considerations are examined in these cases, but the fact that a claimant is incapable of doing his or her particular job, but is capable of doing 101 other jobs, would not automatically mean that that person could remain indefinitely on disability benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The administrative efficiency of the Department is kept under continuous review.  There is an ongoing programme of computerisation of the Department's operations which has been developed at a very considerable rate of progress in recent years to the extent that there are now some one million claims on computers.  This programme has still a considerable way to go particularly in relation to the unemployment payments schemes.  Nevertheless, its development to date has introduced considerable improvements into the efficiency of the Department's services and has enabled it to cope with a massive increase in its workload.  Improved work practices are continually being introduced and where possible, within the Department's own staff resources, staff have been reallocated to the more hard pressed sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards appeals, the appointment of two additional appeals officers in 1984 and the assignment of a number of temporary appeals officers in mid-1985 has resulted in significant progress in clearing the backlog of cases.  Cases decided summarily are subject to very little delay and <Col N="1497" /> while there are still delays in processing appeals which are given an oral hearing, nevertheless the position has shown some improvement.  For example, there were some 870 cases awaiting oral hearing last July and this figure has been gradually reduced to some 480 at present.</P>
    <P>Many of the Department's services are already decentralised to a considerable extent.  For example, unemployment payments are made through the Department's countrywide network of local offices.  In the case of long term benefits, such as pensions and child benefits where the periods of entitlement can be established well in advance, although the entitlements are decided centrally, payment is made by means of books of vouchers cashable at local post offices.  Some 362,000 pensioners and 454,000 families on children's allowances are paid by this method.</P>
    <P>The Department are conscious of the need for providing as much information as possible in relation to their services on a localised basis.  With this in mind, a computerised inquiry service has been provided in local offices throughout the country and this is gradually being extended as circumstances permit. Improvements in the telephone system, including the recent installation of a modern PABX in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, should help to reduce delays for people contacting headquarters sections.</P>
    <P>The question of deciding and paying benefits such as disability benefit, which are at present administered centrally, on a local or regional basis is something which the Department keep under review.  This would, however, require substantial additional resources by way of staff and premises and for this reason can only be planned on a long-term basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the two Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>At a time when the pigmeat industry is in urgent need of rationalisation and modernisation of slaughtering and processing facilities to enable firms to compete effectively on markets abroad, it is a matter of particular regret that one of the foremost exporters &mdash; Grahams of Monaghan &mdash; have signified that they will cease operations soon.  My understanding is that they may resume operations if trading conditions improve.</P>
      <P>In a situation like this I can only point to the substantial aids already available from the State and the EC to firms in the pigmeat industry.  Generous investment grant aid is available from the IDA and FEOGA, training grants from AnCO, marketing assistance from CTT as well as substantial export sales tax relief.  In my own area I would mention the help provided to the industry as a whole in recent years through meeting some £6 million in debts incurred by the statutory Pigs and Bacon Commission and the modification of veterinary charges and arrears, which again give substantial help to the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this export market accounts for 300,000 to 400,000, or about one-third of production, and that all this is <Col N="1499" /> in jeopardy, not Grahams alone?  The Minister said trading conditions will improve, but would he agree that the only way this can happen is if the Irish factory is in a competitive position?  They cannot compete with the Danes unless EC funds are provided, similar to those provided for the Danes, by way of housing, stocking and by way of rations.  Our firms are compelled to purchase intervention grain at a higher price than the home market price.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy was talking about when he mentioned 300,000 to 400,000.  Were they pigs or what?</P>
      <P>There is no way open to me to single out a particular company for assistance in a matter such as this or directly intervene to avert a closure.  There is a specific State agency charged with the task of providing relief to firms in difficulty.  I am aware of the fact that firms have been helped over temporary difficulties by assistance from Fóir Teoranta and that such help enabled a subsequent resumption of profitable trading.</P>
      <P>Virtually all industries go through difficult phases.  The recent past has been one of particular difficulty for the pigmeat industry.  But that is all the more reason why the industry must now address itself most urgently to the task of modernisation because this is the only lasting way to make firms sufficiently competitive.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis the decision on their future is a matter for the firm themselves and they are likely to be guided by their perception of the prospective returns from the market.</P>

What steps do the Government intend to take to reduce the cost of energy which is 20 per cent higher than in the Six Counties and of fuel which is 40 per cent higher than in the Six Counties? In particular, why is there a veterinary levy of 75p per pig in the Republic when the same levy is only 2p per pig in the Six Counties?  Will the Minister accept that when Grahams kill 130,000 pigs per annum in their factory, this levy costs them £100,000 per annum and that this is the real cause of the difficulty? What plans has he to deal with it?</P>

      <P>The Deputy must be aware that the costs he has referred to are coming down, particularly the fuel costs. Secondly, the original levy per pig, the veterinary fee he has referred to, was £1.10p and last year I reduced this fee to 75p because of certain difficulties in the pigmeat industry.  That veterinary fee is designed to cover the cost of veterinary inspections.  Nobody makes a profit out of that.  We operate that scheme at a loss. As I have also stated in my reply, my Department have had to suffer a loss of £6 million over the past three years because of the collapse of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  As a result of that collapse we were not paid those fees in any form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to raise any great opposition to this but I think it would be better to deal with the issues separately.  In the printed documentation the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; is repeated.  I think that happened because of the translation from Irish to English.  There is obviously no need to repeat the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; and that is why we wish to substitute &ldquo;that there has been a breakdown of the marriage&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is a very subjective description of what might have happened to a marriage.  It means that a judge can decide that a particular marriage has failed.  Two different couples experiencing exactly the same circumstances in their marriages can have a different interpretation as to whether it is a success or a failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a subjective concept and through this constitutional amendment we are trying to secure, for those whose marriages have broken down, the right to have them dissolved and the possibility of remarriage.  To say that a marriage has broken down is a more objective and satisfactory description of what has taken place and it may well allow the courts a free hand in coming to a decision regarding a marriage where there are obvious indications that it has not been very successful and that the two people can no <Col N="1611" /> longer live together in a reasonable fashion.  In those circumstances, the court might say the marriage has not really failed and that the couple should make an effort to solve their difficulties when the couple realise that the marriage has indeed broken down.  It may have been a success once but not any longer.</P>
    <P>In many areas we are trying to get away from the concept of failure, particularly in our educational system where we have moved from the concept of describing students who do not fulfil certain conditions as failures.  That is subjective and unfair and leaves people with a stigma for a long time afterwards.  In the context of marriage, it would be extremely difficult for the parties to live with the stigma of being a failure.  It would also be very difficult for children who are often the real victims in many cases to have to live with the realisation that their parents' marriage has been a failure.</P>
    <P>When these proposals were first published, the Taoiseach indicated that he would accept all reasonable amendments. Our amendment is reasonable and one which will allow greater flexibility. It is a more adequate definition of what happened to the parties in a marriage instead of a concept of failure.  What is failure?  Is it a marriage which has not been consummated?  Is it a marriage where there have not been any children or which has not worked from the first day?  I should like to hear the Minister's definition of a failed marriage.  When I sat on the all party committee dealing with marriage breakdown, I realised that you cannot define a failed marriage.  Marriage is a relationship between two people based on commitment and love.  Everybody on that committee realised that he or she did not want to talk in terms of failure or fault, and it was the unanimous decision of the committee that the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; was a far more adequate explanation than failure.  I presume the Minister will reply to those points before we move on to the next set of amendments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things about the wording in this context which worry me.  The Government's proposal is &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  Leaving aside the quality of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, one would have expected that there might have been &ldquo;total&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete failure&rdquo;.  The same applies to Deputy Harney's amendment as to whether the words &ldquo;total breakdown&rdquo; or &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; should have been included.  The Minister may well reply that the words to which I referred may not add anything, that the words &ldquo;failure&rdquo; or &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; stand complete in themselves.  In regard to a marriage breakdown, the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; has been invariably attached to it in this debate.  In that regard, I wonder why the Minister and the Government did not use a word like &ldquo;total&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete&rdquo; to give failure a finality.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for anyone to come to a decision regarding failure and breakdown. I do not think you can argue that failure has finality about it.  Something that has failed could, presumably, be restored, repaired or rehabilitated and the same applies to breakdown.  I find it difficult to decide for or against this amendment.  The element of finality is not conclusive, ultimate finality, and is not inherent in either of the words.  I should like the Minister to tell us what he means by &ldquo;failed&rdquo;.  In earlier times some people regarded a marriage as having failed if there were no children of the union but we do not accept that thinking any more.  Different people regard marriages as having failed for different reasons, which leads one to opt for the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to both words, there is the difficulty that neither of them is defined. I imagine the Minister will reply to that by saying one cannot have definitions in a Constitution which merely lays down guidelines for legislation.  Perhaps these things will be fully defined if there ever is legislation.  It illustrates the difficulty <Col N="1613" /> we are in and the problem in regard to putting these words into the Constitution. I image the Government wish to meet the objections of a number of people who say: &ldquo;Yes I will go along with divorce but only in very rare, limited and restricted circumstances.&rdquo;  I presume it is that kind of thinking that the Government are endeavouring to meet by putting these words into the Constitution as distinct from removing the constitutional ban <i>simpliciter.</i></P>
    <P>However, this put the Government in the difficulty of having to use words which are open to different interpretations and not having available to them the normal parliamentary mechanism of definition.  I should like the Minister to help us in this regard, to tell us what inherent difference there is between &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;.  Will the Minister tell us why he has not availed of a word like &ldquo;total&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete&rdquo; in his own wording to qualify &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  In the Minister's wording the constitutional amendment speaks of period or periods amounting to five years.  Does that mean the failure need not be continuous?  Let us contemplate a situation where a marriage has failed for three years, followed by an interval and a further failure of two years giving a total of five years of failure, does that not mean that failure itself is not conclusive?  If we are to have two continuing periods it will mean that the failure was remedied for an in between period. I have outlined some of the difficulties that present themselves to those of us on this side of the House in regard to these words and I should like to hear clearly from the Minister his view or interpretation before we decide whether &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; or &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is the more appropriate word to use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a lot more that can be said on this issue and I am inclined to go along with the amendment. The worst possible result of the proposed referendum would be if a constitutional change was passed and approved but found later to be totally inoperable or inadequate or the legislation that followed it was found to be <Col N="1614" /> unconstitutional.  We must face up to that major problem when considering words such as &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  That word could prove to be a gold mine for lawyers because there would be legal opinions and judgments of what &ldquo;failure&rdquo; means.  As Deputy Harney pointed out, there are many interpretations of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;. It may be easy to prove a &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and, in other cases, almost impossible although to the people involved the marriage may be a failure.  It is a personal decision when something has failed.</P>
      <P>At an examination it is different: either one gets the marks or one does not but life is different.  What some people may think of as a failure in life, to the person concerned it may be a great success.  It depends on what the individual is looking at and the position in regard to marriage is the same.  Failure is something very personal.  I do not know if the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; is better but it sounds better.  I do not know what the legal interpretation is but it is important that the Minister gets this right because it is on that phrase that subsequent legislative decision will be decided.</P>
      <P>This argument proves that had we been sufficiently mature and grown up, the simple and obvious thing to do would be to delete Article 41.3.2º in the Constitution and then proceed to the legislation we find acceptable on the divorce issue. However, we have the problem of putting in something instead of Article 41.3.2º. It will be on the basis of what we put in that judgments will be made in regard to the future legislation.  We can be sure that constitutional cases will be taken on different interpretations of the phraseology in the amendment being put to the people.  For that reason the amendment must be very simple and clear.  It will have to be sufficiently cut and dried to ensure that we do not have wide interpretations of the phrase.  In my view the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; would be an improvement on the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said about the subjectivity of the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;.  It is still a subjective word and appears to offer little protection for <Col N="1615" /> the existing marriage.  One must ask: when does the breakdown begin?  Does it have to be total or partial breakdown? We must also consider the concept of irretrievable breakdown, the phrase used in most legislation throughout the world where divorce is permitted.  I was somewhat surprised that the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; was placed on its own in the amendment because it seems to leave the word subjective.  The word is being placed in the amendment as a possible replacement for the concept of failure which also seems to be a subjective concept.</P>
      <P>Is it not obvious that a marriage could be said to have failed long before separation takes place?  That is the kernal of the debate about the words chosen and the way they are placed in the amendment to be put to the people. Could the marriage not be said to have failed long before separation takes place? What is the meaning of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;? Presumably, the courts will look at the normal meaning of the word and in doing that I am sure they will take into consideration the meaning in the Oxford Dictionary for instance.  That dictionary describes &ldquo;failure&rdquo; as unsuccessful or a want of success.  That indicates that it is a very subjective test.  For example, can one say on a scale of 1:10 what will fail, what will be successful and where failure begins?  Will that test be applied?  It will be for the courts to decide on the application of the term &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  I do not really see the use of the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; on its own as improving the phraseology because it will offer little protection for the existing marriage.  As far as the use of the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; is concerned there can be the breakdown of a car which is a very common occurrence and which, after a little attention, can be got going again.  The lack of finality in that word seems to present some difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear what the Minister has to say in relation to the subjectivity of the words &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; and &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and also in relation to the five year separation period or periods amounting to five <Col N="1616" /> years.  We know that stipulation is included in the Government's stated intentions, but is it not a fact that the failure could occur long before separation takes place.  What relationship does the Minister see between those two?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an air of unreality about this debate.  I agree with Deputy Haughey.  I do not think there is a big difference between &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; and &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  I did not understand the point made by Deputy Woods about a car breaking down or failing.  I have practised for many years and have dealt with many cars that did not survive their guarantee period.  I could not envisage manufacturers complaining that a failure to start a car some day was different from a car breaking down some day.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Haughey pointed out, we must bear in mind that this is a description we propose to insert in the Constitution which will serve to indicate to this House the parameters within which we can operate. The only question is whether one identifies some absolute test in the Constitution. That would be a very dangerous thing to do.  I think it was Deputy Haughey who suggested that one might add the word &ldquo;total&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete&rdquo;.  If one were to do that it would be impossible for this House to pass legislation other than a form of legislation that would never permit of any sort of divorce because the test itself would be too absolute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take the point raised by Deputy Haughey again as to the question of a period or periods, that can be pushed too far as well.  If one limits this test to one period of five years, as opposed to periods making up a total of five years, then &mdash; far from creating a law that would help stabilise marriage &mdash; what one would do, at least in some cases, would be to exclude the possibility of reconciliation. Any spouses of a marriage going through a difficult patch will realise that this has been going on for three years, realise that one has to be in a failed or broken down marriage for a single period of five years before one can get a divorce.  Then there is absolutely nothing to encourage the <Col N="1617" /> spouses to that marriage to endeavour to overcome their differences.  They will realise that if they do so the difficulties they have had will never be available to them to use in a court as part of the evidence that would show their marriage had failed for a period or periods of five years.  It would be counter-productive to what we are trying to achieve.  Therefore, I do not think it really matters whether we use the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; or &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  I would not agree at all, for the reasons I have given, that one should add to either word another such as &ldquo;total&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete&rdquo; because then the test would become too severe.</P>
    <P>This debate will be very important if the people, in their wisdom, accept the amendment and the House has got to consider legislation in the future because it will be at that stage that the detail of the guidelines we are setting out here will have to be determined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Haughey and Deputy Molony that it is really a question of semantics in relation to the meaning of the words &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; and &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  It was interesting that my friend and colleague, Deputy Woods, gave the Oxford definition of the words &ldquo;fail&rdquo;, &ldquo;failure&rdquo; or &ldquo;failed&rdquo;.  I referred to another dictionary, the Chambers English Dictionary, which gives a different definition of the word &ldquo;fail&rdquo; or &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  The enlarged edition of that dictionary, with supplement, defines the word &ldquo;fail&rdquo; as follows: to fall short or to be wanting; to fall away; to decay; to die; to prove deficient under trial, examination, pressure; to miss; to be disappointed or baffled; to be unable to pay one's debts; to be wanting to; not to be sufficient for; to leave undone, omit; to disappoint or desert anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey made the observation that perhaps the Minister was going for a total abandonment of the reference to the dissolution of marriage in the Constitution, the constitutional bar, that he wanted to abolish it entirely, make no reference to it whatsoever, that effectively what we are dealing with here is a compromise in the context of the nation, <Col N="1618" /> and we should not be making any apologies for so doing.  I would have gone for a complete omission of the reference to divorce in the Constitution but that could not be got and, in those circumstances, I understand the Minister's difficulty.</P>
    <P>The same dictionary defines the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; as follows: to break down, to crush down or level; to collapse; to fail completely.  In the definition of the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; there is the intrusion of the word &ldquo;fail&rdquo;, adding to our confusion.  I do not want to compound our confusion. As Deputy Molony pointed out, what we are endeavouring to do, in difficult circumstances, is to help people by the use of a definition that is comprehensible and understandable.  Bearing in mind the right of Deputies of our party to express their own points of view, I believe that the wording is satisfactory; I do not think it is complete but it is satisfactory.  In the context of the sentence, or of the amendment in its entirety, it is proper that we should tease the matter out and seek clarification.  We are entitled and shall continue to do so.  As far as perfection is sought, the amendment, as it stands, is as perfect as we in our fallibility can achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I might add briefly to the comments of the last two speakers.  There is a great artificiality in debating this issue, in picking out one word, as is being done &mdash; I know it is being done in the context of the amendment proposed &mdash; the word &ldquo;fail&rdquo; and then have a lengthy debate as to its meaning, whether it is subjective, objective, whether or not this is the kernel of the proposition to be included in the Constitution.  I take the view that whether one is talking about &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; or &ldquo;failure&rdquo; in isolation does not matter in real terms semantically. We are talking about a marriage that has collapsed, is not functioning, is not viable.  There are all sorts of different terminologies one can use.  One has to assume that the courts would interpret the Constitution using a degree of common sense, interpreting words in the way in which they are meant and <Col N="1619" /> intended within the constitutional provision prescribed.</P>
      <P>Within this provision we are not simply talking about granting a decree of divorce when a marriage has failed.  We are talking about a court established under the Constitution being permitted by way of legislation to grant a decree of divorce if the failure has continued for a period of or periods amounting to at least five years and if there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage.  No reference to the latter portion has been made in any of the contributions in the House.  We are talking about a marriage which has failed and where there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation.  There is no ambiguity about that.  It is clear that none of these provisions is exclusive, listed in paragraphs (i) to (iv) in the new provisions proposed to be included in the Constitution. We are speaking about a marriage which has failed for a specified period or periods of time and where there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation. Whether there is or is not a reasonable possibility of reconciliation is a decision which the court will make.  The mere fact of five years' failure of the marriage will not of itself necessitate the court making a decision to grant a divorce.  It is a condition or prerequisite which must be met.</P>
      <P>We are not simply talking about taking the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; or &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; in a vacuum and defining their meaning.  We are talking about a marriage that has failed and in respect of which there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the spouses.  It does not take a legal eagle or an expert lawyer to work out the meaning of that phraseology.  The ordinary man or woman in the street without a great deal of legal training would not have too much difficulty in recognising such a marriage.  It would not need a university law degree to know what that concept meant in real terms in applying it to the situation of a broken marriage.  There is a certain degree of artificiality about taking out the word</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" />&ldquo;failed&rdquo; and looking at it in isolation, not taking it in the context of the provision which requires the court to ensure that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Let me briefly refer to another matter. Deputies Andrews and Mac Giolla referred to the fact that there is a provision proposed to be inserted in the Constitution to admit divorce in certain prescribed circumstances.  Both Deputies would have had a preference for simply deleting Article 41.3.2º as it currently stands.  Deputy Woods on Second Stage last week queried our dealing with this matter in that way.  As a member of the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, I can say that this issue was discussed in great detail by the committee and the unanimous conclusion was that one could not simply remove the prohibition on divorce.  If one did that it would leave a constitutional ambiguity. There would then be nothing within the Constitution confirming that the relevant legislation could be enacted.  In the light of the other provisions that would remain in Articles 41 and 42, there could be uncertainty as to what type of law could be enacted following the deletion of that Article.  That is expressly referred to in the report of the marital committee, on advice given by that committee.  It would seem, within the context of our Constitution and the other provisions remaining in it, that it was important that through a referendum by the people voting, the Oireachtas, could have conferred on them a specific power to provide this type of legislation.  In a country where people have genuine anxieties and are eager to ensure that where marriages run into difficulties the maximum possible steps are taken to resolve those difficulties and where people are anxious that nobody can rush into a divorce court, it is important that these protections be there and available.  To have dealt with this matter in a different way would not have met real worries that many have who also wish to be compassionate and to extend to couples whose marriages have totally collapsed the possibility of obtaining a divorce and of a happy second marriage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed my views on Second Stage, as all the Deputies of my party have a right to express their views.  In that context I would refer to the matter under discussion.  Deputy Molony stated that there was an air of unreality about the discussion.  He is correct, but perhaps for a different reason. Whatever word is used, &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; or &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, if the amendment is passed we will have divorce and if the trend in other countries is followed &mdash; and I have no reason to think that it will not &mdash; we will end up with divorce on demand.</P>
      <P>The Government have stated that they propose to introduce legislation, if the amendment is passed, which will insist on a five year separation before a person can apply for a divorce.  In circumstances where a couple have been separated for five years and come before the court, or one of the partners does, saying that his or her marriage has failed, as Deputy Woods has said, this is a subjective matter.  The court cannot decide other than with the applicant.  As happened in any other country where legislation included quite a volume of protections, the end result was that the marriage was accepted as having failed and divorce was granted on that basis.  After some time, the limit of five years' separation will be reduced and reduced further in the Dáil and Seanad and we will have divorce on demand, as is the case in Britain and the United States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, first, to assure Deputy Harney that I share her concern but do not agree with the method that she is putting forward.  I disagree with Deputy Molony on only one point, which is that I believe there is a difference between failure and breakdown.  Other than that, I would make my own the comments of both Deputy Molony and Deputy Shatter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with some matters which go a little further than the specific words about which we are talking.  If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me a little leeway, it might be helpful.  I want, first, to recall the procedure for which we would provide in legislation.  It has been <Col N="1622" /> said in the House, particularly by Deputy Woods, that in relation to the amendment we have a specific proposal but that in relation to the legislation to follow it we have a statement of intent.  That is perfectly true and that is how it must be.  Unless and until the constitutional amendment is passed the House cannot, under the present Constitution, enact any other legislation.  We must necessarily at this point have a specific proposal for the amendment of the Constitution and a statement of intention in relation to the legislation.</P>
    <P>We provide in the legislation that before making an application for a divorce a couple must first, in the normal case apart from the transitional provision that I think people agree on, have already obtained a judicial separation or drawn up for themselves a separation agreement that has been made a rule of court.  The House already knows, as I have already pointed out, that we intend to extend the grounds on which judicial separations may be granted.  One of the extensions would be that a judicial separation could be granted in the event of separation for three years of the spouses or, with the consent of the respondent, separation for one year.  However, the couple would already have had to go through that procedure.</P>
    <P>We will also provide that in no case may a couple seek a decree of divorce less than two years after securing a judicial separation or having a separation agreement made a rule of court.  That background is important because it impinges upon some of the points Deputies have made on the period or periods amounting to at least five years.  I will come back to that in a few moments but it is important to bear in mind that the legislation will be framed in the context of the parameters as set out in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The use of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; has no connotation of fault and I want to reassure Deputy Harney on that point.  That will be clear to the House from the quotations which have been given from Oxford and Chambers.  Nowhere in any of those definitions did I hear a suggestion of fault. It is certainly not the intention of this <Col N="1623" /> amendment to indicate that there is a suggestion of fault in the definition of &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  Deputy Haughey correctly anticipated my reply when he asked whether in relation to either the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; or &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; we would not insert the adjective &ldquo;total&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete&rdquo;. I would take the view that in this context any adjective would be redundant. There is a failure or there is not, particularly, since the proposed constitutional provision would provide where and only where the court is satisfied that the marriage has failed.  In that context it seems that the word &ldquo;total&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete&rdquo; would be redundant.</P>
    <P>When we come to the second next condition as set out in the proposal, where, and only where, the court is satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage that describes the condition far more accurately and effectively than any adjective such as &ldquo;total&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete&rdquo; breakdown of the marriage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney is worried about what she believes to be the subjective nature of the concept of failure, as against which in logic she must oppose what she must claim is the objective concept of breakdown. I cannot see that either one in itself is either more subjective or more objective than the other.  The essential point I want to make is that we are not concerned in this provision with the subjective feelings of the parties to the marriage. Once again, might I emphasise the fact that, under the legislation we propose, they will have to have gone through a process of judicial separation or will have had to draw up a separation agreement which is made a rule of court.  They will already have formed the view and given effect to the view that at the very least there is something seriously wrong with their marriage to the point where they would request a judicial separation or agree to separate.</P>
    <P>When the court comes to consider it, we will have in any case already on the record not just evidence but a very clear statement of the fact that these two people felt something had gone seriously <Col N="1624" /> awry.  But that is not the only element in this that takes this out of the realm of the subjective.  Again, I refer to the provision that the court must be satisfied that the marriage has failed.  Therefore, we are not talking about the subjective opinion of either one or both of the parties to the marriage.  We are talking about what the court may conclude on the basis of all of the evidence brought before it.  We are not talking about a purely subjective test. We are talking about a conclusion which will be arrived at by the court on the basis of the presentation of the evidence.  That objective element is reinforced by the fact that we require that the failure must have continued for a period or periods amounting to at least five years, another test outside of the subjective feelings of the parties to the marriage.</P>
    <P>The court must also be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation.  Here, I go back again to what we have stated is our intention to provide in the legislation.  The House will remember that, in that statement of intention in relation to the legislation, we have set out the proposition that, in considering applications for judicial separations, we will insert a provision to the effect that the court may adjourn the proceedings with a recommendation to the parties involved to go to one of the agencies that offer assistance in trying to bring about a reconciliation to see whether a reconciliation could be brought about.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine that there will be any mandatory force in that but it is something that the court will have to consider at the point where a request is made for a judicial separation, not at the point of the request for divorce.  Of course, if it proved that a reconciliation was not possible at that point or if it emerged that during the course of divorce proceedings that an attempt at reconciliation had not been successful, that is another part of the picture which the court would take into consideration in making its decision on whether or not to grant a divorce.</P>
    <P>With regard to failure I would remind the House of what the Taoiseach said on Friday last in this House without <Col N="1625" /> being able to quote the passage in the Official Report?  I do not think it is printed yet.  He said:</P>
    <P>First the Court must be satisfied that the marriage has failed: not broken down &mdash; for what has broken down may be mended &mdash; but failed.  We chose this word deliberately and with care, because it involves a sense of finality which no other word seems adequately to express.  It is, for instance, much more final than &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;, and also much more final than &ldquo;separation&rdquo;&mdash; for not all separations involve a failure of the marriage, and under this constitutional provision the Court will have to be satisfied not merely that the proposed legal provision of five years' separation is met but that in addition the constitutional requirement of failure of the marriage for five years without any reasonable prospect of reconciliation is also met.</P>
    <P>Moreover this sense of finality is reinforced by the provision that the Court must be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility of a reconciliation of the parties to the marriage.  It is difficult to conceive of a wording that would express more strongly than this the prerequisite that the marriage must be at an end in all but name before the Court can permit it to be dissolved, thus giving the parties a right to remarry.</P>
    <P>That, in conjunction with what I have said about the other conditions and the legislation, should indicate to the House that failure in this context is a more stringent condition than breakdown.  Could I also say since references have been made to the concept of irretrievable breakdown, I take the concern which Deputies show when they use the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I invite the House to consider the proposition that the concept of irretrievable is included in condition No. 3 in the proposed amendment, that is, that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage.  If we are talking about irretrievable breakdown, which is the test that Deputy <Col N="1626" /> Harney has in mind, I prefer the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; for the reasons which I have given.  The concept of irretrievability is already included in the terms of the amendment as set out in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Haughey was insisting on this point, but there are people whose marriages would have been regarded as a failure in the past if they did not have children.  Some people would have regarded marriage as a failure if one of the sons did not become a priest or a doctor.  That is not the concept we are talking about here and those are not the kinds of things which a court would have in mind.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of the period or periods amounting to at least five years.  Deputy Molony expressed concern about this matter and the reason we used that formulation.  We do not want to put into the Constitution a condition which, once people believed their marriage was in serious trouble, that they were at the point of separation or that they felt it had failed, would in any way present an obstacle to those people thinking again and which would prevent them from deciding to try again.  Deputy Haughey asked if this means that the failure need not be continuous, that failure is not conclusive.  He asked what was our concept.  Was it that the failure might be remedied during the in between period?  I do not think it could be the latter because, while the parties in question might at a certain point come to the conclusion that they should separate, they might after some time believe that the separation was not producing the result that they hoped for.  They might decide to see if they could work something out together and bring about a reconciliation.  They might try that and fail and find themselves going into a further period of separation.  We did not want to write this in a way that would prevent people from trying again for a reconciliation.  If we provided only one period of five years, and that had to be a continuous period, it could be what would tip the balance in favour of people not trying again.  If we provided only one <Col N="1627" /> period of five years they would then have to go back to square one if they found that the reconciliation did not prove possible.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Mac Giolla's suggestion that in many ways failure depends on what people are looking for.  What might be described as failure of marriage in one person's view might not constitute failure in another person's mind.  I do not think that we can provide for the differing expectations of people.  For example, it would not be valid to say that what constituted failure or the circumstances that gave rise to failure in one case ought or ought not to have been regarded as failure if they were replicated in another case.</P>
    <P>A number of questions were asked about the reason we chose this route rather than simply deleting Article 41.3.2º from the Constitution.  I think the House is aware of the reasons.  I dealt with them on Second Stage.  Deputy Andrews, Deputy Molony and Deputy Shatter dealt with some of the reasons.  Simply, to delete the provision from the Constitution would have run the risk of creating an inconsistency or a contradiction in the Constitution which would not be justified.  We then had to consider what provision in place of that would be adequate to deal with the problem and to provide the guidelines for the Oireachtas on the restrictive basis which we believe is required.  That is where this provision came from.  Were we simply to delete Article 41.3.2º there would be no guidelines for the Oireachtas.  Some Members of this House would accept that and would rely on the judgment of the Oireachtas to legislate accordingly. Others, and the Government have come to this conclusion, would prefer that the Constitution should set out guidelines for this House so that we could be guided by something &mdash; and I hope this will be passed &mdash; which expresses the general sense of the people on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked could failure not take place before a separation.  The answer is that it could.  There is no doubt about that.  As I said, in the legislation we are making very specific provisions in <Col N="1628" /> relation to lengths of time and the steps that must be taken before a court can even consider granting a divorce.  In the legislation they are based on separation. The final decision of the court, which can intervene only after all of the conditions here have been satisfied, including any other conditions laid down in the legislation, would be on the basis of the provisions as set out here and would at the minimum require that the court be satisfied that that failure had continued for five years or for periods amounting to five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish to deal with some arguments made by Deputy Shatter, which surprised me coming from a lawyer.  He spoke in terms of what the ordinary man in the street would think of these words and how he would interpret them.  I suggest that that is totally irrelevant. The Constitution will be interpreted by lawyers.  We have all had experiences over the years of having words in statutes analysed and parsed in the most exacting detail by the courts as to whether they conform with one word in the Constitution.  When dealing with the words &ldquo;failure&rdquo; or &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; we have to be very clear on exactly what the connotations and the inherent qualities of the word are and not what the ordinary man in the street would imagine it might mean.  The second point made by Deputy Shatter was that we can take Sub-Article 2ºiii which speaks of no reasonable possibility of reconciliation to support Sub-Article 2ºi in regard to the failure of marriage.  I want to suggest that that is not so because the four items in Sub-Article 2º stand separately and distinct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I direct the attention of the House to the fact that the Article speaks of the court being satisfied.  The court will have to be satisfied on each of these paragraphs separately.  No lawyer in the Supreme Court or elsewhere would be able to bring paragraph iii into his aid as an interpretation of paragraph i.  The court will have to be satisfied on each of these four matters, that they are each established as separate.  In that context <Col N="1629" /> the four paragraphs will not be read together.  The question the court will address itself to, first, is has this marriage failed?  It will decide that separately as one matter.  It will go on then to consider the other matters, such as the period, and whether there is a possibility of reconciliation and whether proper financial provision has been made.</P>
    <P>All these will be decided on their own by the court, so it is not valid to say that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is re-inforced by iii, the lack of any reasonable possibility of reconciliation.  Therefore, we will have to look at the use of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; or &ldquo;failed&rdquo; as a separate matter.  On that question the Minister slightly misinterpreted an argument I had made.  He spoke of the Taoiseach referring to &ldquo;finality&rdquo;, when the Taoiseach claimed that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; incorporated the highest degree of finality that could be found.  It is precisely on that point that I was addressing myself when I spoke about the two or three separate periods amounting to five years.  I was not arguing for a continuous period of five years as against two or three separate periods amounting to five years.  I said that the very wording of this Article removes finality from the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and I submit the Taoiseach is wrong in saying that &ldquo;failure&rdquo; has an air, or ring, or quality of finality that is not in any other word, such as &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Article clearly envisages a marriage having failed for a period, then going through another period in which it has not failed and then having another period in which it is a failure.  The Article clearly represents or envisages two separate periods of failure which added together make five years, but obviously there would be an interim during which the marriage would not be a failure.  So the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;<i>ipso fcto</i> is not final if we are to look at the words in paragraph (ii) which provide for a period of failure and then a period of non-failure and then another period of failure which, combined, make five years.</P>
    <P>Therefore &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, as &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;, has not this inherent quality of finality or completeness or irretrievability that we <Col N="1630" /> are looking for.  Deputy Molony said there is an air of unreality about this.  I suggest there is not an air of unreality about it.  We are dealing with a very fundamental matter.  I believe that a section of people &mdash; I do not know how large or how small &mdash; throughout the country have said in polls and surveys that they would accept divorce in very restricted, limited circumstances.  Therefore, we must decide whether we are writing in the Constitution a set of limited restricted circumstances which would satisfy those people.  I suggest to the Minister that perhaps the reason he has not gone for the Article in the Constitution <i>simpliciter</i> but instead is putting these words into the Constitution by way of amendment is to win over the support of that group of people or to satisfy the wishes of that group who would accept divorce provided it is in very limited restricted circumstances.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is important to establish for ourselves, and particularly as a guideline for that section of people, whether the words here are restrictive and limited to the extent some people suggest.  My answer to Deputy Molony in that regard is that there is no unreality about it, and it is not legitimate for the Minister to defend the insertion of these provisions in the Constitution on the basis of legislation he may introduce.  It is only an intention on the part of the Minister, and these words will govern the sort of legislation to be introduced.  Therefore, the Minister cannot advance some sort of legislation that he has in mind to justify these words &mdash; it is the other way around, it is these words that will govern the subsequent legislation.</P>
    <P>We have to satisfy ourselves, therefore, whether these words impose any real limitations and restrictions on the sort of legislation that will be introduced. I ask, and I still feel it is a very legitimate question, why a word like &ldquo;complete&rdquo;, &ldquo;total&rdquo;, &ldquo;final&rdquo;, is not inserted before the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; particularly as I think I can establish from paragraph (ii) that failure is not final.  Paragraph (ii) visualises a situation in which we can have failure which will be ended, followed by another <Col N="1631" /> period of failure, and the two together will make five years.  So &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is not final, and if we are to look at these terms being inserted as being restrictive or limited we must see if this &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is everything the Minister has purported it to be, or is there a need to put some other imprint on it, such as &ldquo;total&rdquo;, &ldquo;complete&rdquo; or &ldquo;final&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony said we could not put such a phrase as &ldquo;total failure&rdquo; into the Constitution because then you could never legislate to comply with it, to satisfy that constitutional prohibition.  All we would have to do in those circumstances is to incorporate the wording of the Constitution into the legislation, and if the Constitution provides for total or complete failure and we subsequently want to legislate in conformity with that we will only have to use those exact words in the legislation we would bring in.  So that argument of Deputy Molony does not stand up.</P>
    <P>Without casting any doubts whatever on the Minister's intention to bring in legislation, or whether he will actually be there as Minister to bring in legislation, I reiterate that that is a relevant consideration because the whole purpose of putting these words into the Constitution is to govern the sort of legislation that the Oireachtas may one day bring in.  Therefore, we must look at these words as they stand and as they will appear in our Constitution in future as the standard against which any legislation will be interpreted.</P>
    <P>I have established that the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; has no totality or finality about it as a word, no more than has the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;.  I cannot understand why some addition has not been made to it that would give it that air of finality.  This is not something to be dealt with lightly, as Deputy Shatter suggested.  We cannot just take the meaning the ordinary man on the street attributes to the word and accept that.  That is not the way Constitutions are phrased, implemented or interpreted.  They are rigorously and minutely examined and dissected by lawyers and judges.  &ldquo;Failure&rdquo; means irremediable <Col N="1632" /> failure or it does not; &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; means irretrievable breakdown or it does not.  I suggest that neither word has that air of finality that is claimed for it.  It is no good using paragraph (iii) in this context because the court will look at each of the four separate matters and decide each one on its merits as to whether it meets the test.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey is right when he says that courts parse and analyse the provisions of the Constitution and sections and subsections of statutes. One of the basic legal principles applied by any court in interpreting a statute is to look at the purpose and overall intent of the statute.  A section in a statute or an Article in the Constitution is normally construed not in isolation but having regard to the body of legislation or the constitutional principle.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what Deputy Haughey has said, here we are talking about a single sub-article that will be inserted in the Constitution if the latter is changed.  It is a sub-Article that stands as a whole.  It makes no more sense to extract the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; and regard that as the most fundamental word than it does to extract the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; or &ldquo;establish&rdquo; or any other word contained in it and conduct a debate on that.  What the courts do in practice is to look at the sub-Article in its entirety.  They will define an intent in that sub-Article by looking at the words contained in it and the way it stands in the Constitution as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that these preconditions that the marriage has failed for a period or periods amounting to at least five years and that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation are interrelated.  One does not stand on its own.  A court will not be able to grant a decree of divorce that a marriage has failed <i>simpliciter,</i> no more than it will be allowed to grant a decree of divorce if it believes that the parties are beyond reconciliation.  It will have to implement each of the preconditions which are complementary to each other and none of which is mutually exclusive.  They stand together, not individually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> There is always a danger in a discussion such as this that one can get lost in the jargon of the Judiciary and the law courts, but we are dealing with a legal argument about the interpretation of the Constitution.  I will give a judicial quotation from the case <i>Murray v. Ireland,</i> in a judgment in the High Court on 2 July 1985 by Mr. Justice Declan Costello.  In that case the family Articles in the Constitution were discussed in some detail and much of the discussion is not of great relevance to this issue.  However, in one part of the judgment the judge looked at how we interpret the Constitution and whether one picks out sections or words in isolation and ascribes a meaning to them, disregarding the entire constitutional environment in which they are placed.  In that judgment the judge referred to the fact that in construing the Constitution &ldquo;the courts should bear in mind that the document is a political one as well as a legal one&rdquo;.  He went on to say that, in construing it, a purpose of approach to interpretation that would look at the whole text of the Constitution and identify its purpose and objective is the approach adopted by the courts.  In other words, in looking at one Article in its entirety sometimes the courts will give an interpretation of that Article in the overall context of the Constitution and the other Articles contained in it.</P>
    <P>In looking at a sub-Article in the Constitution there is no doubt that the courts will look at that and interpret it by identifying its purpose and objective.  There can be no other way of approaching it. Otherwise an absurd interpretation could be produced by isolating a small proportion of the Constitution while ignoring the rest.  In the case <i>Tormey v. Ireland</i>, in a Supreme Court judgment of May 1985, Mr. Justice Henchy referred to the need to adopt a construction of the constitutional provisions that would lead &ldquo;to the smooth and harmonious operation of the Constitution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In interpreting this provision and what it means a court will look at the entire sub-Article and will apply an interpretation based on viewing the objective of <Col N="1634" /> the sub-Article in the overall constitutional context.  It will view it within the context of an Article that seeks to protect the family, that goes on to ascribe rights to the family and that, in the context of this amendment, acknowledges the family is based on marriage but that marriages can fail.  Where a marriage has failed, where the failure is for a continuous period or periods of five years and where there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation, divorce is a practical possibility, provided divorce legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>The courts will not take out one small bit of a sub-Article of the Constitution and interpret it in isolation.  The question has been asked why this does not refer to total failure.  If refers to a marriage that has failed and where there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation and where the court will make an objective decision that there is no possibility of reconciliation.  In all reasonable terms that is a marriage that has ceased to function.</P>
    <P>In that context we have to look at what this House is about.  The intent of the Article is to extend the possibility of remarriage and divorce to a couple whose marriage has failed and who are irreconcilable. The fact that the marriage has been a failure for five years or more indicates clearly that not only can the couple not lead a viable marital relationship but that there is no reasonable possibility of their ever again doing so.  I accept what Deputy Haughey has said, that our job here is to tease out this matter.  However, there is a great artificiality simply arguing about the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo;.  This is a sub-Article that stands as a whole Article, that will be interpreted in the context of the full content of that sub-Article as well as viewing it in the overall context in which it stands.  To say that each paragraph in the sub-Article stands separately and distinct, as Deputy Haughey said, is not correct.  Each is complementary to the other and they are inter-related within the one Article.</P>

      <P>They are intertwined. They are not provisions that stand on their own.  They are interrelated with an overall objective to extend the possibility of divorce in circumstances where it can be established that a marriage has failed for an extended period of time.  Any other type of interpretation is unduly artificial. Deputy Haughey also asked why there should be reference to a continued period or periods amounting to five years. Deputy Molony dealt with that issue.</P>
      <P>I would assume that we in this House would have certain objectives if the majority of the people wish to extend the possibility of divorce and remarriage to couples whose marriages have broken down.  Our objective would be first to extend the possibility to couples whose marriages have broken down and we would be concerned to ensure that couples would not rush into divorce when marital difficulties occur.  There is an overwhelming anxiety on the part of the majority of people to ensure that we do not have divorce on demand &mdash; that a couple who wake up one morning and have a row over something should not be able to seek a judge two weeks later, as can happen in Reno, and get a divorce. I do not think anybody can seriously suggest that divorce on demand is served up by a constitutional provision which requires proof of five years' failure and no reasonable possibility of reconciliation. Built within this provision is the possibility of extending re-marriage to a couple whose marriage has completely failed, while ensuring that there is protection against couples rushing into divorce without the possibility of reconciliation being pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision greatly restricts and limits the availability of divorce in a manner unprecedented in all other countries in the world.  In Italy, for example, a divorce can be obtained by a spouse after a seven-year separation without the consent of the other spouse, but that is not a constitutional provision.  It could be changed at any time.  Here we are restricting divorce constitutionally to provide limited divorce in very limited <Col N="1636" /> circumstances within the overall context of the wording of this Article.  The five-year period is important.</P>
    <P>As well as extending the possibility of divorce and remarriage to a couple whose marriage has failed and also providing protection against people rushing into divorce by inserting a provision into our Constitution, a third objective would be to encourage the possibility of reconciliation where that is possible and not discourage it.  I presume we would all agree that when marriage collapses or runs into difficulties for a time, no constitutional barrier should exist against a possibility of reconciliation.  We would share that objective whether we are for or against divorce or whether we recognise the need for divorce or do not recognise it.  That is where the periods amounting to at least five years come into play.  If we took the formula which Deputy Haughey is proposing that a marriage should have totally failed for a continued period of five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not arguing for a continuous five year period as being desirable or not desirable.  I am not entering into that.  My argument is a very simple one.  The wording of the constitutional amendment envisages the five years as being made up of two or three separate periods.  I am addressing my argument in relation to the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;. If there is failure and then an interim period when there is not failure, followed by failure for two years, the first failure is not final.  I am using that only as an argument for or against the quality of finality in the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  I am not arguing for five years or ten years or for continuous or broken periods.</P>

    <Col N="1637" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context there are periods of failure and non-failure; but, no matter how long the period of failure, unless there is no possibility of reconciliation a decree of divorce will not be possible. This is the kind of finality that is being talked about.  It is very important to have the possibility of separate periods of failure because without that there could be appalling cases.  For example, a couple who had a viable marriage relationship could find that their marriage had collapsed and they might live apart for three or four years, during which time there would be a failure of their relationship. Then they might decide to make a final attempt at reconciliation to see if they can resolve their difficulties.  They recommence living together and after about six months or a year they discover that their relationship is not functioning and that their marriage is not working but has totally collapsed.  They again separate. During the period they were residing together the view may be that they were attempting to make the marriage work and the time would not start running again until they separated.  At the end of a one-year period after their separation there would be a possibility of either of them seeking divorce.  If this gap were not possible this couple could be in some difficulty after the four-year period of separation if they wanted to attempt a reconciliation.  If they needed a continuous period of five years in order to get a divorce, there would be a constitutional disincentive to attempting a reconciliation. If things did not work out they would have to start all over again and a new period of five years would have to elapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody could suggest that this type of formula would be in the interest of marriage or would encourage couples to reconcile.  It would effectively provide a constitutional barrier to reconciliation. I would submit that this is why the phrase &ldquo;total failure&rdquo; is not appropriate to be inserted at the commencement of this new sub-Article.  The formula that is contained in it is far more appropriate and I think all sides would be agreed that it would not inhibit reconciliation if <Col N="1638" /> people vote in favour of divorce.  That is the kernel of the formula.</P>
    <P>There is another reason I suggest that the words &ldquo;total failure&rdquo; are not appropriate.  If the courts were to adopt the approach that Deputy Haughey is suggesting, which I think would be an artificial means of interpreting this and for which I do not think there is precedent, it might be necessary to prove that marriage had totally failed.  That could very well, as Deputy Molony suggested, exclude the possibility of any divorce or remarriage to many people locked into the tragedy of a broken marriage because, if I marry and if, for the first five years of my marriage we have a happy marital relationship and then something happens in the sixth year and our relationship is irrevocably ruptured, irretrievably collapsed, broken down, failed &mdash; use whatever word one likes &mdash; and we separate for five years and I go to court and look for a decree of divorce, it would be open to the court to say that the marriage has not totally failed, that it may have failed now, it may not be functioning now, but for five years it functioned, that this marriage was not a total failure, not a complete failure; it was a functioning viable marriage, a subsisting marriage, a marriage with a relationship operating in a normal way between a young couple, for five years. Later on it failed.  But if one were to describe the marriage as a total failure and adopt this type of artificial interpretation &mdash; and I am doing so in reply to the argument Deputy Haughey is making in taking this sub-provision within this sub-article out of context &mdash; it could produce a nonsensical legal situation where the majority of people whose marriages have collapsed and who wish to use a divorce jurisdiction to extend to themselves the possibility of a second valid marriage, would be excluded from doing so.</P>
    <P>It could be that in that situation the only couples entitled to a decree of divorce would be those whose marriages had totally failed in the sense that from day one they never functioned due to some personality defect or psychiatric illness or physiological difficulty such as <Col N="1639" /> the marriage not being consummated. In those circumstances we could enact a divorce law that would do nothing other than extend divorce to those couples who are entitled currently to get civil decrees of annulment.  This would be a nonsensical constitutional proposition.  I am not saying that I would agree with the method of interpretation that Deputy Haughey is suggesting the courts will adopt, but if they do adopt this interpretation the use of the words &ldquo;total failure&rdquo; would result in us inserting something in the Constitution which would not achieve the objective that is sought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of what I have heard I am not at all convinced that the amendment I am moving is not a correct approach.  In fact, Deputy Shatter makes the case very well.  The concept of failure implies there was never a happy viable relationship between the parties to a marriage. There are many situations where people can be perfectly happy for ten or 20 years and then the marriage can irretrievably break down.  What I want to see is that in those circumstances, where there has been a breakdown, the couple can have the marriage dissolved and have the right to remarry.  I accept the need to add the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete&rdquo;. I accept Deputy Haughey's point and I have no objection at all to that.  But I want to get away from the concept of failure, which I think is subjective, ambiguous and very unsatisfactory.  It would be very offensive and insulting to many people involved in what may have been a viable marriage for a long number of years to be told that their marriage was a failure when in fact, for a substantial period, it could have been a great success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are talking about here is a breakdown in relationship between two people.  We are talking about the irretrievable breakdown of a relationship between two people.  If that is what we are talking about, the parties just cannot be reconciled.  But I do not believe with any certainty that there can be a finality about this.  When dealing with human beings and their relationships I do not <Col N="1640" /> think one can ever say never.  There can never to a period where one can say that that has finally ended.  That is why I believe that the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; later on in the Bill is unsatisfactory because it implies that something might be impossible and, in terms of two people, if it is not impossible and it is not certain that they cannot at some stage get back together again &mdash; which could well be the case particularly in the case of a very young marriage &mdash; I think the element of finality cannot always be there as much as we would like to think because we are talking about human beings and a particular kind of relationship.</P>
    <P>Despite what Deputy Andrews and others who quoted dictionary definitions and so on have said, I still believe we are going down the wrong road by talking in terms of failure.  I do not want to introduce any unnecessary difficulty or difference between parties who essentially agree on the overall approach, because it will be difficult enough to have this constitutional amendment carried without bringing into the debate a whole degree of uncertainty.  But I feel so strongly about the concept of failure that I think it is unwise.  I think that for children, to know that their parents marriage has been described as a failure, is not very satisfactory or helpful and it is rather upsetting for them, besides the two parties involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter spoke continually about the irretrievable breakdown of marriage.  I do not think he used the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; at all.  On our committee, as I said earlier, we were very keen to ensure that we did not in any way talk in terms of fault or failure; and I believe that the concept of failure implies no degree of success, no degree of a normal healthy viable relationship.  I accept that perhaps if I were to add the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete&rdquo; others may feel that that is a more satisfactory explanation which gets over the argument that a marriage can of course break down and, after a number of years, the couple can be reconciled. I do accept that.  With hindsight I agree to the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; should have been added to my amendment and <Col N="1641" /> I am quite happy to do this.  But I would like to get away from the concept of casting people into a situation where they have to live with a stigma on concept which I believe is most unsatisfactory. We are going down a very dangerous and unwise road.</P>
    <P>Earlier remarks were made about the desirability of approaching the referendum in this fashion.  It was suggested that it might have been more appropriate to simply delete from the Constitution the prohibition on divorce.  That would have been my own preference.  But again on the committee we recognised that that would cause constitutional difficulties in relation to Article 41 of the Constitution and the rights and so on given to the family.  Equally, I believe the political reality is such that even with this particular approach we may still not be successful, but without it we would have had no possible reason to believe that the matter would have been carried.  Already there are a number of difficulties coming in the way that I would be worried about.  It is for that reason that I would ask the Minister to accept the bona fides of the approach that we are trying to adopt, to accept that we want to make the wording as satisfactory as possible.  We do not want people whose marriages have irretrievably broken down to have to live with the stigma of failure, which would be a very difficult thing to have to live with.  Equally, I believe that in the course of this debate it is important that parties who agree generally on the approach should, in so far as possible, be prepared to go down the road of accepting amendments like this if there is no real, serious objection.  I do not believe the Minister put down any serious objection to what I had to say.  Many Deputies have argued that the two words are really the same.  I do not accept that at all.  They are very different.  But the concept of what we are trying to do is more or less the same, and, since it is, I think we should take what I would regard as the preferable road.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to all the various back-up facilities that will be available to marriage partners and the fact that a period of five years need not necessarily <Col N="1642" /> be a period when the couples are not encouraged in every possible way to try to come together to reconcile their difficulties. I too, would agree with that approach.  I do not think we should make it impossible or phrase this constitutional amendment in such a way as to discourage people at any stage during the period that they are apart from coming together and seeking professional help and doing everything possible to reconcile their difficulties and save their marriage.  I certainly would agree with that approach.</P>

      <P>I was quite impressed with Deputy Shatter's legal arguments on this issue.  We are always impressed with legal arguments until the lawyer from the other side gets up and tears that to shreds.  Deputy Shatter was the lawyer for the defence in this case, but I am sure if he was prosecuting he would have put up a similarly marvellous performance.  We are back where we started as far as the argument is concerned. All I want to do is clarify &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and say why I am worried about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like Deputy Haughey to clarify why he is arguing against the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;. I am very glad he is here to keep a rein on Deputy Woods.  My worry is that &ldquo;failure&rdquo; will be decided on by a court of middle class, middle aged, male mostly, conservative judges appointed by a conservative Government, and it does not matter which party are in power.  How difficult will they make it for some one to prove that their marriage has failed?  How difficult will it be for someone whose marriage has failed, whose marriage has irretrievably broken down for five years, to convince these judges that that is so? If I am convinced by the arguments from the Government side that that is not so, there will be no problem with that word and I will be prepared to accept what they say.  My only worry is that the definition of &ldquo;failure&rdquo; will be a personal definition of the judge.  How difficult will it be for a couple to persuade the judge that <Col N="1643" /> their marriage has failed?  I would like Deputy Haughey to tell me if he is also worried about the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; or does the believe we are making it too easy for couples to prove that their marriage has failed?</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla mentioned the kind of court which would be dealing with this legislation.  We will have a new type of court &mdash; the family court. I was surprised to read an article in <i>The Telegraph</i> which said that the Lord Chancellor published a paper proposing various procedural reforms in matrimonial and family matters and the paper outlined the argument for the establishment of a family court.  Britain has had divorce for many years and they are only now getting around to the idea of the family court.  In the document of intent we have made provision for family courts.  I hope we will have open minded judges, and perhaps some female judges, to deal with these problems.</P>
      <P>I came here this afternoon because I was interested to hear what definition the House would give to the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;. The whole of Part II depends on the definition of &ldquo;failure&rdquo;&mdash; that is the layman's reading of this.  As a layman I found it very interesting to hear the legal arguments today.  I cannot agree with Deputy Harney's amendment to substitute the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; with &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;. A person can have a nervous breakdown and recover very quickly because it is not final, but while the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; does not satisfy me, it is closer to &ldquo;final&rdquo; and I would prefer if another word could be found.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>The Minister said quite clearly that the use of the words &ldquo;failure&rdquo; or &ldquo;failed&rdquo; will not require separation.  I am glad to hear that.  I would like him to be very clear about this because it is fundamental to this discussion.  I appreciate that the Minister has every intention of including in subsequent legislation periods of separation, relationships to judicial separations, separation agreements and any other kind of arrangement, <Col N="1644" /> but let us look at the amendment before us which will appear in the Constitution if it is passed by the people.</P>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister said that failure will not require separation necessarily and that he, or some other Minister, will bring in legislation subsequently. I accept that fully, but an individual could challenge that legislation and could say he is not interested in what the legislation says about separation &mdash; about five years, three years or two years separation or other conditions that he is only interested in his rights under the Constitution &mdash; that a marriage has failed and the failure has continued for a period or periods amount to at least five years. There is nothing in this about separation.</P>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Shatter said, that we have to take into account the usage of words, that the courts will refer to the normal usage of words and that they will refer to dictionaries, but there is nothing in this amendment about separation.  If there is, perhaps the Minister would tell me.  I accept entirely the Minister's intentions, but I cannot find in this amendment where the separation he keeps talking about occurs.  As far as I can see it is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; can be considered to include separation.  If that is the case, any person could have recourse to his positive rights under the Constitution &mdash; because the Minister is including here a positive right under the Constitution &mdash; and say his marriage has failed for a certain period and he can prove it.  The Minister has not defined the scale of success, or lack of success.  If that is to be left totally to the courts, the courts will have to decide on some scale. Whatever the scale is, the individual will be able to say that under the Constitution there is nothing here about separation.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about that aspect because it is very much the nub of the problem here.  The Minister and Deputy Haughey have pointed out in relation to what Deputy Shatter said that each is adding to the other.  Deputy Haughey made it very clear that each is dependent on the other. On the other hand, the first one is the <Col N="1645" /> first test.  That a marriage has failed is the first test.  If that test does not hold up, do you go any further from that test?  It seems that you do not.  If the marriage has failed, then you go on to the next test and the next test.</P>
    <P>This is fundamental to the whole question. It must be made very clear in the course of this debate what exactly the interpretation of the words that are in the Constitution will be subsequently.  If, as it seems from reading what is here &mdash; and, let me add, as I have been advised legally &mdash; it is a basic question that a marriage has failed and has failed for five years, then the bottom line is failure for five years.  That is the lowest common denominator.  That is the line that a person subsequently could have recourse to under the Constitution.  If the Minister is the person involved he would intend, or if some of his colleagues are involved they would intend, to follow up on the statement of intent and to provide other conditions.  These conditions could not override what is stated explicitly in the Constitution.  The first clear statement there is &ldquo;failed&rdquo;.  The Minister said in relation to the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo;, in trying to emphasise that this failed because it would be associated with the condition at paragraph iii, &ldquo;There is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage&rdquo;, that that would consolidate the failure, would be additional to it, that it would be an additional test in relation to the failure.  The Minister suggested that in his view that strengthened the term &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are two points in relation to that. The first is that the term &ldquo;failure&rdquo; has to be capable of standing on its own as the first test in the first instance.  Subsequent to that one is concerned with paragraph iii &ldquo;No reasonable possibility of reconciliation&rdquo;. Let us see how that will work out in practice.  In the British Act that very term &ldquo;no reasonable possibility of reconcilation&rdquo; is included.  In deciding how that will be implemented the British Act recognises the reality of that kind of terminology and of its restrictiveness or unrestrictiveness.  I take it that that is the <Col N="1646" /> point we are considering now.  Section 6 of the British Matrimonial Causes Act, 1973, states that provision shall be made by rules of court for requiring the solicitor acting for a petitioner for divorce to certify whether he has discussed with the petitioner the possibility of a reconciliation and given him the names and addresses of persons qualified to help effect a reconciliation between the parties to a marriage who have become estranged.  This is to ensure that there would be at least attempts to get reconciliation.  That boils down in practical terms to what I am told by the legal people whom I consult on these matters, that that is not a restrictive condition as the Minister suggests; it is a condition which is the normal practice in courts.</P>

      <P>We are talking about the interpretation of the words which will be in use.  The Minister made a side reference to this suggesting that it strengthens and provides an irretrievable nature to the failure.  That is the note I made on what the Minister said.  I can look at his text afterwards.  One of the problems with words of that sort is that those words would again be taken as they would be understood by a court or by a judge and that that is not the restrictive condition that the Minister suggests it is.  I listened to what Deputy Harney said about breakdown. Breakdown is no improvement on the term &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Let me point out to the House again that this amendment provides that the court can grant a dissolution of marriage in certain circumstances.  It can grant it where, and only where, condition No. 1 and condition No. 2 and condition No. 3 and condition No. 4 are complied with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is point No. 1.  It is totally unrealistic to say that these conditions bear no relationship one with the other, because they are cumulative.  They must each one and all together be satisfied. It is not enough to have any one or any two or any three.  Four conditions and the proviso must be satisfied.  Each one reinforces the other because each one is a necessary condition on its own and in relation to each one of the others.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter is the kind of person I like to have as counsel for the applicant because when he has made his case there is no point that he has left out that I would have wished to make.  Le me say that I must bow to the superior wisdom of a number of Members of this House in their descriptions of how the Constitution is interpreted by our courts.  Not being a lawyer, I take it as given that a fairly well settled principle of constitutional interpretation is that the Constitution must be read as a whole.  Not only will courts not look at a subsection of a section of an Article in isolation, they will not even look at a given Article in isolation.  Remembering debates we have had in this House and elsewhere in the last couple of years about interpretation of the Constitution, it will be seen readily that that is the case.  For that reason again it is wrong to suggest that each bit of this constitutional provision can be taken out and looked at separately in isolation from the others.  My only contention, which is a much more modest one, is that each one of these conditions must first be satisfied but that each one must be satisfied at the same time as each of the others and that, therefore, it is both the separate effects and the cumulative effects of these conditions that we must look at when we are assessing the guidelines that this constitutional provision will give not only to the Oireachtas but also to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> I wish to take up a point which Deputy Haughey made in relation to my reference to the legislation that will follow from this.  It is fair enough, up to a point, for Deputy Haughey to say that I cannot argue back from subsequent legislation and rely on the effect that that would have on the way this provision is implemented. I would not go all the way with that, but I would not go any of the way with that argument when I am speaking about the effect of divorce as provided for in the Constitution, of legislation which does not have anything to do with divorce but which governs the conditions under which judicial separations can be given. I submit that it is perfectly legitimate for me to say that the conditions under which a separation which must predate a divorce can be granted are relevant to a discussion about the provision we make for divorce.  I do not intend to follow up that argument except to make the point that, when I am talking about actions and conditions that must precede a divorce, it is legitimate to speak of them in relation to the provision that we make for divorce. Deputy Harney contends that failure implies that there was never a happy or viable relationship.  That is not so because in any field of endeavour or activity there can be failure after a period of success. I do not think one could argue that a marriage could never be a failure if it had been a success for any period.  We all know that conditions and people's views can change and that their approach to life or to their partner can change.  A number of variables can affect people's behaviour at any given time.  It is not the case that the determination that a marriage has failed necessarily requires, even philosophically, that there should never have been a period during which that marriage worked.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney made a number of criticisms regarding the use of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and then described the term as subjective and ambiguous.  It cannot be all that subjective and ambiguous if Deputy Harney can claim, for example, that it is hard on children or that it means there was never a happy relationship.  As <Col N="1649" /> I said earlier on &mdash; I do not want to labour the point &mdash; we are not talking about the subjective opinion of either or both parties to a marriage, we are requiring that a court be satisfied that there has been a failure on the basis of the evidence presented to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney would be happy to add the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; to her amendment, to her suggestion that we bring in the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;.  That brings me back to the construction of the constitutional provision.  Let us look at what happens to a case before the court.  The court will have to be satisfied that a marriage has failed, it must look at the other conditions and be satisfied that the failure has continued for a period or periods of five years.  It then must look at whether there is a possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage.  It can be satisfied that that condition is fulfilled only if, by definition, it is satisfied that there is no possibility or prospect of those people getting back together in a marital relationship that will be anything but a failure.  The only point I was concerned to make earlier on was that, whatever Deputy Harney may feel about failure as opposed to breakdown, there is no need, once the third condition is there, to be concerned about the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; being inserted because that condition describes a condition of failure which is &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Coming to Deputy Haughey's point about the separate periods, it is perfectly conceivable that people would come to the belief that their marriage has been a failure and that they would separate for a period.  As I said earlier, they might conclude after a period of separation that that separation was not doing what they expected it to do for them and might reflect and agree that they would try to get back together again to see whether a reconciliation could be brought about. If a reconciliation is effected then, by definition there has not been a failure and a court would not be so satisfied.  If, after a period of trying to see whether reconciliation was possible, they conclude that they cannot be reconciled, there has been a failure.  What has happened in the <Col N="1650" /> meantime, as far as the provisions of the constitutional amendment are concerned, is that &mdash; to use the simplest phrase &mdash; the clock has stopped as far as the length of time over which the failure has existed is concerned in the eyes of the court, although perhaps not in the view of the people concerned.  If they conclude, after a period of attempted reconciliation, that there is no point in the reconciliation, then they have concluded that there is a failure.  It is no argument to say that we should not take account of that, simply on the basis of the fact that they have again concluded that there has been a failure.  As I said earlier on and as Deputy Shatter was concerned to point out, we do not want to have a provision which in any way constitutes an obstacle to people who believe, for whatever reason, even without any foundation, that there is some hope of getting back together, which would constitute an obstacle of doing so.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Mac Giolla has left.  When he described the Judiciary he was describing himself because a number of the phrases he used suited him to a T. I am too mannerly to point out in what respects they describe him but he would qualify on each criterion on its own and on all of them together.  He wonders if the concept of failure which we have introduced here is too difficult to sell. I am paraphrasing his words but it is reasonably faithful to the sense of his question.  Perhaps it is difficult to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; and it arises from consideration of the points raised earlier on as to why we should not simply follow the course of deleting the existing provision from the Constitution <i>simpliciter.</i> I do not think that that would be desirable on constitutional grounds or acceptable, given what we know so far of the minds of the people in relation to this issue.  Since that is not the case we have to produce another provision that will replace the one in the Constitution.  The one before the House is the one we believe is most likely to be in tune with the feelings and wishes not just of the Oireachtas but of the people who will have their opportunity to pronounce on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1651" /> I am sorry, I must abjure the use of &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; and use the word &ldquo;Deputy&rdquo; when referring to Dr. Woods because the former is improper parliamentarily.  He wondered if an individual could subsequently challenge legislation that provided conditions in relation to separation because the Constitution will speak only of failure, not separation.  I invite Deputy Woods to look again at the provision. Sub-article 2º (iv) says that the court will grant dissolution of the marriage where it is satisfied that any other condition prescribed by law has been complied with.  In the statement of intent we have set out a number of such other conditions. It is not necessarily an exhaustive list, but we have set out other conditions, which include the question of separation.  It is right at this stage to speak about subsequent legislation if only for the reason that we are speaking of other conditions of law, compliance with which the court would have to look at in granting a decree of divorce.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to point out that those other conditions imposed by law could not in any way derogate from the provisions of the Constitution. They could not constitute a relaxation by comparison with what the Constitution provides.  They could only go further, could be more restrictive than what is provided for in the Constitution.  They can only add to what is in the Constitution and cannot take away from it.</P>
    <P>For the reason I have given the other fears of Deputy Woods are groundless. For example, it is not the case that an individual could come back and say that the Constitution speaks only of failure and, therefore, one may not make any conditions in regard to separation.  Sub-article 2º (iv) is specifically inserted in order to ensure that the law can provide for other conditions and that the Oireachtas, if it feels that that is the right thing to do in the future, can provide other conditions.  I am convinced that the reference by Deputy Woods to the UK legislation does not have any relevance in this connection.  What we are talking about in relation to the possibility of <Col N="1652" /> reconciliation is a condition imposed by the Constitution on which the court must be satisfied before it can grant a decree of divorce.  We are not talking about a request or a facility for a solicitor or anybody else to raise the matter of reconciliation with the parties for divorce.  We are talking about a requirement that the court be satisfied that there is no possibility of reconciliation before it can grant a decree of dissolution.  The two situations are not in any way comparable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to leave this issue until Deputy Mac Giolla, with that capacity he has to personalise these matters, asked me to explain myself in regard to the use of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;. I am very willing to do that.  I should like to explain to Deputy Mac Giolla that what we are doing here is discharging one of the most important of our duties as an Oireachtas.  The Constitution is very clear on this.  Before the Constitution can be changed by way of referendum legislation must be brought into the House to enable that change to take place.  The purpose is that that legislation will give the House the opportunity to explore every aspect of the proposed change so that going into the referendum the voters will have the benefit of having had the matter thrashed out in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>This elaborate procedure is included in the Constitution so that the Oireachtas will debate fully for the benefit and information of the people what is proposed. That is what I am doing in this regard.  I am trying to tease out, as is the Minister, for the benefit of the people the exact implications, aspects and meanings of the words we are going to ask the people to vote on.  We are asking the people to vote for or against a set of words which change the Constitution and, therefore, it is very important that they should fully understand the exact meaning of every word. It is very important that the Oireachtas should try to tease out for them in advance of their voting the meaning of every word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is a key word and it is important that we should fully understand <Col N="1653" /> exactly what it means.  I should like to give an illustration of the importance of words in the Constitution.  In this regard I disagree with Deputy Shatter.  If one looks at Part II one will see that it states, &ldquo;where, and only where, such court established under this Constitution as may be prescribed by law is satisfied ...&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; has a very important meaning in legal parlance. Sometimes in statutes the phrase, &ldquo;where the Minister is of opinion&rdquo;, is used and the other phrase used is, &ldquo;where the Minister is satisfied ...&rdquo;.  There is all the difference in the world between the two words, &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; and &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;.  If the statute uses the phrase, &ldquo;where the Minister is of the opinion&rdquo;, it is entirely within the discretion of the Minister and he does not have to justify his action to anybody but form his own opinion about the matter.  However, if the statute uses the word, &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;, the Minister has to prove and give reasons, in court or elsewhere, why he did something.  That illustration underlines and emphasises the specific importance of particular-words in this or any other constitutional or legal context.  We have in the Bill the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; and that means that the court cannot form an opinion of its own volition about the matter but will have to have before it reasons for coming to a particular conclusion.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the House to get away from the idea that we can have some sort of composite meaning or a whole lot of things coming together to give a meaning in this constitutional context. I should like to emphasise that in a Constitution every word has an importance and a significance and can be of very real operative effect.  I have had the experience of having pieces of legislation upset because of conflict with one word in the Constitution and not on the reading of the Constitution as a whole.  The more one thinks of the concept advanced by Deputy Shatter the more absurd it becomes because there are parts of the Constitution which are directives on specific issues.  They must be read by themselves.  Therefore, if the House is going to ask the people to put these words <Col N="1654" /> into the Constitution it is the duty of the House to tease out for and explain to the public exactly what the words mean.</P>
    <P>Why am I focussing on the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; and posing the question as to whether we should not insert &ldquo;completely&rdquo;, &ldquo;totally&rdquo;, or some such word before &ldquo;failed&rdquo; or &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;?  I am doing it because the Taoiseach went to great trouble to persuade the House that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; had finality. Paraphrasing what he said, he said the Government have examined this very carefully and they are satisfed that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; has the greatest degree of finality over anything else, that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; had this inherent quality of finality.  I am suggesting that it has not.  I think the Minister agrees with me now, that it has not finality.</P>
    <P>It is an important consideration.  I want to repeat my argument, because the Minister still does not understand my contention in regard to paragraph (ii) and its bearing on this matter.  I might talk on another occasion about paragraph (ii) and a period of failure of say, five, three, two years or whatever, but I am not talking about that here.  In this context I am merely directing attention to paragraph (ii) because of the bearing it has on the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  In the very instance the Minister gave he said there could be a marriage which would last three years, then would fail for a period, then would be successful again and then would fail again.  In that instance the Minister quoted the court could take the first period of failure, and add it to the second period of failure to get the requisite five years.  My argument is that, because there is an in-between period in which the marriage has been successful again, the first period of failure had not any finality about it.  Surely that is crystal clear.  If this amendment of our Constitution envisages a five year period, which consists of two separate periods of failure, not continuous, then the first period of failure was not final and could not be final if the marriage has been successful again for a period.  All I am asking is that we accept, in spite of the Taoiseach's argument, that <Col N="1655" /> the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; or &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; does not have finality.</P>
    <P>Why am I pursuing that question of whether or not any of these words we are asked to consider has this quality of finality about it?  I am doing so because surveys, opinion polls and other mechanisms have told us that, to a greater or lesser degree, there is a section of our community who would accept divorce provided a marriage has finally, irretrievably or completely broken down.  It is for the benefit of that section of the community that I want to pursue this matter.  If they were satisfied that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; did incorporate this element of finality, then, presumably, they would be satisfied.  They could say: &ldquo;Now it is in the Constitution that a marriage must have totally, finally, completely, absolutely ended, collapsed, broken down, failed before a divorce can be considered.&rdquo; It is of great importance and significance to that group of people that they know whether or not what they hope will be inserted in the Constitution means that marriage must be finally broken down or have failed before the court can consider dissolving it.  I hope that constitutes an answer on my part to Deputy Mac Giolla.  It is important that we in this House &mdash; whether or not we come to a decision on it &mdash; at least tease out for the benefit of a large section of the people who will vote in this referendum what exactly is involved in the use of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  I am suggesting that it is clear from our discussion up to this point that neither the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; nor the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; on its own means that a marriage has gone beyond repair, is irretrievable, or whatever other word one likes to use.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not being repetitive, but I want to suggest to the Minister that it is a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> for him to argue for the form of words before us on the basis of legislation he intends to introduce. I shall leave aside for the moment the fact that he might be restructured and might never have the opportunity of <Col N="1656" /> introducing the legislation he has in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not go into any contentious realms of that kind.  But it is a qualification we must have at the back of our minds, that it is the intention of this Minister &mdash; by the way it is not even this Government because I understand that some members of the Government do not go along with this &mdash; to introduce particular legislation later on that cannot be used to reinforce these words here. First, that legislation may never be passed but, even if it is, these words here will govern that legislation and not <i>vice versa.</i> As my colleague, Deputy Woods, has said, we must look at these words on their own, by themselves, as something that will be inserted into the Constitution, be there permanently as principles that will govern all subsequent legislation, not just the legislation the Minister has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore we can come to a conclusion on this matter only on the basis of what is before us here as an amendment to the Constitution.  I want to suggest that, in so far as a section of the people is concerned, this amendment, as it stands &mdash; though I do not suggest it is not capable of doing the job &mdash; does not provide for them the safeguard that divorce will be introduced only when marriages have totally and finally broken down or failed beyond recall or any possibility of recovery. Perhaps the difference between Deputy Harney and I is that she wants to substitute &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; for &ldquo;failure&rdquo;. The Minister says &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is a better word.  My difference with both of them is that neither of the two words, on its own, meets the wishes of a large section of the people that I think both the Minister and Deputy Harney wish to meet, namely, people who would be more inclined to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum if they knew that enshrined forever in our Constitution was the provision that divorce would be granted only when marriages have totally and finally broken down.  That is my reason for spending so much time on this word.  I think Deputy <Col N="1657" /> Harney's amendment has directed our attention to the fundamental importance of this matter.  I am not arguing for one word versus the other.  I am arguing that, whichever is to be used should carry an added qualification which would give it that finality the Taoiseach claims it has already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Haughey that it is essential the people know that the amendment of the Constitution being proposed limits the possibility of divorce to circumstances in which a marriage is clearly at an end, dead, completely and utterly beyond recovery. I am satisfied that the Article does do that.</P>
      <P>I would agree with Deputy Haughey also that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; does not, of itself, mean the complete, utter and unavoidable finality.  In my opinion the Article recognises that fact, I do not think there need be, or that it is appropriate that there should be controversy here about that, for this reason.  If the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; meant a complete final and utter breakdown, that a marriage was completely dead, then there would be no necessity at all for subparagraph (iii), that that would be complete surplusage.  If &ldquo;failure&rdquo; meant that a marriage was irrecoverable or irretrieveable there would be no need for and one would not insert paragraph (iii).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that paragraph iii is put in at all implies clearly that it could be that a marriage will have had a long history of failure, resuscitation and again failure, but at a particular time the situation crystallises and the court find the marriage in a position of failure, be it subjective or objective.  Having heard the evidence, the judge comes to the conclusion that the marriage at that particular point is in a state of failure.  I accept, that being so, that there is always the possibility of resuscitation if that is all one could say about the marriage.  It would not be sufficient &mdash; and I would not support it &mdash; if the state of failure were all that was necessary.  There is more to it than that. The judge is obliged to ask, the marriage <Col N="1658" /> having failed, if perhaps there is a possibility of resuscitation and reconstitution of the marriage.  He has to ask further if there is a reasonable possibility of resuscitation. In many cases the judge could come to the conclusion that the marriage had failed but that there was a reasonable possibility of reconciliation and therefore that it was not open to him to grant a divorce because he was not satisfied that there was no possibly of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>It is implicit in the wording of the Article that there is no finality about the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  That follows, because if one had come to a different conclusion one would not have added paragraph iii.  It would be like saying that something was completely dead and buried but yet there is talk about bringing it back to life again. It is not sufficient for an applicant for a divorce to do no more than satisfy that court that the marriage has failed at that time.  He or she has to prove that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation arising at some future time.  That is a pretty heavy burden of truth.  It could well be argued that paragraph iii is too restrictive in its wording, that the phrase &ldquo;any possibility of conciliation&rdquo;, or other phrase could be used instead.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; suggested by Deputy Harney is weaker than the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; would have to be there as the absolute minimum.  I do not think that there is a great deal to choose between &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; so far as paragraph i is concerned, but one cannot dissociate that and look at it in isolation from paragraph iii, on which the court also has to be satisfied.  It was never intended that the mere fact that the marriage had at that time failed ended the matter.  Quite clearly it does not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an excessively crude interpretation of what I said.  It is not a hold all or catch all phrase.  It is there <Col N="1659" /> in prudence, to allow the Oireachtas, if they believe that there is a reason for so doing, to add additional conditions in the future.  That is a little different from a catch all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was putting forward as a security, if you like, on the other three tests this fourth condition, provided that any other condition prescribed by law has been complied with.  He raised this point in the context of concerns about the question of separation and whether there needs to be any period of separation at all, as I understood it.  It is clear that it certainly does not require a further constitutional referendum to lower the separation period already intended.  I accepted that the Minister's intention is five years, but that intention can be changed without any subsequent constitutional referendum.  I mention that as something which has been raised outside in the media.  It is quite possible that no separation period could be built in subsequently.  That would depend on the decisions made by the Minister or by his successor, whoever that might be, in the light of time.  In that event the term &ldquo;failure&rdquo; would stand very clearly on its own, notwithstanding the Minister's suggestion with regard to paragraph iv.</P>
      <P>If one spouse considers that the marriage has failed, in those circumstances has the marriage failed?  If I remember correctly, on Second Stage Deputy Shatter gave as his view that it would have, but that the applicant for the divorce must go to some proofs.  We have difficulty at this stage in knowing exactly what proofs of failure might in practice be necessary.  If one spouse considers that the marriage has failed, will it then be possible for him or her to obtain a divorce on a unilateral basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to collusion or agreement between the two spouses that the marriage has failed, will anybody be able to say in those circumstances that it has not? Does that not leave the children of the marriage in a vulnerable position, because of what I would regard as the unrestricted nature of the term &ldquo;failure&rdquo;? <Col N="1660" /> The Minister has said, with regard to paragraph iv regarding any other condition prescribed by law, that one could not derogate what was in the Constitution.  I would agree entirely with him on that; there is no question about it.  What would be in the Constitution would be that a marriage has failed and that that failure has continued for a period of, or periods amounting to five years.  I do not think one could supersede it either.</P>
    <P>In other words, one could not introduce a condition under iv which would supersede the term &ldquo;a marriage has failed&rdquo; and the definition or the understanding or the resolution in practice of &ldquo;failed&rdquo; because it would be a matter for the courts to determine what &ldquo;failed&rdquo; is. While on the one hand the Minister says one could not derogate from what is there &mdash; and I agree entirely with that &mdash; as I understand it one could not supersede what is there either because what is explicitly stated in the Constitution would take precedence and anything which would come within iv would have to be by way of a further definition or supplement to what was there.  We are considering the question on which the whole section seems to be founded, that is, the understanding of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister said earlier that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is supported by there being no possibility of reconciliation.  I genuinely fear, as the experience in other jurisdiction shows, that the term of &ldquo;no possibility of reconciliation&rdquo; in practice is not found to mean what the Minister is suggesting. In practice it does not have the force or the degree of restriction which the Minister is suggesting.  For example, does the possibility of reconciliation not depend on the willingness of both parties to attempt or consider reconciliation?  In those circumstances, if one party has set his or her mind against reconciliation or is even considering it, is there any useful function that the court could perform? What function has the court if one party says &ldquo;I am not interested in reconciliation. The marriage has failed&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>In trying to see how those things might be applied in practice I looked at the British situation and I found that it <Col N="1661" /> becomes an empty formula of words.  It is simply applied by somebody asking the parties to a marriage if there is any chance of a reconciliation.  The court would check from a solicitor if that was done. In saying this, I am suggesting to the Minister that that formula of words, in addition to the initial paragraph i., which says that &ldquo;a marriage has failed&rdquo;, does not give the degree of strength or force in practice which the Minister accords to it or seems to expect that it will give.  If that is the case, one goes back to the basic meaning of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and what the understanding of the court will be in relation to its meaning.</P>
    <P>That is the difficulty I see in relation to this section, the question of no possibility of reconciliation.  As a matter of interest, I was talking to some social workers over the weekend and their view was that, once the first solicitor's letter arrives, there is almost no possibility of reconciliation after that, or it makes reconciliation very difficult.  Each profession will have its own view and its own approach.  I appreciate the Minister's intention, as I would agree with the intentions on all sides of the House, in wanting to see every effort at reconciliation through mediation.  Family courts would support that approach totally.  There is no question about that from our point of view. Nevertheless, when one comes down to where reconciliation will apply and what force and value it will have in relation to a situation where a couple are already before the court, the indications are that the additional term which is given in iii of &ldquo;no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage&rdquo; will not in practice strengthen paragraph i which is failure.  If the Minister thinks that that is the equivalent of stating that there will be an irretrievable situation, and the Minister has said very clearly that he sees that as providing the irretrievable element in relation to the failure, the practice will show &mdash; I am quite certain from the lawyers I spoke to, who regard these words as not performing the function that the Minister has in mind &mdash; that it does not support the word <Col N="1662" />&ldquo;failure&rdquo; or strengthen it to any real extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say I agree very much with Deputy Haughey about what the function of the Oireachtas is in analysing a proposal of this nature very carefully.  Some of the comparisons and some of the history that he gave us of other clauses that fell to be examined were very helpful.  It that is so, it is incumbent on those who contribute to a discussion like this that they do not oversell their own cases.  I have to say that some of those who have contributed have been guilty of that, some in a relatively minor way &mdash; I mention here Deputy Harney &mdash; and others in a much more serious way, I think here of Deputy Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understood Deputy Harney in arguing for &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; and against &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, she suggested some time ago that failure would have some element of fault-finding and that it would have some element of stigmatising.  She suggested that such a course, were it to be the case, would be in contrast with what was the unanimous wish of the all-party Oireachtas committee that were there to be a divorce jurisdiction it should not be based on fault.  I have to say that that argument is an unhelpful one and one without any substance.  There is the world of difference between the extent to which the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is used here and that which caused concern to the all-party committee.  I was not a member of that committee, a number of people in the House were; but, as I understand it, the all-party committee were faced with a situation where they said that, if there was to be a divorce jurisdiction, there were two extremes in which that jurisdiction could be placed.  One was on the basis of a fault-based divorce.  Along that road was the boom for the private detectives in Bray or Greystones or wherever was going to take over from the Brightons of earlier decades.  The other, which was regarded as being the much more satisfactory approach, was based on irretrievable breakdown.  There is no departure <Col N="1663" /> from that commitment in the use of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; in this clause.</P>
    <P>More serious is the approach taken by Deputy Woods, which is the one more seriously flawed.  I have to say at times he has completely misunderstood what this is all about.  Nowhere was that misunderstanding more clearly exposed than when he dealt with the relationship of this Article to be inserted in the Constitution with the people's assent and any legislation which might follow.  He said he accepted the Minister for Justice's comments that any legislation could not derogate what was in the Constitution.  We all agree with that, but he said that neither could the new legislation supersede. I cannot see how that argument can be made by one who stops for a moment and reads because the judge, in considering whether or not to grant the decree of divorce, is required to address himself, in effect, to five tests: the test of failure or non-failure, the test of duration of failure, the test of reconciliation, the proviso dealing with the way in which provision has been made for spouse and children and also whether or not other additional requirements prescribed by law have been fulfilled.  It is quite clear that this Article states that it is not open to the Oireachtas or to any court in granting a dissolution to apply tests less restrictive than those contemplated but it is open to the Oireachtas and the courts to apply standards more restrictive in a number of respects.</P>
    <P>With regard to the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, which has caused some difficulties, I reached the same conclusion as that reached by Deputy Taylor but by somewhat different reasoning.  Let us consider, first of all, in what circumstances this test is to be applied.  The test is to be applied on the basis of the judge asking himself as a first question: has this marriage failed?  That question can only be answered on the basis of, has this marriage failed, broken apart for all time and all the other synonyms offered by Deputy Haughey.  If the judge in considering the evidence felt that this marriage is now in difficulty and the parties are apart but <Col N="1664" /> that those difficulties may not last and there is a possibility of them coming together again, he could not answer the question that the marriage has failed in the affirmative.  That would be the case if that were the only condition that applied.  It does not stand alone.  We are not dealing with, as Deputy Haughey said, this word or the alternative words on their own.  We are dealing with a judge applying five separate cumulative tests. In this case, before he can pronounce a decree of divorce he must be satisfied that the marriage has failed.  I do not believe that anybody could be satisfied that a marriage has failed if in his own mind he was left in doubt as to whether or not there was the possibility of the parties coming together again.  It is further made certain by the fact that he has to specifically say: is there any reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties concerned?  What is involved there is a double barring of the safety gate.  That is an entirely appropriate approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods suggested that paragraph (iii) is of little substance.  He compared it with the position in England and suggested that an analogy is to be drawn.  That proposition is so extraordinary that it cannot be made in good faith. Let us consider what is involved in the two jurisdictions.  In this jurisdiction there is an obligation on the court to be satisfied.  Deputy Haughey, in his historical parallels earlier, very helpfully pointed out to us just how onerous is that obligation to be satisfied as distinct from being of opinion or any of the other requirements that are sometimes put on courts or statutory bodies.  In this instance it is a question of the court addressing itself to the opinion, not being inclined to think but being satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation. In contrast, what is at issue in Britain is that the legal advisers get formal proof from the applicants.  The contrast is between, on the one hand, a rule of procedure and, on the other hand, a solemn constitutional obligation that rests on the court, and not on the lawyers, the parties or anyone else, to be satisfied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> Deputy Woods asked what would happen if one party is satisfied that the marriage has failed and the other is not. This is not for the parties to address.  It is not a question of what their subjective opinions are, however well intentioned, carefully considered or well founded, as to the prospects of a reconciliation.  It is a matter for the court to address and to be satisfied with.  Only if they are satisfied should they pronounce a decree of divorce.  In those circumstances the Article achieves admirably the objective which it set itself, which was to respond to the very substantial section of public opinion that Deputy Haughey spoke about who would be happy to see divorce jurisdiction available but only on the basis of very limited circumstances.  That has been achieved by this Article.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion which is taking place is a very valuable and useful one in trying to tease out these difficulties. It underlines, for me at least, the problem that our Constitution poses because of the detailed nature of it and because of the fact that we have to write into it so many detailed provisions by contrast with some other written Constitutions which confine themselves to general statements of principle and allow all the detail to be worked out in legislation. For better or for worse we have an extremely detailed Constitution.  One of the consequences of it is that when a change of this kind is being made it must not only be a repeal of the provision which is proposed but also its replacement by something fairly detailed.  When we get into that sphere of detail we get into the sort of difficulties in which the House now finds itself but not in any acrimonious form.  There is concern on all sides of the House about the meaning and significance of various words.  Even if the amendment in Deputy Harney's name is not drafted in precisely the way it should be, the idea put forward in her amendment is one which is superior to the wording which exists in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this section.  As she said, the whole concept of failure, however it is defined, is a more subjective concept <Col N="1666" /> and more difficult for a judge to be satisfied about than the concept of irretrievable breakdown.</P>
      <P>Perhaps on Report Stage we should consider putting down an amendment, if this amendment is not carried, to make paragraph (i) read, &ldquo;a marriage has irretrievably broken down&rdquo;.  If I heard him correctly, Deputy Haughey felt that the wording might be something on the lines of, totally and finally broken down. The difference between that and irretrievably broken down must be minor.  I would not mind seeing all the words inserted if it helped to get more general agreement in relation to this.</P>
      <P>In the discussions which took place before this Bill was published most people were agreed that irretrievable breakdown should be the basis on which divorce would be introduced and that it should be irretrievable breakdown for a specified period of years.  Some people thought it should be two or three years and others thought it should be a longer period.  The Government finally decided on five years.  I think it may be a little on the long side but I am quite happy to go along with that aspect of it.  When we were talking about irretrievable breakdown for five years we had in mind that it was something objective, something with which one could identify, something that one could see.  How can one describe failure for a period such as that, where the whole concept is so much more subjective and where what may be failure to one judge is not failure to another judge? Their idea of failure is different from that of their colleagues.  Until we saw the words we did not see any difficulty in this. Now that we have been able to consider them we see much difficulty.  This amendment would minimise it because it would introduce a greater degree of objectivity. I am aware of marriages where the parties have not spoken to one another for more than 15 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to formulate and publish a policy for Irish deep sea shipping and to declare its determination to maintain in Irish hands, adequate ferry services to the UK and mainland Europe.</P>
      <P>I do so because I see the results of the inertia on the part of the Government in the whole business of shipping.  The motion calls the attention of the House to that inertia and we hope that perhaps it will spur the Government into some kind of action to help to remedy the serious situation that has arisen in regard to Irish shipping.  I will first of all comment on the amendment put down in the name of the Minister for Communications:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann notes that the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements set up by the Minister for Communications, were published in the Green Paper on Transport Policy and that the Committee's report is at present being considered by the Government; and also takes note of the substantial financial support for the B &amp; I Company recently approved by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will come back to &ldquo;the substantial financial support&rdquo; for the B &amp; I Company as <Col N="1668" /> incorporated in a Bill which is the oddest I have seen since I became spokesman for Transport.  I do not know whether that Bill has been examined in detail by commentators.  I cannot understand it.  It is connected with a shipping company but is substantively concerned with the Department of the Public Service and not the Department of Communications.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister for Communications and asked him for a copy of the report of the committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements and I was told that it was not available to me and could not be made available to me.  There is reference in the Minister's amendment to parts of the report being published in the Green Paper on Transport Policy.  If that is so, why is the report not available to the House?  The committee is a committee of the Department of Communications and its report should be available to those Members of the House who are trying to urge the Government to develop a policy in regard to shipping.  It is an appropriate time for decisions to be taken by the Government on the development of shipping &mdash; they should be searching for areas for investment.</P>
    <P>We need a development policy in the Irish shipping area &mdash; I spell &ldquo;shipping&rdquo; with a small &ldquo;s&rdquo; because I will be referring to Irish Shipping and to other lines including the B &amp; I.  It is appropriate to ask the Minister, now that unemployment has reached such a high level, that the morale of the country is exceptionally low, that young people, including those highly qualified in the science of marine engineering, are emigrating apace to Britain and the US, often illegally, and to the continent, to take cognisance of the fact that ships are available at rock bottom prices at present for anyone here who wants to develop a shipping company.</P>
    <P>The cost of oil, according to this week's <i>The Economist,</i> is $13.60 for North Sea Brit.  That is a 49.3 per cent drop on the price 12 months ago.  I am painting a picture of this area to encourage the Government to develop a shipping policy and to come down hard in favour of a deep sea fleet of modest size, and other <Col N="1669" /> developments in relation to shipping. Such developments might help in a very important area where morale is very low, where we have many people unemployed and where large sums are being paid in unemployment assistance and benefit to people with high qualifications.  We have highly trained sailors but we are not doing anything about them.</P>
    <P>This is a sorry tale.  I do not want to go into it in detail.  However, we want to castigate the Government &mdash; we have done it over and over again &mdash; about the treatment of Irish Shipping workers and the way the Government have washed their hands of responsibility for them.  It is very difficult to get hard figures but we are told the <i>Irish Spruce</i> could be purchased for £7 million.  That is the market value.  Yet, figures up to and even more than £100 million are mentioned as the cost of liquidating Irish Shipping. That is crazy economics.  It is Stone Age economics in anyone's language, to do something that will cost so much and end up having nothing at all.  There are aspects of this matter that are so crazy the House could not understand them. For instance, why is there an Indian crew on the <i>Irish Spruce</i> while fully qualified Irish Shipping personnel are walking around drawing unemployment benefit in Dublin, Cork, Galway or elsewhere?</P>
    <P>I call attention to this craziness because on occasion, for example with regard to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and Irish Steel, the Government have gone over the top in order to buttress up those companies.  It is a <i>tu quoque</i> kind of argument. The fact is that the former workers of Irish Shipping are asking those questions. They are quite understandable questions and the Government should answer them.  They could save the whole situation if they had a positive development policy for Irish Shipping.  The people who were caught in that trap picket Dáil Éireann every Wednesday.  It is an orderly picket and the people have well reasoned arguments.  They are temperate people and, above all, they are persistent.  They will keep at it until they see that justice is done in their case.</P>
    <P>This saga, this tragedy, has continued <Col N="1670" /> since 1984.  I quote from an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> by Tom Reddy entitled &ldquo;Scuttling of Irish Shipping proves very expensive&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>...It has now been estimated that the total bill for liquidating the shipping line will top £170 million.  The liquidation may take over five years to complete.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister said £50 million but even that is the price of seven vessels such as the <i>Irish Spruce.</i> I am not saying we have to invest in vessels that size in a new deep sea fleet.  We could invest in smaller vessels and I note there was a recommendation to that effect in the Green Paper.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>...The obvious question that the Minister and his advisers now have to ask themselves is, would it have been cheaper to keep the fleet afloat?  The answer appears that it would have been and, despite the huge subsidy, the State would have a creditable asset in a large and modern shipping fleet.</P>
    <P>If the process now in train continues, we will have nothing at the end for all the expense.  The taxpayer is also footing the other bill, namely, the social welfare payments for more than 250 people.  I do not have to continue about Irish Shipping because the details have been spelled out here time and again.  However, I thought it better to recall some of the scandalous facts with regard to Irish Shipping in the context of this motion.</P>
    <P>In other places, and even in this House, I have indicated what other countries roughly the same size or even smaller than Ireland have been doing with regard to the provision of deep sea fleets.  At random I give deadweight tonnage for the following countries: the figure for Belgium is 3,890.4; Denmark which is territorially smaller than Ireland has a tonnage of 7,973.4; Finland, which is tightly packed in by seas to the north and to the south west has 3,209.2; Iceland, with a very small population, has 165.9 and Ireland has 270.5.  Norway has a huge fleet and even Switzerland has a larger fleet even though it has no harbours.  We <Col N="1671" /> should have a fleet and we should start to establish that now no matter on how small a scale.</P>
    <P>I reject the idea that Fianna Fáil, in or out of Government, have been or would be irresponsible with regard to State investment.  The Minister, Deputy Mitchell, has so indicated as far as Irish Shipping are concerned.  There is a tendency to spread this kind of propaganda.  The propagandists of the Government, and Fine Gael in particular, wish to get the idea abroad that we were irresponsible and would be again.  After a recent comment of mine on the whole shipping area, the Minister jocosely asked me in the House what would be the cost of my suggestion and I reported that it would be £7 million in that instance while he was spending up to and in excess of £100 million with nothing to show at the end.</P>
    <P>I wish to know from the Minister when he is replying what are the Government doing with regard to a deep sea fleet. What proposals are with the Government and at what stage are such proposals? Has the Minister presented them to the Cabinet and are they under consideration there?  Have there been any decisions, either positive or negative, with regard to a deep sea fleet?  Is a policy objective being pursued by the Department and, if so, what is it?  Are we talking about a State company or about something else? What consideration has been given to the co-operative proposal from management that was sent to the Department by some of the former employees of Irish Shipping? Have there been any consultations with private shipping interests about a deep sea fleet?  Has a full private venture been discussed with anybody in the shipping world?  Has a joint venture been discussed?  I should like to know if there is any kind of incubus on the Government's conscience with regard to the workers or have they written them off?</P>
    <P>The House knows that Fianna Fáil have decided there will be a deep sea Irish fleet.  We envisage a fleet that will be small to start and, as is the natural evolution, that it will grow as success <Col N="1672" /> demands.  We are totally open to suggestions. We have no ideological hang up about the type of company.  It may be a totally State-owned company such as B &amp; I or a private company.  It would be necessary to encourage people in that regard.  It could be a semi-State company or a joint venture of the private sector and the State.</P>
    <P>I made the point earlier that this is a good time to buy ships.  I have had some consultations with experts in the private field who indicate that possibly there will be further shrinking until about November of this year.  That is guesswork and it is hazardous but at present there is value for money in the shipping market. Fuel costs have dropped by over 49 per cent according to today's quotation in <i>The Economist.</i> Perhaps there is some little reservoir of goodwill left for the Irish flag and for the tradition which Irish Shipping had established.  The House would generally agree that the tradition established over almost 50 years was admirable and that the flag and the crews were well received and well thought of throughout the world.  That goodwill has to a certain extent been dissipated by ships being arrested in foreign ports.  We have always contended that it would not have been necessary if the matter had been better handled by the Minister and if he had acted according to the advice of the board of Irish Shipping Limited.  I was listening on my car radio a few days ago to Dr. John de Courcy Ireland, the great marine historian of this country, regretting that this whole matter had been badly handled.</P>
    <P>I am asking now whether anything is being done.  Is there any move?  Is there total lethargy and inertia in the Department?  Is there any positive thinking with regard to this matter?  Will the Minister publish any policy with regard to a deep sea fleet?</P>
    <P>We regard the maintenance of the Irish Continental Line in Irish ownership, either State or private, as being of special importance.  That line has been successful and it is fitting in the context of our membership of the EC that we should have a direct link like that, dependent on <Col N="1673" /> nobody, with the Continent.  It has been a financial success, despite modest hiccups, and a success in showing our flag.  It is important to concentrate on service on ICL ferries and it will become increasingly so as competition sharpens.  There must be continuous service and the management should write that in their diaries each morning and see that that attitude goes down the line to the people dealing with the public.</P>
    <P>What is being done about ICL?  There are all kinds of rumours about difficulties and I will refer to two of them in a moment.  Brittany Ferries are operating successfully from Cork to Roscoff.  They are doing that not just to exercise their engines but to develop business and make a profit.  It Brittany Ferries can do it, we should be able to do it with our own company, whether it is public or private or half and half.  There are predators ready to take any company that they can utilise to make a profit and nobody will criticise them for that.  We do not want to lose more jobs.  We do not want frustrated young people who have studied and trained for this career and find they have nowhere to go.  I want to stress the importance of service and courtesy and intensive training in that regard.</P>
    <P>Is there an Irish customer at present for that company?  Would the Minister spell out to the House what the commitments of the purchaser would be as of now?  There has been a report that the complicated tax partnerships have turned buyers away from ICL, that a consortium of investors own ICL and have leased it back to ICL, that there was a guarantee of tax breaks and that the company that would purchase now would have to assume responsibility for those tax breaks.  Is this true?  The House should know it.  If people can speculate about it, the Minister is the person who can say definitely whether it is true or not.</P>
    <P>Another complication has been reported in regard to the pension scheme. The sad conclusion has been canvassed that a guarantee of the pensions for ICL employees will cause a deterioration in the position of the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited.  This is the place <Col N="1674" /> for the Minister to make quite clear the position with regard to the sale of ICL, his plans for maintaining it under the Irish flag, the difficulties, whether he thinks they are superable and what action is being taken in this regard.</P>
    <P>I turn now to B &amp; I.  This House was saddened when the very expensive Zeus consultants and a chairman were appointed to B &amp; I at a time when the then chairman and his board had plans for bringing the company into profit.  A good deal has happened since then and I will not go back into the detail.  I questioned the wisdom of that at the time, particularly in regard to the heavy expense.  We will have to posit what has happened and take it as given.  We must decry a loss of jobs as a result of the new arrangement.  I commend the fact that the management have been strengthened and have committed themselves to tightening up the company and making it efficient and profitable.  This could have been done, in some instances at least, without the loss of jobs, which has been sustained.</P>
    <P>I do not at all agree with the arrangement with regard to the southern corridor.  It was said that if there was competition between the B &amp; I and the new owner of Sealink on the Rosslare to either Fishguard or Pembroke run that B &amp; I would lose out.  I cannot see how it should be immediately taken for granted that B &amp; I would be the loser.  When I visited that area it was the other company that was worried about the competition. When we were studying that problem there was some evidence at the time that lack of capacity caused a loss of custom and that if the B &amp; I had a larger ship on the route they would have been able to cater for far more business than they actually did.  Now we have an agreement about sharing the route and this has been criticised by me and by others as being a very dangerous arrangement as far as the consumer is concerned.  There is no competition now and a quite and cosy arrangement between B &amp; I and Sealink can militate against the rights and advantages of the consumer.</P>
    <P>This House should tease out the implications <Col N="1675" /> of the arrangement that has been made.  I criticised the arrangements before this at the Chartered Institute of Transport weekend and in the House.  I see that the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, quite recently echoed my sentiments with regard to that arrangement.  He was taken to task by the Taoiseach about it and about Aer Lingus.  We are not dealing with Aer Lingus at the moment; but, as far as I am concerned, having read about the arrangement and having read the consumer commentary on the matter, I am on the side of the Minister and not of the Taoiseach in this regard.</P>
    <P>I want to comment also on the duty free shops and the shops generally.  That will be a joint effort on the southern corridor in a jumbo ferry boat when the arrangements are finalised.  I am very afraid that Irish drinks and Irish goods will not get a fair crack of the whip unless management in B &amp; I is much more alert than they are with regard to the Sealink boats now plying between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead.  I made a personal listing at the end of January/beginning of February of what was advertised on board a Sealink vessel sailing between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead.  About nine spirits were advertised for sale on the walls in the boat and not a single Irish product was mentioned among them.  Admittedly, Irish whiskey and so on was available in the duty free shop, but there was no plugging of it.  I can see that that was probably appropriate when Sealink was a British-owned company.  But it is now privately owned by an American, Sherwood, and we should make a pitch to have at least equal commercial exposure on these routes when we are supposed to be in a type of partnership with Sealink.  I know that jewellery was available on that ship and not a single piece of it was manufactured in Ireland.  Yet everybody knows that that is an area of our artistic life that has flourished in recent years, with expert people in silver and gold and other precious stones of whom I could mention half a dozen by name, and they should be able to get a presence on those ships.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> I mentioned also that the Channel Tunnel is going to act as a lodestone and pull traffic towards the southern part of Britain and therefore the Rosslare/Fishguard run will be exceptionally important.  I am sorry to say that we are not going to own half the ship, which will be wholly owned by the partner, but we will still be paying for Pembroke and we should keep an open mind on it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Bill mentioned in the amendment that the Minister put down to my motion, I would point out that it looks better than it actually is.  There is provision in the Bill for £38 million of equity.  The main body of the Bill is concerned with industrial relations, and this is alarming.  I do not want to waste time reading the Bill but it claims for the Minister the right to settle industrial relations. In other words, the board of B &amp; I would no longer be responsible, as a normal board is, with regard to remuneration for their staff.  But the right is being reserved to the Minister for Communications. The implications of this are horrendous as far as industrial relations are concerned and when that Bill comes before the House we will be able to deal with it more fully.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire is a total investment by Ireland.  There is no other investment there and we owe it to our taxpayers to see to it that companies that use Dún Laoghaire appreciate it and pay for the services, and we should see that the services provided there are properly reciprocated at Holyhead and other places.</P>
    <P>I would like to know also what the position is with regard to Belfast Ferries. Fianna Fáil were very keen on this out-of-Belfast service as we were about to provide a subsidised airlink with Derry city.  So I would like to know what is the present position.  What is the present financial position with regard to the B &amp; I?  Is it in profit in 1986 or is it making a loss?  I am subject to correction but, as far as I know, the annual reports for 1984 and 1985 have not been published yet. Can the Minister tell the House if B &amp; I, under the new arrangement, is profitable?</P>
    <P>I want to know also about the new <Col N="1677" /> scenario with regard to the ferries.  I understand that the <i>Leinster</i> was put in for refurbishment and fitting out.  Was this a success?  Is there any truth in the rumour that the company that did the job did not trust the Irish Government and held the ship?  This is the kind of thing that follows what happened with regard to Irish Shipping.  This lack of trust can only be damaging.  Where is the <i>Inishfallen?</i> There are two ships operating on the Rosslare/Fishguard run pending the availability of the jumbo boat.</P>
    <P>I would like to know about Pembroke. Is Pembroke going to be used at all by any facility in this country, because we will still have to continue to pay an annual substantial sum to Pembroke despite the fact that we will not be using it?  Unfortunately, Bell's company has gone &mdash; the Dutch have purchased it.  But perhaps the Government could approach other companies and tell them there is a facility there for which the Irish Government are paying and that if they could use it the country would be saving some of its loss.</P>
    <P>I have not time to go into the whole question of B &amp; I freight.  There was at one time a report that the B &amp; I was terminating the freight part of its business. I would like the Minister to tell me what the position is.</P>
    <P>The chief purpose of this motion is to act as a stimulus, a goad to activity, because there is no activity with regard to shipping as of now.  The fact is there is serious turmoil in the shipping world.  In north-east England a shipbuilding company is laying off thousands of workers as reported in this week's copy of the <i>Economist.</i> This is an indication of the kind of chaos that exists but that is no excuse for the lack of activity.</P>
    <P>The <i>Eithne</i> was commissioned by an Irish Government and in design it has been so successful that other Governments are going to pay £1 million per ship for using that design.  In my view that ship should have been built in an Irish yard and consequently the total moneys would have accrued to an Irish company, giving jobs to Irish workers to the benefit of the national economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements set up by the Minister for Communications, were published in the Green Paper on Transport Policy and that the Committee's report is at present being considered by the Government; and also takes note of the substantial financial support for the B &amp; I Company recently approved by the Government.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The origins of the present public debate on the issue of strategic shipping capacity lie, of course, in the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited.  The Minister for Communications has set out in this House on a number of occasions the circumstances which led up to that event and I do not intend to go over that ground again in any great detail.  I do think, however, that it is worth emphasising once again that much as the Government regretted the collapse of Irish Shipping Limited and the ensuing hardship to the company's employees, the Government had no choice but to allow the liquidation to proceed since the total cost to the Exchequer of keeping Irish Shipping Limited going up to the end of 1989 would have been about £144.5 million.  Moreover, even if the Exchequer had met this enormous bill, the company would still have had debts of £59 million at the end of that period with little grounds for expecting that it could service them from their own resources.  It would have been socially and economically indefensible for the Government to have kept Irish Shipping Limited in operation at such a cost.  Events since November 1984 have vindicated the Government's position. Freight rates have fallen still further and the overall cost of keeping the company going is now estimated to be of the order of £220 million</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> Irish Shipping Limited, over the years provided the necessary national strategic tonnage and, in the context of a general review of shipping policy undertaken in the preparation of the Green Paper on Transport Policy, the Minister decided that the time was ripe for a thorough reassessment of the country's strategic shipping needs.  It had after all been over 20 years since the strategic deep sea tonnage requirements of the country were last reviewed and more than 40 years since the most fundamental question, that is the necessity to maintain a strategic deep sea fleet, was addressed.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful to the debate if I were at this stage to say a few words about the present state of the world shipping industry.  Shipping everywhere is still reeling from the worst depression for 50 years.  Freight rates remain low and the industry is still bedevilled by a chronic imbalance of supply over demand.  The past three years have seen heavy losses by shipowners, bankruptcies of shipping companies, debt rescheduling, deferred delivery of new vessels and more and more vessels being laid up.  Anyone who had occasion to fly into or out of Athens and to view all the shipping tonnage laid up there will have an idea of what the problems are as regards shipping at this time.</P>
    <P>The worldwide picture is of an industry realigning itself and in the process taking a long hard look at its own position in the context of the enormous long term changes that are taking place in world trade.  Between 1984 and 1985 the world fleet of ships over 100 gross registered tonnes was reduced by 2.4 million gross registered tonnes from 418.7 million gross registered tonnes to 416.3 million gross registered tonnes.  The contraction is a welcome one, but nevertheless is relatively insignificant compared with the rapid annual increases in tonnage recorded during the seventies.</P>
    <P>The influx of new ships on the market, stimulated by State grants and subsidies aimed at maintaining shipyard employment rather than meeting any need as far as shipping is concerned, has not yet <Col N="1680" /> ceased.  The world order book for bulk carriers at the end of 1985 still amounted to over 20 million deadweight tonnes, 16 million of them for delivery during 1986, and there is little hope of this being matched by an improvement in demand, quite the contrary, as we have seen so far.  There is still a substantial surplus of capacity in the dry bulk carrier and tanker sectors.  In mid-1985, the surplus of the dry bulk carrier sector amounted to about 29 per cent of demand, 50 million deadweight tonnes and in the tanker sector to about 59 per cent of demand, 101 million deadweight tonnes.</P>
    <P>Ireland, of course is not alone in having problems to face and decisions to make regarding its merchant fleet.  Within the overall picture of surplus capacity the European Community's share of world tonnage has declined since the beginning of the decade.  Within the Community many member states have experienced a decline in fleet size, drastic in some cases. Member states generally are now engaged in internal reviews of their shipping policies.  And most importantly, a Community policy on maritime transport is on the way at last.  As Deputy Wilson will know, an extremely difficult and complex task still has not been completed but it is on the way at last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said about shipping in the Community since the Treaty of Rome came into force, but little of any practical value was done until recent years.  Since 1973 we have, of course, seen the major European shipping nations brought into the Community and this has made shipping an even more important part of the Community's own transport system.  At the present time about 90 per cent of the Community's external trade, and about 25 per cent of internal trade, is seaborne and, in terms of fleet ownership and influence the Community is a formidable force in world shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there had been earlier steps towards shaping the Community's external <Col N="1681" /> relations in shipping matters, 1985 was distinguished as the year when a blueprint for a European shipping policy finally emerged.  It was not before time, as the problems affecting international and Community shipping had become acute.  This development was necessary in order to put the Community in a good bargaining position as far as shipping is concerned.  The Commission Memorandum on Maritime Policy is perhaps one of the most significant documents that body has ever produced.  The Minister has welcomed at Council the Commission document both for its useful analysis of the problems facing the industry and for its proposals for tackling those problems and promoting the wellbeing of the Community's shipping industry.  We fully support the view that a non-protectionist shipping policy is in the best interests of Community shipowners and shippers alike, but I recognise as well that Community action is the best way of countering the growth of protectionism by other countries and those trends which militate against the very principles of free competition which we espouse.</P>
    <P>The Commission's memorandum on maritime transport policy was forwarded to the council on 19 March 1985.  In reviewing the fortunes of the European shipping industry over the past ten years the Commission ascribed its relative decline to the loss of comparative advantage, the development of other countries' fleets &mdash; sometimes of substandard safety levels and often with the aid of protectionist policies &mdash; and in addition to these factors the overall recession in international trade.  In the Commission's view, the most pressing problem for the European industry was the increasing use of cargo reservation and rate undercutting by State-trading and developing countries.</P>
    <P>The most obvious cases of protectionism are in the liner sector where the Commission noted a trend towards cargo reservation by developing countries.  It indicated its concern to prevent any increase in bilateral agreements between Community member states and developing State trading countries which restrict <Col N="1682" /> access to other member states or OECD states.  The Commission also tackled the application of the EC's competition policy regarding liner shipping and the conference system in particular.  It broadly confirms previous statements on this issue, accepting the role of conferences in the sector.</P>
    <P>In the bulk sector, the Commission again adopts an open policy, noting the role of flags of convenience in keeping European shipping competitive &mdash; 25 per cent of open registry tonnage is owned by EC nationals.  It discounts claims that flags of convenience are reducing employment opportunities for European seamen, although the Commission will investigate further the use of foreign seamen on European vessels.  While recognising that problems exist the Commission believes that a mandatory genuine economic link between flag State and ship would run counter to EC shipping and trading interests.</P>
    <P>There are now proposals for four specific instruments of EC shipping policy which in due course will be settled by the Council of Ministers.  The Commission has proposed a draft regulation to combat cargo reservation, with a system of diplomatic and financial sanctions: if diplomatic approaches fail, the Commission proposes a combination of quotas and financial charges against the country and its shipping companies.  The Commission also proposes a regulation to combat unfair pricing arrangements, notably by State trading companies, which affect European shipowners.</P>
    <P>The Commission has proposed a regulation to liberalise the Community's internal shipping arrangements.  This will remove restrictions on freedom to provide shipping services within the Community including offshore supply and the coastal trades.  The Commission has also proposed application of the competition rules of the Treaty to maritime transport.</P>
    <P>When you consider that the member states run across the rull range of the shipping industry from the massive Greek tramp industry to our own small fleet I think Deputies will agree that the reaching of any form of workable consensus <Col N="1683" /> will be an achievement in itself.  There are tremendous doctrinal differences within the Community in attitudes to transport in general and shipping in particular. Common problems produce common interests, however, and ultimately common solutions can and must be found to the benefit of all.  The package of measures addressing internal and external issues has been making progress slowly and painfully, but I think purposefully enough towards the goal of a common maritime policy.  We may well see concrete results before the end of the year. I have had experience of the major efforts made under the Dutch Presidency at a Council meeting which I attended seeking to get common thought and common endeavour towards this end.  Against that background of domestic and international factors, the Minister for Communications established the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements, representative of the relevant Government Departments and other interests.  The committee's brief was to investigate and report on Ireland's current and future strategic shipping needs and how these should be met.</P>
    <P>The conclusions and recommendations of the committee were published in the Green Paper on Transport Policy of November last.  The committee confirmed the need to maintain on the Irish register a strategic fleet of deep-sea vessels for the transport of essential supplies in an emergency.  They estimated that total dry cargo tonnage of 158,000 dwt, of which 140,000 dwt should be deep-sea vessels, would be needed to transport such supplies.  They concluded that there was an overwhelming case, on strategic grounds, for the provision of incentives for the maintenance and development of the Irish fleet.  They proposed that, as a general principle, a larger number of relatively small ships would be preferable to fewer larger vessels because of the greater impact of losses of the larger vessels in an emergency, and they concluded that the acquisition of tanker tonnage at <Col N="1684" /> this time could not be justified on economic grounds.</P>
    <P>In light of those conclusions, the committee recommended that:</P>
    <P>&mdash;measures be taken to provide an effective stimulus to existing Irish shipowners and to attract new investors to the industry,</P>
    <P>&mdash;State agencies give a lead in greater use of Irish shipping services and control the choice of shipping services,</P>
    <P>&mdash;The IDA take steps to ensure that Irish shipping companies get a better opportunity to compete for the provision of transport services for grant-aided industries,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the employment of Irish ships to the greatest extent possible to carry coal supplies to the ESB generating station at Moneypoint be explored,</P>

      <P>They recommended that:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a comprehensive review of manning requirements on Irish ships be undertaken, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the question of future training of Irish maritime officers and seamen be pursued.</P>
      <P>The key recommendation of the committee is the one relating to the provision of incentives for the maintenance and development of an Irish fleet.  Although some reservations were expressed, the committee felt that, from the Exchequer's point of view, this would be the least expensive way in which and adequate strategic dry cargo fleet could be provided.  The committee were also of the belief that there may be opportunities for State sector-private sector co-operation to provide the necessary strategic tonnage.</P>
      <P>Following consultation by the Minister with the other Ministers concerned, the committee's report is at present being considered by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deny strongly the inertia on this matter suggested by Deputy Wilson <Col N="1685" /> earlier.  The Minister has acted expeditiously and with vigour in this.  He has given due consideration and he has had the matter examined.  There is no instant solutions to this matter and it is now before the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he is approaching this task with the same vigour and enthusiasm as he has done with all of the other complex problems he has faced within his Department.  I am sure this will be resolved expeditiously.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the representatives of the shipping industry who served on the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements and whose expertise in this area was of particular value to the committee's deliberations. I should also like to thank all those bodies and individuals who made submissions to the Minister on this subject in response to the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already taken action to meet one of the committee's recommendations, that relating to manning levels and trading areas for Irish ships. The basic principle applied by my Department to manning requirements on board ship is that the longer the voyage and the bigger the ship, the larger crew of officers and ratings it must carry and the higher must be the qualifications of the officers.  Manning levels for particular ships on particular voyages are determined in part, therefore, by reference to the zone &mdash; known as a trading area &mdash; within which the ship operates.  My Department have now undertaken a comprehensive review of trading areas and manning levels, including those applied in other European maritime countries, with a view to ensuring that Irish ship owners are placed on the most competitive footing consistent with safety.  I must emphasise the safety aspect and assure Deputies that the Minister would not be prepared to take any decisions which might compromise the safety of our ships and of those who sail in them. On foot of the Department's examination, <Col N="1686" /> the Minister has decided to extend the trading areas within which our ships may operate.  In addition to this general move, the Department have agreed to adjustments in other manning levels on particular ships in consultation with the individual shipowners concerned.  These changes will improve our competitive position in a market which is becoming tougher all the time.  Changes in this general area are made in consultation with the Irish Chamber of Shipping, with which body discussions have been and continue to be on-going.  Much common ground has emerged from these discussions and this is reflected in decisions taken to date.  These discussions will continue under the guiding principle which I have indicated, namely competitiveness always subject to safety.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Minister recently announced the Government's decision to provide substantial funds to enable the board of the B &amp; I to implement their rationalisation plans for the restoration of the company to profitability.  Subject to the enactment of the necessary enabling legislation which has been published, which will be introduced shortly in this House and on which there will be a detailed debate on the various questions raised, the Government over the next four years will allocate £38 million additional equity for the B &amp; I, of which £20 million will be provided in 1986.  This represents a very substantial level of investment by the Exchequer in present financial circumstances and is an indication of the Government's commitment to maintaining a strong Irish presence in shipping services on the Irish Sea. It is also a recognition of the importance of our access transport services to trade, commerce and tourism and to our national economy generally.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully aware of the importance of keeping a significant share of cross-Channel traffic in Irish hands. While we welcome external participation in shipping services to and from Ireland, both for the traffic generating capacity which it brings and the competitive spur which it provides, we cannot afford to <Col N="1687" /> rely entirely on foreign interests to supply vital national needs.  Our economy needs efficient shipping services if it is to prosper and the Government consider that a significant level of Irish participation operating under equitable conditions is an essential ingredient in ensuring the efficiency and quality of cross-Channel shipping services.</P>
    <P>This major investment by the Government as shareholder is contingent on a matching contribution by the board, management and the workforce of the B &amp; I towards the restoration of the company to viability, in accordance with the mandate which the Minister gave to Mr. Alex Spain, the new chairman and managing director when he was appointed in May of last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson raised the question of fare increases on Irish Seas routes and B &amp; I. Sealink pooling arrangements.  It must be noted that in the past, cut throat competition for market share operated with fares failing to keep pace with inflation as far as the Irish Sea was concerned. As a result, B &amp; I incurred very substantial losses which had to be met by the taxpayer.  It should be readily understood that that this situation could not continue and that, inevitably, fares would increase to cover service costs.  Compared with their 1985 fares, however, the B &amp; I have either decreased or held the level of off-peak stimulus of their week-end fares for 1986.  It will be appreciated that passenger traffic to Ireland is seasonal, with low demand in winter and excess demand at peak travel times.  Many of us who use cross-Channel links by sea will readily appreciate the extroardinary fluctuations which take place, exceptionally low in winter and extraordinarily high in a good tourist season.</P>
    <P>In common with other sea and air carriers, B &amp; I must charge premium rates during peak periods if a profit is to be achieved.  Notwithstanding this, the company have retained a peak period stimulative fare, the seven day mid-week family fare.  As indicated, the B &amp; I incurred serious losses over the last number of years due also to the downturn in trade <Col N="1688" /> and tourism in addition to the other matters which I outlined.  If such losses were to persist, the continued operation of the B &amp; I would be placed in jeopardy.  The agreement between B &amp; I and Sealink British Ferries is essentially a pooling arrangement which is feature common on other European ferry routes.  The agreement was entered into in the context of the B &amp; I's commercial mandate in an effort to reduce costs while maintaining capacity commensurate with demand.  It is not anticipated that the agreement will encounter any difficulties under EC law.  It should be pointed out that Ireland continues to promote full commercial freedom of shipping and an open ports policy.  Indeed, our policy in that area is much more liberal than many of our partners.  There is no restriction on shipping companies wishing to operate to and from our ports.  The same can be said of air fares.  We all like cheap fares when we use the service but we must take into consideration other elements involved and ensure that we have a presence on the cross-Channel link, which is vital.  We must ensure that it is an economically viable presence.  Nevertheless, fares should be reasonable.  Everyone will accept that if the service is to be available on an all the year round basis, not just during peak periods with someone creaming off the profits, fares must be set at a realistic level.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the importance of our access transport services.  I should perhaps in this context draw attention to the fact that the Minister, in the course of a recent discussion in this House regarding Irish Continental Line, at present in the hands of the liquidator of Irish Shipping Limited, indicated that he would take every step possible to ensure the continuation of a direct ferry link between Ireland and the Continent of Europe.  Deputy Wilson asked for details in so far as Irish Continental Line are concerned but the Minister has consistently pointed out that this is generally a matter for the liquidator&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister does not want to get involved in details but he has assured Deputy Wilson on many occasions of his clear interest in the continuation of the Irish Continental Line and that he will not be found wanting in fulfilling his duty in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson said that Fianna Fáil promise they will bring back an Irish deep sea fleet.  They may promise that, but tonight Deputy Wilson told us they were open to suggestions and did not have any ideological hang up about this.  He was saying, in other words, that Fianna Fáil have not done anything about formulating a policy.  They can say that they will back a deep sea fleet but they have not said how they will do that.  That is not our approach.  Our approach is to take into account all factors and study them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to make a contribution on this motion in support of Deputy Wilson.  Our motion states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to formulate and publish a policy for Irish deep sea shipping and to declare its determination to maintain in Irish hands, adequate ferry services to the UK and mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>As an island nation with a total population of 3,500,000 &mdash; five million on the entire island &mdash; our economy is very exposed and trade with other countries is an economic lifeline for our future.  We depend on exports to keep our economy ticking over and that cannot be emphasised enough.  To be involved in the highly competitive export markets it is essential that we should have the wherewithal to transport goods from the production centres here to marketplaces in Britain, mainland Europe and the US.  Getting exports from point &ldquo;A&rdquo; to point &ldquo;B&rdquo; is an integral part of production, marketing, selling and delivery.  At the end of 1984 Irish Shipping was liquidated and we all agree that that was a sad day for our economy.  It was a sad day for our economy that the Coalition decided to let Irish Shipping go to the wall.  The Government did not recognise the strategic and economic necessity of having a deep sea merchant shipping fleet.  It was a proud day for the country when Seán Lemass established Irish Shipping.  That was done at a time when our economy was going through a difficult period; but Seán Lemass, being a man of vision, knew it was necessary that we should have complete and absolute control in this area. He recognised that without a deep sea fleet we would be exposed and isolated. Seán Lemass made a decision at that time that was in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>The performance of the company for years was excellent by any standards. Indeed, it was the pride of State companies for many years.  The country's flag, the symbol of our nationhood, was to be seen in all trading ports around the world. In these times of peace the Coalition tell us that there is a surplus cargo carrying capacity available.  I do not dispute that, but that could change very quickly.  With <Col N="1691" /> the liquidation of Irish Shipping our credibility as a trading nation took a very severe battering and it will take years &mdash; it will not be easy chore &mdash; to restore our credibility in this area.  The Coalition effectively walked away from their responsibilities and that in the area of world trade and cargo carrying will not be forgiven.  We may pay a steep price for that decision for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Those who examine the difficulties experienced by Irish Shipping will agree that the charter agreements entered into by the company with concerns in Hong Kong and Japan were a major error of judgment.  That error was compounded by a world economic recession that lasted longer than most Governments and economists anticipated.  The combination of those factors put severe stress and strain on Irish Shipping.  However, the Government could have chosen to help the company ride out the storm and stay in business until there was an economic upturn.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government produced their Green Paper on transport policy.  It was accepted in that Green Paper that the first half of the eighties was difficult for world shipping and that that depression hurt many shipping fleets.  The boom that was anticipated for our increased tonnage did not materialise and as a result we had surplus capacity available.  The Green Paper readily recognised the importance of having a dependable and efficient transport service available for industry, agricultural produce, and tourists. At a time when a reappraisal of our industrial position is being carried out we cannot over-emphasise the importance of having a strategic fleet available.  The importance of its availability cannot be divorced from the overall plan for the development of our economy.  We have to recognise that at the time of war the cause of exporters will be a very long way down the list of considerations of those we would be depending on.</P>
    <P>Given the mobility of world trade today we cannot live in splendid isolation, a small island population on the perimeter of Europe, a member state of the <Col N="1692" /> biggest trading bloc in the world.  We could not continue to operate in those circumstances without the wherewithal to export our produce and import necessary supplies.  We are living in a world in which there is the constant noise of sabre-rattling and war mongering.  Who can say with any conviction that there is not a war brewing?</P>
    <P>Our slice of world trade is very small, but it is of vital importance to our economy. Economists and others looking to the future, at the quarter of a million people unemployed, at the present level of taxation, the necessity for national wealth to invest in infrastructure that lags far behind that available in other member states of the EC, are examining the possibility of expanding our slice of world trade.  It is difficult to argue with the contention that the future success and well-being of our country are dependent on our ability to secure a much larger slice of that world trade.  For example, a couple of percentage points of an increase would work wonders for our economy, would give hope and confidence to investors and, above all, convince young people leaving our educational establishments that there is a life at the end of the tunnel, that we are up and doing and that their future is not as gloomy as some people would like us to believe.</P>
    <P>An increase in our exports would mean also an increased volume of trade from our shores whether that trade be with Britain, Europe, America or elsewhere. We must ensure the carriage of our produce from point A to point B.  We must examine it in the context of our control of all the elements that are part and parcel of our industrial development and expansion.  We cannot run the risk of leaving the control of our exports in the hands of others who when it suited them could depart leaving us isolated, holding the baby.</P>
    <P>I might move on to the question of port development and its importance in the context of this debate.  In my constituency there is the deep sea port of Greenore, a port through which the volume of trade has expanded enormously over the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> I am sure most Members of the House will be aware that that port is privately-owned, that it has been expanded and developed without any State support. Many people &mdash; and I share their view &mdash; foresee the future development of Greenore port as absolutely vital to the development of the north-east region generally.  In the last three or four years there has been a rapid increase in the numbers of people unemployed in the County of Louth.  There was also the migration of some of the workforce from the other counties in the north-east region.  The development, or opportunity to do so, of the north-east region is being ignored by this Government.  They are not prepared to recognise the difficulties obtaining in those counties.  Neither are they prepared to recognise that the increased unemployment figures represent a manifestation of their lack of commitment to County Louth in particular.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to make capital funds available for development of infrastructure in County Louth.  While the labour content of many capital projects is relatively low, the expenditure of moneys under that heading would generate activity locally, putting a much larger amount of money into circulation which must boost jobs in the trade and supplies sector.  That is apart altogether from the advantage to the area of a proper road structure, and the extension of the natural gas pipeline to Drogheda and Dundalk where there are industries hanging on in the hope that the Government will take that decision quickly.  They have been hoping in vain for far too long.  The agreement with the British Government to extend the natural gas pipeline to Belfast having fallen through after various attempts to revive it, one would have thought that the Government would see the urgency of its extension to Drogheda and Dundalk, giving the inherent advantages.  Unfortunately, that decision has not been taken.  I am asking the Minister to convey that message to the Government and to have that decision taken as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The possibility of establishing a special <Col N="1694" /> Border counties development authority, with Greenore port constituting the outlet to the sea for the produce manufactured in the area, carries obvious benefits.  The possibility of introducing special measures to get the Border counties off their knees economically is being ignored.  The Dundalk economy is suffering from the poisonous effect of the Government's economic policies of the past three and a half years when rapidly increasing unemployment has been the order of the day, with no end in sight. Indeed, in a town in which people never knew unemployment, industries that stood the town and country well for generations have been allowed go to the wall.  Unfortunately, it appears that the Government are not prepared to implement the necessary remedial measures. Unemployment, unknown to many people a few years ago, has now become a fact of life.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government taxation policies have left County Louth with a trail of bankruptcies and liquidations. The stagnation induced by these policies is like a cancer eating at the economic body of the county.  Still the Government have not recognised the measures which need to be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  Before the adjournment of the debate, we were discussing the fact that the concept of failure is a very subjective one.  Effectively, it means that different judges can place different interpretations on what exactly constitutes a failed marriage.  For that reason we would prefer to see substituted for &ldquo;failure&rdquo; one of the following phrases: irretrievable, or final, or complete breakdown, as Deputy Haughey suggested.  These would be far more in line with what we are discussing here.  The stake here is <Col N="1696" /> that a relationship may have been viable, happy and successful for a long number of years but has now finally and irretrievably broken down.  The word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; explains that position far more clearly, concisely and precisely than the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that there is no concept of fault involved.  However, Deputy Woods made reference to the breakdown of a car which can be mended, but the car which fails is possibly one which never worked.  The concept of failure allows for no success, or achievement, or hapiness, no pleasant memories to look back on.  That would be most people's concept of a failed marriage. The Minister has said that despite my saying that the Government's proposal was ambiguous and unsatisfactory, I was able to find very clear ways of explaining what I meant.  For the parties involved, it makes it all the more difficult that they are described as failures in some sense.  The same applies to the children of that marriage.  It would be better for them to realise that their parents' marriage had broken down, rather than that it had failed.</P>
      <P>Many people would consider that in a failed marriage there had never been an element of success, or that there had not been any viable relationship.  Also, it leaves too much responsibility with the individual justice.  We have seen in recent years in our courts interpretations of the law allowing very different penalties to be imposed for almost similar offences. There is too much flexibility allowed. Because it is so subjective, it may well be the case that a particular justice might concede that a relationship had broken down, perhaps irretrievably, with no chance of reconciliation, but that it was not a failed marriage because there were three lovely children of the marriage and the parents had gone on holiday together for ten years out of possibly 15 years, that they had a nice home and good jobs.  That is not beyond the bounds of possibility when we consider some of the decisions emanating from some of our courts, particularly in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and Government and all <Col N="1697" /> Deputies are trying to recognise, through the constitutional amendment, that marriages in this country irretrievably break down and to allow those people so affected to have that marriage dissolved and have an opportunity to remarry in this country.  Since that is what we all are trying to achieve, we should not be too paranoid about changing words simply because some people might take an incorrect interpretation, that some might believe it would be easier to obtain a divorce if the word used were &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;failed&rdquo; and that the referendum might not succeed.  People will misinterpret, no matter what wording is used.  We already find our efforts being misinterpreted and people are being frightened.  That will happen, no matter what words are used.</P>
    <P>What we must ensure is that the words which we write into the Constitution are adequate and reflect the reality of what we are talking about and, above all else, reflect the reality of the position of those whose circumstances we are trying to help by showing our recognition of there having been a viable relationship, perhaps of many years' duration, that there has been an irretrievable breakdown but that we are not talking about such people in the context of their being failures or failed people in any sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made my contribution, but having regard to the length of time that has been spent on this amendment, I feel motivated to come in once again and copperfasten my original contribution.  It is very important that this debate should not be taken for granted. In that regard we should be very greatful indeed to Deputy Harney for going to the trouble of proposing her two amendments. This has varied the debate and opened it up to a great degree.  Deputies should thank that Deputy.  I am placing on record my appreciation of the opportunity that her amendments have offered, not only to myself but to other people. Those who might be dismissive of them should not be so.  Rather should they be seen as an effort to improve the wording <Col N="1698" /> in the Government's amendment.</P>
      <P>However, I do not agree with the proposed amendment because at this stage, and I do not mean this as a carping criticism, but as a help and assistance, the difference between the dictionary definitions of &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; are so minimal as to offer, in fact, no real difference.  The Government have quite clearly examined the matter, through the apparatus available to them and not available to me, or Deputy Harney, or others, and have come up with this wording. They have decided, in their wisdom or otherwise, on that wording.  I submit that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is adequate as compared with the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is approaching this matter in a most civilised fashion. We should be grateful to him for that. He has helped to keep the debate on an even keel and the tenor of the debate has been proper and reasonable which is as it should be in a matter of this importance. However, it appears that there were a number of Deputies behind him who made references to the effect that the spokesman for the Opposition, Deputy Woods, was putting forward an argument which was seriously flawed.  I take exception to a remark of that nature.  Deputy Woods, like myself, is entitled to make his observations on this proposal without that sort of comment from Deputies who rush in and out again with a hit and run comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very unfair.  I may not altogether agree with my colleague and friend, Deputy Woods, and the thrust of his argument on Second Stage, but I would not deny him the right to make the argument that he has made in a well researched and thorough fashion.  I do not necessarily agree with what he has said but I do not deny him the right to say what he said.  The people from the other side who appear to be representing themselves as a little bit more than they are, namely, as Ministers, seem to be responding on behalf of their own Minister. They should take a leaf out of their own Minister's approach to this debate. I reject the suggestion that there is a great air of artificiality about this discussion <Col N="1699" /> and I reject that the debate in some way has broken down in its interpretation. We should approach this debate as men and women of the people rather than men and women of the law.  If we keep to the grass roots approach to the subject, we will be doing it a justice rather than an injustice and a service rather than a disservice.</P>
    <P>To return to the suggestion that the words &ldquo;failed&rdquo; or &ldquo;failure&rdquo; should not be examined, of course, they should be examined and they should be set off quite properly against the amendment proposed by Deputy Harney.  Even if we did not have the amendment from Deputy Harney, we still have a fundamental obligation to examine the proposed amendment to the Constitution in absolute detail.  That is what we on this side of the House have done, albeit with a different emphasis.  Why not?  Is that not what democracy is all about?  I do not intend to speak for any length of time because I have said what I have to say on the amendment, not only in my contribution on Second Stage but also in my first contribution on Committee Stage.  From now on, I will be at risk of repeating myself and that I do not want to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong of me to let the matter conclude without replying to some of the points which have been made.  I go back to Deputy Haughey's question about the finality that attaches to the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and I must say, and I hope the House will not think me obdurate for saying this because I have listened very carefully to what has been said, I am still not convinced, quite the contrary, that &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; is a better word to use.  As I have pointed out, I believe there is a greater connotation of finality about the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; than there is about &ldquo;breakdown.  Deputy Haughey put the question in these terms: if we talk about more than one period of failure, can that possibly mean that there was a failure there in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I answered that earlier on by saying broadly this, that if the two parties to a marriage decide at a given point that <Col N="1700" /> something has gone seriously awry with their marriage and believe they should separate or cease to live together in a marriage bond that <i>prima facie</i> is evidence of failure of the marriage.  As I said before, they may find after a period of separation that that separation is not achieving what they thought it might achieve. They could then decide to try to effect a reconciliation.  If they succeed in effecting a reconciliation, so much the better.  If they succeed in effecting a reconciliation that lasts, they were wrong in the first instance, their marriage has not failed.  If, on the other hand, after a period they find that the marriage still does not work, it is reasonable to conclude that there was a failure in the first instance.  We cannot parse and analyse each individual case.  One could argue that in some cases the fact that they did not succeed in a reconciliation indicated that there has been a failure in the first place, not immediately on marriage but after a period.  That, therefore, should be taken into account in the way that is set out in the text before us and counted as part of the period of failure or periods amounting to, at least, five years.</P>
    <P>It is conceivable also that if two people, having decided that something was awry with their marriage, subsequently tried to effect a reconciliation which worked for a time and then concluded again that something was awry with their marriage, one might decide that the failure had not existed the first time but existed the second time.  That is one of a number of reasons for leaving a margin of discretion to the courts.  Deputy Harney seems not to like that but I do not think that we can conceive of a legal system worthy of the name that would absolutely tie the hands of courts.  If one pushes that argument to its extreme, one will find that one does not need courts at all because all of the cases would be dealt with in legislation.  I do not accept the validity, I say this without any wish to start an argument or row in the House, of an argument that says we cannot trust the courts.</P>
    <P>I put that question when I was concluding on Second Stage last Friday.  I asked the House to consider very seriously if it <Col N="1701" /> supported some of the suggestions which were made during the Second Stage and I asked the House to consider the question, are we really saying that we cannot trust the Judiciary who have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution?  That is a question which has to be asked because during the course of this debate suggestions may be made without their being meant that in some way we should decide that we do not trust the courts.  I do not believe that that is an argument which can be sustained nor do I believe that it is one that is justified either on the basis of our past history or on the basis of any expectation as to how the courts would handle the legislation which is before us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked what would be the situation if one partner considers that there is a failure and believes that that is a ground for divorce.  I dealt with that question already.  We are dealing here not with a subjective judgment by either or both of the partners to a marriage that there has been a failure, we are providing the framework within which a court will decide on the basis of the evidence that is presented to it that there has been a failure in that case.  Deputy Woods went on to raise another question, one that has been raised both inside and outside of this House, and that is the question of collusion.  He asked, what if there is collusion between two spouses, if they agree between themselves to say that the marriage has failed and what will happen to the children after that?</P>
    <P>The first question that springs to mind reflecting on what Deputy Woods has asked is this: If the marriage is a success, what possible reason can the two spouses have for colluding in showing that it is a failure?  If the marriage is not a success, is there collusion if one spouse says.  I do not want to have anything more to do with this?  Is there collusion if between them each one of the spouses separately and then jointly say: This is not working out, we will adopt the procedures which are laid down in the law, first, a separation and, then, a divorce?  Surely, that is a question that they have to settle for themselves.  To bring up as an issue the possibility that people would collude <Col N="1702" /> between themselves to represent a situation as being one of failure is to start off on the wrong foot.  If that is their opinion or if that is what they have decided to do, surely, by definition there has already been a failure because if people get to that point obviously they cannot seriously be involved in what we would normally regard as the life of a marriage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods raised the question of condition No. 4 in this proposal and wondered if provisions could not be introduced to supersede the condition that there has been a failure.  I am not sure what Deputy Woods means by provisions that would supersede it.  As I pointed out, condition No. 4 provides the ability for the Oireachtas to add other conditions to those that are set out at (i), (ii) and (iii) and to the proviso.  They cannot be conditions that alter the Constitution by definition because we cannot do that by legislation.  They can extend it and add to the conditions but they cannot derogate from it.  The extra conditions that would be applied can go in only one direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods than asked what is the meaning of the condition that the court be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties.  He claims that these terms do not have meaning, force or restriction. He points to situations in regard to other jurisdictions and asks quite reasonably if the possibility of reconciliation does not depend on the willingness of both parties to attempt it.  I would have to answer that it is perfectly clear that the possibility of reconciliation depends crucially on the degree of willingness of the two parties to attempt it.  It is quite clear that if each of the two parties is willing to attempt a reconciliation there is some possibility that a reconciliation will be brought about.  If one of the parties is willing to attempt a reconciliation and the other is not, I find it very difficult to see how a reconciliation would be brought about in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>To argue from the point of view of the English provision and to say that the provision we have here would not have any meaning is wrong.  Out of respect to the vicarious sensitivities of Deputy <Col N="1703" /> Andrews, I will not say that there is a flaw in the argument; I will say that it is wrong.  The English provision provides &mdash; Deputy Woods read a part of it &mdash; that rules of court may be made requiring a solicitor to certify whether he has discussed the possibility of a reconciliation with his client.  It also provides that if at any stage of the proceedings it appears to the court that there is a reasonable possibility of reconciliation then the court may adjourn the proceedings in order to enable the attempt to be made.  That provision is totally different in character from the provision in the proposed amendment before the House which requires a court to be satisfied that there is no possibility of reconciliation before it can grant a decree of divorce.  We are dealing with the Constitution of the State and not simply with rules of court.  In addition to that, as I have said, the provision before us requires the court to be satisfied that there is no possibility of reconciliation rather than simply enabling it to adjourn proceedings in order to find out if there is a possibility. It is a much stonger provision and one that adds to the restrictive nature of the constitutional amendment proposed here.</P>
    <P>I have listened very carefully to the arguments that have been made and while I agree, as I said at the outset of this discussion, with the direction of Deputy Harney's concern I do not agree with the method that she proposes.  I prefer the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; in this context to the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; whether or not breakdown is accompanied by another qualification.  I know that basically Deputy Andrews agrees with the line that I am taking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for clarifying a number of points.  When I make reference to what happens in Britain or elsewhere I am no expert.  I am here as a public representative representing ordinary plain people who want to know what the implications of these proposed changes will be.  We do not have these words in practice in <Col N="1704" /> Ireland but we can see them in practice elsewhere.  It is for this reason that I look, in relation to such words, to what is happening in Britain or in some of other jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that a margin of discretion must be left to the courts.  I do not think anybody would disagree with that.  The courts and the Judiciary will want to know from this House and from the people if they are to pass the measure what kind of riding instructions they are to have.  They too are ordinary people but with extraordinary experience and knowledge of the use of words, of language and of the application of the Constitution in so many different circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we working in a different way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are working at a different end of the whole spectrum.  It is fair to say that Members of the House trust the Judiciary fully in relation to their independent character and their integrity. That is not the question that arises here.  It is a question of the words which we leave them to work with.  They will have to take the ordinary interpretation of these words.  There is no question of anyone here mistrusting the Judiciary in any way.</P>
      <P>The Minister clarified, as far as he could, that if one partner believes that there is a failure then that is a matter for the court to decide.  It comes back to the position in relation to reconciliation.  If one partner says that there is no possibility of reconciliation the Minister agreed that that would mean that there is not much prospect of reconciliation in practice.  Likewise, this applies in relation to the whole question of failure.  In relation to the two partners agreeing to this, the Minister seems to accept that the marriage has already failed and the circumstances in so far as the children are concerned will have to be faced up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the court must be satisfied that there is no possibility of reconciliation.  It is important to recognise that the reasonable possibility of <Col N="1705" /> reconciliation only occurs when divorce is being decided on.  We have gone through the other questions of the failure of the marriage.  It has been decided that it has failed for a continuous period or for periods amounting to at least five years and that there is no prospect of a reconciliation. At that late stage, when a decision is about to be made, it probably will not be very difficult for the member of the Judiciary or for the court to decide that there is little possible hope of reconciliation. It is at that late stage that the question would arise, and I cannot see it being particularly effective in preventing a final breakdown because reconciliation, if it is to start, must start early, before mental attitudes are established by the exchange of solicitors' letters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us just stick to the time since the committee completed their work.  I am trying to relate this to the impact of three conditions attached to the failure of a marriage.  Breakdown, on its own, is subjective and provides little protection for the existing family.  I suggested that at the outset.  The word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is subjective and members of the Judiciary would be forced to consider the usage of the day in the dictionary.  During the debate today the Minister was given two definitions which have shown that &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is not a final determination.  The Minister is caught in an awkward spot&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like Deputy Woods to use phrases like that when I am not caught in an awkward spot.  I do <Col N="1706" /> not think it is an awkward spot but a sensible way to put it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is finality in the word.  There does not appear to be a clear definition of the word available to us.  It is clear from what the Minister has said that there is no provision in relation to any period of separation in the proposed constitutional amendment.  The Minister may wish to introduce a period of separation later under paragraph (iv), but even if he did so in legislation there is no guarantee that the period would not be reduced later. This could happen even if the period was five years.  Under paragraph (iv) the only thing the Minister can do is to add in an extra condition.</P>
      <P>It seems quite clear that you could not have unilateral divorce under the term &ldquo;failure&rdquo; which, in itself, is a low threshold as it is being used.  I appreciate what Deputy Harney said about the term &ldquo;failure&rdquo; implying a low status to the family in which marriage has failed.  That is an important point because the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; would record the fact that the family had failed.  The Minister, by way of supplementary condition, could add in a five year separation, but he cannot supersede what will be in the Constitution, the use of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  Anything the Minister puts into section 4 cannot redefine that word unless the Minister were to include a new section saying that the law may define &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, which will have to be considered on its own as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This constitutional amendment will permit divorce solely on the conditions in the amendment and it will then depend on the Oireachtas as to what additional conditions can be added under paragraph (iv).  If the Minister feels it is necessary to have a five year separation clause it would be open to him to include it in the amendment so as to have certainty.  It seems to us that the Minister would have to add such a condition if he is to provide the restrictive element which the majority of people would like to see &mdash; some definite period of separation which could not be varied readily subsequently.  At <Col N="1707" /> the moment that is not part of the amendment and if it were brought before the House subsequently it might be varied and without constitutional certainty.  In the public mind the two things have been joined.</P>
    <P>They are some of the problems attached to the use of &ldquo;failure&rdquo; which seem to have arisen during the debate.  There are many other factors which we can discuss later.  Looking at the two words &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;, there is no particular merit in &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; on its own as compared with &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  I do not think either will provide real protection for the existing family.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods claims that the concept of failure is subjective.  I am bound to say &mdash; and I hope the Chair will not think me provocative &mdash; that the Deputy does not seem to have considered what I said earlier or even to have weighed it in the balance.  I am not so thin skinned that personally that would worry me unduly, but for the purpose of the debate it does worry me.  I made the point &mdash; I have not heard anything from Deputy Woods to challenge or refute it &mdash; that we are not talking in the proposed amendment about a subjective judgment being made by either or both of the parties to a marriage.  We are putting an obligation on a court to be satisfied that a marriage has failed.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy fully appreciates that he should not continue to claim that the concept of failure is a subjective one.  What we are doing here is requiring a court to be satisfied on the basis of the evidence presented to it that there has been a failure.  Deputy Woods now seems to agree that we are not talking about a purely subjective criterion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods mentioned the question of reconciliation.  I interjected and I beg the pardon of the Chair for being disorderly.  I was trying to be helpful in a slightly disorderly manner.  In the legislation proposed, and which I confidently expect to bring before the House, we are <Col N="1708" /> proposing that the question of reconciliation would have been looked at by the court at an earlier stage, when the court is looking at the matter of a judicial separation or a separation agreement.  That would be a necessary precursor to an application for a decree of divorce.  I agree with the concern of Deputy Woods about the necessity to ensure that possibilities for reconciliation are given a chance and are properly tried out.  I should imagine all of us share that concern. My point is that we will make provision in the stages that precede divorce for finding out if there is a possibility of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods came back to the question of whether legislative provisions can supersede what is in the draft amendment before the House.  He accepts that there cannot be any derogation in legislation from the requirement that the court be satisfied that there has been a failure for five years.  That is beyond argument once it is written into the Constitution and no law or court can derogate from that and if we add further conditions to it they can only be conditions that are more restrictive. Deputy Woods claims that we have provided for what he called a low threshold for divorce.  I am not quite sure what he means by that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>A low threshold would seem to indicate that the Deputy believes it would be relatively easy to get a decree of divorce under the provisions we have here.  We have had a long discussion this evening about the meaning of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  Obviously, it is something the courts will have to think about very carefully in any case that comes before them. It will not be easy to decide that there has been a failure and the courts will have to look at these other conditions and the proviso.  Adding them together in their cumulative effect, I cannot see how anyone can pretend that represents a low threshold, that it will be easy to get a divorce or that it is a facility that will be readily available.  Deputy Woods went on to say that there is no guarantee that the <Col N="1709" /> period of separation will not be reduced at a later stage because, as he points out, separation is provided for in the legislation. Failure of the marriage is provided for here.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the legislative provisions can only add further conditions to the amendment.  We are talking about a provision that will require a court to be satisfied that a marriage has failed for five years or for periods amounting to five years.  No matter what is in the legislation afterwards, that requirement to satisfy the court that there has been a failure for five years subsists.  That is what the Constitution will provide.  If we provide for anything else in legislation it can only be either to give legislative effect to what is in the Constitution or to add extra conditions to what is in the Constitution. My belief is that the provisions we have set out are very restrictive and will be difficult to demonstrate in any given case. To the extent that legislation adds to those conditions &mdash; I have indicated it is the Government's intention to add other conditions to those included here &mdash; the effect will be to make the whole complex of constitutional and legislative provisions more restrictive.  In my view it is wrong to suggest this represents a low threshold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the constitutional amendment cannot be said to provide for a low threshold.  Deputy Woods suggested that if I wanted to provide that divorce would be available after five years of separation it was open to me to put that in the proposed amendment.  I have to say that if Deputy Woods wanted to provide for that or for any other period of separation equally it was open to him to put down an amendment to that effect. He has chosen not to do so and I fully respect his right and his reason for not doing so.  I caution against going too far with that line because that would suggest to me that what might be in mind in making such a provision would be that we would require separation only as a <Col N="1710" /> test for divorce.  From the tenor of the remarks made here this evening, I do not think anyone here would be satisfied to provide for divorce only on the test of separation.  I do not think that is what Deputy Woods or Deputy Harney had in mind.  It certainly is not what the Government or what I have in mind.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods concluded by saying he sees no merit in the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; as against &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  I must accept that is his view.  I contend at the very least that if that is his point of view then he can see no particular merit in the concept of irretrievable breakdown as against the provision here.  As I have said on many occasions in this debate, we provide that the court must be satisfied that the marriage has failed and, among other conditions, that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties.  I accept fully the caveat of Deputy Haughey about using the language of the man in the street in these debates but occasionally it may provide a little side-light to help us to clarify the debate.  Putting those two things, failure and no reasonable possibility of reconciliation, into ordinary man's language, that seems to mean irremediable failure.  Personally I believe that irremediable failure is a stronger notion or concept than irretrievable breakdown.  If Deputy Woods has the concern which he has been illustrating during the course of the discussion he will join with me in rejecting the amendment.</P>

      <P>This discussion has gone on for some time as a result of the attempt by Deputy Harney to substitute the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; for &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  As the debate has progressed we have reached something of a consensus.  I want to reiterate that we are not concerned with legislation which may or may not be introduced afterwards or any provisions in it.  In this debate we can only concern ourselves with the words of the amendment as they will go before the people. That is the only thing that will last in the Constitution.  Any other legislation or provisions are of no relevance and cannot be adduced in support of this wording. <Col N="1711" /> We have to look at these four steps as they are.  At this stage we are concentrating on paragraph (i) because Deputy Harney's amendment deals with paragraph (i).  Deputy Harney has a second amendment which deals with paragraph (iii). When we come to that we can discuss paragraph (iii) on the basis of the amendment which has been tabled.  We will have something to say about it.  At this stage we are only concerned with whether or not the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; is adequate.  It has to be adequate to satisfy the section of the people who will not vote for this change in the Constitution unless it is confined to totally failed, irretrievable, irremediable breakdown of marriage. Does the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; here satisfy those people who will only accept divorce in those very strict limited circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that there is now a consensus in this House against him. Deputy Mervyn Taylor agrees that &ldquo;failed&rdquo; has not the element of finality that he suggests.  The Taoiseach said it had finality and the Minister quoted the Taoiseach with approval this afternoon as indicating that the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; has this quality of finality.  Deputy Taylor does not agree and accepts our suggestion that failure can be a temporary thing and is not necessarily irrevocable, irretrievable, final, dead breakdown.  In the remarks he made before we adjourned this debate for Private Members' Business, Deputy O'Malley agreed that failure does not have this connotation inherent in it in the constitutional context. I have to put it to the Minister, dealing only with paragraph (i), that the majority of this House has expressed itself as clearly accepting that failure does not necessarily have finality as a quality. Failure in this context does not involve total, complete and final breakdown.  If we have established that, it has made this whole debate worthwhile.  It must give the Minister pause as to the exact status of this amendment which he is putting before us.  The Minister, in all good faith, will probably claim that failure does have this finality about it, although when he was answering Deputy Woods just now <Col N="1712" /> he had to introduce the phrase &ldquo;irremediable failure&rdquo;.  He was not prepared to let &ldquo;failure&rdquo; stand on its own two legs, as it were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with paragraph (iii) when we come to it.  These are the words the court will be examining and satisfying themselves about.  It is pretty well established as a result of this fairly lengthy but well-conducted debate that the phrase &ldquo;when marriage has failed&rdquo; does not mean that the court must be satisfied that the marriage is ended beyond any possibility of ever putting it back together again.  That is the conclusion of the majority of this House at this stage of the debate.  Deputy Harney has another amendment which will bring us on to paragraph (iii) and we can then look at exactly what paragraph (iii) contributes to the situation.  I suggest that whatever advantage &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; might have as a word or &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; might have as a phrase, the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; standing on its own in paragraph (i) does not mean that a court can dissolve a marriage only when that marriage is finally beyond any possibility of redemption and has broken down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion has been somewhat circuitous.  I accept that this amendment is very important and that it is necessary to tease it out.  If I would introduce a slightly less serious note, we have gone round in so many circles that one suspects the only thing that Deputy Haughey would regard as having finality in this context is to replace the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; by &ldquo;death&rdquo; which has a final ring to it.  I find it very difficult to come back to reality in the context of the discussion that has taken place.  Deputy Haughey said earlier that &ldquo;failure&rdquo; or &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; on their own do not mean that marriage has gone beyond repair.  I think I am quoting him accurately in saying that.  This was also the mainstay of his contribution which has just concluded. That is quite true &mdash;&ldquo;failure&rdquo; or &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; on their own do not mean that a <Col N="1713" /> marriage has gone beyond repair.  In so far as Deputy Haughey says there is a consensus about this point, the Minister is part of that consensus.</P>
      <P>We keep coming back to the issue that this amendment is not about taking out one word and parsing and analysing in a vacuum.  The failure we are talking about is a marriage which has failed in the context of a couple in respect of whom there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation. This has been said before and we have gone around in circles saying this. No reasonable legal interpretation could possibly look at the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; in isolation.  I do not wish any acrimony to be brought into this debate.  We have had a constructive discussion.  However, it would seem to me that there is no possible legal method of interpreting this provision by taking the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; in isolation and interpreting it in the way that is being suggested.  Anyone with any experience of the interpretation of legislation and the manner in which the courts operate would accept that this provision stands not in isolation but with four or five prescribed conditions, each of which has to be complied with before divorce can be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only, at this stage, raise a doubt in my mind as to why the Deputies opposite persist in this type of artificial approach or interpretation.  I do not mean that in a contentious way.  When I talk about artificial I am not saying that there is not an argument being put forward.  By artificial I mean an artificial method of legal interpretation that does not bear analysis.  Deputy Haughey and Deputy Woods referred to the fact that this provision is clearly designed to reassure people who recognise the need for divorce but wish it to be restrictive and that this provision is designed to reassure them that it will be so.  A provision which requires proof of failure, proof that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation and proof that a marriage has failed for five years would, I have no doubt be seen by the majority of people outside this House as being extremely restrictive. The only way it could not be seen to be restrictive is if we forgot about the need <Col N="1714" /> to prove five years' failure, about the need to prove no reasonable possibility of reconciliation and about the fact that the court would have objectively to decide these issues, and if we constantly harped on one particular section of this provision which, when taken in isolation, would provide a restricted divorce jurisdiction. But we cannot do that because the whole thing is a unity; it is a whole; it all stands together.  None of this stands in isolation. So, what I am concerned about is that in dealing with this in what appears to be a constructive discussion, there is an attempt, either by mistake or otherwise, to create the perception outside this House, for whatever reason, that this is not a restrictive measure.  I do not understand why that would be the case in the context of a provision such as this which is clearly restrictive, which is clearly limited and which clearly does meet the criteria set by many people who want to see a restrictive form of divorce, divorce available in limited circumstances, because this is limited circumstances, it is a divorce limited to a great degree, to the extent that there is a need to prove five year' marital failure, that a marriage has not functioned, has not been viable for five years.  We need to cut through the legal jargon and remember what it is we are talking about.  We are talking about two people whose marital relationship has ceased to exist, two people who are married in nothing but name for a period of five years or more, whose marriage has become an empty shell.  For them that five year period will be a period of great deal of pain and stress and the stress for many of them will be aggravated by the fact that they will be constrained in law into a marriage that has failed for a minimum of five years after failure has occurred.  They will accept it on the basis of a change in the Constitution extending to them the possibility of a second marriage, something that is not a possibility today.</P>
    <P>But let us not look at this as if it is some sort of flimsy provision that has to impact on the lives of people.  This provision will be seen by many people who are the casualties and victims of <Col N="1715" /> broken marriages as being harsh.  Some may see it as vindictive, as requiring them to serve a sort of marital prison sentence due to the fact that their marriage has collapsed.  But for those people who anxious and concerned that divorce be restrictive, that it should not be easy, that it should be available only in limited circumstances, in so prescribing these conditions, it meets their worries, and I think that view would be held by practically everybody in this House who favours change.  No one is advocating divorce on demand or easy divorce.</P>
    <P>I am concerned as to why this presentation is still being made at this stage.  I do not believe it is sufficient to say that when we come to paragraph (iii) in relation to the specific amendment proposed to it we can then dismiss it because we are not talking about a constitutional article with a series of sub-articles.  We are talking about a single article which states a number of conditions each of which will have equal status and validity which must be complied with before a court could pronounce a decree of divorce.  It is not a reasonable approach by way of legal interpretation and it is not one that I would anticipate an Irish court, the High Court or the Supreme Court or the Family Court taking, simply isolating the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; and looking at it without looking at the totality of the article within which it exists.  The point is worth making that if this is a serious point that Members opposite are making, one must ask why did they not table some form of amendment. Again it is their right not to do that but if it was serious point of contention on the part of Deputy Haughey and Deputy Woods, one would have expected that there might have been a debate that would have involved looking at an alternative form of wording that might be proposed by the party opposite.  Of course we have had Deputy Andrews' contribution in which he has expressed the view that as far as he is concerned this proposal is adequate and fits the bill.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to one other issue. Deputy Woods coined a phrase, and he is very good at coining these phrases and <Col N="1716" /> they appear to be meaningful until one examines their content.  He said that this provision will provide for unilateral divorce.  That is interesting terminology. It is the type of terminology that has been thrown up.  Fortunately it has not appeared in today's debate but it was used last week either by accident or deliberately, to create worry or alarm outside this House on the part of people who are concerned about this issue.  I want to analyse what is meant by unilateral divorce because the reality is in many instances currently that court proceedings are brought unilaterally, when a marriage breaks down.  The 27-year-old wife who is having the hell beaten out of her by her husband, who has been viciously assaulted on a regular basis, unilaterally applies to the courts currently for a barring order for protection.  She may unilaterally currently bring judicial separation proceedings to get a separation decree on the grounds of cruelty. She will not wait until the husband who is beating her gives his permission to go to court to seek protection.  So, if we were to assume this provision would succeed and that the wife would go ahead and get her decree of separation on the grounds of cruelty, and the five year period of separation will pass, she may indeed unilaterally apply for a divorce, seek an entitlement to remarry.  The husband who is beating her might take the view that she should not be allowed to remarry, that she should be constrained into a relationship with him, albeit the courts have granted a decree of separation, because it suits him and he does not want her to remarry.  Is that unilateral divorce?</P>
    <P>In the opinion polls that have been done on this issue in excess of 70 per cent of the people in this country believe that a wife who is being violently treated in that way should have the possibility of a second marriage extended to her.  That is the unilateral divorce law.  A husband may not agree to it.  The courts may take the view that the marriage has failed and that the differences are irreconcilable and that indeed it would be monstrous to require that wife to again live with her husband and may permit her to obtain a <Col N="1717" /> divorce.  What else could be described as a unilateral divorce?  What about the young husband left to care for three children, whose wife leaves him and goes to live with another man?  She lives with that other man permanently but for some perverse reason she may decide she wishes to maintain the legal tie between herself and her husband even though she is living with that other man.  The husband currently could go to court alleging adultery and getting his decree of separation against his wife.  Under this provision if it succeeds, after separation for five years the husband could unilaterally apply to the courts for a divorce and the courts would look at the different aspects of failure, whether the differences have been there for five years or more, whether the differences are irreconcilable, and the husband would be granted a divorce which would extend to him the possibility of a second marriage.  Is anybody suggesting in this context that that husband should have to get the agreement of the wife who is permanently living in adultery in order to obtain a divorce?</P>
    <P>If one is talking about the views, as referred to by Deputy Haughey, of people outside this House and their willingness to accept a restrictive form of divorce, in excess of 70 per cent of the people in a succession of polls going back to 1977 held the view that where either a husband or wife was left by their partner who is living permanently in adultery with someone else, that husband or wife should be entitled to seek a divorce.  What about the wife left in Dublin with three or four children who is deserted by the husband, who is in Cork, Wexford or simply cannot be found?  Has the wife the right to apply unilaterally for the decree of divorce, or must she wait for 15, 20 or 30 years until the husband appears and says he finally agrees and they can have consensual divorce?  This type of terminology, unilateral divorce in this context, is being thrown out without being fully examined as to what is meant by it.</P>
    <P>There are 5,000 couples each year whose marital difficulties being them into the court &mdash; District, Circuit or High <Col N="1718" /> Court.  When court proceedings are initiated, they are initiated unilaterally by either the husband or the wife, and in the overwhelming majority of cases by the wife.  This terminology about unilateral divorce is not meaningful to the discussion, and I do not think it gets us anywhere to talk in those terms.</P>
    <P>In the context of Deputy Haughey's contribution earlier today, he emphasises &mdash; and I agree entirely with this aspect of his contribution &mdash; that there are certain types of words and phrases which can be found in legislation and may be in the Constitution, which can be analysed to indicate the type of approach courts should take.  He gave the classical legal type of area that it was a matter of great contention in litigation in this country, originally arising under the Offences against the State Act, where the difference is between someone being of the opinion that something was the case and someone having to be satisfied that something was the case.  It is worth repeating that the phrase that a court must be satisfied that a series of conditions had been complied with before the court could make an order &mdash; which is what is prescribed within this provision &mdash; is regarded as the most onerous judicial means of assessing whether an order can be made that can be imposed on a judge.  The judge must be satisfied that something is the case, not simply that he is of the opinion.</P>
    <P>That emphasises how this provision copperfastens two objectives, the objective of extending the possibility of remarriage to the casualties of broken marriages, a possibility which is not there at the moment, while providing a guarantee to those who have a very real and genuine concern that this legislation will not provide for easy divorce or for divorce on demand but will provide for divorce solely in limited and restrictive circumstances and will provide the type of constitutional mechanism which ensures that the legislation which is to be enacted in this area will meet the types of conditions the majority of the people believe are desirable.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if Deputy Haughey took my earlier remarks as being personalised or as being a personalised attack.  On the contrary, my comments were to emphasise the importance of Deputy Haughey's views in this matter.  My impression from his comments is that he is sincerely trying to tease out a form of wording which would be acceptable to the majority of our people who have indicated in polls that they would accept divorce under certain restrictive circumstances.  That was the point I was trying to put across.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey said there is a consensus being reached on this question of &ldquo;failed&rdquo;, meaning a consensus that &ldquo;failed&rdquo; is not a satisfactory word.  However, there is not any consensus on what would be a satisfactory word.  If we could get wording which was satisfactory to Deputy Haughey it would be of great importance to the people in any forthcoming referendum.  After all, in the latest opinion polls he represents the views of 50 per cent of the voters.  He is a person of some importance in this debate and that was the only reason that I referred specifically to him.</P>
      <P>My view of the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; is the opposite to Deputy Haughey's.  I believe it will be too difficult to prove to a court that a marriage has failed; Deputy Haughey feels it will be too easy.  This indicates the enormous personal differences people have about what the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; means.  Earlier I gave my views about middle aged conservative judges on the bench and the Minister neatly returned that remark to myself.  He said it appeared I referred to myself; I have to contest that because I am way past being middle aged.  As regards being conservative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;conservative&rdquo; means protecting, preserving and conserving the existing order, which is one of the things judges on the bench feel they are specifically put there to do.  I see my job as trying fundamentally to change <Col N="1720" /> the existing order.  In my view the judges may be difficult to convince that a marriage has failed.  A sociologist or a psychologist in a family court would definitely take a completely different view of failure from that of a legal man. I am worried that it will be very difficult to prove before these courts that a marriage has failed.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Shatter that any difficulty that Deputy Haughey or Deputy Woods might have in regard to the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; in the section not being strong enough or final enough is covered in the later paragraphs, particularly in paragraph (iii) in which you have to prove that there is no reasonable possibility of a reconciliation, which is very difficult to prove to a court.  My difficulty in this whole amendment to the Constitution is that I feel that only a very small proportion of those whom this amendment is set down to help will be helped by the amendment before us, a view completely opposite to that put forward by Deputy Woods, which seems to be that once this is done there will be divorce on demand, that everybody will be getting a divorce.  One would think that this is making divorce compulsory and that you will have to queue up looking for your divorce, from the arguments of many people who are presenting the difficulties here.</P>
      <P>This is a very restrictive bar on families where marriages have irretrievably broken down.  To prove failure, continued failure and no possibility of reconciliation would be very difficult.  I ask the Minister to address his mind to this point. What is his view of the interpretation of failure, of a marriage which has failed? What is his view of the interpretation which judges on the bench, who are put there for a legal purpose, will take of marriage failure as against the view which the Minister has in his mind, the view which a sociologist would take of marriage failure?  That is where I see the difficulty in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; would be a better word.  It is a simpler word to the layman, but I do not know what &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; would mean to the <Col N="1721" /> legal mind.  It seemed at the beginning of this debate that &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; was a better word, being simpler to explain, whereas &ldquo;failed&rdquo; has wider connotations and is much more difficult to explain to different people.  To a person of very liberal views it might be easy to explain and to another person it might be much more difficult to explain.  There is no specific explanation.  That is my only worry about it.  I ask the Minister to satisfy me, from the view of judges in the past and his view of judges who will be on the courts, on how he can see them interpreting that a marriage has failed and what kind of evidence would be required to prove that a marriage has failed, apart from separation.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that we advanced all that far since this afternoon when we started to discuss the difference between &ldquo;failed&rdquo; and &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;.  I was surprised when listening to Deputy Haughey's last contribution because he exhorted us to consider paragraph (iii) of the proposed Article of the Constitution when we came to it.  It cannot be considered a separate part because this is not just part of the one Article, it is part of the one sentence.  For people to suggest here that failure is left there without a means of definition is untrue.  &ldquo;Failed&rdquo; is a word in a sentence which includes several other characteristics that define specifically what failure is.  I have listened to most of the debate today and I am still of the opinion that there is not a great deal of difference between &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; and &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, provided the other words remain as they are.  For example, consider the words &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo;. You could have irretrievable breakdown of a marriage after six months.  Do Deputy Woods and Deputy Haughey hold the position that one substitutes &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo;, takes everything else and leaves it to a judge to satisfy himself that irretrievable breakdown of a marriage has occurred, notwithstanding the fact that the couple have been married for only a year or two years?  It seems that failure, if it lasts for a period of five years and if there is no <Col N="1722" /> reasonable possibility of reconciliation, is a far more stern test of a marriage not working.</P>
      <P>The whole thinking behind the effects of all sides in this debate today, well intentioned though it may be, is slightly unreal because it is crediting our Judiciary with very little common sense. Judges dealing with marriage breakdown cases particularly, even though they have not had the benefit of the professional expertise and the facilities that we envisage giving them now in the family courts, have generally conducted themselves very well in this area, and I have every trust in their judgment.  I am not convinced that &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; as a description on its own is a sterner test of failure over a period of five years with no reasonable possibility of reconciliation.</P>
      <P>The main reasons I rise to my feet at this stage are related to Deputy Woods' introduction again of the phrase &ldquo;unilateral divorce&rdquo;.  I agree very much with Deputy Shatter in dealing with Deputy Woods' contribution with which we have the difficulty that we are not really sure, if one judges by Deputy Woods' contribution of last week or any contribution of his that I have heard today, whether he would recommend any type of divorce or any right to remarry for anybody in this country.  I indicated last week that I believed that divorce was a civil right.  That is my view and I may be right or wrong in that I complimented Deputy Flynn here last night for being clear about his position.  He is against divorce.  He does not believe that people should have the right to remarry in any circumstances.  I admire his candour.  On our side of the House Deputy Glenn, Deputy Flanagan and others have signalled clearly that they are against giving anybody who has been married the right to remarry.  That is fair. I understand their position and I can deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods has not given us the benefit of his thoughts on that.  Were he to do so it might be easier to tease out some of the problems he has at the moment.  His suggestion that this amendment <Col N="1723" /> will permit the possibility of acquiring the right to obtain &ldquo;a unilateral divorce&rdquo;&mdash; whatever that means &mdash; is very difficult to understand.  In his Second Stage contribution last week he quoted, I understood with considerable credit to the sources, the Law Reform Commission and the Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown on the subject of changing the system of determining a person's entitlement to judicial separation from fault to no fault system. He said that the Law Reform Commission recommended in 1983 that the grounds on which judicial separations may be granted should be extended to include desertion, breakdown of marriage and separation for a set period of time.  That is precisely what he complains of on this occasion, that we are somehow proposing to give the right to a spouse to apply for and obtain, by his or her unilateral action only, the permission to remarry.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Woods approve of a change in our laws of judicial separation which will permit one person to move and force the other spouse out of home, to division of property or whatever but will not grant that person on the same grounds the right to remarry?  I ask Deputy Woods, so that we might have the benefit of his views on the subject and know precisely what we are talking about here in this debate, if that is what he means.  In the debate last week he referred again, as I understood it with some agreement and approval, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee when he said that in their report over a year ago they gave their proposal that a decree of judicial separation should be granted if the court is satisfied that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.  They considered that the one overall ground for granting the decree should be irretrievable breakdown.  Of course, irretrievable breakdown is not a fault based system either, albeit it is only in relation to somebody obtaining a judicial separation.  Of its nature that is unilateral.</P>
    <P>Again I challenge Deputy Woods to say whether he believes that a spouse in <Col N="1724" /> a marriage which has run into difficulties should have the right to apply to the court for a decree of judicial separation but not to obtain a divorce decree?  I appeal to Deputy Woods to initiate his position in this regard.  I studied his Second Stage speech and listened to most of his contributions today and I am still at a loss to understand his position as to whether anybody, because of marriage breakdown, should ever be given the right by the courts to remarry.  He wound up his remarks on that part of his contribution last week by saying that these recommendations were aimed at updating the law on judicial separation and ensuring that the arrangements for a couple who separate and their children, would be as helpful and supportive as they could possibly be.  He is right in his analysis that the change in the fault system to a no fault system is to bring about a position whereby these proceedings &mdash; judicial separation or divorce in a very full sense &mdash; would be changed, as in all other jurisdictions of which I am aware, so as to get away from the accusatorial system and to bring about a situation where, from the time a marriage runs into difficulties to the ultimate date when a decree for divorce is granted, the possibility of reconciliation is not excluded and circumstances are conducive to the parties remaining on the best terms possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods &mdash; I say this with every respect as this has been a most constructive debate &mdash; was slightly mischievous in throwing in a remark about unilateral divorce which is inconsistent with his position as outlined on Second Stage last week.  It is also inconsistent with all modern thinking on any form of judicial separation or divorce legislation in the modern world.  It is done, not to give people the right to get anything on demand but to bring about proceedings which will not exclude, inhibit or place obstacles in the course of the possibility of reconciliation.  If Deputy Woods is of the view, as he said in the House last week, that a couple should have the right <Col N="1725" /> to move unilaterally for judicial separation, why does he feel that different grounds should apply for divorce?  If a couple have obtained a judicial separation, are there any circumstances in which Deputy Woods would allow a law giving either or both parties in the marriage the right to remarry?  That is the kernel of this issue and I do not understand his position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter called for the need to bring the debate back to reality but that is a little unfair on those who have been debating this issue for the past couple of hours.  Even if he does not like some of the things he heard, I am certain that when these matters come to court he and others will have great fun teasing out this and other aspects of the proposed legislation.  I can foresee a situation where a lawyer representing one party to a marriage who was not in favour of divorce or the dissolution of marriage would argue that there was little likelihood of reconciliation because the marriage had broken down for a period of five years or more but that the marriage had not failed because there were three lovely children, they went on holidays together once a year and there was a reasonable level of communication between the two parties.  Lawyers will argue on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not against allowing the courts flexibility &mdash; there would be no need for courts if we did not have some flexibility in our laws &mdash; but I am against allowing a judge to have total flexibility in deciding what a failed marriage is because nobody here has said very clearly what they mean by a failed marriage.  Is it a marriage where there are no children or which has not been consummated?  Is it a marriage where people have not lived together for a number of years or where a couple live in the same house but do not have much communication between them?  In so far as anyone can have any degree of certainty, &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; and &ldquo;total&rdquo; are better words than &ldquo;final&rdquo; because you can never say that something has finally <Col N="1726" /> ended, particularly in regard to human relationships.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony referred to the fact that we have not got very far in the debate and that is true because the Minister is not prepared to accept any changes.  That is regrettable because, while we are all trying to achieve the same end results, it is extremely important throughout this campaign that those of us who agree on the fundamentals should not separate or divide on particular words.  For that reason I would not be keen to call for a vote because perhaps only five or seven people would vote in favour of my amendment.  I do not want to add any fuel to what will be a very divisive campaign or to have any unnecessary divisions. However, it is fair to say that there has been a consensus throughout the House today from all sides about the need to be a little clearer about what we are talking about and the unsatisfactory nature of the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is unfair on the parties in the marriage, especially when a marriage has broken down because of the activities of one of the partners rather than as a result of the activities of both partners &mdash; for example, in cases where there is violence, desertion or a failure on the part of one party to fulfil any of the responsibilities of marriage &mdash; to describe that marriage as failed, to assume that both parties are, therefore, failures in some sense and that, as Deputy Woods said, the children of the first marriage will have to live with this stigma.  It would be unwise not to accept that it is much better to recognise that &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; or &ldquo;total breakdown&rdquo; is a much more objective term than the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  Indeed, many judges could argue that a marriage which has irretrievably broken down because of violence or because people were apart for many years has not really failed and that the couple should get together and try to make a success of it.  I can foresee a situation of two couples, in very similar circumstances, one of whom going before Judge X could have their marriage dissolved and divorce granted and the other couple, in almost identical circumstances, appear before Judge Y <Col N="1727" /> who could decide that it was not a failure despite the fact that the circumstances are the same.  The concept of failure is a subjective concept and it leaves the parties to that marriage, the children of that marriage and the friends of the people involved with a certain stigma attached to them although, as I said earlier, in recent years, particularly in our education system, we are at pains to try to get away from the concept of failure. We believe it is a concept that people should not have to live with.  If that is the case in relation to examinations in education, then surely it is the case in relation to marriage and the family.  It is more important in the context of marriage and the family.</P>
    <P>Since we are all trying to do the same thing I think the Minister is being a little unreasonable in his attitude.  When these proposals were produced the Taoiseach said any reasonable effort to amend them in the Dáil or the Seanad would be accepted and in that regard I should like to ask the Minister to bear in mind the views expressed on all sides of the House. Perhaps the Minister would prefer to discuss the matter with his advisers but between now and Report Stage he should be in a position to accept an amendment along the lines I have suggested.  I am not fussy whether the word &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; or &ldquo;total&rdquo; is used before the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;. I accept, as Deputy Haughey said, that it needs some further clarification but I would prefer if we went down the road of breakdown rather than continuing to go on with this business of failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong this part of the debate unnecessarily but I should like to deal with a number of points.  What Deputy Shatter and Deputy Molony said does not require any answer from me.  I regard what they said as statements. Deputy Mac Giolla asked about the specific meaning of the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo;. One of the reasons he is interested in that is that he feels it might be harder to prove failure than to prove breakdown.  That is precisely my point; it is a more stringent <Col N="1728" /> test than breakdown.  In my view that stringency is more in keeping with the view which has been referred to by a number of Members, notably Deputy Haughey, as being the view of a majority of people who have given an opinion on this matter.  A more stringent test is more in keeping with what is the consensus view among our population and, therefore, is the more appropriate one to put into the constitutional amendment.  I do not claim any particular insight or wisdom in making that statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record I should like to point out that I did not say a majority of the people.  What I said was a majority of those who would be in favour of divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going a little further in that.  I have said a majority of those who have been sampled on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is attributing that to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am attributing to the Deputy, correctly in my view, a reference to those people and a reference to the view they appear to hold on the basis of the polls that have been carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument was that the majority of those who would have stated they were in favour of divorce would only be in favour of it in very stringent final breakdown circumstances. I wanted to make my position clear on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I have no difficulty whatever in accepting that this is Deputy Haughey's position.  I do not have any difficulty in accepting, on the basis of the polls that have been carried out, that that would appear to be the position of a majority of people.  Equally there is no doubt that a very substantial majority of those who favour divorce in some kind of circumstances favoured it in very restricted circumstances.  The burden of my case is that the test of failure as provided for in the proposed amendment is a more stringent test than <Col N="1729" /> the test of breakdown whether or not we qualify &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; by &ldquo;total&rdquo; or &ldquo;complete&rdquo; or whatever word may be applied to it.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Harney was being all that fair to her case when she said she was not particularly fussy about the qualification that is applied to it. Deputy Harney is still making the case that she prefers to see breakdown as the basis.  She has given the example of a couple with three children who have gone on holidays every year for a period of years and have reasonable communication and says that is not a marriage that one could describe as having failed.  I agree with that.  Equally it seems to me that it is not a marriage that one could describe as having broken down.  I do not think Deputy Harney is making the case that we should describe that kind of case as either a breakdown or a failure.  I would not describe it as such and under the provisions in the draft amendment to the Constitution a situation like that would not constitute a case of a failure of marriage, to say nothing about the other criteria.</P>
      <P>The notion of breakdown, whether it is irretrievable, complete or anything else, is in my view a less stringent test than failure.  If we were to pursue that it is the Government's view, and my view, that we would be pursuing a road that would lead to the granting of the dissolution of marriage on less stringent grounds than would appear to be the kind of grounds the majority which Deputy Haughey and I referred to earlier want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney felt it was unfair of me not to be prepared to accept any change. I am not setting my face against any change.  I have made it clear that I do not agree with the amendment Deputy Harney has proposed, nor would I accept an amendment simply for the sake of accepting a change although I agree with Deputy Harney's concern.  On the issues where we do agree we should make that agreement as wide as possible.  The reason I do not agree with her proposal is that I believe the concept of breakdown is a less stringent test than the concept of failure.  I do not believe the question of <Col N="1730" /> irretrievability falls to be discussed in relation to the amendment Deputy Harney has put down because it is dealt with in Part II (iii) in the Bill.  I am sorry if Deputy Harney finds that excessively obdurate.  The only reason I do not accept the amendment is that I find it does not provide the stringency in the test the Government believe is required.</P>

      <P>The Deputy made great play on the last occasion, in the hope <Col N="1731" /> that he could bring confrontation into the day's business, with certain references to the Leader of our party and the reason why he was not in the House at the time. I put it to Deputy Molony that he had the story all wrong.  Indeed, he told me on that occasion that he would be very pleased, if it transpired that what I was telling him was accurate, to withdraw his remarks.  But he has not been gracious enough so far to do so.  I suppose, in the realms of the kind of fantasy the Deputy spends most of his time debating in this House, he is not going to withdraw anything on this occasion either.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note what is going on here this evening, because the confusion that exists in people's minds as to the intention of the Government on the whole question of this legislation is compounded by the confusion now existing between some of the people who are the proponents of this divorce legislation as being the proper means of dealing with marital breakdown.  It seems that the members of the Progressive Democrats are not satisfied that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is adequate for their purposes, in simple language, that it is not a good word in this context.  That is the only issue that has been decided here this evening &mdash; that there is confusion in the minds of those who wish divorce legislation to be introduced here.  We are moving legislation for the purpose of seeking a mandate from the people to bring divorce legislation into play in this country.  Yet they cannot even agree among themselves. The general public are entitled to be aware of that.  Those pushing for divorce are divided on the most fundamental issue of all, as to what wording would be put before the people by way of referendum. If that is not making a nonsense of the whole legislation as it was intended in this House, I do not know what could be more divisive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no divisiveness being perpetrated by Members on this side of the House.  We have at least teased out, by a full and lengthy procedure, what is the source of the real divisiveness in the whole issue, which is the fact that the <Col N="1732" /> Minister, the Government, some of their backbenchers are at variance with The Workers' Party, the Progressive Democrats, all of those whom they would like to have in their net going forward.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another interesting fact I would have to put to Deputy Mary Harney concerning this matter.  I have found that she has not been consistent in this debate from the beginning.  Again, this evening I find the inconsistency goes right to the kernel, to the core of her position in this debate.  We and the general public were led to believe for some considerable time that there was an attitude, a position, being taken by that party in so far as the divorce issue was concerned. That has not been the case.  It has been very evident from Deputy Harney's contribution this evening that that position promulgated by her party for some <Col N="1733" /> time is not consistent with what will transpire in this House concerning these matters. She stated categorically that she cannot support the Minister's point of view, that the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; constitutes a more stringent test than would the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;.  On the other hand, she is not prepared to put it to the test in the House here.  I do not care whether or not she has to stand up alone.  Had she the courage of her convictions at least she would follow through on what she has been protesting here for the longest time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure I know full well what offends Deputy Mary Harney in so far as this is concerned.  She is not prepared to put it to the vote and slips in that little aside in the midst of her last contribution so as to put people on notice that there was no way she was going to embarrass any of the members of her party into coming in here and voting against her.  That is what it is all about. That position has been further clarified from her contribution on the last occasion she spoke here when she made a statement, after I had taken her up on it, that her party had changed position over the last couple of weeks when she said that most of the party were for divorce, suggesting of course that there were some who were against divorce.  I have no objection whatever to people holding their personal views but I hate the hypocrisy of people trying to promote one point of view out in the countryside, coming in here and not being prepared to follow through on what they had not been promoting for the last couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Molony, who has now taken himself hence, knows full well, my position has always been quite clear on this matter.  There is only one problem so far as Deputy Molony's attitude toward my position is concerned &mdash; and he is wrong in so far as there are no circumstances whatever in which I would not allow somebody to remarry in this country. The position is as follows.  If it is <Col N="1734" /> decided by a court of law in this country, after a case of civil nullity being taken, that no marriage existed and if the people who sought that also provided themselves, if they belong to a particular Church, with a corresponding Church annulment, in those circumstances only why would they not be allowed to remarry?  There is nothing against them remarrying in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned, the Minister himself in the course of the debate so far has been adding to the confusion that exists in the minds of the electorate.  Far from teasing out the matter here and bringing something to a finality, which would be of benefit to the electorate in helping them to make up their minds finally one way of the other on this matter, the Minister has been adding to that confusion.  I am satisfied that the Minister had been adding to that confusion for some time even before this debate took place here today.  Bearing in mind the way this legislation was framed in the first instance it must be understood &mdash; recognising the polls to which the Minister referred himself in the course of his introductory remarks, recognising the fact that the majority of people, it would appear from recent polls, were in favour of divorce in limited circumstances to accommodate that and devise a formula of words that would give the edge to accommodate that poll &mdash; that by putting with it a list of proposed Government intentions the Minister hoped to confuse the electorate still further.  That is unfair of the Minister because, whether he likes it or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comment in that regard.  However, the only question which must be decided by the general public when they go to the polls is whether they are voting for or against divorce.  It is not fair to suggest to them otherwise.  The Government may pick whatever formula of words they like and issue whatever Government statement of intention they like, but that tends to confuse the issue.  The only question the general public wish to have determined is whether they are for or against divorce.</P>

      <P>If the Minister would stop interrupting I could deal with these amendments.  He makes great play with the possible difference in interpretation between failure and breakdown.  I must agree with the Members who put the point to him that there is no definition of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; in anything he has said so far.  I must make reference to that in so far as the Government statement of intention is concerned.  It would have been expected, at least when that word was being used as against any other formula of words and since it was being introduced for the first time by the Government and had not been hinted at or suggested by anybody before, that there would have been a definition.  These were 18 months of discussion and consideration of all aspects of marriage breakdown undertaken by the joint committee and the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; was never introduced by any speaker on either side of the divide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a new phraseology and had to be introduced for a particular purpose, other than, as the Minister has said, being a more stringent and better test than if the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; were used.  It would <Col N="1737" /> have been expected that the opportunity would have been taken in the Government statement of intention which accommodates the legislation, to give a definition of the word used.  That is a fair and reasonable request to make.  But it was not attended to and has not been attended to here this evening.  Those who have complained bitterly about the failure to give a suitable definition of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; have a case made and to be answered.  It has not been answered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A considerable length of time was spent by the committee in discussing the pros and cons and the formula of breakdown or irretrievable breakdown.  I hope I am quoting him correctly, but I think it was Brian McMahon who said &ldquo;There is nothing irretrievable absolutely, certainly not this side of the grave.&rdquo;  I understand that failure, breakdown, or whatever word is used is nothing more than a formula of words to allow &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; divorce to be introduced into this country.  The ordinary person in the street sees it like that &mdash; as easy divorce in certain circumstances.  It is not true to say this is restrictive divorce legislation which is being suggested.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; as distinct from the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;.  This will not be restrictive legislation.  One must look at the evolution of divorce in other jurisdictions which points to the fact that this is very much nondescript and will make for easy divorce being made available in this jurisdiction. I must also make objection to the statement of intention because the Government have made it part and parcel of the introduction of this legislation and there is nothing in that statement which can stand up in law.  On Second Stage the Minister spoke of legislation that might be introduced.  He indicated the element of doubt which must exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister has a marriage failed if people separate for a period of time and then, for some reason, find it possible to be reconciled?  I put the case of an individual saying to me that had divorce legislation been in existence when they contracted their marriage some years previously they would both have been quite willing to become involved in divorce proceedings voluntarily. Some years later they found that matters and circumstances had changed and they were reconciled.  They are now perfectly happy and I would have to say to the Minister what a shame it would have been if divorce legislation had been in place and those people had utilised that legislation to part forever more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What a pity it would be if we, as legislators, were to contribute to bringing about a formula of words which would increase not just the rate of marital breakdown but the number of divorces that might be obtained in the jurisdiction.  I suggest to the Minister that it is not an isolated case I am talking about and many marriages in the early stages do have difficult times of adjustment.  Couples realise they have a commitment for life and consider it <Col N="1741" /> worth while making every effort at conciliation and reconciliation.  Many marriages have been saved and subsequently have proved not just to be happy but successful in every other way also.  That is the great fear amongst the electorate. If they were to allow divorce legislation to be introduced it might result in an increase in marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>It was an extraordinary statement by the Taoiseach at the weekend to suggest otherwise.  Subsequently, he might have withdrawn from his stated point of view but it only goes to show again the confused thinking which exists at Government level concerning this matter.  My understanding of it is that many of his backbenchers, like Deputy Molony, were so horrified that he should make that statement that they insisted it be withdrawn, at least in part.  I take the Minister on good faith here as he is not the type of person who would seek to confuse the electorate.  The Minister would like to put them in a position where they would have a clear decision to take in so far as the wording is concerned and that there would be at least unity &mdash; at least I would like to see unity &mdash; on the side of those who are proposing divorce. That would be preferable in so far as those people are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa has got to understand that what is happening here this evening is that we see a situation evolving where even those on the one side of the issue cannot agree among themselves.  We have a very entrenched position by Deputy Harney and we have an equally entrenched position on behalf of the Minister.  I regret that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the basic fundamental question the people have to decide is whether they wish to introduce divorce legislation and whether that would be in the best interests of the family and the country.  I believe you cannot legalise divorce without altering radically the whole concept <Col N="1742" /> of marriage and the family.  I wish we could agree at least on that, that it will result in an altering of the general concept as to what marriage and the family stand for as enshrined in the Constitution. At least, it was clearly stated there.  Deputy Dowling and I both agreed on that.  Not only did we agree on the fact that it was clearly stated and what the people required and wished the Constitution to mean for them but we also agreed, along with many others, that in no way did we want the thrust of Article 41 changed, irrespective of what happened.  That simply stated that we wished the protection and understanding of marriage and the family as laid down in the Constitution would not be altered by anything the Government might do.  I have to put to Deputy Dowling and others who supported that point of view so vehemently on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown that they were so entrenched in their views that no way would they ever stand by and see the thrust, meaning and spirit of Article 41 altered to accommodate divorce.  I would dearly like to see those people come in and defend the point of view they put forward over that period of 18 months on that committee, which regrettably has not happened.</P>
    <P>Finally, I regret that the Minister seems to suggest and presumes to know what the courts' interpretation might be on the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  He must be stating that when he refuses to take on board Deputy Harney's point of view.  The Minister goes on to say &mdash; he makes a big point of it &mdash; that divorce will be very difficult to get.  It is very strange that he can make that point, and he certainly makes it by referring to the other matters also &mdash; the question of the five year period being involved and the question of a reasonable possibility of reconciliation having being engaged in.  One could easily dispose of paragraph (iii) but that is for another day.</P>
    <P>Taking the words even at face value, &ldquo;a reasonable possibility of reconciliation&rdquo; requires only the exchange of sentiments between two individuals that there is no reasonable chance of reconciliation to <Col N="1743" /> accommodate that little item.  In so far as the second one is concerned, the question of a period or periods amounting to five years, that is probably in more ways than one the sweetener which was decided on by the Government in the hope that they would get the necessary percentage over the line.  I do not see that as being an honest response to what was required.  It would have been much more suitable if the Minister had not used the formula of words as laid out in the second part of the Schedule.  Even at this late stage the Minister might make some changes and we could see further what he has in mind. He leads us all further down the avenue of confusion by saying that even at this late stage, having told Deputy Harney that he was in no way going to alter his mind, his mind is not fully closed either. I do not understand that talk from the Minister above anybody in the House. He is not that kind of person and has never been.  One can say what one likes about him, one can like him or love him, but he has never tried to involve himself in double talk in the House at that level.</P>

      <P>When the Minister quoted the example which I gave he said he did not think that that was a marriage which had broken down.  It may be modern breakdown but I know of situations where people have separations, they are living apart and have been for a substantial number of years but they can still get together once a year with their children, perhaps at Christmas or during the summer.  Basically they still have a good friendship which is possible even in a marriage which has broken down.  It is desirable that that kind of relationship would continue between the parents rather than total confrontation where people rarely ever meet except in cases of absolute necessity.  In many cases children are totally ignored as a result. Even with the introduction of this kind of legislation one would hope that parents would still exercise joint rights over guardianship of their children and that they would still jointly make decisions in regard to education and matters of that kind.  That should be encouraged.  It does not mean that a marriage is successful, that a marriage has not broken down or that there is reason why divorce could not be considered in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to some of the comments made by Deputy Flynn, it is unfortunate when we hear people using words like hypocrisy.  Most of us regretted the tone of last week's debate but were very pleased with the tone of this evening's debate.  There was a general air of calm and rationale around the House.  People were discussing the issue very seriously until Deputy Flynn started accusing me of hypocrisy, of not pursuing the amendment <Col N="1746" /> and calling a vote.  First of all, the amendment put down in my name is down on behalf of all five members of this party.  When the Labour Party Bill was introduced in this House all of those five members voted for that Bill.  Equally, in this party as in all other parties, there are many people who do not fundamentally agree with the need for divorce legislation. It would be a very unhealthy party if there were not people of that kind.  I would say to Deputy Flynn that there is a difference in the wording between myself and the Minister just as there is a difference between the approach of Deputy O'Hanlon and that of Deputy Flynn or between the approach of Deputy O'Hanlon and the approach of Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Glenn.  There is a vast difference in their approach.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy O'Hanlon outlined a very good case against divorce but he did so in a very calm, rational and meaningful way.  That could not be said of many of the other Members on that side of the House.  Differences can occur and people should not read too much into those differences.  I am enough of a political realist to know that there is no point in calling a vote on an issue of this kind when one knows that only five or seven people will vote for it simply because one wishes to pursue a principle of one kind or another.  Deputy Flynn, despite his protestations for many years that he would always vote against divorce legislation in this House, did not choose to call a vote last week or did not choose to vote against the Labour Party Bill when it was being discussed.  It is unfair that words such as that are used and that we are accused of things simply because we try to improve legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting facts about this evening's discussion is that Deputy Haughey and I agree about the unsatisfactory nature of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  We agree even though we have two different points of view.  I believe the whole concept is far too subjective and restrictive. Deputy Haughey believes that it is not restrictive or stringent enough.  We can come to virtually the same conclusion while approaching it from totally different <Col N="1747" /> sides.  That is often the case on issues of this kind.  The debate today was very good and worthwhile.  I wish to ensure above all else that political difference in this debate is minimised and in so far as possible that we can come to some consensus and agreement because this kind of issue is above party politics. I want to see this amendment succeed and I want to see divorce legislation introduced even if it is extremely restrictive, far more restrictive than I would wish.  It would be preferable to the situation which we have at the moment.  I do not underestimate the difficult task that lies ahead for those of us who want to see this amendment succeed.  Already there are signs that many people outside this House and indeed within it are beginning to misrepresent the issues.  There are many people in first marriages, in particular women, who are gravely worried about the consequences of this legislation because of the false information they get from many groups who claim to be responsible.  They have no need to be worried.</P>

      <P>When we are sitting here for a number of hours I am not surprised what kind of words we use.  I am not fussy as between the words &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; or &ldquo;total&rdquo;.  They both signify the same thing, that the relationship between the two parties to the marriage has ended and broken down and is very unlikely ever to be reconciled.  It is a better concept.  It is <Col N="1748" /> better for the people involved and for the courts.  At the end of the day it may be founds that it would have been a more satisfactory way to describe what has happened. No doubt, throughout this debate there will be many examples given of marriages that may not have totally worked out but can well be described as not having failed.  We are leading ourselves into an unfortunate position by insisting on using the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; but I accept the political reality of the situation. For that reason I do not see the need to call a vote.</P>

      <P>(c)  have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions since 5 January 1953 or his entry into insurance, if later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no plans to include insurance contributions paid prior to 1953, which was the date when the present unified scheme of social insurance came into <Col N="1506" /> effect, in calculating the yearly average of contributions.</P>
    <P>The issue raised by the Ombudsman in regard to the average test was that calculating the average from 1953 resulted in certain persons with gaps in their record between 1953 and 1974, when the remuneration limit for social insurance was abolished, not qualifying for pension.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for assessment of means are set out in the Social Welfare Acts.  Applications for unemployment assistance are investigated by social welfare officers who are appointed by the Minister under the Social Welfare Acts.  Decisions as to entitlement to assistance including the amount of means to be assessed are determined by deciding officers and appeals officers taking account of the report of the investigating officer.</P>
      <P>Community welfare officers are officers of health boards and are concerned with the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The determination of entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance in any case is a matter for the chief executive officer of the health board and he may delegate his functions in this regard.

A further sum of £33,000 will be provided by the Arts Council, which functions under the aegis of my Department, to help meet part of the operating costs of the Grapevine Arts Centre, 31 North Frederick Street.

      <P>The factory as planned in 1982 would have had a capacity to produce 150,000 tonnes of briquettes per annum.  In the event of the project being proceeded with at a future date the required production capacity would have to be assessed at that time.</P>

      <P>Honorary Consuls, Honorary Consuls General &mdash; In addition to offices headed by and staffed by career officers Ireland has 41 offices headed by Honorary Consuls or Honorary Consuls General.  The function of such offices is to provide basic consular services in return for a nominal honorarium and a proportion of any consular fees they may collect.  They are themselves expected to bear the costs of providing staff time and premises.  The officers in question are not career civil servants and they have no diplomatic role.  The consular functions of such offices relate mainly to providing consular documents or certificates, accepting applications for Irish visas, helping or advising Irish citizens in emergencies, providing certain passport services, and similar matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such offices can also provide routine information material on Irish tourism, culture or the economy.  It is not however their function to become involved in <Col N="1518" /> giving information on Irish political or diplomatic matters, and in fact they are precluded from doing so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have consistently voiced our concern about the threat imposed by the existence of nuclear weapons.  In our advocacy of and support for arms control and disarmament measures we have paid particular attention to those in the nuclear field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) lies at the heart of the Government's policy of disarmament.  This Treaty remains one of the most important arms control agreements yet concluded.  In addressing the Third NPT Review Conference in August 1985 I made the point that it brings together 129 states in a commitment that nuclear weapons shall not constitute a basis for security in the long term, that it contributes to stability now by preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons capability, and that it <Col N="1519" /> looks forward to the elimination of these weapons as instruments of force.</P>
    <P>The Government have made considerable efforts in the recent past to see that the Treaty is effectively upheld.  During the last review of the implementation of the NPT, Ireland actively contributed to bringing the various parties together in a common understanding of the responsibility which falls to each to implement its part of the Treaty: for the nuclear weapons states to eliminate their nuclear arsenals and for the non-nuclear weapons states to remain steadfast in their repudiation of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has pointed to the danger of the acquisition of nuclear weapons capability by non-nuclear weapons states &mdash; what is known as horizontal proliferation. It is true to say that since the NPT came into force, nuclear weapons capability has been acquired by a number of states.  Ireland and the other parties to the NPT have consistently implemented their commitments under the Treaty to prevent the wider dissemination of nuclear weapons to those few states which are not party to the Treaty and which seek to acquire nuclear weapons capability.</P>
    <P>As a practical demonstration of our continuing efforts to prevent any access by such countries to the technologies and equipment used for nuclear explosive devices, the Government in 1984 adhered to the London Supplier Guidelines, designed to control the export of any material, equipment and technology <Col N="1520" /> transfer which could be used for nuclear explosive devices.</P>
    <P>In addition during Ireland's Presidency of the European Community in 1984, a common Declaration of Common Policy on the Consequences of the Adoption of the London Guidelines was adopted by the Ten.  Ireland also co-operates with other parties to the NPT in the Zangger Committee in implementing Nuclear Supplier controls designed to curb attempts by countries not parties to the Treaty to acquire nuclear weapons capability.</P>

      <P>The provision and maintenance of public conveniences is a matter for each local sanitary authority.  To assist local authorities I make available to them both capital and subsidies towards annual loan charges in respect of the provision of sanitary conveniences and instructions issued to them have emphasised the need to maintain public toilets in good repair.</P>
      <P>I understand that complaints received by Bord Fáilte regarding public toilets are taken up by them direct with the local authority concerned in each case.  I would hope that, as part of the national &ldquo;CleanUp Ireland&rdquo; week which I have announced to take place during the first week of July next, local authority's will pay particular attention to this area.</P>

      <P>In June 1981 the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants (UPTCS) lodged a claim for a restructuring of the forester grades.  This was the subject of discussions between the Union and the then Department of Fisheries and Forestry during the period 1981 to 1983. In June 1983 the Union changed the restructuring claim to a basic salary claim.  The latter claim was that which was heard at arbitration in June 1985 and the arbitrator's finding was received by the Minister for the Public Service on 5 March 1986.</P>
      <P>In the course of negotiations on the 25th round and related matters certain proposals were put to the unions which took account of the special factors which existed in the case of some of the UPTCS findings, for example, that offers had been made prior to arbitration but had been rejected by the union.  UPTCS did not accept the package of proposals then offered.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with UPTCS on 10 May, I indicated that I was prepared to look again at the outstanding arbitration findings with a view to securing an agreement on the same broad lines as for the teachers.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received the submission to which the Deputy refers and a reply has issued from my office.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, section 50 of the Finance Bill increases the restriction on capital allowances for business cars and the <i>pro rata</i> restriction on the running expenses of such cars from £3,500 to £4,000.  This is the first time since 1976 that these restrictions have been increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the increase is a modest <Col N="1547" /> one, but I took the opportunity of explaining why it is not possible to improve upon it when I spoke in this House at the commencement of the Second Stage of the Finance Bill on 15 April 1986.  I stated then:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The cost to the Exchequer in raising the restriction to a level consistent with present prices for appropriate cars would be quite prohibitive and is out of the question at this time.  It would also be inequitable since it is clear that many of those who have business cars enjoy a considerable advantage over other taxpayers who must meet all their motoring expenses out of after tax income.  This is due to the fact that the private benefit derived from the business car is subject to less income tax than monetary income.  In these circumstances, it would not be fair to ask these other taxpayers &mdash; and, indeed, taxpayers who cannot afford to run a car at all &mdash; to bear the cost of a substantial increase in the restriction.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The general hospital requirements of the Clare population are kept under regular review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1981 a Project Team, representative of my Department and of the Mid-Western Health Board, was established and <Col N="1549" /> carried out a detailed investigation of the future accommodation requirements of Ennis General Hospital.  This Project Team completed a comprehensive planning brief which covers all aspects of services, including surgery, at the hospital. It provides the blueprint to guide developments at the hospital as resources can be made available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In 1984 a major extension was provided to the x-ray department at a cost of £300,000.  In 1985 the new maternity unit in Cahercalla was opened and the transfer of maternity patients from the General Hospital allowed additional accommodation to be made available for other services.</P>
    <P>At present the operating theatres and surgical wards are being up-graded and this work is expected to be completed by the end of June or early July.  In order to facilitate this work a temporary reduction of the bed numbers has been necessary but the full number of beds will be restored when the work is completed. With these developments I am confident that Ennis Hospital will continue to provide an adequate service for the people of Clare.</P>

The question of providing resources for the setting up of the hostel will be considered by the health board in the first instance.  A number of factors will have a bearing on the outcome of this consideration.  These include the need for the service and the degree of priority to be attached to it, having regard to the many other demands for available resources.</P>

    <P>Not all of the factors known to or thought to impact on the incidence of cancer are amenable to intervention by the health services.  The measures being taken to combat the disease within the remit of the health services are concerned with prevention firstly, secondly, diagnosis and treatment after the onset of the disease and thirdly, research.</P>
    <P>In recongnition of the impact of personal lifestyle on individual health the Health Education Bureau was established in 1975 to provide advice and education on health matters to the general public.  In 1986 the bureau's budget is £2 million. Much of the bureau's activity is concerned with the prevention of lifestyle related diseases, including cancer.  A prominent example, is the bureau's various anti-smoking campaigns.</P>
    <P>Also, in the area of smoking, now known to be a major contributory factor <Col N="1557" /> in many cancer deaths, a number of controls are exercised on the promotion of tobacco products.  On 9 May, I signed new Tobacco Products Regulations which, when they come into operation later this year, will help emphasise the risks to health from smoking.  Under the new Regulations, which replace Regulations made in 1979, advertisements and packages of cigarettes will be required to carry in rotation, more forceful health warnings.  Warnings will be displayed on the front and back of packages and will occupy an increased area of the package as will the warning on advertisements for tobacco products.  The Regulations also provide for stricter controls on the conduct of events sponsored by tobacco companies.</P>
    <P>In addition to these Regulations, I intend, shortly, to introduce a new Tobacco (Health Protection) Bill, which will prohibit or restrict smoking in a variety of designated public places.</P>
    <P>In regard to diagnosis and treatment many of the health services are concerned with the curative or palliative treatment of cancer.  These include general practitioner and public health nursing, the refund of drugs scheme, and out-patient or in-patient diagnostic and treatment services in acute hospitals.  In the case of cervical cancer a screening service is available nationally.  Patients suffering from cancer may be treated in general hospitals or specialised radiotherapy units depending on the form of the disease in individual cases.  The standards of treatment available in Ireland are comparable to those provided in other developed countries.</P>
    <P>The Medical Research Council of Ireland has conducted numerous projects related to cancer research.</P>

      <P>I have proposed to the Western Health Board that a 30 bed psychiatric unit should be provided from within existing accommodation in Roscommon County Hospital.  The health board agrees to the provision of the unit but considers that it should be provided by way of new building on the hospital grounds.  The matter is at present the subject of correspondence between my Department and the health board and until it has been resolved, it is <Col N="1563" /> not possible to estimate the capital cost of the project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned submitted a claim for retirement pension on 7 February 1986.  He reached retirement pension age of 65 years on 3 November 1985.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from the year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The Department's records show that the person concerned had a total of 60 reckonable contributions in the relevant period, which in his case is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1985.  This is equal to a yearly average of only one and is not sufficient to qualify for a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts. Neither will he qualify for an old age contributory pension at age 66.  A yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions is required for this latter pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> Where a person was also employed in another EC country his insurance in that country may be combined with his Irish record to enable him to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension, calculated on the basis of the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total in the relevant period.  The person concerned was employed in Great Britain and details of his British insurance record are awaited from the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. His entitlement to a <i>pro rata</i> pension will be determined when those details are received.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded an old age pension at the weekly rate of £18 from 6 December 1985.  This is the rate to which she is entitled having regard to the assessment of her means, consisting of half the weekly value of a holding.</P>
      <P>In 1976 her husband was awarded an old age pension at the maximum rate when he transferred the holding to their son.  Since the death of his son, however, he is in beneficial occupation of the holding and he, too, is only entitled to a pension of £18 a week.  Appeals against rates of pension in payment to the couple have been referred to an appeals officer and the pensioners will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on <Col N="1565" /> 6 November 1985 and, on the basis of the information available, her claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her case on 15 April 1986.  The appeals officer, however, also disallowed her appeal.  She continues to sign the unemployed register and her claim will again be reviewed to ascertain whether she satisfies the statutory conditions from 16 April 1986, that is the day after the appeals officer's decision.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking employment.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 3 February 1986 but her claim was disallowed by a deciding officer who was of the opinion that, she was not available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing on 22 April 1986 at which she was given an opportunity of presenting her case, but the appeals officer disallowed her appeal.  She was notified of the decision.  She continued to sign the unemployed register and further inquiries are now being made to establish if she satisfies the required conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit from 23 April 1986, that is the day following the appeals officer's decision.  When these inquiries are completed her entitlement to unemployment benefit from 23 April 1986 will be determined.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the conditions that a claimant must have not less than 26 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment and at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the contribution year governing the claim.</P>
      <P>When the person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 24 March 1986, he supplied an incorrect Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number and consequently, it was not possible to ascertain whether he satisfied the relevant contribution conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit.

He appealed against the disallowance of benefit and was examined by a different medical referee on 1 May 1986 who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>He was informed of the result of this examination and was supplied with a form on which to set out the grounds for appeal if he wished to have his case referred to an appeals officer for determination.  His case will be reviewed on receipt of this form.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 3 March 1986 to 19 March 1986 and was paid at the weekly rate of £39.50, the maximum rate appropriate to a single man.  Due to an administrative error, which is regretted, the two cheques which issued to the person concerned were issued to an incorrect address.  Replacement cheques have been issued to the correct address and all benefit payable to the person concerned has now been issued.</P>

      <P>Following investigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned in December 1983 he was assessed with means of £24 weekly derived from the value of board and lodgings on his parents' holding.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance of £9.80 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £33.80, less means of £24.</P>
      <P>The person concerned did not appeal against the amount of means assessed against him.  However, if he feels that his circumstances have changed since the investigation took place it is open to him to apply for a review of his means.

      <P>The person concerned has been claiming unemployment benefit since 4 June 1985 and she is required to attend at her local employment office on Friday on each week to sign the unemployed register as evidence of being unemployed.</P>
      <P>When she attended the local office on 18 April 1986, she indicated that she would be unable to sign the register on the following Friday, 25 April 1986, because she would be attending a wedding on that day.  She was given a form to complete to enable her to nominate a person of her choice to collect unemployment benefit in respect of the period 17 April 1986 to 23 April 1986, which would normally be paid to her on 25 April 1986. The person nominated duly collected the payment due on 25 April 1986.</P>
      <P>The person concerned next attended personally at her local office on 2 May 1986, but as she did not prove unemployment, by signing the unemployed register, for Friday, 25 April 1986, her unemployment benefit entitlement for the period 24 April 1986 to 30 April 1986 was reduced by one day for that week.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the contribution year governing the claim.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 26 November 1985. Inquiries had to be made to establish if her employment during the contribution period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984, which governed her claim, was appropriate to a contribution class which provides cover against unemployment.</P>
      <P>The inquiries have now been completed and her claim has been allowed at £33.65 weekly, which is the appropriate rate applicable in her case.  The weekly rate was increased to £38.05 from 15 May 1986 in line with the increase in rates payable to married women under the equal treatment provisions made operative by the Social Welfare Act, 1986. Arrears of benefit due will be paid to her this week and further weekly payments will be made as they become due.  Her entitlement to pay-related benefit is being examined at present.</P>

      <P>Following investigation of his unemployment assistance claim, the means of the person concerned were assessed at £6.70 weekly with effect from 25 March 1985.  His means are derived <Col N="1579" /> from self-employment.  He was, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £56.25 on his claim from 25 March 1985 to 29 June 1985.  This was the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £62.95, less means of £6.70.  Following a general increase in the rates of unemployment assistance in July 1985, the person concerned was paid at the weekly rate of £60.35 in respect of claims from 23 August 1985 to 2 December 1985 and from 13 January 1986 to 3 April 1986. This was the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £67.05, less means of £6.70.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the means assessment and an appeals officer also assessed his means at £6.70 weekly.  Notification of the appeals officer's decision was sent to the local office for issue to the person concerned but it was mislaid in the post. However, he has now been notified of the decision.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts at age 65 requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  A yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contribution is required to qualify for an old age contributory pension at age 66.</P>

    <P>The Department's records show the person concerned has a total of 1,072 <Col N="1580" /> reckonable contributions from 5 January 1953 to 31 December 1973.  This is sufficient to qualify him for either pension at the current rate of £48.25 per week.

      <P>His case was again reviewed in March 1986 and a deciding officer again assessed him with means of £10 derived from self-employment.

      <P>When the husband's death was notified to the Department in 1983 she was asked to return the book issued in her name to enable a widow's contributory pension to be put into payment for her.  As she did not return the book a widow's pension could not be awarded.  However, the increase in respect of her as an adult dependant continued in payment to her up to the end of March 1986.</P>
      <P>The matter has now been regularised. A letter was received from the local post office on 1 May 1986 saying that the person's pension book for April had not been received.

According to the Department's records, he had only a total of 25 contributions paid and credited during the contribution period 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985, which governed his claim and, accordingly, his claim for unemployment benefit was disallowed.</P>

      <P>During the recent price-fixing negotiations the Commission proposed a 1.98 per cent devaluation of the Irish green pound for animal products and 1 per cent for other products.  Following strong pressure, I succeeded in achieving the maximum 3 per cent green pound devaluation for animal products and 1.5 per cent for the others.  The 3 per cent rate applies to products which account for about 80 per cent of our gross agricultural output, while products subject to the lower adjustment account for less than 7 per cent.  The arrangements made provide for the elimination of all MCA charges in our case and I regard this as a satisfactory outcome.</P>

It is the responsibility of each vocational education committee to provide cover by way of insurance policies against damage by fire to their property and against public liability in the matter of accidents.

      <P>In relation to national schools, I am not aware of any significant level of complaint that the provision for physical education equipment is inadequate.

Current or capitation grant to <Col N="1597" /> these schools would be expected to meet in some measure the cost of a variety of small items such as balls, ropes, hoops and bats.</P>
      <P>In so far as vocational, community and comprehensive schools are concerned adequate provision is made in the annual budgets allocated to meet the needs of these schools.  These budgets allow for the provision of necessary equipment including equipment for physical education.</P>
      <P>The provision of physical education equipment in secondary schools which are privately owned and managed institutions is a matter for the schools themselves. Apart from the payment by my Department of a per capita grant of £140 per annum in respect of schools participating in the free education scheme (92 per cent participation rate) secondary schools can also seek grants towards the cost of purchasing physical education and other equipment under a special scheme of grants operated by my Department.
