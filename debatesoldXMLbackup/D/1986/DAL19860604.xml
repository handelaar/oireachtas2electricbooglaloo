      <P>I understand that amendments can be small or large but we are dealing with legislation that concerns nationality and citizenship.  I should like to register my objection to being asked to deal with amendments to an important piece of legislation when I received them in my post this morning.

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  In page 2, line 14, after &ldquo;who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after the passing of the <i>Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986,&rdquo;</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is purely a technical amendment to <Col N="850" /> clarify the meaning of section 2 of the Bill.  Section 2 inserts a proviso after paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section 7 of the 1956 Act.  Under the proviso the citizenship of people who register under section 27 shall commence only as and from the date of such registration.  At present it is accepted that the citizenship of such persons dates from their date of birth or the date of the passing of the 1956 Act, whichever is the later.  The purpose of the amendment I am now proposing is to protect the position of persons who register under the provisions of section 7 of the 1956 Act as it stands, that is, to ensure that the effective date of their citizenship will be their date of birth or the date of the passing of the 1956 Act, whichever is the later.</P>
    <P>In proposing the proviso as in section 2 of the Bill it was the intention that the position of people who had already registered prior to the passing of the Bill would not be affected.  The amendment now being proposed to the section is to clarify their position and to ensure that there is no change in the effective date of their citizenship.  This is achieved by the insertion of the words, &ldquo;after the passing of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill seeks to extend to an alien man who marries an Irish woman the same rights of acquiring citizenship as would be enjoyed by an alien woman who marries an Irish man.  It removes an anomaly from the existing legislation and we welcome that, but I must point to some of the possible difficulties in regard to the way the Minister is tackling the problem.  We all recall that the need for the amendment was highlighted by the High Court action between Mohammed Ali Somjee and the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General.  Mr. Somjee, a Pakistani who married an Irish girl, gave evidence that he had been omitted from the Irish squash team for an overseas tour because he was not an Irish citizen and he could not become one as quickly as he desired.  His wife claimed that she was precluded by virtue of the <Col N="851" /> 1956 Act. from conferring on her husband the benefits of Irish citizenship by virtue of her marriage to him.  A male is able to confer on his alien spouse an automatic right to Irish citizenship which is not the grace and favour of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The Bill removes the distinction between men and women in the 1956 Act and Fianna Fáil welcome this step because it provides for equal treatment for men and women.  However, our concern was that in acquiring citizenship a waiting period of three years was introduced by the Minister.  While there is equal treatment both parties, male or female, will have to wait three years before getting Irish citizenship.  Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Act of 1956, which relates to formalities to be complied with in certain cases, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following proviso after paragraph (b) of subsection (2):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that the citizenship of a person who is registered under section 27 shall commence only as on and from the date of such registration.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment states:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 14, after &ldquo;who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, after the passing of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I take it that this is a technical amendment to section 2 which would read as follows:</P>
      <P>Provided that the citizenship of a person who, after the passing of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, is registered under section 27, shall commence only as and from the date of such registration...</P>
      <P>The purpose, I take it, is to set a time from the date of the passing of the Act and to clarify the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 19 to 27 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `8.&mdash;(1) A person who is an alien at the date of that person's marriage to a person who is, or who after the marriage becomes, an Irish citizen (otherwise than by naturalisation or by virtue of this section or section 12) shall not become an Irish citizen merely by virtue of the marriage, but may do so by lodging, not earlier than three years from the date of the marriage or from the date on which the person last mentioned became an Irish citizen (otherwise than as aforesaid), whichever is the later, a declaration in the prescribed manner with the Minister, or with any Irish diplomatic mission or consular office, accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship: provided that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgment of the declaration, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the couple are living together as husband and wife and the spouse who is an Irish citizen submits an affidavit to that effect when the declaration is being lodged.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the amendment to section 3 of the Bill is to clarify the requirement that foreign spouses of Irish citizens be three years married to become entitled to Irish citizenship by post-nuptial declaration.  The amendment requires that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgment of the declaration, and <Col N="853" /> the couple are living together as husband and wife and the spouse who is an Irish citizen submits an affidavit to that effect when the declaration is being lodged.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate the point was made that it was not clear what was meant by the phrase &ldquo;provided that the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgment of the declaration&rdquo;.  Did this mean merely that the marriage was still in existence legally or did it mean that the marriage was an on-going one and that the couple were continuing to live together as husband and wife?</P>
    <P>I explained during that debate that what was intended was that the marriage would have to be a viable one in the sense that the couple had not broken up but were still living together as a married couple.  I accept, however, that there could be some dispute as to what the exact meaning was of the phrase &ldquo;provided that the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgment of the declaration&rdquo;. The amendment has been drafted with a view to making it quite clear as to what is intended.  Not only will the marriage have to be in legal existence at the time of the declaration but, also, there will be a requirement that the couple are living together as husband and wife.  It will be necessary for the Irish partner in the marriage to confirm by affidavit that the couple are living together as husband and wife.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the requirement for post-nuptial citizenship should be a viable marriage that has been in existence for three years.  I would like to point out to the House that a right is being granted to Irish citizenship in the case of the foreign husbands of Irish citizens.  As I said in the House already, we should set a high value on our citizenship and, accordingly, a right to citizenship should not be given lightly.  Three years has been set as the period of marriage which will give that entitlement.  It is logical that the three years in question should refer to an on-going marriage and not to one that has broken up or, perhaps one that was <Col N="854" /> entered into merely for the sake of gaining an entitlement to Irish citizenship after three years.</P>
    <P>During the course of earlier debates on this Bill reference was made to some unusual cases that could arise.  One such case was that of a foreigner who marries an Irish citizen, comes to Ireland, and the Irish partner to the marriage dies before three years have elapsed.  In that case the foreign spouse would not be entitled to Irish citizenship by post-nuptial declaration.  As I said already, this situation could be dealt with under section 16 (a) of the Act &mdash; the widow or widower could be regarded as having Irish associations and, other things being equal, acquire Irish citizenship by naturalisation.</P>
    <P>Another case referred to was that of a couple living here whose marriage broke up after a period of less than three years and the Irish citizen wished to obtain maintenance from the foreign spouse.  If the foreign spouse was not entitled to Irish citizenship by post-nuptial declaration he or she might not be able to pay the maintenance to the Irish partner as he or she would have difficulty in getting a job because of not being an Irish citizen. The point was also made that a similar difficulty could arise if the couple are living in Ireland and before the end of the three year period the Irish spouse goes off with somebody else.  The foreign partner is left trying to support the children of the marriage and he or she cannot get Irish citizenship and as a consequence cannot get a job.  What does a person in this predicament do?  I am satisfied that these types of cases could also be considered under section 16 of the Act.  Paragraph (e) provides that the normal conditions for naturalisation may be dispensed with if the applicant is married to a person who is an Irish citizen otherwise than by naturalisation.  If the marriage has been terminated legally the case could be considered under section 16 (a) &mdash; Irish association.</P>
    <P>The argument was made that there should be an automatic right to Irish citizenship if the Irish spouse died within three years of the marriage.  I do not <Col N="855" /> agree that there should be such a right. Other EC countries do not give a right of citizenship to foreign spouses of their nationals: what most of them provide is that foreign spouses may get naturalisation in more favourable conditions than applicants for naturalisation generally. Naturalisation is not given as a matter of right; it is at the discretion of the State. We are conferring a right after three years marriage.  In giving a right we are being more accommodating than most other EC states.  Three years has been set as the benchmark for the right.  I am satisfied that we should adhere to the three years in all cases.  Unusual cases, such as those that have been mentioned in debates on this Bill, can be considered in the context of naturalisation and, specifically, under section 16.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I am satisfied that the three years marriage requirement must mean a marriage that has lasted for three years and is a viable one.  The unusual cases that have been mentioned do not come within that criterion.  These situations can be met, however, by considering them under section 16 of the Act.  I am satisfied that this is the way these unusual cases should be dealt with rather than by providing for exceptional circumstances under section 8.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which was brought up in earlier debates to which I would like to refer.  This is the position of foreign husbands of Irish citizens and the fact that they may be refused permission to enter into or remain in the State. The general position is that husbands of Irish citizens have no difficulty in being admitted to the State or being allowed to stay here.  The fact that they are married to Irish citizens does not give them a right to be here but it would be taken into account in the consideration of their cases.</P>
    <P>There are cases from time to time, however, of foreign husbands being refused permission to land or permission to stay.  Mention was made of some court cases where permission to stay or to land was refused.  I am satisfied that a careful reading of those court cases supports the <Col N="856" /> policy of not giving an absolute right to foreign husbands to enter or remain in the State.  One of these related to a case where the alien was involved in serious crime.  Another related to a case where the Irish wife had obtained a barring order against her husband and she did not want him to come to her house.  The views of the courts on those cases are worth reading.  In my view they support the policy of not giving a right of entry to the State to foreign husbands or an absolute right to stay.  The cases where admission was refused were extreme cases and the negative decisions on them were fully justified.  The majority of cases involving foreign husbands are, of course, straightforward and result in permission to stay or to enter the State being given.</P>
    <P>There are also two technical amendments to the section as in the Bill.  Their purpose is to clarify the meaning of the section.  The first technical amendment deals with a situation where a person who is not an Irish citizen marries a person who is also not an Irish citizen but one of them subsequently exercises his or her right to obtain Irish citizenship by registration under section 27.  The amendment provides that in such a case the alien spouse will have the same right to post-nuptial citizenship as he or she would if his or her spouse had been Irish at the time of the marriage.  When the original section 3 of the Bill was being drafted it was the intention that this should be the case.  However, it is not absolutely clear from the wording of the section that the section would apply in such circumstances and, accordingly, the purpose of the amendment I am now proposing is to ensure that the alien spouse of an Irish person who becomes Irish by registration subsequent to the marriage, will be able to obtain Irish citizenship by post-nuptial declaration.</P>
    <P>The second technical amendment provides that the spouse of a person who is an Irish citizen by virtue of this section or section 12 of the 1956 Act will not be entitled to citizenship by post-nuptial declaration.  Again this is a matter of clarification.  This situation could arise <Col N="857" /> where a person who is Irish by post-nuptial declaration marries again.  His or her spouse would not be entitled to post-nuptial citizenship.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has given such thought to what I said earlier. At the time I was trying to be as helpful as possible and I am glad the Minister has looked into the points so thoroughly and has come up with an amendment to tighten the matter up.  The amendment will overcome some of the weaknesses which we discovered on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There is a basic question that must be considered, namely, the introduction of the three year waiting period after a couple marry. On Committee Stage I pointed out some of the anomalies that could arise as a result.  I referred to the fact that the Minister has included a new clause which provides that the entitlement to automatic citizenship to be enjoyed by a spouse will not take effect earlier than three years after the date of marriage, provided that the marriage is still subsisting at the time of declaration. At the time I said that presumably that safeguard was included to provide against marriages of convenience.  The three year waiting period is a new provision for this country.  The Minister has excused that by saying that other European countries use this provision, that it is the most frequently used arrangement.  I proposed that we take another approach.  At the moment a woman coming to Ireland can automatically become a citizen on marriage to an Irishman and I said that since we have not experienced serious problems with regard to that provision why not extend the right to both spouses, thus bringing about the equality on which all of us are agreed and which we are happy to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a consequence of the three year waiting period that the various anomalies have arisen.  It would be reasonable to provide that period if there was experience of serious difficulties with the alternative arrangement that has been in existence but that has not been the case. <Col N="858" /> Now the Minister talks about a subsisting and viable marriage, but how does one define that?  If the foreign spouse who wants to become an Irish citizen and who has settled here is not the partner who defaults or who in causing the difficulties, why should that party not have the right of citizenship?</P>
    <P>There has been talk about the practice obtaining in European countries.  We should remember the view we take of marriage under our Constitution.  We regard marriage as a very important institution and regard the family based on marriage as antecedent to and superior to all positive law.  The State undertakes to guard and defend marriage and presumably that would apply to marriages of the kind we are talking about here because they would also be marriages within the State.  We take a very serious view of marriage in this country, we provide a great deal of support for it and we should not be ashamed of that fact.  It may well be something that has developed here over the years but nevertheless it is the way we have treated marriage up to now.  Therefore, should we not recognise the importance of marriage and grant citizenship at the same time?  We could have done that and we could have provided the safeguards in a different way to cover the defaulters and those who become problem people.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we tabled an amendment stating that a person who was an alien at the date of marriage to an Irish citizen should not become an Irish citizen merely by virtue of the marriage but could do so by lodging a declaration with the Minister in the prescribed manner or with any diplomatic mission or consular office at any time after the marriage, accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship.  We proposed that we should continue in the direction we had been taking, but we also proposed that we should give equality in the treatment of both spouses.  To deal with the more exceptional cases &mdash; and it seems very clear from the evidence of the Minister that they are the exception &mdash; we proposed an amendment stating that, <Col N="859" /> where a person enters a contract of marriage solely or primarily for the purpose of enabling one of the parties to acquire post-nuptial citizenship and who knowingly gives or makes a misleading or false statement for the purpose of enabling such citizenship to be acquired he or she shall be guilty of an offence.  We also said a penalty should be imposed for that office.</P>
    <P>That was the other approach, namely, to regard marriage as normal and as an institution to which many precedents are attached.  We said we should not just turn to our European partners and take the same action as they do.  As a neutral country we should be able to decide how to behave and perhaps our example might even be followed by them in due course.</P>
    <P>In any event, the Minister has decided not to pursue this line and instead she proposes to introduce the three year waiting period.  As I pointed out earlier, this will not make Mr. Somjee any happier. At that time the Minister offered him a two-year waiting period and it is obvious we have done nothing to solve his problem which brought this question to light.  The words used by the Minister are subject to various interpretations and they will cause anomalies and difficulties. Quite possibly more difficulties will be experienced as a result of taking this line. Now the Minister is attempting to tighten up the situation to deal with the question of what would be regarded as a viable and subsisting marriage.  The Minister has admitted there will be problems.  For instance, a foreign spouse who marries here and who is left a widow or a widower within the three-year period will not have an automatic right to citizenship.  That is very sad.  On the grounds of compassion one should say that such a person in those circumstances should automatically have citizenship if they so wish.  The Minister has said this should be available under section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  Under that Act, the Minister may, if he thinks fit, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation where an applicant is of Irish descent or Irish association.  The Minister <Col N="860" /> is prepared to recognise that this spouse had taken on an Irish association by marrying an Irish person and that spouse is now dependent on the grace and favour of the Minister &mdash; albeit the Minister says there is a clause which should be in favour of that individual.  In my view, when dealing with such an important area as marriage, this is the wrong way to go about it.  This highlights the problem created by the direction the Minister has chosen to take.  Having gone along that road, we have no alternative but to do what the Minister is proposing, that is to delete lines 19 to 27 in page 2 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>8.&mdash;(1)  A person who is an alien at the date of that person's marriage to a person who is, or who after the marriage becomes, an Irish citizen (otherwise than by naturalisation or by virtue of this section or section 12) shall not become an Irish citizen merely by virtue of the marriage, but may do so by lodging, not earlier than three years from the date of the marriage or from the date on which the person last mentioned became an Irish citizen (otherwise than as aforesaid), whichever is the later, a declaration in the prescribed manner with the Minister, or with any Irish diplomatic mission or consular office, accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship: provided that&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is where the Minister introduces a clause to cover some of the anomalies which could arise:</P>
    <P>(a) the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgment of the declaration, and&mdash;</P>
    <P>This means the marriage would have to be recognised as being legally in existence&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  the couple are living together as husband and wife and the spouse who is an Irish citizen submits an affidavit to that effect when the declaration is being lodged.</P>
    <P>This tends to give one partner a strength which is denied the other.  By accepting <Col N="861" /> the line the Minister is pursuing and by not recognising the marriage as it should be recognised at the outset this clause is more or less inevitable.</P>
    <P>We spoke earlier about the anomalies which can arise.  If the Irish partner dies the spouse who comes from another country does not have the automatic right to citizenship.  If the Irish spouse deserts his family, there is no longer a subsisting marriage.  Paragraph (a) relates to the referendum and paragraph (b) covers the case where the couple are not living together.  If the Irish partner deserts his spouse, she will have to fall back on the grace and favour of the Minister because it is not a subsisting marriage since the couple are not living together as husband and wife.  That creates a difficulty for the alien spouse.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of an American marrying an Irish citizen, setting up a business and raising a family in Ireland. If the Irish partner dies, immediately the American partner will be in difficulties and presumably will have to wait three years because under this legislation he &ldquo;shall not become an Irish citizen merely by virtue of the marriage, but may do so by lodging, not earlier than three years from the date of the marriage or from the date on which the person last mentioned became an Irish citizen... a declaration in the prescribed manner with the Minister...&rdquo; What will be her position in the meantime?  It will be dependent on the grace and favour of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that by establishing an Irish association it will be possible for the alien spouse to appeal.  I hope the person concerned will be fully informed of his or her rights and that he or she will not be rushed into making decisions.  As I understand it, it would be the wish of this House that in such circumstances that spouse should have every right to remain here as an Irish citizen.  In this amendment the Minister is trying to provide a remedy for some of the difficulties which I foresaw on Committee Stage, but in my view we are dealing with this problem in a patchwork fashion.  It would be better if we recognised the marriage, as we have <Col N="862" /> always done, and dealt with the exceptions because experience shows that there are very few exceptions.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the case of Americans and their rights when they marry Irish citizens.  If a man here takes an American wife she gets the automatic right to citizenship at present on application.  In bringing in equal treatment then the simple way would be to give an American husband of an Irish woman the same right on application.  I suggested earlier that that is the way we should do it but the Minister's proposal introduces a three year waiting period, and the question then is that some of these anomalies will develop.</P>
    <P>There is not much more I can say about this.  Naturally, we are concerned, just as the Minister is concerned, about the possibility of marriages of convenience, but with the lack of evidence of this happening and the fact that clearly it would be more the exception than the rule, especially given the close ties we have with the US as an example, it would seem more reasonable to give the right of citizenship in the normal way that applies at the moment.  The Minister has decided to go the other way and in this amendment she is attempting to deal with some of the questions raised on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In so far as it goes we support the Minister's approach but I still feel that it only tends to isolate the fact that we are not showing the same regard for this marriage from the outset, from the time when the marriage takes place.  Some of our European partners build in a waiting period for three years, but why should we have a similar provision?  Why should we leave a couple who are happily married in a <i>bona fide</i> way under that question mark for as long as three years, especially since the Minister was disposed previously in circumstances like that to allow only a two year waiting period? Why should these people be pushed on to a three year delay?</P>
    <P>I do not think it very desirable.  It is not good enough to say that just because some or most of our European partners build in that kind of delay we should have <Col N="863" /> the same kind of delay.  I say that for two reasons.  One is that we have always been a much more open society, particularly open to comings and goings from the USA and from Great Britain, of course. Secondly, we have always taken a very special view of marriage and of the place of marriage in our society and in our Constitution.  On that basis we have a very high regard for marriage.  I know that, irrespective of present circumstances, the referendum and whatever, the Minister and the vast majority of Irish people want to maintain that high regard and place for marriage and the family in the Constitution.  On that basis then, on the logic and thinking in relation to marriage and the Constitution, we should accord the citizenship, if not immediately on marriage, certainly at a much earlier stage than after a three year waiting period.  Be that as it may, the Government have decided to follow this line and in doing that the Minister has attempted to remedy some of the difficulties we discussed on Committee Stage.  On that basis I will not oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is aimed at regularising the granting of post-nuptial citizenship to the foreign spouses of Irish citizens.  We are dealing with it in the context of the requirements of 1986.  The basic Bill was drafted and drawn up for social conditions, labour mobility and, I suppose, the fifties situation in so far as women were concerned. The more I deal with this Bill the more I must question the thinking of the fifties in so far as the special provision was built in only for the husband, the Irish man, the citizen.  I am quite sure that in the fifties as many Irish women as Irish men were emigrating and marrying foreign spouses but that feature did not seem to be taken into account at all.  Therefore, I feel that the approach of this legislation is the correct one.  It hits the right balance, recognising the need to protect our citizenship and at the same time affording just and equitable treatment for those foreign spouses who marry Irish citizens. I remind the Deputy that we are talking <Col N="864" /> about extending citizenship as a right &mdash; not naturalisation &mdash; to the spouses, regardless of whether husband or wife, of Irish citizens on the basis of three years' marriage, not two years' residence as it is at present for foreign husbands. That is an important point that I suggest to the Deputy.  On Committee Stage he was proposing an amendment to the effect that citizenship should be automatic for both parties after marriage, and then he was proposing that penalties should be dictated for fraudulent application, incorrect evidence or whatever. I suggest that that would be extremely difficult to ascertain and establish for a marriage that could have happened anywhere in the world.  How would you establish whether the evidence or the information provided were accurate and correct?  I am very happy that we were able to go back on the section and elaborate on it as we have done in subsection (1) (b) of the amendment because Deputy Woods and Deputy Shatter brought up that point and I feel that it meets the requests that were made in the debate.</P>
      <P>Let me deal further with the issue of the widow or widower where the Irish citizen, the husband and wife, would have died within the three year period.  I have no doubt that such a situation would be dealt with very benevolently and justly by any Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.  &mdash;Section 21 of the Act of 1956 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):</P>
      <P>`(1)  If an Irish citizen of full age is or is about to become a citizen of another country and for that reason desires to renounce citizenship, he or she may do so, if ordinarily resident outside the State, by lodging with the Minister a declaration of alienage in the prescribed manner, and, upon lodgment of the declaration or, if not then a citizen of that country, upon becoming such, shall cease to be an Irish citizen.&rdquo;'.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment that was highlighted by the Deputy.  Its purpose is to insert a new section 21 for the existing section 21 of the 1956 Act.  The only difference between the proposed section 21 and the existing section 21 is that the phrase &ldquo;or a married woman under that age&rdquo; is being omitted from the proposed section and the words &ldquo;who is either&rdquo; are also being omitted because they are unnecessary in the proposed section.  The existing section deals with the renunciation of citizenship by an Irish citizen &ldquo;who is either of full age or a married woman under that age&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Age of Majority Act, 1985, has made the reference to a married woman under that age unnecessary as the definition of full age in that Act refers to a person who is 18 years of age or who, if under 18 years of age, is married. Accordingly, the amendment I now propose does not make any difference to the meaning of the section as, when considered in the light of the Age of Majority Act, 1985, it would be the same as under <Col N="866" /> the revised wording now proposed.  However, I have given further consideration to the matter and I accept the thinking behind the amendment proposed by Deputy Woods.  I agree that the reference to &ldquo;woman&rdquo; in the existing section seems out of place in the context of a Bill, the objective of which is to eliminate differentiation based on sex.  Therefore, I am satisfied that an amendment should be made.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for looking in such a constructive way at my proposal.  While we may have differences in regard to some aspects of the Bill we have co-operated on many points. I appreciate that there are difficulties and that we must decide where the balance lies in a particular case.  We disagreed in regard to the balance in the three year waiting period as it is a longer time than I would wish to see.  However, on Committee Stage I proposed that this amendment should be made to section 17 of the 1956 Act.  I welcome the fact that the Minister consulted her officials and decided to make an amendment along these lines.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the Minister's remarks in relation to the general requirements of the eighties as distinct from the fifties.  Circumstances change and it is desirable to look at our Acts and the language in which they are couched. I did not do an exhaustive study of the 1956 Act but it was clear that other parts of it need to be updated and perhaps the Minister would consider this in due course.  Very often the introduction of change, such as that proposed here, brings our minds to bear on a variety of other things which need to be done in regard to an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally I am happy to support this amendment since I proposed a broadly similar one on Committee Stage.  I was pressed at the time to take the remaining stages together but, as a matter of principle, I did not want to do that because it is necessary to have a break between Committee and Report Stages so that if the Minister, after consultation with her officials, feels that something raised on <Col N="867" /> Committee Stage needs to be dealt with, she can make an appropriate amendment in the circumstances.  That is why it is so important to separate Committee and Report Stages.  It is often said that it can be considered further in the Seanad but I do not think that is desirable.  The acceptance of this amendment is a good example of constructive debate.  I know it takes time and trouble and that no one will be over-enthusiastic or excited about this measure but, nevertheless, there is an onus on us to debate it fully.  Naturally, I am happy to support this amendment.</P>

I trust that this will be the case and I appeal to any Minister dealing with this measure in future to take such a compassionate and sympathetic view of the three year waiting period, especially when one of the partners dies and the other wishes to remain in the country.  An assurance should be given at the earliest possible stage to the partner who remains here after a death that the position in relation to citizenship will not be in question and that an application will be treated very <Col N="868" /> favourably.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  In page 3, subsection (1), lines 25 to 27, to delete &ldquo;an act or omission standing specified for the time being as such in the Regulations or in any other regulations made under section 14 of the Act of 1925 after the establishment day&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;conduct specified in the Fourth Schedule to this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A brief word of explanation is in order on these amendments.  The group of amendments we are considering here is designed to set out in a schedule to the <Col N="869" /> Bill, rather than in the schedule to the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, the kinds of behaviour that a member of the public may complain about to the complaints board.  That procedure has a number of advantages.  In the first place, it makes for easy reference, that is, that the public do not have to look beyond this Bill for information. The matter is set out as a schedule to the Bill.  The details are also more accessible to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the purpose of debate.  It makes it possible to exclude all those breaches of discipline which are of purely internal disciplinary concern, for example, disobedience of orders and so on.</P>
    <P>As compared with the schedule to the discipline regulations, the new schedule to the Bill will not include a reference to criminal conduct by gardaí for which they have been convicted.  In other words, a complaint by a member of the public which is specifically related to a conviction of a member of the Garda Síochána will not be admissible under the Bill.  The public, of course, can complain to the board before the conviction about the conduct which constituted the offence. Then the board will supervise the criminal investigation and, if the member is subsequently prosecuted and convicted, the board will have power to deal with that member under the Bill.  That is the effect of amendment No. 2.</P>
    <P>It is conceivable also that there might by no complaint from the public to the board before the conviction.  Take, for example, a conviction for using an untaxed car or an uninsured car.  Such a conviction constitutes a breach of discipline under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations and the member of the public, if he is so minded, can write to the Garda Commissioner, although the Commissioner would be aware in the normal course of events of any convictions of members of the force.  The Commissioner would then invoke the discipline regulations to inquire into the suitability of the member concerned for retention in his or her present rank or, indeed, even in the force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> In a particularly bad case the Commissioner would be authorised by the regulations to dismiss the member concerned without holding an inquiry but, at the same time, giving the member concerned an opportunity to advance reasons against the dismissal.  The new schedule does not include a reference in the disipline regulations to engaging in prohibited spare time activities.  These activities would include, for example, actively or publicly identifying with a political party or behaving in relation to political or other matters in such a way as to give rise to public apprehension about the member's impartiality in carrying out his or her duties.</P>
    <P>Complaints about conduct of that kind are best left to be handled under the discipline regulations although, if the particular conduct being complained of were to come within the category of discreditable conduct &mdash; that is at Item 8 in the new schedule &mdash; it could of course be investigated by the board.  I do not think the other items that are being left to the discipline regulations call for any special comment but it might be useful if I were to mention them for the record.  They are misconduct towards another member of the Garda Síochána, disobedience of orders, breach of confidence, giving an unauthorised character reference in support of an application for a liquor, betting or gaming licence, signing or circulating a petition about matters affecting the Garda Síochána other than through authorised channels, neglect of health, untidiness on duty or in uniform, drinking on duty or unauthorised entry of licensed premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>One of the purpose of this Bill is to enable the Garda Síochána to avail of the full powers of arrest and detention of suspects on suspicion of involvement in serious crime which are contained in the Criminal Justice Act passed by the Oireachtas in 1984.  The crime situation has deteriorated alarmingly in recent months and a new and frightening level of violence has been experienced in vandalism.  It has brought about a crisis in many communities and <Col N="871" /> frustration for the Garda.  To tackle the new outbreak of crime effectively the Garda urgently need additional powers and resources.  They need the Criminal Justice Act now, without delay.  These measures which we are discussing here are directly related and are tied in to the Criminal Justice Act and will have the effect of making it available to the Garda in its full sense.</P>
      <P>Because of the importance of providing the Garda with the new powers immediately, I want to suggest to the Minister that we pass all the remaining stages of this Bill today.  The important thing for us to do now is to put the new criminal justice powers into operation without delay.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I put forward in 1983 a draft complaints procedure to accompany the Criminal Justice Bill.  The Minister has now, some two years later, put the Government's proposals before the House.  He has also put down 48 amendments to his own Bill.  I have listed 12 and The Workers' Party have listed another number of amendments.</P>
      <P>The crime situation now demands that these amendments be discussed and concluded today.  That should be possible and I propose to the Minister that we discuss the Committee Stage amendments up to say, 7 p.m. at the latest, that we then break maybe until 9 p.m. and that we resume to take the Report and Final Stages of this Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill.  This recess would give the Minister an opportunity to consider what has been said on Committee Stage and make any final amendments which might be necessary.  I am proposing this unusual measure in the interest of assisting the Garda and the Minister in their efforts to defeat criminals and obtain more convictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have done our homework on both sides of the House and with the necessary co-operation I think the Bill should be completed today.  We owe this to the Garda Síochána and the hard pressed members of the public who are afflicted with crime.  I am sure that the Whips could make the necessary arrangements <Col N="872" /> if the Minister is agreeable.  If the Minister were to have a break for even a few hours, he could examine the amendments put forward by our party and The Workers' Party and having listened to the debate, he could then include whatever amendments he wishes.  We are not going to press these matters or debate them at great length at this stage, although they are very detailed proosals and, as the Minister knows well, have many ramifications.</P>
    <P>One matter is highlighted by the Minister's amendment being considered now and in his statement to us, which is that the existing disciplinary code is one with which the Garda are familiar and which operates well.  In relation to the Criminal Justice Act and following the Ó Briain report, there was shown to be a need for additional safeguards for people in custody and for a complaints procedure. I never saw the complaints procedure as taking over from the internal disciplinary code.  The two have become intermingled to some extent in the original proposed draft to which the Minister is now putting down amendments.  It is very necessary to separate, in so far as possible, those internal matters of discipline which are appropriate to be dealt with by the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister has mentioned a number of these and the sort of matters which should be left to the disciplinary procedure.  The Garda have views on that and in their discussions, at an earlier stage on the draft Bill, they were concerned about the overlap.  We should be clear that our objective is to have a complaints procedure for the public in relation to those matters which rightly concern the public.  The complaints procedure is the public's Ombudsman or watchdog for the operation of the Garda Síochána as a whole, that body being excluded from the consideration of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the Minister would be happy to have at least Committee Stage concluded today, but I do not see why we could not agree to having a break and then having Report Stage.  We have discussed at considerable length the points on which we agree and disagree <Col N="873" /> and they may be discussed again during the day.  As evidenced by the long list of amendments which the Minister is proposing at this stage, he has made strenuous efforts to try to get the Bill right. Many of his amendments refer to points debated at an earlier stage which he has taken on board and he has gone a long way to meeting the points I raised on Second Stage.  He and his officials have had discussions in considerable depth with the Garda associations and others to try to get the balance right.  It is of major importance that this matter, which has been before the House in one shape or other for a long time, should be concluded as urgently as possible.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Woods and I am glad that we can take this procedure.  Having spoken to the Deputy last week and this morning, I would agree with the general approach he puts forward. I should point out that, as the Deputy has said, a number of the amendments that I have put down arise from our debate on Second Stage.  Others, which we shall see as we go through them, are consequential on the amendments of substance as a result of the Second Stage debate.  I am perfectly prepared, if it is possible for the House, to take Report Stage this evening.  I would remind the House that there will be a break in this discussion between 7 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. for Private Members' Business, so if the House were agreeable we could aim to conclude Committee Stage at 7 p.m. and possibly take Report Stage from 8.30 p.m. onwards.</P>

      <P>Peace has broken out between the spokesperson for Fianna Fáil and the Minister on this issue.  I have no objection to the Bill being completed tonight.  I should however like to make the point that while this Bill on complaints procedure has been tied in with the Criminal Justice Act, a complaints procedure is required irrespective of any Criminal Justice Act which is or is not in operation at any particular time.  I have argued at length that there is a need for an independent complaints procedure.  That was clear from the Ó Briain report and even before that from the point of view of protecting not only the individuals who might be in the custody of the Garda Síochána but the Garda from malicious accusations.  That is now generally accepted.</P>
      <P>Having this legislation pushed through today will not make all that much difference to the crime rate in this city and around the country. There are grave reservations among the Garda as to how effective the Criminal Justice Act will be when the sections on detention and so forth are finally brought in.  There are concerns that it may not be operable because of its complexity, but that is for another debate.  It can truthfully be said that the issue of a complaints procedure has been debated at length and the Minister has gone a considerable distance to meet the points raised by the Garda and by others also as to how the system would work.  I only have a small number of amendments to the Bill and I do not see any great problem in dealing with them.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1971.  The amendment deals with that.  Amendment No. 13 states:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (3) (a) (iii), lines 45 and 46, to delete &ldquo;a breach of discipline&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;be conduct specified in the Fourth Schedule to this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Fourth Schedule specifies the conduct to which the Minister referred. Amendment No. 66 which we are considering now is the Fourth Schedule.  This is a very important Schedule.  It covers the conduct which is included under this section and under the complaints procedure. Where it states to delete &ldquo;a breach of discipline&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;be conduct specified in the Fourth Schedule to this Act&rdquo;, the said conduct is, under subsection (3):</P>
      <P>On receipt by the Board of a complaint or of a notification under subsection (2) of this section, the chief executive shall consider whether the complaint is admissible and the complaint shall be admissible if the following conditions are satisfied.</P>
      <P>A complaint would be admissible to the whole process of investigation and consideration by the Board if it satisfies certain conditions.  Under subsection (3) (a) (iii) conduct specified in the Fourth Schedule is defined.  The conduct which the Minister is introducing and which is a major change to the Bill is given in amendment No. 66.  It states: &ldquo;in page 27, after line 39, to insert the following Schedule&rdquo;.  The matters which would be admissible would include discourtesy, that is to say, failing to behave with due courtesy towards a member of the public. That is obviously one of the areas which we would like to have seen covered. Secondly, neglect of duty, that is to say, without good and sufficient cause&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  failing or neglecting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> (i)  properly to account for any money or property received by him in his capacity as a member, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  promptly to do any thing which it is his duty as a member to do,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(b)  doing any such thing as is mentioned in subparagraph (a) (ii) of this paragraph in a negligent manner.</P>
    <P>Here we have examples of what we would regard as the sort of thing that in other Departments would be brought to the attention of the Ombudsman if they were not dealt with satisfactorily by the Department in the first instance.  That brings us back to the informal way in which they might be treated and the extent to which the informal application of any of these rules would apply.</P>
    <P>The third area is falsehood or prevarication, that is to say, in his capacity as a member&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  making or procuring the making of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any oral or written statement, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  any entry in an official document or record, which is, to the member's knowledge, false or misleading, or</P>
    <P>(b)  with a view to deceiving, destroying or mutilating any official document or record or altering or erasing or adding to any entry therein.</P>
    <P>The fourth area is abuse of authority, that is to say, oppressive conduct towards a member of the public, including&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  without good and sufficient cause, making an arrest, or</P>
    <P>(b)  using unnecessary violence towards any person with whom the member is brought into contact in the execution, or purported execution, of his duty.</P>
    <P>The Ó Briain report was particularly concerned with the oppressive conduct towards members of the public or the abuse of members of the public in any way.  There would therefore be a clear <Col N="877" /> procedure to pursue this kind of abuse in a regular and organised way.  The Garda and the members of the public in general could be happy that, taking the overall activity of the Garda, these are very few and far between.  Nevertheless, where they occur there is a recognised and established procedure to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The fifth area is corrupt or improper practice, that is to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  soliciting or receiving as a member and without the consent of the Commissioner any gratuity, present, subscription or testimonial (other than customary collections for such purposes as presentations to members on the occasion of transfer, marriage or retirement),</P>
    <P>(b)  placing himself as a member under a pecuniary obligation to any person in a manner that might affect his ability to discharge his duty as a member,</P>
    <P>(c)  improperly using (or attempting to use) his position as a member for his private advantage, or</P>
    <P>(d)  failing wilfully and without good and sufficient cause to pay any lawful debt in such circumstances as to be liable to affect his ability to discharge his duty as a member or as to be liable to compromise other members.</P>
    <P>The areas which the Minister is covering are fairly extensive and go ino a wide area of the relationship of the Garda Síochána with the community generally. They would cover questions which would be regarded as leading to a situation in which a member was placed under an obligation.  No. 6 states:</P>
    <P>Misuse of money or property in the custody of the Garda Síochána belonging to a member of the public, that is to say, misappropriating, or wilfully or carelessly misusing, losing or damaging, any such money or property.</P>
    <P>No. 7 states:</P>
    <P>Intoxication, that is to say, owing to the effects of intoxicating liquor or drugs or a combination thereof, being unfit for duty either while on duty or <Col N="878" /> while not on duty but wearing a uniform in a public place.</P>
    <P>No. 8 states:</P>
    <P>Discreditable conduct, that is to say, conducting himself in a manner which the member knows, or ought to know, would be reasonably likely to bring discredit on the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Finally No. 9 states:</P>
    <P>Accessory to conduct specified in this Schedule, that is to say, conniving at or knowingly being an accessory to such conduct.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing that this Schedule would be included as the schedule referred to under No. 13, page 5 of the Bill.  The areas of conduct which the Minister covers are quite extensive and they will cover a wide variety of areas of conduct in addition to the ones which are already specified in the section.</P>
    <P>From our point of view any of these measures should in the first instance be related to the conduct of the member while on duty or while exercising the powers as a member.  This is dealt with elsewhere in one of the other amendments.  These are measures which define in the Fourth Schedule the kind of conduct which the Minister is referring to.  They seem to be fairly comprehensive.  Other matters which are mentioned are that the said conduct will constitute an offence or, secondly, a matter which is covered in this particular Schedule.  As far as I can see, the provisions are fairly extensive</P>
    <P>I am quite happy that the matters of internal discipline are left to the internal procedures, the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 1971, which are fairly extensive.  They cover the point which the Minister mentioned of prohibited spare time activities.  I take it from what the Minister has said that the question of prohibited spare time activities is being left to the disciplinary procedures under the disciplinary regulations.  Prohibited spare time activities as defined in the disciplinary regulations at present include: identifying actively or publicly with a political party, behaving in relation to political matters in such a manner and in such circumstances as to give rise to <Col N="879" /> reasonable apprehension among members of the public in relation to impartiality in the discharge of duties and engaging, whether for reward or otherwise, in any activity which though not mentioned in subparagraphs (a) and (b) is prohibited by the Commissioner either by general or special directive as being likely to interfere with proper discharge of duties and as being likely to give rise to reasonable apprehension among members of the public in relation to impartiality in the discharge of duties or as being for good and stated reasons inappropriate for members of the Garda Síochána to engage in.</P>
    <P>I take it that, No. 15 of the Schedule of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 1971 is a matter outside the ambit of this complaints procedure and will be dealt with under the disciplinary regulations and that if people have complaints in relation to that matter, they are complaints which are purely ones which should be made to the local superintendent and dealt with under that procedure.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 6, to delete &ldquo;section 4 (1)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 4 (1) (a)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a consequential amendment, which proposes to amend section 4(1) by creating a presumption that any person who goes to the Garda Síochána with complaint wishes to have it considered by the board unless that person requests otherwise when making the complaint.</P>
      <P>As the Bill now stands, it envisages that there will be some complainants who do not wish to involve the board at all but to leave their complaints to be handled by the Garda for example, at local level. These would be minor complaints where, for example, the complainant might feel that a quick ticking off or timely advice from a superior officer or local level is all that is called for.  I think we would all wish to leave that level of choice to people making that complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, a strict interpretation of section 4(1) might require the Garda to inquire in every case whether the complainant wished to have the complaint investigated by the board.  In the case of written complaints received by post, this could cause delays in that the Garda would have to check back with <Col N="881" /> the complainant.  Even in a case where a complaint was made, orally, at a Garda station and was subsequently handled by the Garda there would be scope for argument later as to whether the complainant wanted the Garda, rather than the board, to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The proposed presumption in favour of the board dealing with all complaints made to the Garda Síochána will eliminate any confusion on points of that kind as there will now have to be an express request in writing before the jurisdiction of the board can be ousted or by-passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that matters which could be dealt with informally, in a routine way, should be so dealt with. It has been my experience as a public representative that when one refers a complainant to a superintendent very often the matter is cleared up at that level and the complainant is satisfied.  Superintendents do a great deal of such work which goes unnoticed at higher levels. Many such occurrences arise from misunderstandings or misinterpretations. Discourtesy is not intended but may arise because of the difficult task involved. Sometimes people are upset when they see a member of the Garda Síochána coming near their premises at all because they fear that others will think there is something wrong, leading to a certain misunderstanding of the role and function of the Garda in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the experience recently of an informant having given the Garda an erroneous address, a house situated four doors away from another man with the same name.  The Garda searched the house of Mr. B instead of Mr. A. Mr. B, being an upstanding, civic-minded person who gave every support to the Garda, was extremely upset that they should have come to investigate anything in his house, garden or elsewhere.  In those circumstances it is difficult to explain to a person the position of the Garda.  Yet it was a perfectly natural mistake because it was a friend of Mr. B's who had informed the Garda in relation to stolen goods but who had not specified clearly which of the houses was involved.  All <Col N="882" /> Mr. B would require would be that a superintendent, inspector or someone else would say: we are sorry that this happened but mistakes can occur.  In fact Mr. B asked me to ensure that if any member of the Garda Síochána returned to apologise that he do so in plain clothes because in the vicinity in which he lives it is not uncommon to have stolen goods found on premises.</P>
    <P>We need a means of enabling the Garda to relate to the community without becoming tied up in formalities.  It should be remembered that the vast majority of citizens want to support the Garda and the Garda can rest assured that they have that general support.  However, if on some occasions it does not appear evident it may be that people are somewhat frightened to be seen to be too obviously supporting them.  Another case comes to mind which happened about a week ago, of people knowing about stolen goods being moved within a certain area.  They were afraid to tell the Garda because the first thing that will happen is that the Garda will call to the informant's house when they will find themselves immediately in difficulties with their neighbours. I tell such people that if and when they encounter such difficulties they can telephone me, I will ring the Garda informing them of the position, leaving them to pursue the matter, communicating with the informant with appropriate discretion. I could cite many other examples of such happenings within the last few weeks.  Nevertheless it is important that there be informal means of handling such situations, of building up a good relationship between the members of the Garda and the public in general.  Equally it should be recognised the position in which some members of the public may find themselves at given times in given circumstances.  There should be methods devised to deal with such difficulties without exacerbating people's problems.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that there is even more support for the Garda than may be after he had spoken to him.  I can see thing to which the Minister might devote a little attention.  We have gone into the matter of the neighbourhood watch.  The <Col N="883" /> Minister will know that there are areas in which the neighbourhood watch has not been successful or has been taken off. Breaking down barriers and developing relationships in some of these areas would be important and productive.  In that context, having complaints dealt with in an informal way by means of a simplified process is particularly important. Indeed the initiation of that process probably should begin in the course of children's schooldays, the Garda meeting school children frequently, establishing a relationship with them so that they would have a good basis on which to relate to them later.  There are far too many fears on the part of members of the public generally in these situations and we could do more to break down those barriers.</P>
    <P>We are taking amendments No. 4 and 10 together.  Amendment No. 4 proposes the deletion of section 4 (1) and the substitution therefor of section 4 (1) (a). Section 4 (1) says:</P>
    <P>A member of the public who is directly affected by, or who witnesses, any conduct of a member and who wishes to have a complaint concerning that conduct considered by the Board shall himself or through his solicitor or, in the case of a person under the age of seventeen years, through his parent or guardian make a complaint...</P>
    <P>and it goes on to deal with that in more detail.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 proposes to insert an additional subsection.  Subsection (1) provides that a member of the public who is directly affected can make a complaint orally, or send or give it in writing to the board at the office of the board, to a member at a Garda Síochána station or to a member above the rank of chief superintendent at a place other than a Garda Síochána station within six months of the date of the conduct.  The Minister proposes to include paragraph (b) which reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  A complainant who makes a complaint to a member under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be presumed, for the purpose of that paragraph, <Col N="884" /> to wish to have his complaint considered by the Board unless, at the time of the making of the complaint, he himself or his solicitor or, in the case of a person under the age of seventeen years, a parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Unless persons stated at the time they made a complaint under paragraph (a) that they wished to have it considered informally, it would be considered by the board.  It should be kept as informal as possible.  I see the Minister's difficulty in providing cover for the board.  My main desire is to keep complaints which could be dealt with informally out of this machinery.  I proposed that such informal complaints be dealt with by the superintendent. The number and nature of such complaints could be noted and a record of them sent to the Commissioner and to the board.  The board could then observe what was happening in a general way.</P>
    <P>Many complaints of a minor or routine nature could be dealt with by the superintendent on the spot.  We should not make the system more bureaucratic.  The Commissioner will have power to delegate the handling of routine inquiries to a superintendent. We discussed this before and the Minister was of the view that my concerns in this area could be covered by the Commissioner having the power to delegate. How would that affect this since there is a requirement to have something in writing?</P>
    <P>If, for example, there was a case involving discourtesy which may not have been intended as such and if the person asked the superintendent to look into the matter, would the superintendent have to get a note from the person to say that he did not want the matter formally investigated?  That is probably what it would amount to in practical terms.  The onus would be put on the superintendent to get a written note from the person after he had spoken to him.  I can see the technical and practical reasons for stopping the inquiry there and for making it clear that was what was intended by the person making the complaint.</P>
    <P>I often find that if I listen to someone <Col N="885" /> making a complaint and talk it over with him the person discovers that the matter complained of was perhaps unintended or due to misunderstanding.  The same could apply to the gardaí and people may find that they do not wish to go any further with a complaint.  Many complaints could be resolved at a basic level, given goodwill.  If a person has to sign a note or a certificate it would be better to have a standard format for doing so.  If a person meets a superintendent and after talking to him signs such a note, that fact is all that needs to be notified to the board. That would eliminate the need for the matter to go before the board, come back to the superintendent and then have the superintendent meet the person.  I wish to keep the informal things informal, although I know it is necessary to have the protection the Minister proposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's wish to keep informal things informal. That is part of my intention.  I want to clarify the position so that there is no doubt about the way a complainant wants a complaint to be dealt with.  It is because we are setting up a formal Garda complaints machinery which will have the confidence of the public and the gardaí that I am proceeding in this way.  I am creating the presumption that any complaint which is brought forward by a complainant will be presumed to be a complaint a complainant wants dealt with by the board unless the complaint specifices otherwise.  If we were to do it any other way there could be a doubt at a later stage and a complainant could say he or she did not really understand that it would not be investigated by the board. When a complaint is brought forward the complainant will have to decide whether he or she wants the matter to be dealt with by the board or not and will have to indicate that that is their wish.  Where it is stated that a complainant wants the matter dealt with in that way it will not go to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to swop stories with Deputy Woods.  However, where a member of the public is a little unsure about the best way of contacting the <Col N="886" /> Garda without causing embarrassment or without giving rise to complications with the neighbours, my advice to public representatives is not to act as a conduit or channel between the Garda and the person in question but to advise that person how they should go about contacting the Garda.  Deputy Woods is suggesting that one should say to the person, &ldquo;if you want to talk to the Garda I will give them a ring and get them to talk to you&rdquo;, but my view is that it would be better to suggest to the person that they should give the Garda a ring, should show concern. In my view that would be a better way of bringing about this link, this co-operation, this closeness between the Garda and ordinary people that all Members want to bring about.</P>

      <P>I often act as a conduit but I am sure the Minister will agree that many people are reluctant to ring the Garda.  They will often talk to public representatives and having done so will feel happy and will not bother anybody. Very often it is simply a matter of understanding the procedures.  People may be reluctant to telephone the Gaarda because they realise that as soon as they do they are making a formal complaint. People who may wish to express their unhappiness about a certain thing may not be anxious to make a formal complaint. A public representative may suggest to people that they should contact the local superintendent and have a word with him.  Some people will do that but others would be afraid to do so.  Many people request public representatives to make contact with the superintendent and arrange a meeting for them.  Once the contact is made a public representative need not bother any further.  The gap that exists should be attended to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am highlighting what happens in practice.  A book on management which was presented to me recently recommends that top managers spend 40 <Col N="887" /> per cent of their time on the shop floor so as to be able to pick up all the &ldquo;vibes&rdquo; from employees.  If we want to eliminate the gaps that exist between the Garda and the public we will have to get such a relationship going.  I accept that it is more difficult where the function of the Garda is to maintain discipline and apply the law.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said with regard to the conduit but I must point out that in many cases there will be no communication.  That will result in unhappiness which will roll on into the pubs and other places rather than sorted out and clarified up front.  I take it the superintendent will be in a position to deal with a complaint in the first instance, that he will be able to request that the person making the complaint signs a document indicating that the person does not wish to take the matter any further? Will the superintendent be required periodically to notify the board of the number of such informal complaints?  It is clear that a person may write to the board with a complaint but I am referring to those who will convey a complaint to the local superintendent to be sorted out.  I hope the superintendent will be in a position to deal with such informal complaints immediately and to indicate that it has been dealt with to the satisfaction of the complainant.  I hope such informal complaints do not have to go before the board because there is a danger of a hardening of attitudes.  A simple matter could become very serious if there was a delay in processing such a complaint.  I presume that board will be notified of the number and nature of the complaints without having to be involved in a more comprehensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that where a complainant makes it clear that they do not want the matter to go to the board the matter will not go to the board.  There will not be any question of the superintendent, or anybody else in such a case, having to wait for clearance from the board before action can be taken.  Where a complainant makes it <Col N="888" /> clear that they want the matter dealt with outside the scope of the new procedure, informally it will be a matter for the local officers to decide how best to deal with it.  If it is a case of a friendly word to the member in question, or where a ticking off would suffice, that will be the end of it and there is no procedure, nor do I propose one, under which any record of that will be sent to the board.  If, however, the matter being complained of is one that has a disciplinary dimension, and the matter has to be brought further, it will be dealt with by the officer in question under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations.  It is only then that such a matter will go up through the system.</P>

      <P>Do I take it that the Minister does not intend to notify the board of the informal complaints?  If a person signs a document indicating that they do not wish to pursue the matter further can they be satisfied that the matter will not go before the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear in case there is any misunderstanding about this that the signing that the Deputy is talking about is not an indication by the complainant that they do not want to pursue the matter.  It is an indication that they want the matter dealt with informally at local level rather than by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point remaining is the notification to the board of the number and nature of such complaints. The informal resolution will apply to many cases and they will be removed from the whole system without going before the board.  However, I suggested originally that at the end of each month the board should be notified of the number and nature of such complaints. That would mean that the board would be kept informed of what was happening and of the views of members of the public in regard to complaints.  These would go directly to the Commissioner and the Commissioner would get notification so that he could take appropriate action. <Col N="889" /> Informal complaints would indicate to management the best way to establish good relations between the public and the Garda &mdash; a kind of running survey of how the activities of the Garda were being perceived by the public.</P>
      <P>These notifications would be a useful indication to management of future steps to be taken in the ordinary training and in-service training of gardaí and of how best to improve relationships with the public generally.  If the Minister does not intend that these will go to the board, I take it they would still be considered by management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the concern of Deputy Woods but I would not make such a large issue of it.  As I said, there are several possible cases to be considered. One is when a complainant believes that what is required is that the local inspector or superintendent should have a quiet word with a garda.  I do not think it would add to the functions of management if they knew that in a particular division that there were, say, 25 cases in which members of the public found that gardaí were a bit abrupt.  In cases in which matters of discipline were involved, they would be entered in the Garda management process anyway and that would be taken into account by divisional and headquarters managements in regard to the running of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only concern I have about the two amendments is that we would ensure that it will be clear in everybody's mind just how a complainant would want a complaint dealt with so that at a later stage there would not be any confusion or lack of clarity as to what the complainant had in mind at the time.  In that way we would have the confidence of the public and the Garda in the system.  The best course is that every complaint would go to the board except when the complainant indicated that he wished it otherwise.  I presume that the complainant who would not think that his complaint was of any gravity would suggest that a ticking off would be sufficient to deal with it, and a ticking off is not something that normally would be recorded in the Garda system. <Col N="890" /> If an inspector came to a garda and said: &ldquo;You should have been a little softer in dealing with those people who asked you a fairly routine question&rdquo;, that would not be listed in Garda records and would not go through the Garda bureaucracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where we get into the rigidity of the Garda machine.  We are talking about the number and the nature of complaints.  As the Minister said, you might get 50 cases of abruptness on the part of gardaí in a month and perhaps something more than tick-offs should be administered by management. We can look at the Police Complaints Board Review in England for 1984 and we will see that of the 17,245 complaints, 14,373 required no disciplinary action. That is very important from the point of view of police relations with the public. Most of the problems in England were not major, but people might misunderstand such problems.  Between 1978 and 1984 in Britain the pattern was similar to the one I have just cited, with a similar proportion of the complaints made not requiring disciplinary action.  There were 1,424 cases of officers receiving advice. There were 194 cases of charges being brought.</P>
      <P>Here there could be forewarnings to management in regard to the type of problems that would arise.  In the original proposals I made when the Criminal Justice Bill was going through the House I spoke about the importance of dealing with complaints as informally as possible. I was thinking of the number and the nature of informal complaints and I was suggesting that the number and the nature of complaints might be referred to the Commissioner.  If they are the matters covered by the document the Minister is proposing in amendment No. 10, then the Minister might consider that these are things of which management would get a forewarning and this would lead to a better system of management in the future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment no. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), to delete lines 11 to 13 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`investigating officer' means an officer of the Board appointed under section 6 of this Act to investigate an admissible complaint;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 is a matter of definition of what an officer of the board would be.  This is the section which allows the Commissioner to appoint a member of the Garda to be an investigating officer.  This amendment is consequential on amendments Nos. 18 and 19.  The reason I tabled these amendments is because I consider the one major defect in the Bill to be the lack of an independent investigating procedure.  In establishing a board and a complaints procedure we are trying to improve the confidence of the public in the gardaí.  There is a defect in the Bill in that we are allowing the situation to continue whereby if a person wishes his complaint to be formally proceeded with the Commissioner will be empowered under this Bill to appoint a garda to investigate a complaint against the gardaí.</P>
      <P>The single most frequent complaint I have received about the present procedure is the one about the gardaí investigating complaints against themselves. Obviously it will not be done by the garda accused of misconduct but it is obvious that gardaí are investigating their colleagues. The board should have their own investigating officers and where a person wishes to have his complaint dealt with formally it should be done by the investigation officers of the board.</P>
      <P>When the Minister spoke on Second Stage on 28 January 1986 he dealt with this matter.  He dealt with what he considered to be recruitment difficulties and he made the following comment:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> ... neither the scale nor seriousness of the problem in this country could be said to warrant such an extreme solution which would be far more costly than the solution proposed.</P>
    <P>For the very reason mentioned by the Minister, namely, that the scale of the problem is not a major one, I would expect that the vast majority of cases would be dealt with informally.  The question of costs does not arise when one considers we would be relieving members of the Garda from the task of pursuing the investigations.  In turn, they would be free to pursue their normal policing duties, whether on patrol, in court or elsewhere.  I do not believe the net cost would be very high.  It would be a price well worth paying in any event because we would in that way overcome many of the concerns that exist relating to the present procedure where gardaí investigate complaints against their own colleagues. As I am proposing in the three amendments, the investigators should be full time investigators and should be answerable only to the board.</P>
    <P>The nub of the whole Bill is to try to ensure that the public in general have confidence in the procedures established to deal with complaints against the Garda.  That is particularly important in view of the new powers the Garda will have under the Criminal Justice Act which will be brought into effect once this Bill is passed.  It is essential in view of that situation that the public should have confidence in the procedure and the board to be established.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the argument made by the Minister on Second Stage that it would be too costly.  It would release gardaí from the duties of investigating complaints and free them to do their more normal and routine police work. The Minister also referred to problems of recuitment and he spoke of people who might have the necessary skills to carry out investigations.  I have no particular objection to retired gardaí being employed as investigators.  The fact that they have had many years experience would be an advantage and in many cases <Col N="893" /> they would have retired before reaching retirement age.  Former members of the Garda Síochána would be ideal candidates for the job.  I do not accept that the public would have qualms if such people were employed to carry out that work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy De Rossa has said, the effect of his amendments would be that complaints would be investigated by staff especially hired for that purpose by the board rather than by Garda investigating officers appointed by the Commissioner as proposed in the Bill.  I could agree this would be the ideal way of going about it if it were practicable or affordable but I do not think it would be either. Deputy De Rossa referred to one of the points made by my predecessor when he introduced the Bill but I should like to recall some of the other points made also by my predecessor on the same occasion. He said:</P>
      <P>I believe that investigation by a fully independent body is unrealistic.</P>
      <P>For one thing, it would be necessary to appoint a large number of independent investigators &mdash; in effect a second, though naturally very much smaller, police force to handle the work &mdash; and it is by no means clear where persons with the requisite skills and experience for this could be found, bearing in mind that it would often involve investigating complaints alleging criminal offences &mdash; assaults and the like. Former or retired gardaí would, presumably, be unacceptable as not being manifestly independent.</P>
      <P>In this connection I note the point made by Deputy De Rossa to which I shall refer later.  The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>Moreover, even if there were no recruitment difficulties, neither the scale nor seriousness of the problem in this country could be said to warrant such an extreme solution which would be far more costly than the solution proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the only sentence Deputy De <Col N="894" /> Rossa quoted.  The Minister continued as follows:</P>
    <P>Even if independent investigation were free of the difficulties mentioned, there is the fact that many occurrences giving rise to complaints are seldom witnessed by independent third parties and, consequently, there is frequently a conflict of evidence between the complainant on the one hand and the garda on the other without any corroboration of the complainant's allegations.  In these cases supervision of the investigation by an independent board is likely to be just as effective as investigation by a fully independent person.  The credibility of the parties is what has to determine the outcome and, if in the end there is a doubt, the deciding authority &mdash; whether it be a board, tribunal or court &mdash; must give the benefit of it to the garda as the person being accused.</P>
    <P>I must point out that the board are given power in section 6 (5) to have a complaint investigated by the chief executive where they consider the public interest demands it or where the board are not satisfied that a complaint has been properly investigated by the gardaí.  I would not see that provision being invoked on anything other than very rare occasions, particularly having regard to the extent of the powers of supervision given to the board over the conduct of the investigations.</P>
    <P>The selection of gardaí to carry out investigations is not proposed simply because of the excessive cost of any alternatives. Even if an alternative agency were a cheaper way of achieving the result, I doubt that it would be as effective or if persons with the requisite skills could be recruited and kept in what would be a fairly small force with limited promotional opportunities.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa said he would have no objection to retired gardaí.  I think he suggested they would be ideal for the job because of their experience but the same point can be made of serving gardaí, particularly when they are operating under the supervision of a board and where in <Col N="895" /> specific cases section 6 (5) of the Bill gives the board power to have the investigation carried out by a chief executive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to imply that serving gardaí would not be ideal to carry out the investigation.  Of course they would.  I agree that, in the vast majority of cases, they would do an excellent job in pursuing complaints, but we are talking about whether a particular group would do the job as well as another, but whether the public would have complete confidence that the procedure being established is totally independent.</P>
      <P>As I said, the most frequent complaint I get about the present complaints procedures is that it is gardaí investigating themselves.  While I have no doubt that in the vast majority of cases they do so effectively, efficiently, fairly and justly, the fact is that people have this idea in the back of their minds that it is not a totally independent procedure and, if their complaint is not validated by the investigation, they have a niggling doubt whether the gardaí carrying out the investigation can be expected to come to a decision which may be harmful to their colleagues.  That is a point we must bear in mind when we are deciding whether to have an independent investigation team or to use the existing Garda force to carry out the investigations.</P>
      <P>Gardaí who had left the force, because of early retirement or for any other reason, could carry out an investigation and would be seen to be independent because they were no longer part of the Garda force.  It is as important for the Garda that they be seen to be independent as it is for the public because the Garda require the confidence of the public to carry out their duties effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that I only quoted one point from his predecessor's Second Stage speech.  I quoted that section because it appeared to be the main point the Minister was making, although I referred in passing to the fact that he had also referred to the expected <Col N="896" /> unsuitability of retired gardaí.  In his pre-decessor's speech, the question of cost loomed very large in his argument, although there seems to be a contradiction in what the previous Minister and what the present Minister said in relation to cost.  On the one hand it is said that a large force of investigators would have to be appointed and, on the other hand, that the small number of complaints would not warrant a large force of investigators. Perhaps the Minister will explain where the large number of investigators come from, and how many complaints he expects the board would have to deal with in any one year.</P>
    <P>I do not have any figures of complaints received, but I have figures for the numbers of gardaí who were disciplined, dismissed and so on during the years 1972 to 1985.  The figures for gardaí fined &mdash; these disciplinary measures did not necessarily arise from complaints from the public &mdash; for breaches of discipline were in October 1985, 107; in 1984, 103; in 1983, 108; and less than 100 in the previous three years.  The average figure seems to be 100.  A number of gardaí were dismissed in those years as well varying from three in 1972 to as many as 17 in 1984, but dropping to four in 1985.  It appears that the complaints which would require to be investigated by an independent body would not be so large that we would not need a large army of investigators.</P>
    <P>Assuming gardaí are investigating complaints the time taken obviously precludes them from being involved in normal police duties.  It would make for better use of Garda time if they were free to follow normal investigations of crime, routine patrolling and so on and not have the problem of dealing with what would be relatively minor complaints about breaches of discipline by a garda.</P>

      <P>I put down amendment No. 48 to the Criminal Justice Bill, 1983. We looked at this from an Opposition point of view and at what was happening in other countries.  I did a certain amount of that work during the summer recess of <Col N="897" /> 1983.  Subsection (3) (e) of that amendment proposed that the Garda Síochána Complaints Commission should have the functions conferred under or by virtue of that legislation in relation to the investigation, including the supervision of any investigation or complaints made by members of the public concerning acts of misconduct on the part of members or officers of the Garda Síochána.  Our main concern there was that the board &mdash; we called them the commission then &mdash; would have the power to supervise and also the power to investigate exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>We recognised that the most practical and feasible way of dealing with the investigations was the precedent whereby the gardaí themselves would appoint someone at a high level to look into and investigate any matter.  That has the confidence of the people in present circumstances, but we recognise Deputy De Rossa's point that there could be circumstances in which it would be important to have the matter dealt with other than by the members who would be dealing with that internally, so to speak.  The Minister has met that by the provision he has made in the Bill.  For instance, section 6 (1) (c) provides: &ldquo;The Board may prescribe general principles to be observed in the appointment of investigating officers under Paragraph (a) of this subsection.&rdquo; Therefore, the board have a function in that sense in that they set the principles to be observed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 63 (3) (a) provides: &ldquo;The Board shall supervise generally the investigation of complaints...&rdquo; so that the board have the function of supervising the investigation of that complaint anyway under that section.  Section 6 (5) (a) provides that the board may at any time request the chief executive to investigate or cause to be investigated, a complaint. It is not only for the chief executive himself to investigate, but he may cause a complaint to be investigated. I understand that to mean that, if it is necessary for the board to take on some external specialist for a particular investigation, the board can make direct provision for circumstances, which I think <Col N="898" /> Deputy De Rossa recognises would be likely to be exceptional but could arise and would be necessary.  From the various discussions and debates we have had, it seems that for all practical purposes the Minister has covered this requirement.</P>
    <P>We can find evidence in some other countries.  I remember reading that where they tried the other procedure of having a totally external arrangement it did not work in practice.  In practical terms it was not very feasible.  The people had not the same insight into the operations generally to make it feasible.  I will have to get the reference to that separately, but I remember cases where that was occurring, where it was tried and it was not working or was not working out very well.  That was probably in the US. Naturally, this would come to one's mind as a matter of concern.  The Minister is making reasonable provision for that here by allowing the board, where they consider it necessary, to investigate directly or to cause an investigation to be done in some other way, but under the normal procedure the gardaí would be able to do the job thoroughly with integrity and with the support of the public. Once we make provision for exceptional circumstances we need not be unduly worried about public confidence generally. That provision is made and the board will have that oversight all the time and that supervisory power.</P>

      <P>If this Bill is to be taken seriously by the public the board must be and must be seen to be independent.  A recent case in which I was involved in Drogheda made me think.  I will not call it a celebrated case, a word used in judicial circles.  When discussing my case subsequently with a senior police officer friend of mine in a very informal manner he said to me: &ldquo;I do not wish to discuss it <Col N="899" /> because, after all, they are my colleagues.&rdquo; That appalled me.  He was not concerned that perhaps his colleagues had been guilty of an indiscretion or of wronging me.  That fact that they were his colleagues was paramount for him.</P>
      <P>That illustrates the fear I have about gardaí investigating themselves.  There is a fair measure of public concern about this.  The gardaí should have representation on this board, but gardaí should not investigate themselves.  They should be investigated by somebody from the legal profession, somebody outside and independent of the gardaí.  If this Bill is to be anything other than a charade, the board must be totally independent of the police. As Deputy De Rossa said, this Bill is in the interests of the police themselves and any decisions made by this board must be seen to be completely independent of police influence.'</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa began by asking what would be the expected level of complaints.  I am sure he will not disagree with me when I say that is in large measure an unanswerable question. It is very difficult to say in advance.  The figures Deputy De Rossa referred to of around 100 cases in each of the last four years of gardaí being fined and varying numbers of gardaí being dismissed, as he said, would not all relate to the kinds of complaints that would be dealt with under this Bill.  A number of them would relate to purely disciplinary matters that would not come under the umbrella of the procedure we are providing for in this Bill.  On a more general level the number of complaints has been running at around 400 or so a year in the last two years. Again, that is not necessarily an indication of the number of complaints that would fall to be dealt with by the board when set up, if only for the reason, for example, that a number of those complaints might be dealt with informally at the request of the complainant.  Therefore, it is difficult to say what the number would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa is not on good ground when he believes he detects a <Col N="900" /> conflict between what I was saying about the cost and size of separate investigative machinery and what my predecessor said at the time he held this office.  I made the point, as did my predecessor, that if we were to take that road we would need a fairly large force of people.  It would be large enough to cost a bit; it would be too small to provide any career prospects for people in it.  There is no conflict between those two statements.  I said that, apart from anything else, the cost was not the main factor in deciding me against taking that road.  I might say in passing that, if I had the resources to have extra investigators of any kind, I would like to have them in the Garda force.  We have provided the maximum level of resources we can for manpower in tha Garda at 11,400.  As I have pointed out in this House, the strength of the force is greater than it has been for very many years.</P>
    <P>I must point out to Deputy De Rossa and Deputy McGahon that the difference this Bill makes compared with the present situation is the fact that now we are providing for a board who will supervise these investigations.  Let me point out to my friend and colleague, Deputy McGahon, that he is rather inconsistent to require that gardaí be represented on the board and then to demand that the board be fully independent.  The two things do not go together.</P>

      <P>In addition, 12 reports of Dáil committees have been debated in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>On a more general note, I can inform the Deputy that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges recently approved a proposal by the Leader of the House to provide, on an experimental basis, extra Dáil sitting time to debate reports, including reports of committees.  A motion to give effect to this is being drafted and, following consultation with the Whips, it is hoped to bring the new arrangements into effect soon.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that it is a disgraceful performance to have debated three out of a total of 49 reports presented by all-party committees to this House?  Does he further agree that this amounts to a failure on the part of the Government to lead in reforming the procedures of this Chamber? Is it not the role of Government to lead in the matter of Dáil reform?  Would <Col N="902" /> he agree also that the plans of the Minister for Finance to reform this House and to make the committees more relevant are now in shreds?</P>

      <P>If that were done, more time could be given to debating committees' reports.  Since Easter, the House has been sitting for four days a week, until 11.30 p.m. on two nights and until 4 p.m. on Fridays.  That is a fair amount of time to give to legislation and, with the co-operation of the Opposition, we have got through many Bills.  We recognise that we must allot time to debate the reports of the committees.  At present a motion is being drawn up and the Opposition Whip and I will decide the details.  It is proposed to discuss the reports of these committees on Tuesdays between 8.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. and, if it is done in an ordered way, we will get through them.  However, although it is desirable to discuss these reports it is not necessary.  Many of these committees have been very good and have provided thought for future legislation.  A number of the proposals on the committee dealing with building land will be incorporated in future legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in the light of the increased public concern arising from a number of nuclear related incidents, the Government will consider convening a meeting of other non-nuclear States with a view to launching a campaign for a new United Nations backed treaty which would facilitate the proper monitoring of all nuclear installations, with a view to ensuring the most effective possible safety standards, as well as the maximum possible warning of, and protection from nuclear accidents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government strongly support the convening of an international conference which would seek to agree, <i>inter alia</i>, internationally binding safety standards for the operation of nuclear power installations and arrangements <Col N="905" /> for international supervision and enforcement.</P>
      <P>The response of the international community to the Chernobyl incident already includes proposals for the convening of an international conference to discuss the lessons to be learnt from this accident in relation to the safety of nuclear power installations.</P>
      <P>On 14 May, General-Secretary Gorbachev of the Soviet Union proposed an intensification of international co-operation in the area of information exchange and early warning in the case of accidents and the establishment of mutual assistance mechanisms in cases of accident.  He suggested that a high level conference within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency should be convened to discuss these issues.</P>
      <P>Chancellor Kohl of the Federal Republic of Germany has also proposed an international conference of nuclear power countries and also of countries with a substantial interest in the nuclear power issue.  Ireland has indicated, in response to an approach from the German authorities, that we strongly support the idea of such a conference and would be interested in receiving an invitation to it if, in fact, it is to be held. It is envisaged that this conference would seek international agreement on information mechanisms and measures of mutual assistance in the case of accidents, as well as the question of internationally agreed standards of safety for the operation of nuclear power installations.</P>
      <P>Following a special session of the Board of Governors of the IAEA on 21 May, it was proposed that, within the IAEA framework, experts would meet on an urgent basis to draw up international agreements on early notification and information exchange, as well as on emergency response and mutual assistance measures in the event of nuclear accident.  Furthermore, it was proposed that an international conference be convened at an early date on the full range of nuclear safety issues, including nuclear safety policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure <Col N="906" /> from the Minister's reply, which was fairly lengthy and read at great speed, whether or not the international conference he is talking about is an international conference of countries using nuclear power.  I believe there are only about 24 countries in the world that have nuclear power stations.  Is that what the Minister is saying?  Does the Minister not consider that the countries which should be attempting to monitor these power stations are the remaining 120 or 130 countries in the world?  Has the Minister any initiative to bring forward to the United Nations in this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refers to an international conference.  That is why I wonder why a separate conference needs to be convened when the United Nations exists for this purpose.  Does the Minister not intend to raise this matter at the United Nations?  It is an excellent idea to have as many conferences as possible on this issue.  But what I am asking is: does the Minister intend to bring forward any initiatives at the United Nations on this in order to bring forward whatever agreements or suggestions are made at these international conferences and to <Col N="907" /> have them agreed through the United Nations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share my disappointment about the statement in Tokyo by the leaders of the seven industrialised nations which was confined to talking about a better system of notification of accidents and that, as far as those leaders of the western world are concerned, the only thing they came up with was a system of notification of accidents? In other words, they contemplated accidents happening and then having some improved or perfected system of notification of the accidents.  Will the Minister agree that that is a particularly defeatist and negative way for those leaders of the democratic world to approach this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only half of the story.  If there is an accident we want better notification.  The accident in the Ukraine in April underlines that.  But as well as that what we have asked the EC to do under Euratom is to set up a system of improving safety in nuclear stations so that such accidents do not occur.  That is the preventative side and is much more desirable even though the other is necessary as well.  Preventing accidents by establishing higher safety standards in nuclear stations is much more desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Mac Giolla and I are seeking is a meeting of those states who do not have a vested interest in nuclear power.  We should come together and assert ourselves in this threatening situation.  Does the Minister visualise such a conference either under the auspices of the UN or separately? Will he agree that it is the nations who have nothing to gain from nuclear energy but who are exposed to all the risks who should have the main say in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be against the coming together of those states who have no nuclear installations themselves. But it is unrealistic to talk about convening a conference purely to protest at countries who have nuclear installations. We must remember that the people in the Ukraine suffered very grievously so it is not right to say that it is of no concern to the people who have installations.  In this case their citizens have died or suffered from the effects of radiation.  It is a different concern but a very real concern to those of us who live next to countries where there are nuclear installations.  But it would be unrealistic to hold a conference about nuclear safety and about the effects of accidents without having present at that conference the countries who have the nuclear installations. They are the people we must bring into a conference so that they raise their standards and introduce measures that are necessary in the case of an accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to differentiate and recognise that there is a valid difference between those countries that do not have nuclear energy and those countries that have?  Does he not see that we would have different priorities?  Unfortunately, countries that are committed to nuclear energy almost certainly would not be prepared to go as far in the areas of safety &mdash; as some would wish, to the extent of closure &mdash; as those of us who have no nuclear energy, who are never likely to have it and who gain nothing from it? There are two different sets of nations <Col N="909" /> with different approaches and different priorities.</P>
      <P>The sort of conference the Minister has in mind, a mixture of both, might achieve something but it is much more likely to be totally stymied and negatived by the efforts of those countries who do not want inspection &mdash; and I will name them if necessary.  Failing any progress in such a conference &mdash; and I would not have any confidence in such an international conference making any progress &mdash; at least we might get somewhere if the nations who have no vested interest but who are exposed to danger could express our wishes as to what we would like to see happen in the world.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that at present the European Community, towards which his Government are directing all their efforts and on which they are relying, has no real powers in this matter, that there is no inspectorate in the Community which could inspect nuclear installations and that it is very doubtful if the present Treaty would permit the establishment of such an inspectorate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last part of the Deputy's question, there is no inspectorate at the moment.  That is why, prior to the Chernobyl disaster, we wrote to the EC in early April to get such an inspectorate established.  There will be a meeting in Brussels on Friday of this week to reinforce this point.  We believe that the European Community can take its powers from chapter 3 of the Euratom Treaty to establish such an inspectorate.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Haughey appears to infer that a conference which included states with nuclear installations would not be more effective in imposing standards than a meeting from which they were excluded.  Obviously, those who have no nuclear installations would probably bring in very much higher standards, but they would have no means of enforcing them.  It would be purely their view as to what should be done.</P>

However, it would be quicker and easier to have a conference under the IAEA in the autumn of this year which would have the effect of bringing around the table nuclear and non-nuclear countries so that standards could be drawn up, overseen and implemented.  If that does not succeed, or if the non-nuclear states consider that the measures are inadequate, then another conference could follow on. Urgency is what is needed now and what is proposed by the IAEA can be done by the autumn of this year and should be proceeded with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Ireland supports the imposition of sanctions as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the South African Government. However, it is our view that for such sanctions to be effective they should be carefully chosen, selective, graduated and imposed by the Security Council.  A trade embargo by a single small country would be unlikely to influence South African policy in the direction Ireland would wish to see it take.  As Deputies will be aware, Zambia is a priority country for Ireland's development cooperation programme and will this year receive assistance to the extent of IR£2.4 million. Zimbabwe, which is not a priority country, will receive IR£270,000.  Ireland is not involved in development assistance in Botswana but projects to assist development in that country would be eligible for consideration for assistance by my Department in the normal way.</P>

      <P>It is the EC Commission which has the right of initiative to make proposals in the budgetary area, and, subsequent to the last Foreign Affairs Council in May, the Commission submitted proposals in regard to the Community budget for the current year and for 1987. These proposals have not yet been discussed by the Council.</P>
      <P>The Commission has proposed a supplementary budget for the current year which, if adopted, would have the effect of using all the resources available within the 1.4 per cent ceiling of VAT returns which member states make over to the Community in order to finance the budget.  This proposed supplementary budget is under consideration by the member states and will be discussed in detail by the Budget Council when it meets next month.</P>

      <P>The proposal for the Commission, who are the initiating body, only came in after the last Foreign Affairs Council budgetary meeting.  Although my reply says next month, this matter will be considered by the Budgetary Council this month.  I do not accept, without having examined the figures in detail, that the Community will be out of funds by September, as the Deputy says.  The supplementary budget being proposed by the Commission for 1986 is relatively modest and will be within the 1.4 per cent ceiling.  What is of more concern is the position for the year after.  I gather that the year 1986-87 can be facilitated within the 1.4 per cent but 1988 is a very different matter.  Unless there is agreement to raise the ceiling from 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent, the Community will be in trouble in 1988.</P>

      <P>I find it very hard to take seriously what the Minister says having regard to the fact that informed opinion agrees unanimously that the 1.4 per cent ceiling on VAT will not be sufficient for 1986.  Would the Minister not agree that there is room for great concern at present because of the shortfall of cash that will emerge and that the Commission, the heads of State and the Council of Foreign Ministers have been doing nothing about it?  Would the Minister turn his mind back to the time when we discussed in this House the question of the admission of Spain and Portugal to the Community.  At that time we, on this side of the House, urged that appropriate steps should have been taken to ensure that there would be sufficient finances to maintain and improve the different schemes in operation within the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We put forward the case very strongly that 1.4 per cent was not sufficient given the demands for new policies, the joining of Spain and Portugal to the Community and the number of other existing policies which cost more than was originally thought.  At the time we said that the ceiling should be 2 per cent but that was not agreed to.  The figure of 1.4 per cent was agreed.  The budget for 1986 plus the supplementary budget for 1986 and 1987 can, according to the Commission, be contained within the 1.4 per cent ceiling.  We may argue whether or not those budgets are large enough. I agree with the Deputy that they are probably not large enough.  We would argue for more but they can be contained within the 1.4 per cent ceiling.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that because of the obstinacy of member states, in particular the United Kingdom and Germany, the EC are not able to increase the limit from 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent or 2 per cent and that because of this downright obstinate opposition to an increase in the VAT levels the Commission are being forced <Col N="916" /> to tailor make their policies and programmes to suit a budget which is not sufficient?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem in agreeing that a number of countries in the EC are not willing to lift the ceiling above the 1.4 per cent.  Ireland and a number of other countries proposed that that ceiling should be 2 per cent.  We could not get agreement on that.  We could only get agreement on the 1.4 per cent.  I agree that the budgets put forward have to be within that limit.  The budget put forward for 1986 is below that.  The 1987 budget will tip that ceiling.  The problem is not in regard to these two years because budgets that are adequate for the Community can be drawn up and will come within the 1.4 per cent ceiling. In 1988 they cannot be drawn up.  That is the real problem.</P>

      <P>All countries reserve strictly to themselves the right to determine and administer their immigration policies in the light of their own needs. Most countries base immigration on criteria such as their need for skills in short supply, or family relationships to people already resident.  Immigration is, therefore, a matter determined by the changing needs, or at least the capacities, of the country of immigration, not on changing patterns of emigration in the countries from which people come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stressed on previous occasions that US immigration policy is not based on national quotas but rather on objective criteria such as skills or family relationships. It is clear that this last criterion is now of more limited benefit to Irish citizens due to the low emigration to the <Col N="917" /> US from the late fifties onwards.  Countries such as Australia stress that their policies also are not based on national quotas.  Australia has recently adjusted its immigration rules to widen the &ldquo;family sponsorship&rdquo; to a broader range to include uncles and aunts.  Indeed, they have introduced new possibilities for those with no relations there.  However, the basic criteria remain young, skilled, educated and employable.  In Canada too the criteria are based on skills or in some cases business ability.</P>
    <P>My Department monitor closely such developments and any changes in immigration rules or policies in countries which are likely to be of interest to Irish citizens.  This involves contacts by our embassies with relevant officials in those countries and, where necessary, we raise issues of concern to us with the countries in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs current Government policy in relation to world disarmament, and in particular nuclear disarmament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy on disarmament questions continues to focus on nuclear disarmament, because the challenge of eliminating these weapons remains at the forefront of our concern for the maintenance of world peace. The Government recognise that these weapons will not cease to exist in the foreseeable future, and that no real progress will be made in this direction until the two super powers agree on concrete measures to curb and reverse the nuclear arms race.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context we have welcomed the resumption of the bilateral talks between the two super powers and consider it important that they come to grips with the problems of the nuclear arms race, not only in the field of reductions but also with regard to the more fundamental issues of nuclear testing and the curbing of the spiral of nuclear arms.  In the framework of the United Nations and in <Col N="918" /> other disarmament fora we also play an active part in advocating and supporting measures in pursuit of these objectives.</P>
    <P>While we reject the concept of nuclear deterrence as the long term basis of international security, it is unfortunately true that we must deal with nuclear weapons in the knowledge that they currently form the basis of security for most of the industrialised countries.  Nonetheless we must recall that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, of which Ireland is an architect and steadfast promoter, sought to freeze the number of nuclear weapons States by securing commitments from many States, which had been considering the acquisition of nuclear weapons capability, to renounce this objective in the interest of international peace and stability.</P>
    <P>The NPT was equally addressed to the nuclear weapon States.  It required the implementation of commitments aimed at reducing and eliminating nuclear weapons. The measure which it singled out as a first and most important step in this direction was the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty.  There can be no doubt that the conclusion of a CTBT would be the most credible demonstration of a commitment by the nuclear weapon States to their long term intentions to eliminate nuclear weapons.  So long as these States maintain their option to test, they could not be said to have taken that road.  Ireland has consistently promoted the goal of concluding a CTBT in implementation of the commitments contained in the NPT.  The Irish delegation at the 1985 review conference of the parties to the NPT worked hard and successfully to secure from the conference a renewed commitment to the conclusion of a CTBT as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>When I addressed the Third Review Conference of the parties to the NPT, I called for the introduction of a moratorium by the nuclear weapon states parties to the treaty in the context of negotiations on a CTBT, either in the framework of the trilateral negotiations which were broken off in 1981 or in the framework of the multilateral negotiations at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament.  I <Col N="919" /> note that the Soviet Union has announced once again a limited moratorium on testing along the lines of a previous moratorium which it introduced prior to the NPT Review Conference.  I am just as strongly of the view now, as I was when I so stated at the review, that a moratorium will only have value if adopted by all nuclear weapon States, or at least by those nuclear weapon States parties to the NPT.  I do, however, believe that there is an obligation on all the nuclear weapon States to consider urgently the halting of testing as well as the negotiation of a CTBT.</P>
    <P>While underlining the priority of questions of nuclear disarmament, we must record that the security system foreseen in the Charter of the United Nations is not being implemented.  With increasing frequency recourse is being made to the use of force instead of to the machinery available for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means.  Wars are being fought today which cause enormous loss of life, both military and civilian.  We see the renewed use of chemical weapons in the Gulf War, weapons whose use has been outlawed since 1925 by the Geneva Protocol. For our part the Government have introduced export controls in order to prevent the acquisition by countries, which have used such weapons of chemical substances which could contribute to their chemical weapons capability.  We have co-ordinated our efforts in this regard with our partners in the European Community in particular and also with other industrialised countries.  However, such measures cannot be effective other than as a delaying action.</P>
    <P>In the view of the Government it is of primary importance that a chemical weapons convention be concluded in the near future, both to prevent chemical weapons capability and use from becoming more widespread and in order to bring an end to the modernisation and stockpiling of these weapons by the two super powers.  We believe that the time for the conclusion of a chemical weapons convention has arrived.  The experts' work on implementation mechanisms has <Col N="920" /> almost been completed and all that is required is the political will to conclude an agreement.</P>

I ask the Minister if he would reconsider what I think is a very dangerous sentiment which he has expressed. I am not sure exactly of the thrust of his remarks but they seemed to be somewhere along the lines that nuclear armaments are the basis of the security of industrialised nations?  I would ask him if he would repeat that aspect of his reply.

      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is a very important distinction of principle between accepting that it is the basis of their security and what most Deputies in the House would adhere to, namely, that the basic cause of insecurity in the world is that the super powers keep on building their nuclear armaments in the mistaken belief on both sides that they must keep on until they reach equilibrium with the other?  Would the Minister not agree that therein lies the basic fallacy and the danger in the whole situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that.  The fact that I agree with it and that I disapprove of what is going on does not alter the fact that the two super powers believe that nuclear weapons are the basis for their own security and they intend to build until they get them in balance and until one side is sure the other has no advantage over it.  The only way we can get them to reduce those levels is when they are both satisfied they are equal. That is the basis of the Geneva conference. I hope it will succeed and that events over the past few months have not put a spoke in that wheel.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy has said about chemical warfare is absolutely correct.  It is most regrettable that chemical weapons should have been used in the Gulf War in the last two years, for the first time since the First World War.  It would be entirely inappropriate to discuss such a matter in the framework of political co-operation in Europe.  It has no place there.  What has a place is the condemnation of all forms of weaponry, whether they be conventional, nuclear or chemical weapons and an endeavour by a country like Ireland, hopefully supported by its partners, to make whatever political gestures are necessary to see that the level worldwide is reduced.  The actual deployment of weapons is not a matter appropriate for discussion in the European Community.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the need to have multilateral disarmament of all kinds. <Col N="923" /> Would the Minister use every means available to him to encourage the renewal and, hopefully the successful renewal, of the summit process which appeared to be so optimistic last year but which seems to have gone a little awry recently?  May I take it that it is the position of the Irish Government to use every endeavour to encourage the renewal and reinforcement of that process between the two super powers?  Even though it is a multilateral question it is through the joint efforts, hopefully, of the two super powers that progress will be made.  Could I also ask the Minister whether or not we are also pursuing every avenue open to us through the United Nations?  I would like the Minister to reaffirm that while we recognise the reality of the position of the two super powers, nevertheless, for a small nation like ours it is to the United Nations and their procedures we must ultimately look for success in this area.</P>

      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference has met five times since the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in November last year.  The joint statements issued after these meetings have been placed before the House.  The Deputy will be aware from these that the conference has begun work on a wide range of issues of central interest to Nationalists including a Bill of Rights, the use of flags and emblems, Irish language and culture, electoral arrangements and the role and composition of public bodies in Northern Ireland and cross-Border co-operation in economic, social and cultural matters.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference has also dealt with security policy including cross-Border security, relations between the security forces and the community and the legal system and the administration of justice.  We are working actively in the conference for a programme of special measures to make the security forces more acceptable to Nationalists and for reform in the administration of justice.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, I spent a day up in Cavan and Monaghan the week before last visiting some of my friends.  I received a number of deputations there, including some from chambers of commerce.  But most of the submissions I received from the chambers of commerce, county councils, trade promotion bodies and tourism boards on both sides of the Border, were applications for funds from the international fund when it is set up.  That fund has not yet been established.  The criteria on which the funds will be distributed have not yet been established.  Therefore, I could not respond except by way of acknowledgement of their submissions up to this point.</P>

      <P>The Minister's visit and the statement he made do not bear out the facts of the case.  For example the Minister made reference to the Erne catchment drainage scheme and to the Ballinamore/Ballyconnell canal.  Nothing has been done in that area despite extensive pressure having been brought to bear on Departments in recent years.  Would the Ministers not agree that lack of progress or communication is one of the most dissatisfying aspects of cross-Border co-operation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Erne catchment area project predates the Anglo-Irish Conference.  I have been endeavouring to get movement on the opening of the Ballyconnell canal since I was Minister for Tourism in the mid seventies.  It would constitute one of the most valuable contributions not alone to cross-Border co-operation but to community co-operation on the whole island, in addition to providing one of the most attractive waterways in all of Europe if that canal were opened.</P>

      <P>Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish agreement, the Intergovernmental Conference has become the official framework for the promotion of cross-Border co-operation.  The extent of the co-operation which exists is apparent from the catalogue of cross-Border social and economic co-operation which was published as an annex to the joint statement issues after the 11 March meeting of the conference, and which has already been laid before the House.  Semi-State bodies are among the organisations engaged in this co-operation.</P>

      <P>Legislation has been adopted or is being considered in the State Legislatures of a number of individual states in the United States requiring adherence to the McBride Principles. Such legislation so far adopted refers to American companies located in Northern Ireland in which public funds in the State concerned are invested.  The passage of such legislation is a matter for the State concerned.  In regard to the McBride Principles the Government have no difficulty in supporting the main aim of the McBride Principles, namely the elimination discrimination in employment in Northern Ireland.  As the Deputy is aware the Anglo-Irish Agreement sets out the commitment of the Irish and British Governments to a society in Northern Ireland free from discrimination and intolerance.  The Intergovernmental Conference established under the agreement is concerned with the avoidance of economic and social discrimination.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in an interview with the <i>Irish Echo</i> on 9 May 1985 the Taoiseach stated that laws against discrimination were not being adequately enforced and that some pressure along the lines of the McBride Principles to ensure that American firms live up to the standards they should be living up to would help.  Can the Minister explain why in the light of the Taoiseach's remarks, Irish diplomats in the States are lobbying against the McBride Principles by implying that they might lead to disinvestment? Does the Minister stand over the Consul General's letter on 20 March 1986 to Senator Ohrenstein which seeks to dissuade him from supporting the McBride Principles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a misrepresentation. The Deputy did not see the Consul General's letter.  He saw an account of it in a newspaper report.  When he quoted from the <i>Irish Echo</i> he should have also stated &ldquo;We are concerned here with a different point and that is the suggestion that there should be disinvestment in Northern Ireland.  Because the problem of unemployment in Northern Ireland is so enormous with 21 per cent unemployed we would not want action which would withdraw investment and lead to disemployment.  We would not be in favour of disinvestment but we are very much in favour of and have ourselves taken up with the British Government on many occasions, the question of ensuring an end to discrimination&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Question Time.  The following is the letter from the Consul General in New York to the State legislators in New York or Massachusetts, I am not sure which:</P>
      <P>As is well known the minority (Nationalist) Community in Northern Ireland has been discriminated against over the years in various cases and has borne and continues to bear a greater share of unemployment than the majority (Unionist) community does. The chronically high rates of unemployment in minority areas have been a significant factor in nationalist alienation from the institutions of government in Northern Ireland.  The Irish Government have consistently drawn attention to and has worked to end discrimination in employment in Northern Ireland and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>There are, however, certain factors and circumstances unique to Northern Ireland, which militate against an easy resolution of the unsatisfactory job situation currently obtaining there.</P>
      <P>(i)  The gravity of the job situation is dramatically illustrated when one refers to the decline which has taken place in the numbers engaged in manufacturing employment in Northern Ireland from 170,000 in 1974 to 100,000 now, 15,000 of whom are directly dependent on public subsidy.</P>
      <P>(ii)  At least some enterprises located in exclusively Unionist or Nationalist areas are likely to continue to attract workers from those communities only, for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  In addition, for so long as prospects for expanding existing employment are not encouraging, efforts to enforce affirmative action to benefit the minority at the expense of the majority would exacerbate bitterness between the communities rather than promote <Col N="937" /> reconciliation, which is the aim of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>It is against this background, as well as because of the desire to create new employment opportunities through additional investment, that the Irish Government is looking to the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement as the best means of, among other things, resolving the present unsatisfactory jobs situation.  The Social Democratic and Labour Party of John Hume, which secured 65 per cent of the Nationalist vote in the most recent Northern Ireland election, fully supports the Irish Government's position on the Agreement.  The Agreement, which was signed by the Taoiseach Dr. Garret FitzGerald and the British Prime Minister on 15 November 1985, set up an Intergovernmental Conference which, among other matters, concerns itself with the avoidance of economic and social discrimination in Northern Ireland. Moreover, the Conference provides a framework within which the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals on the role and composition of such bodies as the Fair Employment Agency and the Equal Opportunities Commission.  It is our view that the scrupulous application of the existing fair employment legislation, and its review in the future, combined with the Irish Government's input into the Conference will have a beneficial effect in ensuring equality of treatment for both sections of the community which is one of the principal objectives of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>As to the specific economic needs of Northern Ireland, it is evident that increased employment on a non-discriminatory basis through increased investment is urgently required in the area.  For this reason, among others, we believe that, while the philosophy underlying the MacBride Principles presents no difficulties for us, any action which, in the serious economic situation of Northern Ireland, might lead to disinvestment and to the discouragement <Col N="938" /> of US firms investing in Northern Ireland should be avoided. Were the investment climate there to be adversely affected at this time the purposes of the Anglo-Irish Agreement would be seriously undermined.</P>
    <P>Under the Agreement measures are in train to create an international fund to which the US and other governments would contribute to promote the economic and social development of those areas of both parts of Ireland which have suffered most seriously from the consequences of instability there in recent years.  The US House of Representatives has already unanimously approved a proposal to provide $250 million in aid to the fund.  The Irish Government will ensure that disbursements from the fund will be applied on a non-discriminatory basis, with full respect for equality of opportunity and will address the needs of both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Official development assistance to developing countries is being increased significantly this year and there are plans for another substantial increase in 1987.</P>
      <P>The provision in the 1986 Estimates reflects the Government's continuing commitment as set out in the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> to expand Ireland's assistance to the developing countries of the Third World.  In accordance with <i>Building on Reality</i> the allocation for Irish ODA is £43,961,000 in 1986 compared with a provision of £38,357,000 in 1985.  There is, therefore, an increase in 1986 of 15 per cent over the 1985 figure. It is planned that expenditure will rise to approximately £50 million in 1987.  Ireland's ODA will have grown from £34 million to £50 million or 47 per cent during the period of the national plan.</P>
      <P>I am delighted with the very successful Band Aid, Live Aid and Sport Aid ventures to raise both money and awareness of the plight of some of the poorest and least developed countries of the world.  We are all proud of the generous response of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>In so far as the official development assistance programme is concerned the Government are satisfied that the policy of steady significant growth which it is following under the national plan is the correct one.</P>

In that regard we share in a long tradition because since the ODA package was launched in the mid-seventies by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, when he was Foreign Minister, there has been a pattern of steady growth each year.  Indeed, without wanting to introduce any element of politics into this, I must state that there has been only one year when we failed to achieve that &mdash; in 1979 when Deputy Collins was Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>Before Question Time concern was <Col N="1017" /> expressed by Deputy McGahon about one of the matters raised earlier.  I said it was inconsistent of Deputy McGahon to be making a case for a completely independent investigation of the Garda while at the same time proposing something that is not in the Bill, that is, that the Garda should be represented on the board.  I had said that by comparison with the present position, the main change is that the investigation of complaints about the Garda would be carried out under the supervision of the board and that they would give added reassurance to the public and to the Garda about the investigation of complaints.  When the board believe that the public interest would demand it and when they were not satisfied that a complaint had been properly investigated by the Garda, they would ensure that the complaint would be investigated by their chief executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister misunderstood what I said earlier.  I was not suggesting that there was a contradiction between what the Minister said and what his predecessor, Deputy Noonan had said.  My point was that there is a contradiction between an independent investigation and a Garda investigation.  You cannot argue on the one hand that we would need a large number of investigators and on the other that the scale of the problem would be so small that it would not warrant the appointment of a number of investigators.</P>
      <P>The Minister repeated what the former Minister said in January, that there would be a large number of investigators needed, that it was presumed that retired gardaí would not be acceptable, that the appointment of investigators would be too costly and would not be justified because of the scale and seriousness of the problem, that supervision by the board would be just as effective and that career opportunities for independent investigators would be nearly nil because of the small number of complaints involved. There are a number of contradictions there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the point that a large <Col N="1018" /> number of investigators would be needed, the Minister indicated that in 1985 there were about 400 complaints.  If it is accepted that many of the people who make complaints will want them dealt with on an informal basis, it can be assumed that a high proportion of them will not need the services of the board at all.  I will take a comparison.  The Ombudsman employs about 16 investigators and in 1985 his office dealt with 2,392 complaints.  That would not bear comparison with the pursuit and investigation of complaints in relation to the Garda.  It is reasonable, however, to draw a comparison to indicate the numbers involved. The Minister suggested 400 complaints against the Garda, and we can compare that with 2,392 investigations by the Ombudsman.  We can take it, accordingly, that no more than eight investigators would be required to deal with complaints against the Garda, and that is allowing a fairly wide margin for possible increases in complaints on the 400 specified, and a shorter period for investigation.  Perhaps the Minister will contest that, but he did not give an indication of the number of independent investigators who would be required.</P>
    <P>On the question of the unacceptability of retired gardaí, that is an Aunt Sally set up by the previous Minister.  I do not know if anybody made that point against retired gardaí.  I would not have any problem with such personnel as independent investigators if they were no longer members of the Garda and had no connection with the force from the point of view of remuneration or discipline.  That question, therefore, does not arise.  On the point about the justification for appointing independent investigators by the scale or the seriousness of the problem I indicated that the serious element is the importance to establish beyond question the independence and the fairness of the investigation procedure so that people would see it was independent because of the involvement of independent investigators.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill as it stands, the board and the chief executive would request that a Garda superintendent would carry <Col N="1019" /> out the investigations.  Surely a superintendent's time is fairly expensive, and such an officer, anyhow, would be better disposed doing other work.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that it would make sense to have a corps of independent investigators whose full time job it would be to investigate, and who would be on salaries.  Clearly, the level of salary would be the attraction to take on the job.  I do not know much about career prospects but I am sure there are all sorts of transfer facilities available within the Civil Service which would ensure that people of a certain grade could be transferred to other areas in the service or who could apply for positions in a higher grade.  I do not think that is a valid argument.  I have not heard it argued in relation to any other job in any agency or State board that career prospects would be stunted by such a position.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that supervision by the board would be just as effective.  I agree it would be just as effective in terms of getting the job done but not in creating public confidence which was my basic argument in looking for independent investigators.  The Minister has said that the Bill gives the board the right to investigate in exceptional circumstances. Again, one has to say that would be only in exceptional circumstances, that it would be the exception rather than the rule.  It would probably only happen where there was a fairly high public profile involved in a case, where there was public concern expressed in the media or in this House.  I am talking about the generality of complaints which the public might bring to the board, which they were anxious to have dealt with in a formal way and the outcome of which would be strengthened by having a team of independent investigators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are travelling ground we have already travelled.  Deputy De Rossa's comparison of his proposal with the position obtaining regarding the Ombudsman is not a relevant comparison. The kind of investigations carried <Col N="1020" /> out by the Ombudsman are completely different from the investigations we are talking about in the context of this Bill, some of which could concern cases in which a criminal prosecution might arise. That is very different from investigation of the operation of administrative machinery carried out by the Ombudsman. Quite frankly, I do not think the public would be very happy if they were to find we had a corps of investigators doing the kind of job in relation to the Garda Síochána that the Ombudsman does in carrying out his investigations.  I hasten to add that this is not in any way to indicate any disrespect or lack of appreciation of the work carried out by the Ombudsman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In relation to the independence and fairness of the procedure, I wish to point out again that the board will, I hope, be clearly seen to be both independent and fair-minded. Deputy De Rossa is aware of the proposal in relation to the size of the board and my amendment in that regard is to take account, in part, of some of the concerns expressed here on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither is it directly relevant to suggest that since these investigations will be carried out by the Garda, superintendents who will be carrying out the investigations might be better employed otherwise. Superintendents carry out such investigations at the moment.  It is part of their management job in the Garda Síochána.  It is important, as Deputy Woods pointed out, that the management structure in the force should be aware at all stages of the nature of the complaints against and about the Garda Síochána so that they can build in, where possible, appropriate remedies to the <Col N="1021" /> management structure and practices of the force.</P>
    <P>In relation to the team of investigators proposed by Deputy De Rossa, the effect of his three amendments would be that every complaint to the board would have to be investigated by the team of investigators. I do not know what would be the size of such a corps but I can only repeat what I said earlier, namely, that if it were possible to devote extra manpower and resources to this area I would put them into the Garda Síochána and not into investigators of the type suggested.  We have made the maximum allocation possible to the Garda in terms of manpower and that is where such additional resources, if available, would be best employed.</P>
    <P>I am not going into the fine argument about whether it would be a small force or a large one and whether the career prospects would be good or bad.  Quite apart from what I said about that earlier on and which was not contradictory, the point I have just made is a valid one.  If I had extra resources in terms of manpower I would put them into the Garda Síochána, partly because I think they are needed there and partly because the structure we are setting up in the board will gain the confidence of the public and the gardaí.</P>
    <P>Finally, in case there is any misunderstanding, I did not indicate &mdash; and if I did, which is not admitted, I did not mean to indicate &mdash; that the board would direct the chief executive in exceptional circumstances to carry out an investigation.  I said that the board are given power under section 6(5) to have a complaint investigated by the chief executive where the board believe the public interest demands it or where they are not satisfied that a complaint has been properly investigated by the gardaí.  It could be &mdash; and I hope it is &mdash; that those two categories cover exceptional circumstances but obviously they are not intended to cover only exceptional circumstances.</P>

My point is that the towel has been thrown in by the main Opposition Party and there is practically no possibility of the Minister accepting any recommendations.  It is almost certain he will not do so.  We discussed the independence of the board already.  The former Minister started out with an independent board but we end up with something much less than that.

      <P>You are getting my co-operation but I represent a point of view in this House &mdash; some people would say I represent a point of view from this side of the House &mdash; that is not put forward by anybody else.  I represent 100,000 people in my constituency but I speak for people all over the country.  If the Government want to use the guillotine or the jackboot to put legislation like this through the Dáil, then they have to answer to the people because this country is going down the drain as a result of these measures.  There is no need for this type of tactic.  The people can make up their minds at the next election as to <Col N="1024" /> whether anything I am saying is worth listening to.  I resent the cynical remarks made by the Minister in cutting across my contribution as if it meant nothing. This Government are playing the numbers game because they have a majority, but one would think they would be more cautious since their majority has been reduced in recent times.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I referred to the police complaints board in Toronto and drew attention to the fact that the people mistrusted the ability of a police officer to be objective in investigating complaints against his colleagues and, the other extreme, that some members of the police community would not like it if investigations were carried out entirely by civilian investigators.  I gave examples of what has happened in difficult countries and I think I argued very conclusively that nowhere in the western world are people happy with the police investigating themselves and that this always gives rise to mistrust and dissatisfaction. We have gone a long way backwards in rephrasing the Bill in such a way that the investigative officer is a member of the Garda Síochána, although there is some measure of reassurance in that someone not below the rank of superintendent will be carrying out the investigation.  There has been a great deal of dissatisfaction in this country for some time past about the way investigations are carried out and because it is the members of the force who are carrying out these investigations. Many people will not go to Garda stations to complain when they know that members of the force will be carrying out the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people in my constituency who made complaints but unfortunately for me they mentioned that they came to me for help.  Since then, to say the least, they have been victimised because of their association with me.  Many sarcastic remarks have been transmitted to me through these people because my name was mentioned.  Even though an officer not below the rank of superintendent will be carrying out the investigation, he will send a member of the Garda into an area in which the complaint was made.  It will <Col N="1025" /> be common knowledge among members of the force who is being investigated and who is instigating the investigation.  The same type of dissatisfaction which so many people in other countries feel today will be rife here.  I am not suggesting that members of the force will set out to do this, but that is a fact of life throughout the world not just in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;balance&rdquo; was used all through the criminal justice legislation as well as this Bill.  The former Minister said he looked forward to having at the end of the day a system of criminal law and pre-trial diligence in bringing offenders to justice, with respect for the personal rights of persons in custody and their dignity as human persons.  That is all we are asking for, but that is not the kind of satisfaction the Irish people will get, with the co-operation of the main Opposition party.  They will get unbalanced legislation and it will be extraordinarily difficult to overturn that.  It is hard enough to get something changed on Committee Stage. But there is no possibility of getting an Act which is already on the Statute Book changed in this House unless the system is changed, and that is not likely in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Investigation of complaints by the Garda themselves will not have the confidence of the public, not will it be fair to the Garda.  Investigations by fellow members of the force will be perceived by the general public as being more favourable to the member under investigation, but it could also result in being very unfair to the member if the person conducting the investigation is prejudiced against him.  It is not in anybody's interest that such a system should be used and it will not work to anybody's advantage.</P>
    <P>The main argument against this has been that it might not be possible to find people with sufficient investigative skills to undertake such a task &mdash; the Ombudsman was suggested as a possible answer &mdash; but we already have people who undertake very complex tasks and investigations, for example, people in the Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise.  If the arguments and reports which are available worldwide had been <Col N="1026" /> taken into account we would not have come up with this system of the investigative officer being a member of the Garda Síochána, nor would we have a representative of the Commissioner on the board. We would have a completely independent complaints tribunal, but we are not even prepared to try that for a while.  We have to go another road and, in the long run, the citizen will be the sufferer.</P>
    <P>When the sections of the Criminal Justice Act which have been withheld come into force the real possibility of injustice or abuse will arise.  People will have to depend on a complaints board for redress but we can see all kinds of flaws in this.  A person can be fobbed off or intimidated and members of the force in a particular station, as happens at present, will go into the district where the complainant lives and the members of the force serving in the nearest Garda station will investigate the complaint. With this system in force, it will be less likely that people will come forward with complaints, but I hope it never comes to that.</P>
    <P>We have gone a long way from independent investigation and I am very unhappy about that.  I disagree totally with this and I have been consistent in my objection to it from the very beginning.  It did not get through without notice because it was mentioned many times whenever the former Minister brought it up, and he tried to bring this package through in three different elements.  It was pointed out that he could eventually do what is being done now because he started off by talking about a totally independent complaints tribunal, and that is what the citizen in Ireland wants but apparently for many reasons is not going to get.  Those are the reasons that should be under the spotlight.  These are the things that must be changed if there is to be any hope for the ordinary Joe.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I see no real chance at all of changing this.  I do not really feel happy about having to get up and object to it for the umpteenth time.  It is a shame. It is very bad for democracy.  The way legislation can be brought in here and not scrutinised in any depth at all, the <Col N="1027" /> numbers, the majority of the party or parties in power can use that to push it through is verging on scandal.  It is a disgrace that many Members on this side of the House who say they are caring people who stand up for social justice, for the individual in society, for the disadvantaged, for people with the chips stacked against them are not in here speaking out.  Let me put on the record also that they were not in here when we spoke on the Criminal Justice Bill. For God's sake, one would think the Garda were under siege.  As far as I am concerned the Garda are being hoodwinked into standing with the establishment against their fellow citizens. That is not good for the Garda in the long run any more than it is good for the citizen.  It is good only for the same small group who benefit all the way down the years.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my worthless contribution on Second Stage that the report of the GLC in Britain identified four factors responsible for the lack of public confidence in the complaints system.  The first of these factors was that the police investigated themselves.  The second was that the police complaints board were too remote and failed to exercise their obviously limited powers adequately. Third, the DPP may be too cautious in recommending the prosecution of police officers.  Fourth, investigations are not conducted thoroughly enough and are not pursued as vigorously as they would be if the offence had been committed by a civilian.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise also the number of new instances that will arise as a result of new sections coming in where offences may attract five years in jail and the person can be detained for questioning.  In many cases the frailty of human nature could see a citizen ending up for four, six, eight or 12 hours in a police cell or a police station under investigation, maybe because he has annoyed the police officer who happened to stop him, or because he had a borrowed car and did not know the number on the plate and in order to get <Col N="1028" /> at him he was accused of stealing the car. He could be brought in for that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>Therefore, all of the patience and painstaking scrutiny that the few Members gave to the Criminal Justice Act when it was going through this House and this legislation, which was referred to at length several times, are thrown out the window, and with that Deputy Woods on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party has thrown in the towel because he knows as well as I do that it will go through anyhow come hell or high water.  If it has not been said often enough in the past, let me say again that this is only an exercise that we are going through in here.  We really have no say in changes which can be made for the good of legislation which would affect citizens.  If the Government and Minister of the day decide to use their majority to pass that through the House we are only rubber stamps and the Dáil is not effective as a parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not sure whether Deputy Skelly had finished.  I am sorry if he thinks there is not a huge level of agreement with his point of view.  I would like to make a couple of points because they are important in presenting the progress of this Bill to the public.  Let me begin by remarking that the fact that we are talking about 66 amendments on Committee Stage, 49 of them from me and a number from Deputy Woods, Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa, seems a reasonable indication that the Second Stage debate has had its effect on certain parts of the Bill.  I do not agree with Deputy Skelly's contention that a fully independent investigation system is a <i>sine qua non</i> of public acceptability of the system, because that is a separate point.  When this Bill was being prepared a number of contacts were made with police forces elsewhere on the question of independent investigation.  I refer to two groups.  One was in the United States where we had a look at the complaints procedures operating in Washington DC, New York, San Francisco, Cade County in Florida and a number of others. <Col N="1029" /> The other was in Toronto which Deputy Skelly mentioned.  In only one of the systems that were examined were investigations carried out by investigators independent of the police; that was in Washington DC.  The nature of the complaints which the complaints commission there could investigate was limited to four non-criminal categories of complaint. Therefore, neither the scope nor the type of procedure bore any comparison to what we are talking about here.</P>
      <P>The US Civil Rights Commission have expressed the view that the success of a complaints scheme depends not on the question of whether independent investigation is provided for but on the commitment of police management to make sure that the investigations are properly and fully carried out.  Let me make another reference to a system in another country not too far away, that is, the UK.  There, all investigation of complaints is carried out by the police and I am not aware of any widescale public disquiet with that.  In that jurisdiction there is no provision that corresponds to the provision in section 6 of this Bill for the complaints board to direct that an investigation be carried out in circumstances where they are not happy that the complaint is being investigated properly.</P>
      <P>The UK system is based on a series of principles set out in a report published in 1974 of a working group for England and Wales on the handling of complaints against the police &mdash; Cmnd. 5582 of March 1974.  Paragraph 14 on page 6 of the report makes a number of interesting points in relation to the investigation of complaints about the police.  It sets out the principles:</P>
      <P>(i)  The investigation of complaints in the first instance must remain in the hands of the police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a fundamental point since, if accepted, it rules out the possibility of investigations into complaints against the police being taken out of police hands altogether.  One prime consideration here is that any complaint from <Col N="1030" /> a member of the public may raise the possibility that the officer concerned has committed a criminal offence.  The more substantial complaints most often amount to allegations of crime (assault, theft, perjury, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, corruption). These are the very cases in which, although they are investigated by the police in the first instance, subsequent action is determined by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We take it as a matter of basic principle that the police must operate and be seen to operate within and under the law.  This in our view means that police officers alleged to have committed offences must be subject to the same procedures as other citizens &mdash; starting, in the normal course, with a police investigation.  Investigations of allegations of criminal conduct by police present the same difficulties and require the same qualities as the investigations of such allegations against any other member of the community.  The necessary skill and expertise is in practice only to be found in the police service, and is in practice equally required for many investigations into complaints against the police of other kinds.  Many complaints involve both non-criminal and criminal aspects, and investigation of an apparently non-criminal allegation may reveal the possibility of an offence.</P>
    <P>There is a lot more than that, but it set out the general principles and a number of considerations relating to the way in which investigations should be carried out which are central to the way our whole system of criminal justice and administration of the law work.  It makes the very simple point &mdash; one which we should bear in mind &mdash; that since we regard the matter as so important, we should ensure that investigations against the police which may lead to evidence of criminal activities should be carried out in the same way as for anyone else.</P>
    <P>That is what we provide for here and we also provide a power for the board to decide that particular attention should <Col N="1031" /> be given to certain investigations, as I pointed out earlier.  Therefore, far from it being the case that it is universally held that there can be no satisfactory system which is not completely independent, I am making the point that it is widely held that the kind of system we are putting forward in this Bill is not alone satisfactory but that considerations adduced and set out in this report require it to be done in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is still a major point in that the main purpose in setting up a board and attempting to create an independent procedure to deal with complaints was to ensure that the confidence of the public in investigations into misconduct or alleged misconduct by the Garda would be such that there would be no doubt that a person going to a Garda station to make a complaint would have it fully dealt with.  I wish again to make the point that the largest number of complaints I receive about existing procedure is that the Garda investigate themselves.  That is the main point which people make when they ask how to make a complaint.  They regard such a procedure as nonsensical.  Why should the Garda investigate complaints against <Col N="1032" /> themselves?  I am pressing this amendment because it is fundamental in ensuring that people have confidence in the processes of law and order.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not prepared to argue the case in relation to the large number of investigators which it is claimed is required.  He said that if he had the money he would appoint more gardaí instead of independent investigators.  I am sure he would, but that is not an argument against having independent investigators because it does not overcome the basic point that people need to see independence in relation to investigations. That is the nub of the problem.  I mentioned the number of investigators which the Ombudsman has simply as a yardstick by which we might judge the number of investigators who might be needed.</P>
      <P>In 1985 the Ombudsman dealt with 2,392 complaints and he had 16 investigators to help him.  I made the point that I was not arguing that the same type of investigation would not be needed regarding complaints against the Garda but it is reasonable to draw a conclusion that if 16 investigators can deal with 2,392 complaints in a year, eight investigators could deal with less than 400 complaints in the same period in relation to complaints against the Garda.  I asked the Minister to say, if he did not agree with those figures, how many investigators would be needed to deal with the existing level of complaints.  Then we would know the costs involved because, although the Minister said this morning that cost was not a major problem it is clear that it is in terms of appointing investigators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I qualify that by saying that clearly the Minister also feels he has gone far enough in amending this Bill.  The amendment which I am seeking is a fairly major departure from what is proposed in the Bill.  Perhaps there is an element of that as well.  The Minister feels he has gone far enough and is not prepared to go any further.  But I feel that, in the interests of assuring the public of the independence of the procedure, it would be well worth the cost of employing eight, ten or 12 <Col N="1033" /> investigators, or whatever figure the Minister can come up with.  I am sure it would not be a great problem for him to produce a reasonable figure.  I am sure he has to come up with figures of this nature at various times when deciding on the manning of services.  He certainly has enough experience in judging what will be required to come up with that kind of estimation.  I am pressing the amendment. It is an important one.  To ignore it and to argue it out of existence simply on the basis that other countries are largely satisfied with their investigation procedures is not dealing with the situation at home where traditionally there has been an unease with the procedure we have whereby the Garda investigate complaints against their colleagues.</P>

That is why I suggest people such as peace commissioners who perform other functions for the Minister, ministers of religion, or members of the medical profession, responsible people who would know persons in the community and would be known by them and accepted by the Minister's Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs or other Departments in that capacity, including also teachers or trade union officials.  This would meet some of the questions raised here about <Col N="1035" /> ensuring informality in the system, so that people can feel more readily that they are being represented and that their point of view has been carried forward.  I suggest the amendment for consideration and think it would be helpful to the practical application of the measures we are discussing here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point the Deputy is making, but must take the view that this amendment is not the way to do it, nor is it particularly appropriate.  The procedure set out for making a complaint is a very simple and straightforward one. Complaints can be made orally or in writing; we discussed earlier some aspects of this.  The complaint can be made direct to the board or at a Garda station.  There is nothing particularly difficult about the procedure.</P>
      <P>If a complainant is reluctant to make his complaint at a Garda station &mdash; and Deputies, including Deputies Woods and Skelly, have indicated that people sometimes are reluctant to do so &mdash; he can go either to the board's offices or write to the board.  If the complainant has difficulty in formulating a complaint or putting it on paper, there is absolutely nothing to stop him from getting assistance from any quarter from which he wishes to seek it, as long as he personally signs the complaint. It is important that the complainant, given the nature of the procedure that we are setting up, should sign the complaint. To allow any third party other than a solicitor &mdash; the reason for including solicitors is obvious &mdash; or the parent or guardian in the case of a person under 17, to convey complaints to the board would introduce an unnecessary complication and a further unnecessary risk of misunderstanding or mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While not denying the number of cases such as those we spoke about earlier where complaints are about matters that are not very important or which the complainant would prefer to have dealt with at local level, the making of a complaint is a serious enough procedure to expect the person making the complaint <Col N="1036" /> to make it directly himself.  For that reason I would not be disposed to accept this amendment because (a) it would run the risk of introducing unnecessary complications and (b) it would in a sense unnecessarily distance the complainant from the complaint that he or she wishes to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This borders on an area of reluctance.  Reluctance and the reasons for it would have to be examined.  One reason may be shyness.  Some people would find that to deal with a person in uniform is intimidating.  Other reasons are lack of education, articulateness and bad experiences.  In some cases where members of the force or any authority are not held in high regard there may be a reluctance on the part of people to come forward.  These should be more flexible.  In the past we used the magic word &ldquo;solicitor&rdquo;.  Many people realise that they are not as accessible or as easy to deal with as, for example, the medical profession.  At the same time they are very expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should consider the possibility of making a complaint by telephone.  I do not think that is covered in the section. Many of the complaints which most of us get are by telephone.  Telephone complaints are not taken on a whim.  They are usually an emergency.  Very often these are emergencies.  It may involve a meeting at a later stage but a telephone call would break the ice for some people. The obvious answer to that is that we would get anonymous calls or calls that are not serious.  That happens with the fire brigade and in other cases but I am sure it could be handled.  There is a definite case for allowing complaints to be made in this way.  In rural areas or disadvantaged areas where people would not have access to the offices of the complaints board they may not be confident enough to express themselves in writing. They may be reluctant to call in person to the local Garda station to register their complaints.  In such cases I cannot see any reason for not allowing people to make the initial complaint by telephone. It could be followed by an interview with <Col N="1037" /> an officer of the board to ensure that the person wanted to pursue the complaint. The amendment is asking for a degree of flexibility which might make the submission of complaints much easier.</P>
    <P>I would be very reluctant to make complaints under this new system.  I have held back from making complaints because of experiences in the past.  As a public representative I have been very reluctant to make complaints because I am tired of the backlash that comes from speaking out as I do and from complaints which I make.  With these new sections inserted, with the members of the Garda force being the investigating officers and with the Commissioner being represented on the board and with the lack of independence, as a member of Parliament and a qualified lawyer, I would be very reluctant to make complaints.  If that is the way I feel about it, I am sure there are tens of thousands who feel the same way.</P>
    <P>With <i>habeas corpus</i> in the legal system a person can throw a note out of the window of his cell or whisper to someone going by if he wants help.  Fortunately, that has not been removed from the law. As we have said in the past, the solicitor is available to a very small section of the community.  It is surprising the number of well heeled and well educated people who could not name a solicitor.  In the section there are only two ways of making complaints, either personally or through a solicitor.  If it is left to the person, a huge percentage will not make a complaint. On the other hand the argument is put forward that if the complaint is serious enough people will make the complaint. In order to have a really good system of social justice we need to have easy access to solicitors.  It should not be as it is at present where people have no confidence in the system.  This is another reason for them not to use the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by the Minister in relation to anyone being permitted to assist a person in preparing a submission.  They do not have to make the complaint on behalf of the person.  If a person comes to the board <Col N="1038" /> presumably the members or officers of the board would help him or her to put their case.  I appreciate that.  It is a pity that this should be confined to a solicitor, particularly in rural areas where a solicitor may not be readily available.  There must be other people in the community who are sufficiently responsible to help a person without setting about a process of just causing trouble in one way or another.  I appreciate that could be a difficulty in a case like this.  The more people we bring into it the more we could make it open to those who might want to abuse the system.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if we want to keep it as informal as possible, for instance, a peace commissioner appointed by the Minister who is causing trouble can be removed at any stage.  Therefore, he would seem to be a person who is relied on by our system generally which can be controlled if it is going out of order.  I would have thought a member of the medical profession or some of the responsible groups could be helpful in presenting a case, bearing in mind that a large number of cases will result in no particular action after the investigation.  In other words, much of it, in practice, as we would expect, will be an exercise in maintaining good relations with the public and in being able to assure people that there is a suitable system to deal with any of these queries when they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment for consideration. I leave it to the Minister to consider it further.  I appreciate what he has said about not wanting to introduce unnecessary complications into the system.  Out of that group there are at least one or two who could be added to the list without introducing unnecessary complications.  I also appreciate the point the Minister made about the fact that these people could help others by introducing them to the board or to the Garda station or by advising them on their rights in that respect.  Having done that they could help them in the preparation of their complaint so that they would only have to sign the complaint.  It would help many people if they could have assistance in those circumstances.  Some people are <Col N="1039" /> very much afraid to come forward and make their case.  Those are the very people who could probably be reassured subsequently by the process.  They will need to be reassured.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to bear the amendment in mind, or some modification of it, between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 43, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;who is mentally handicapped or a person who is&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment follows on directly from the last amendment.  After &ldquo;... considered by the Board shall himself or through his solicitor or, in the case of a person ...&rdquo;.  I am suggesting that the Minister adds in the following words &ldquo;who is mentally handicapped or a person who is&rdquo; under the age of seventeen years.  I am pretty sure the Minister would agree with me that this section should include both a person who is mentally handicapped and a person who is under the age of 17 and allow them to make their complaints through a parent or guardian as the section otherwise provides. In the proposals for regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice on the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations, in April 1986 which we discussed at the beginning of last week &mdash; we have discussed so many Bills on justice recently that we could get them confused &mdash; the Minister specifically provided on page 23, section 22:</P>
      <P>The provisions of these regulations relating to persons under the age of seventeen years shall apply, in addition to any other applicable provisions, in relation to a person in custody whom the member in charge suspects or knows to be mentally handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That arose from the deliberations and discussions we had earlier in relation to that area.  It would be consistent with <Col N="1040" /> the thinking which the House adopted in that area to include this amendment in section 4 or some technical version of the same wording.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Woods' concern.  I was going to point out, if he had not done so, that we had made that provision in the draft regulations for the treatment of persons in custody.  I have one difficulty with the text which Deputy Woods has proposed and that is that it equates mentally handicapped persons with persons under the age of 17.  I would put it forward, and I think Deputy Woods would agree with me, that the reference to a parent or guardian might not always be appropriate in those circumstances.  For example, we could be dealing with a mentally handicapped person who is middle-aged or elderly. Therefore, the reference to a parent or guardian in the text, as it would be if amended, might not always be appropriate.</P>
      <P>What I propose to do, therefore, and I think Deputy Woods will agree with this, is to hold this one over until Report Stage.  I am having an alternative amendment prepared which would meet the case Deputy Woods is making and which would also meet the case of mentally handicapped persons over the age of 17 or who are not in a position to be in the care of a parent or guardian.</P>

I accept that point.  I will withdraw my amendment for the present.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1042" />&ldquo;or is the parent or guardian of a person who is mentally handicapped or is under the age of seventeen years and who was directly affected by or witnessed the conduct alleged in the complaint&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This would mean that subsection (3) (a) would then read:</P>
    <P>On receipt by the Board of a complaint or of a notification under subsection (2) of this section, the chief executive shall consider whether the complaint is admissible and the complaint shall be admissible if the following conditions are satisfied&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the complainant was a member of the public,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the complainant was directly affected by or witnessed the conduct alleged in the complaint or is the parent or guardian of a person who is mentally handicapped or is under the age of seventeen years and who was directly affected by or witnessed the conduct alleged in the complaint.</P>
    <P>Essentially it is a similar point in that I was trying to include those two categories. This subsection specifies clearly those two categories.  This subsection specifies clearly those who should be included as admissible when it says: &ldquo;... the chief executive shall consider whether the complaint is admissible and the complaint shall be admissible if the following conditions are satisfied&rdquo;.  Therefore those conditions have to be satisfied.  Whereas the amendment to section 4 (1) related to the putting of the complaint, this subsection deals with the complaints which are admissible.  I am suggesting that mentally handicapped persons and those under 17 be included where it says: &ldquo;the complainant was directly affected by or witnessed conduct alleged in the complaint, or is the parent or guardian of a person who is mentally handicapped or is under the age of seventeen years and who was directly affected by or witnessed the conduct alleged in the complaint.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical amendment which appears to be based on the view that, in this context, a complainant means the person who actually makes the complaint, for example, the parent or guardian in the case of a complaint made by an under-seventeen year old.  That view is not supported by the definition of a complainant given in section 1 (1) which says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;complainant&rdquo; means a person who makes a complaint orally ... and, in the case of a complaint so made, ... by a person through his solicitor or his parent or guardian, includes where the context so requires, the solicitor of the person or the parent or guardian, as the case may be;</P>
      <P>It is clear from that definition that it is only where the context so requires it that a person who makes a complaint on behalf of an under 17 year old will be regarded as a complainant.  The context of section 4 (3) (a) (ii) does not require such a parent to be so regarded.  The explanation I have given is one that has been checked and supported by the parliamentary draftsman.  Therefore, given the definition of &ldquo;complainant&rdquo; set out earlier, the amendment proposed is not necessary.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4)  If at any stage of the investigation of a complaint the Board is of the opinion that the participation of the Commissioner as a member of the Board or Tribunal, as the case may be, would prejudice the fair hearing of such a complaint, the Commissioner shall not participate any further in the consideration or investigation of such complaint&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with complaints made to the board, the way the board conduct their business and handle such complaints.  The Commissioner could be the complainant or he could be called as a witness.  If he is involved in any case he should not be present at the hearing of the case.  If he was present the case could be found to be outside the bounds of natural justice.  There should be a provision in the Bill which would enable a request to be made to the Commissioner not to participate in the hearing of a case in those circumstances.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Commissioner could not be a complainant.  Such a case could not arise.  The Commissioner is the head of the force.  He is the chief disciplinary <Col N="1047" /> officer of the force.  He is the custodian of the good name of the force.  If it is suggested that the Commissioner could seek in any circumstances to prejudice the fair hearing of a complaint, then the wrong person would have been appointed as Commissioner.  I do not think that is what Deputy Woods suggests.</P>
      <P>I oppose the amendment.  I cannot think of any circumstances in which the kind of case Deputy Woods has in mind could realistically arise.  I cannot conceive of circumstances where the head of the force, who is the chief disciplinary officer of the force and the person who above all others has an obligation to ensure that the force does its job properly, could seek to prejudice the investigation of a complaint.</P>

      <P>If the Commissioner is called as a witness how could he, in natural justice, sit on the board which would consider the case?  The Commissioner would be involved with the Deputy Commissioner on a regular basis and, if he was called as a witness in a case involving the Deputy Commissioner, then natural justice would require that he would not sit on the board.  If that is so, then the board would need a procedure whereby it could handle such a case.</P>

      <P>There is provision elsewhere in the Bill for the Commissioner to be represented by another person and there is also provision to ensure that a given member of the board does not sit on the board and at the appeal.  We have provided safeguards to prevent the kind of situation Deputy Woods has in mind. As I have said, it is very difficult to conceive of the type of case in which the kind of difficulty Deputy Woods mentioned would arise but if there was such a case it would be up to the board to take whatever steps were necessary &mdash; it is difficult to conceive what those steps might be &mdash; to prevent anything being done which would be contrary to the idea of natural justice.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is <Col N="1048" /> to make provision for any circumstances that might occur in the future.  If such a case arose the board might need to have under its own rules the authority to request the Commissioner to absent himself from a particular hearing.  If the board so suggested and if the Commissioner thought it would not be advisable to absent himself, I appreciate that the provisions of natural justice could override that, but it would be preferable to anticipate such a situation and have a provision in the Bill which would ensure that in case of conflict there would be a procedure to be followed.  Cases would not have to go by default.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern although I find it hard to imagine circumstances in which it could become a reality.  There are two things which will run side by side.  We have the complaints procedure and in addition we have the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations. In some cases these will overlap. I find it inconceivable that the person appointed as the chief officer of the force and the chief disciplinary officer should not be involved in a case either where there is a complaint from a member of the public about a member of the force or where there is a case of a disciplinary inquiry within the force into some allegation of misconduct that falls under the discipline regulations rather than under the complaints procedure.  At the end of the day the Commissioner has responsibility to ensure that the force carry out their job in the way intended.  I do not see how it could be suggested since he is, and must be, acquainted with questions of discipline, that his presence would be prejudicial to the conduct of any such proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem arises because of his function as disciplinary officer and his relationship with the public at large in relation to the complaints procedure. As head of the force and as the person responsible for discipline within the force there are matters with which he would be directly involved.  That is a separate question.  These matters relate <Col N="1049" /> to complaints by the public about the conduct of an officer in the carrying out of his duties.  In certain instances the Commissioner may be a witness to or in some way a party to some of the actions complained of.  In those circumstances the board would be infringing natural justice if it could not deal with such an occurrence.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that we should leave such matters to the board and the Commissioner and if the Commissioner's presence on the board on such an occasion was unwarranted it would be up to the board, and the Commissioner, to identify that and make appropriate arrangements.  It may be necessary to call the Commissioner as a witness in relation to complaints against a senior officer.  In such circumstances, if my amendment is accepted, there will be a procedure in place to enable the board to handle the matter.</P>
      <P>I would prefer if the Commissioner was not on the board.  I agree that the Garda should carry out investigations and that the board should have the power in exceptional cases to make other arrangements for an investigation, but it is not desirable to have the Commissioner on the board.  The Minister is insisting on the Commissioner being a member of the board and that means he will be present for all cases.  What are the consequences of that?  Could it cause difficulties?  In my view problems will arise and we should have a provision in the Bill to deal with them.  Otherwise we are depending on the board and the Commissioner agreeing and taking the appropriate action in line with natural justice.</P>

      <P>I should like to reassure Deputy Woods on this point.  I am not going into the argument as to whether the Commissioner should be on the board because the Deputy is aware of my views on that matter.  The Commissioner could not be the complainant and that conflict cannot arise.  If there is a complaint about a very senior officer of the force it seems to me that only the Commissioner can advise the board from his particular perspective. The only other circumstance in <Col N="1050" /> which there could be any question, remote though it might be, of the difficulty to which Deputy Woods referred arising would be in a case where the Commissioner witnessed conduct about which a complaint was made but did not participate in it.  It is my view that as chief disciplinary officer of the board he should be more informed by witnessing such conduct although the likelihood of that happening is remote.  It would be up to the board, with the help of the Commissioner as a member of the board, to decide on the procedure to adopt and the weight to attach to the views or advice expressed during the course of the board's deliberations on the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible for a Commissioner to witness the activity complained of.  It is also possible for the Commissioner, in some circumstances, to be party to such conduct.  His instructions may be misinterpreted.  It is not hard to think of cases that may arise.  To what extent would senior officers sent to carry out an investigation or an interrogation be acting on the instructions of the Commissioner? If in the course of an inquiry it is revealed that there was a close relationship between the Commissioner and senior officers in regard to instructions the inquiry will have to find that the board is infringing natural justice.  The Minister may say that the board, and the Commissioner, should be aware of those circumstances and take the appropriate action without having any guidelines from the House &mdash; and I appreciate that they can do that &mdash; but a member of the board may say that because of the operation of natural justice it would be preferable if the Commissioner was not involved.  It must be remembered that we are not really dealing with internal discipline but with the external perception of complaints.  I appreciate that either the board or the Commissioner could come forward and say that the Commissioner should not be involved in the consideration of this case because of a possible danger of infringing natural justice.  The Commissioner could say that <Col N="1051" /> he would step out of the case, or the board could ask him to do so.</P>
      <P>If my amendment were included, the board, including the Commissioner, would be given guidelines and alerted to the dangers.  If the Minister is not disposed to consider the matter I will withdraw the amendment, but if the Minister considers this with his legal advisers he will find that this problem will have to be covered in some other way.</P>

      <P>This matter gives rise again to the lack of independence of the board. I can visualise situations &mdash; and I am sure there are others that we cannot visualise &mdash; in which the Commissioner's presence on the board will compromise the board: there can be imputations made because of his presence on the board.  Fellow members will have difficulties because of the Commissioner's presence, like the vacant Archbishop of Dublin's chair that was left when he did not attend early ecumenical meetings.  Many difficulties will be caused because the board will not be independent, any more than the investigations.  These doubts will always arise.  Here we have a doubt raised at a very early stage and it will not do any good for the force or the management of the force, as further sections will reveal. It will not do any good overall for our system of justice.  When there are doubts like this at an early stage doubts will be cast in the minds of the people.  The Commissioner should not be on the board, which should be totally independent. I hold that view right down the line.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 24 to 34, to delete subsection (5) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  It shall be the duty of the Commissioner and of any member (whether authorised under section 1 (2) of this Act or not), on becoming aware of a complaint, to take any lawful measures <Col N="1052" /> that appear to him to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining or preserving evidence of or relating to the conduct complained of and, in a case where the Commissioner proposes to take any such measures, he may postpone notification of the complaint to the member concerned under subsection (4) of this section until the measures have been taken.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In response to points made by Deputy Woods on Second Stage, I undertook to have this subsection redrafted to make its meaning clearer.  The object of the subsection is twofold.  It authorises the Commissioner or any other member of the force, on becoming aware of a complaint, to take any necessary measures to obtain or preserve evidence of the conduct complained of.  It also allows the Commissioner to postpone notifying the member concerned of the complaint until the measures have been taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods was concerned on Second Stage that the present text might not be adequate to ensure that these preventive measures could be set in motion immediately on receipt of a complaint by the board, the member receiving the complaint or the local superintendent.  I explained at the time that this was not the case but I accepted that the provision could be made clearer.  The new draft imposes a positive duty on the Commissioner or other member to take any such measures as are necessary and to take them on receipt of the complaint.</P>
    <P>It also meets a point made by the Garda associations that the existing text could be interpreted as giving the Commissioner and other members of the force a free hand in the kind of preventive measures they should take.  That is not so, but in deference to the associations' views the subsection now being substituted refers to lawful measures, to ensure there can be no doubt about the kind of measures that would be taken.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), after line 51, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  if he considers that the Complaint is not suitable for informal resolution, so inform the Board, and have the Complaint investigated under section 6 of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the informal resolution of complaints.  The subsection states:</P>
      <P>(a)  having made such inquiries (if any) as appear to him to be necessary, consider whether the complaint is suitable for informal resolution, and</P>
      <P>(b)  if he considers that the complaint in suitable for informal resolution, so inform the Board and undertake the resolution of the complaint in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>
      <P>My amendment proposes to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  if he considers that the complaint is not suitable for informal resolution, so inform the Board, and have the complaint investigated under section 6 of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure there will be a positive provision that the complaint will be pursued under section 6. The Minister may say that would be the natural thing for the Commissioner to do if he found a complaint was not suitable for informal resolution. I am suggesting it should be made explicit and clear, that having made inquiries as to whether a complaint was suitable for informal resolution, he then informs the <Col N="1054" /> board and undertakes resolution of the complaint in accordance with the provisions. Secondly, if he considers a complaint not suitable, to so inform the board and have the complaint investigated under section 6.  I wish to include a positive requirement that would allow a complaint to be pursued under section 6 if it is not suitable for informal resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that section 6 (1) (a) constitutes a positive requirement to have a complaint investigated. It states:</P>
      <P>The Commissioner shall appoint a member of the Garda Síochána (in this Act referred to as an investigating officer)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  not below the rank of superintendent, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  if he considers that the circumstances so warrant, of the rank of inspector,</P>
      <P>to investigate an admissible complaint (other than a complaint resolved under section 5 of this Act) and a person so appointed ...</P>
      <P>For any admissible complaint received by the board that is not investigated under section 5, by virtue of the provisions of section 6 (1) (a) it will be investigated. That appears to cover adequately the concern expressed by Deputy Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going further than that, it seems unnecessary to inform the board in a case of the kind the Deputy has in mind.  He seems to start with the viewpoint that, for the purposes of section 5 which deals with the informal resolution of complaints, it is necessary to say specifically what the Commissioner should do if he considers the complaint is not suitable for informal resolution, namely, to inform the board and have the complaint investigated under section 6.  I point out that section 5 (1) (b) requires the Commissioner to tell the board where he considers the complaint is suitable for informal resolution.  That has its own importance because the board have their <Col N="1055" /> own responsibilities in relation to informal resolution and they need to be informed if they are to discharge their responsibilities.  For example, the board have the power to request the Commissioner before, during or after the informal resolution of a complaint to have it formally investigated under section 6 where they think the complaint is or was not suitable for informal resolution. Therefore, even going through the procedure in section 5 is not a conclusive determination that the case is one suitable for informal resolution.  The board have the ability to change their mind.</P>
    <P>There is no particular reason for telling the board that a complaint is being formally investigated.  They could assume a complaint is being formally investigated unless they are told otherwise by the Commissioner.  As provided for in the Bill, the investigating officer is required to complete his investigation as soon as may be and to send the chief executive an interim report if he cannot complete the investigation within 30 days.  If the chief executive has not heard within 30 days of the matter being informally resolved, of course he can inquire about the case.  Taking all of that into consideration, and in particular the provision in section 6 (1) (a), it is clear that any complaint not informally resolved must be formally investigated.  Therefore, I suggest there is no need for this amendment to achieve the end required by Deputy Woods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister is quite happy that that is the situation, that section 5 provides specifically for what the Commissioner should do if he considers the complaint suitable for informal resolution.  It does not state specifically what he has to do if it is not suitable but, as the Minister pointed out, section 6 (1) (a) states that the Commissioner shall appoint a member of the Garda Síochána to investigate an admissible complaint.  We are assuming the complaint will be regarded as admissible and will be investigated under the provisions of the other section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> The purpose of my amendment is to make section 5 clearer and to leave no doubt about the specific obligations to inform the board if the Commissioner considers the complaint not suitable for informal resolution and to have it investigated under section 6.  The Minister is happy that this would happen in any event and I accept his assurance.  I appreciate that the matter is covered in an indirect way but it would be an advantage to set it out specifically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously there is need for an informal method to deal with minor complaints: otherwise the work of the board will be slowed down considerably by many trivial complaints.  I suggest that the informal resolution of complaints must be strictly supervised.  In that context I refer to a report of the Police Complaints Board in Britain in 1983 which stated:</P>
      <P>If not properly supervised, informal resolutions will attract the same fears that are sometimes expressed about complaints that are withdrawn under the present system, that is to say, that complainants are pressurised into accepting a solution which falls short of a proper response to the complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is difficult to draft legislation to deal with every eventuality and that we must have trust in most of our dealings. We are leaving a lot in the hands of the Commissioner and we are placing much trust in him.  Without referring to any particular person in the position of Commissioner &mdash; and I am not referring to the <Col N="1057" /> the present incumbent &mdash; the members of the force might fear that participation by the Commissioner or his representative might prejudice a fair hearing of the complaint.  Taking human nature into account, personal reasons could influence such a person.  I mentioned this earlier on section 5 when we were discussing fellow officers investigating complaints. The officer being investigated might not be too happy that a certain senior officer is investigating a complaint against him because they may have had a run in in the past.</P>
    <P>The answer to this problem may be a monitoring system.  If a complaint is not serious it can be treated informally and this will not take up a great deal of time. At any stage the board can intervene if they are not happy with the way an investigation is progressing, but on what basis can they intervene?  Must they depend on information from another source?  Can the complainant get in touch with the board if he or she is not happy with the way the investigation is being conducted?  I imagine the majority of complaints will be dealt with informally. The public will judge the force by the way complaints are handled and, therefore, it is necessary that such complaints are handled efficiently and courteously. There should be a monitoring system to ensure that informal complaints will be monitored.</P>
    <P>I note that all complaints will come back to the board who will look at the type of complaint, the time taken to investigate it, the numbers involved and so on.  It would be preferable if this could be written into this legislation so that no commissioner or any other officer would have <i>carte blanche</i> to operate his own system.  The drafters of this Bill appear to have gone into great detail to ensure that this part is fair.</P>

      <P>The section provides a number of safeguards.  Section 5 (1) (a) <Col N="1058" /> and 5 (1) (b) give the Commissioner certain powers to decide whether a complaint is suitable for informal resolution. Section 5 (3) provides that a complaint shall not be resolved informally on certain conditions if the complainant or the member concerned does not consent in writing to the resolution of the complaint under this section.  Section 5 (4) allows the board to prescribe procedures to be followed in the resolution of complaints under this section, that is, informally. Section 5 (5) gives the board the power to change their mind about whether an informal resolution procedure is appropriate.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that that allows the board, before, during or after the resolution of a complaint, to request the Commissioner in writing to have the complaint investigated under section 6, that is a formal investigation, and that section shall thereupon apply and have effect accordingly.  There is no room for argument there.  If the board come to that conclusion, that is what must be done.</P>

      <P>The restrictions already in the text appear to be sufficient to ensure that a complaint will not be informally resolved when it should be formally investigated.  The first safeguard is that a complaint may not be informally resolved if the conduct constitutes criminal offence and the member concerned has been, or is likely to be, charged with it. That should cover any case where the conduct causes death or serious injury and the complaint is that the conduct involved is assault.</P>
      <P>The second safeguard is that the complainant must consent in writing to have the complaint dealt with in this way.  In the circumstances mentioned, that is, where the conduct alleged in the complaint resulted in death or serious injury to a person, it would be most unlikely that a complainant would agree to an informal resolution if the injury was in any way intentional.</P>
      <P>The third safeguard in the text as it stands is that a copy of any informal resolution arrived at must be sent to the board who have the power, as I pointed out a moment ago during the slightly disorderly discussion I was having with Deputy Skelly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If they think the complaint is or was not suitable for informal resolution the board have the power to request the Commissioner to have the complaint formally investigated.  As I pointed out a few minutes ago, and it may be for the purposes of the record an <i>obiter dictum,</i> if the board take that view, as I read from section 5 (5), &ldquo;it shall, as soon as may be, request the Commissioner in writing to have the complaint investigated under section 6 of this Act and that section shall thereupon apply and have effect accordingly in relation to the complaint ...&rdquo;. <Col N="1061" /> Therefore, there is no further argument about it at that stage.  If death or serious injury were caused in serious circumstances not amounting to an offence by the member concerned and the complainant agreed to informal resolution, the board themselves could still insist on a formal investigation being carried out.</P>
      <P>I suppose there could be, nonetheless, cases where serious injury, for example a deep cut or laceration as referred to in Deputy Woods's amendment, could be caused by the conduct of a member but where it would be admitted on all sides that the conduct was not criminal in any sense but only carelessness.  We have all seen cases in our own lives of deep lacerations caused by carelessness.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to bring it out later on.  Such injuries could be caused by non-criminal actions.  I cannot really see why in such circumstances the case should not be capable of being dealt with informally if the complainant and the member involved agree that is the proper way to do it.</P>
      <P>In summary, three safeguards are built into the text of the Bill as it is to deal with the situations covered or envisaged in Deputy Woods's amendment.  Again, I do not think the amendment is required in order to bring about the results that he wants.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (6), lines 19 to 26, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>This amendment is to delete section 6 (6) (b) from the Bill.  I wish to have it removed because it shuts off possibilities of inquiry at a stage where I do not think that is necessarily correct.  I am sure the Minister will agree that strange things happen in courts.  This paragraph provides that where conduct alleged in a complaint has been investigated by a court in civil proceedings and a determination of the issues is made by the court &ldquo;no action or further action shall be taken by the Board under this Act in relation to the complaint&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complainant should be entitled to come back to the board and give certain reasons in certain cases why he believes the board should pursue the matter.  I cannot give an example from civil proceedings, but the Minister will be aware of criminal proceedings.  Take the Shercock case of Peter Matthews.  There were a number of criminal proceedings there. The man died but the situation had not been resolved and the complaint still existed.  I am sure the Minister can foresee cases where similar proceedings will be taken and, for one reason or another, maybe a technical reason, maybe a vital witness not turning up, maybe the justice will be in a bad mood, or Justice Windle may be in court, and the matter reaches a determination which still will not resolve the complaint.  If such circumstances arose the complainant should be entitled to put a case to the board as to why they should proceed or consider the case further.  They could turn it down.  If this paragraph is left in then no matter how good a case is put by the complainant <Col N="1063" /> they cannot act once the matter has come before a court in civil proceedings and has reached a determination.  There can be circumstances in which a complainant should be entitled to have further action taken by the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come in with an example.  I agree with this and I can think of many examples.  Suppose there are proceedings and serious charges or a number of charges are brought against the defendant and plea bargaining goes on.  The gardaí concerned agree to drop or not to proceed with certain charges provided the defendant admits to one of the charges.  In that instance the defendant may have no choice.  He may have Hobson's choice, either to go ahead with the case and be hammered and have the book thrown at him and it is he against, say, three Garda witnesses, or he can agree to plead to a lesser charge so that they get a case against him.  That is done frequently.</P>
      <P>The person concerned, the defendant, might have a legitimate complaint against the Garda.  For example, he may believe that he was blackguarded.  In that case he would be able to make his complaint in the normal way.  I can give a clearer example.  In a case in which I was involved I had to plead to a lesser charge of breaking a speed limit when I was happy that I had not broken the speed limit.  If I had not pleaded to that a whole list of charges including dangerous driving and all kinds of things would be brought up. Against my will, and despite the strong advice from my counsel, I did not intend to do that.  I was convicted on a lesser charge; but, nevertheless, I felt I was badly done by and would have liked to have made a complaint.  This amendment will enable me to make a complaint and, as it is an internal matter in the Garda force, I do not think it will unduly affect anybody &mdash; in other words, it would help the good name of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can think of many other examples where citizens were involved in arrests or in actions taken against them, and that should be left open.  The other important <Col N="1064" /> point is in regard to what is commonly called &ldquo;hit and miss justice&rdquo; which takes place daily in abundance in the District Court and even in higher courts.  However, it takes place mostly in the District Court with its huge volume of cases.  Even Solomon could not impart justice all the time, which is a good reason for the amendment being considered.</P>

      <P>I take the points made by Deputy Mac Giolla, when he introduced the amendment, and also those made by Deputy Skelly.  I can see the difficulty of the board being in conflict with civil proceedings in the courts.  However, as Deputy Mac Giolla pointed out, there might be a situation where as a result of a technicality, without taking natural justice into consideration, a very substantial complaint should be made to the board.  For instance, a garda in giving evidence might think that he was justified in making a complaint in regard to how the proceedings had gone as far as he was concerned; but I know of such cases where gardaí are convinced that their complaints were not listened to.  The board is being set up to ensure that justice is done in relation to the Garda as well as to those who complain.  We all know that many gardaí still have a grievance as a result of civil proceedings which they feel need further investigation.  Perhaps this could be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The contributions made by Deputies Mac Giolla, Skelly and Barnes should really be considered in the context of whether in the case of proceedings with which people are dissatisfied they should proceed to an appeal, especially in relation to the kind of case to which Deputy Barnes referred.  Deputy Skelly's case &mdash; and I do not like talking about particular cases &mdash; is not relevant because they were not civil proceedings.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (6) (b) reads:</P>
      <P>If the Board considers that the conduct alleged in a complaint has been investigated by a court in civil proceedings and a determination of the issues which are, in substance, the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> issues involved in the complaint has been made by the court in those proceedings, when finally determined, in favour of the member concerned, no action or further action shall be taken by the Board under this Act in relation to the complaint.</P>
    <P>We are talking about civil proceedings which involve the member against whom the complaint is being made and it is only in the case where a court has finally determined in favour of the member that the board would act in the way suggested here.</P>
    <P>We should be careful, especially as we are talking about civil proceedings where there is always the provision for appeal, about trying to second guess the courts and claiming that because we did not like the conclusions of the court they were based on a technicality or not properly considered.  It would not be proper to make disparaging remarks about the person on the Bench and, of course, I must abjure any such remarks in the interest of propriety.  As I said, it is not our job to second guess the courts, particularly when there is an appeal to another court.  Taking account of that, the argument might take on a slightly different hue.</P>
    <P>Before the provision which Deputy Mac Giolla proposes to delete could come into operation, two conditions have to be satisfied.  The first is that the board must be satisfied that the issues determined in the civil proceedings are in substance the same as those in the complaint. If it is not the same issue in substance, this does not apply.  The second condition is that the proceedings must have been determined in favour of the member concerned so that, if the proceedings are the same in substance and have been determined otherwise than in favour of the member, then this does not apply.  If the subject matter of the complaint is not the same subject matter as that of the proceedings, then equally this does not apply.  There are a number of circumstances to be borne in mind in regard to cases where the question could arise in the first place.  The civil proceedings <Col N="1066" /> could have been initiated by the complainant or by the member concerned. The matter would have been considered by a court which would have had the benefit of hearing all the evidence adduced by or on behalf of each of the parties concerned and the court would then have determined the issue.</P>
    <P>Where the issue involved in the civil proceedings is the same as that in the complaint, I am not persuaded that the board should pursue the complaint further where the matter has been determined in favour of the member concerned. I do not think it is the business of the House to second guess the courts, nor do I think that it should be a function of the board to do that either.  Of course, there is nothing to prevent the board from proceeding with an investigation where the issues involved in the civil proceedings are not the same as those involved in the complaint or obviously where a decision in civil proceedings is against the member concerned.  While I am not persuaded that there is a strong case for deleting the provision which Deputy Mac Giolla proposes to delete, having heard the arguments, perhaps there is a case to be made for further reflection on it.</P>
    <P>Before we conclude Committee Stage, I wish to point out that there are a number of matters to which I wish to return on Report Stage.  One is in relation to section 6 (6) (a) but, in the context of this discussion, I will reflect on section 6 (6) (b) which Deputy Mac Giolla proposed deleting.  If the House is agreeable I will come back to it on Report Stage and Deputy Mac Giolla will lose nothing by agreeing to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief point on that.  The Minister said it was in relation to civil cases.  But what are civil cases but a joust between lawyers.  The appeal through the courts system would not necessarily give satisfaction because, <Col N="1067" /> apart altogether from the cost consideration, which is usually the main factor, appeal may not be entered into.  Often these cases come to court as a result of an accusation, and even if one wins one still may not be in a position to go forward &mdash; about 95 per cent of personal accident cases are settled before they go to court. In most of these civil cases there is a lot of horse dealing, with many people being left with no choice but to go through the procedure and suffer the consequences. One cannot always get justice because a lot of it will depend even on such things as the ability of those representing them and on lots of other things.  Therefore, the Minister should consider that broadly, and as he is going to consider it on Report Stage, should accept that point as well.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (8) (b), line 4, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, after consultation with the Attorney General,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This refers to where the conduct alleged constitutes an offence.  Subsection 8 (b) provides:</P>
      <P>Subject to paragraph (d) of this subsection, where a matter is referred to the Commissioner under paragraph (a) of this subsection, if the Commissioner, having made such inquiries, (if any) as he considers necessary, agrees with the opinion of the investigating officer in regard to the information in question or any portion of it, he shall report the matter to the Minister and, if or in so far as the Minister agrees with that opinion and so directs, the relevant information shall not be included in any report of the investigating officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment is to insert after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; the words &ldquo;after consultation <Col N="1068" /> with the Attorney General&rdquo;.  It is a technical provision to ensure that the law officer would be the person to advise the Minister in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection at it stands allows a direction to be given that information relevant to an investigation should be omitted from the investigating officer's report to the complaints board. That direction would be given where the disclosure of information in the officer's report, information which would otherwise be appropriate for inclusion in the report, would be liable to affect the security of the State or to constitute a serious and unjustifiable infringement of the rights of some other person.  What the Government has in mind in including that subsection was a case where, for example, the name of an informer was relevant to a report and its inclusion could have damaging consequences in certain circumstances and for the security of the State.  Non-disclosure therefore would be permitted only in the most limited circumstances and before a direction could be given under this subsection three persons would have to agree that it was appropriate to do so.  They were the investigating officer, the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice.  They would all have to agree that disclosure would have the consequences that I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision itself is quite clear. Given the fact that it requires those three persons, the investigating officer, the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, there is already a very substantial safeguard.  It is difficult for me to say this but I am going to say it in the most noncontentious and respectful way I can. I do not see that it falls particularly within the ambit or the functions of the Attorney General who, as Deputy Woods has pointed out, is the chief law officer of the State, to advise on matters relating to security in this particular context.  So, frankly, I do not see the appropriateness of including a reference to the Attorney General.  If Deputy Woods' concern is to ensure that there is a sufficient weight of opinion to the effect that a direction of <Col N="1069" /> this kind should be given, then I would think that the combination of the investigating officer, the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, if I may say so with due respect to the other two gentlemen and due to modesty in my own and my successors' regard, the weight of those three opinions should be enough to satisfy the House that such a direction would not be given lightly.</P>

I draw his attention to the fact that the subsection requires that the Minister shall cause a copy of every report received by him under this section to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Obviously, the Minister cannot lay these before the House if he has not received them.  The practice for a long time has been for reports received by Ministers to be presented at the earliest practicable moment to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The provision here is the standard one in all the Statutes which require reports to be presented to the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the recent excessive increases in third-level student fees in Vocational Education Colleges in the order of 11 to 18 per cent as representing a total departure from the Government's stated policy, and in view of the importance attached <Col N="1081" /> to the technological courses offered in these colleges calls for a significant reduction in the rate of increase in these fees.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that our party, and in particular our Chief Whip, have put down this motion.  It is one of extreme importance coming up to the time when most VECs will be taking their decisions which have been outlined to them in a letter in early March from the Department of Education telling them the rate of increases for the colleges.  This letter is in the form of a directive.  It is dated 6 March 1986.  It is Circular Letter No. CF 1/86 regarding tuition fees.  It states:</P>
    <P>I am directed to draw the attention of your Committee to the level of the tuition fees charged in respect of courses of instruction under the provisions of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.</P>
    <P>It lists the various charges: certificate, £325; diploma, £350; degree, excluding architecture and engineering, £550; and architecture and engineering degrees, £700.  The following significant letter was sent on 25 March 1986 from the Department to each VEC with responsibility for third level colleges.  It states, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>I am also to say that the financial allocations now being authorised are on the basis that the instructions notified in Circular Letter</P>
    <P>&mdash; which is the earlier letter from which I quoted&mdash;</P>
    <P>regarding tuition fee increases have been fully implemented and that further revenues will accrue to the College in respect of fee increases from September 1986.</P>
    <P>I quote this so that the record of the House will show that each individual VEC does not have discretion in this matter.  They received circulars in early March and late March from the Department telling them the level of fees which should obtain.  This is also borne <Col N="1082" /> out by the relevant section of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  I know it comes as no surprise to the Minister that we have put down this motion.  We shared a platform in Athlone some time ago at a student union debate at which the matter was aired in a democratic fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that, I looked into the matter.  I received the data and discussed it with the Fianna Fáil Front Bench, with our Leader and with the deputy spokesman and others involved in education.  I also wish to put on record the statement of the Government in their document, <i>Building on Reality,</i> in which they said that higher education fees will increase somewhat faster than the rate of inflation.  Fees increased at the rate of 11 per cent to 18 per cent.  As announced by the Minister and other Government Ministers when admonishing people who were seeking wage increases, the rate of inflation was forecast at 3 per cent or perhaps even less.  If the rate of inflation is less for one group surely the same must apply to students in order to keep them in college and to educate them?  In some isolated cases the rate of increase has been as high as 30 per cent for some courses.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's amendment he mentions the low base on which the recently announced fee increases have been calculated. The low base had a certain valid purpose.  When the regional colleges and various Dublin Institutes of Technology colleges were set up they were to serve the needs of a region where young men and women from a particular socio-economic background could have access to third level education at a reasonable price and one that would be within their ambit or that of their parents.  In the intervening years the rate of increase of fees in third level VEC colleges has been astronomical regardless of the fact that many are funded at European Social Fund level.  That has a great bearing on our motion and on the Minister's amendment to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of students attending <Col N="1083" /> vocational education colleges are in receipt of ESF grants.  That is partly true.  The Minister did not say that ESF grants are not applicable in all disciplines.  Where they are applicable in most disciplines in a college they are only applicable for two year courses.  That means that if a person is in receipt of an ESF grant he can progress to certificate level.  The diploma, the third year, or the degree, the fourth year, have to be undertaken at the person's own expense if the person is not funded by the VEC.  The strictures for that are extremely tight as regards means test and honours requirements.</P>
    <P>People say that, if a person can afford to pay for his education, he should pay for it.  That is all very well, but we have lost sight along the way of the purpose for which Regional Technical Colleges were set up.  When I speak about RTCs I speak about all VEC third level colleges. When they came on stream in the late sixties and early seventies they were set up to serve the needs of a region.  They were to meet what would be the forecasted manpower needs for that region in a particular skill or technological area. They were to provide competency, job creation skills and job seeking skills in young people.  The upward mobility in all areas of life has had a cruel effect on education.  Some years ago if a person had a good inter certificate or a good group certificate he got an apprenticeship, went into a trade or went into commerce or some kind of business. After a few years a person needed a good leaving certificate.  Now a two year certification course at a regional technical college no longer suffices for entry into the technological area.  More and more one needs a diploma and a degree.  RTCs and all allied colleges have been to the forefront in the provision of these courses.  They saw where the need was. In many instances the most forward looking of them looked around to see what courses needed to be provided and what needed to be done.</P>
    <P>I am thankful to have had the experience of serving on the board of management for five years of the Athlone RTC, <Col N="1084" /> and for some of them as chairman.  The very forward looking viewpoints which were taken by the college enabled it to keep ahead of what was coming and to set up expertise in a particular field which allowed students from all over the country to seek entry to the plastics course and now to the management catering course, both of which offer degree level.  That has been very much to the good of the area and the students who are participating in these courses.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the college in Athlone because it is the one I am most intimate with.  From discussions on the matter which my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, who is chairman of Dublin VEC, I know they control a vast budget and a vast number of students and are constantly innovative and far-seeking in what they hope to do for their students, all of which has been very much within the terms of the provisions under which these colleges were set up.  My colleague will be dealing in full detail with the various rises from 1980 to 1986 and the various percentage increases, some of them absolutely horrendous, in those various colleges over the years.</P>
    <P>While the Minister talks about the low base, the low base was for a purpose.  It was to enable access to the colleges for those people who might heretofore not have had the chance of equal educational opportunity.  In a year in which Government Ministers confidently nightly and daily tell us on television and radio that there will be nil inflation, to put on the backs of young people, quite literally, prohibitive rises such as these will mean that they will be priced out of their knowledge. I make my point quite clearly aware of the ESF funding for two years but also very keenly aware that the certification courses in many instances will no longer suffice for that young man or woman going out into the job market.</P>
    <P>The advances in science, mathematics, physics, technology and in the new areas of commerce and business require daily more and more changes.  We might wish that it were not so.  We might wish that it had stayed simple and placid and that everybody could gain entry into a college. <Col N="1085" /> That is not the way it came about.  Now we are faced with a huge influx of young people who seek and have a right to seek access to these colleges for which their skills fit them.  Over 50 per cent of then will find having completed their course, if they are lucky to get on the ESF one, they cannot go ahead because they are not able to bear the funding of it.  I have said to the Minister on another occasion when we met on a deputation from our VEC that I felt the barrier of forbearance for these rises had been breached and no longer could the parents of young people continue to fund them.</P>
    <P>Despite all the advances in education there has not been a sufficient advance in the level of participation in third level by pupils from, for the want of a better word, disadvantaged areas.  Whilst it may be that Ballsbridge and Ballymun may be only five to six miles apart geographically, they are planets apart with regard to access to third level education.  I felt that, with the continued vibrancy and continued growth and vigour of the RTCs, we were in a real fashion beginning to dent that disparity and allow young people who might not otherwise have had a taste and a chance to get into third level colleges to do so.  Is that chance of equity no longer tenable?  I submit it is not if these fees are allowed to continue and at that rate.</P>
    <P>I would also like to question the whole matter of the ESF funding.  Again, I discussed this some weeks ago in Athlone during that debate.  It is a question which will have to be addressed by persons in authority.  Are young people entering upon short junior and middle technician courses which are ESF funded simply because the money is there for two years? Is the fact that that money is available just allowing them to enter upon them with no thought of a further career prospect at the end of the two years?  It is time for a very thorough survey and review to be carried out on the number of students who have to drop out after second year to find out the reason students finish at certification level when they could have gone on to diploma and degree <Col N="1086" /> courses.  I am sure that if a head by head survey in each college were done, and it would be a very useful one, one would find the reason why they had dropped out was lack of financial backing to enable them to continue on in their courses.</P>
    <P>All of us from time to time say that our greatest resource is our young people and our aim is to do our best for them.  All public representatives would genuinely feel that and would feel they should do it.  We are not giving expression to it. Whilst it might seem to some that it is simplistic to say: &ldquo;Reduce the fees&rdquo;, if I were in Government, I could not stand over increases in fees from 11 per cent to 18 per cent when the comparable increase in universities &mdash; indeed it was high too but that is not my case or my submission tonight &mdash; reluctantly agreed, to by the traditional universities, was 10 per cent. The VEC third level colleges offering courses which we are told, will be the cornerstone of our growth and of the economy in the years to come &mdash; we would all believe in that &mdash;seem to be punished in a harsh way by the increases, most of them nearly double what has applied to universities and what might be called the more traditional third level colleges in the university sector.</P>
    <P>The low base reason given in the Minister's amendment was for a purpose.  Is it that it has served its purpose, or is it that it is no longer valid?  I would hold that it has only started on its road of gaining access and it has only begun to make inroads into the inequality of access to education.  If VECs around the country implement this circular &mdash; and they have to implement it under the terms of the two letters they have received &mdash; they will be doing so very reluctantly.  That has nothing to do with the make-up of the individual VECs or the parent body of VECs.  It has to do with the genuine commitment of the people who serve on these VECs and who know full well that they will be depriving people of a chance of education.  They must implement this circular or they can be invoked under the 1930 Act.</P>
    <P>Most of the VECs have not implemented the circular.  In some areas they <Col N="1087" /> have sent it back to the Minister and asked him to review it.  In some cases the Minister has kindly agreed to meet with them and to review it and think about it. This has culminated in the putting down of this motion tonight.  I am aware that the Green Paper, Partners in Education, forecast that there would be legislation dealing with the role of RTCs and with the colleges of technology in Dublin.  The Minister is to make an announcement shortly regarding this.  I gather there may be a proposal to upgrade the role of the RTCs.  But the Minister will be putting the cart before the horse if endeavours to have the level of fees approach those of the universities without conferring on the RTCs many of the advantages, services, resources, research and development facilities at present afforded the universities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not got his priorities in order.  I might see some point in an increase in fees if the RTCs and the Dublin Institute of Technology had resources and services comparable to those of universities; but, even then, I would question somewhat the role of RTCs.  Where are they going?  For what where they established?  Have they fulfilled their role to date?  I would contend they have.  I would contend that they have turned out men and women well equipped, many of whom had to seek employment abroad, but at least they did so with their qualifications in their pockets.  Hopefully, when the conditions improve, they will return, giving back to their country something of what they received.  Now that approximately 15 years have elapsed since the establishment of most of the RTCs, the time is appropriate to take stock of their role and decide where they go in the future. It is not good enough to heap increase upon increase, in the hope that by so doing they will be forced into a role willy-nilly not at all to students' advantage, of becoming elitist when that was not their originally envisaged role.  They were established principally to serve a particular need, which they have done admirably. They have overcome enormous challenges.  They are very democratic and <Col N="1088" /> the enlarged boards have ensured additional expertise which may have been lacking in the smaller boards.  They represent business, democratic scholastic, academic interests, all of which are necessary, and they knit into the VEC system. Whether they should be separate is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that these fees were proposed under the previous Minister and Vote.  However, it is the present Minister who will have the job of implementing them in the course of the Estimates ensuing very shortly.  Prior to the introduction of the Education Estimates we are afforded an opportunity to do something for the young people involved in this type of third level education: give them a chance to continue with further courses so that they can emerge with their diplomas and degrees, look the world in the eye, without feeling they have been disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The motion, which is put very simply, has enormous validity.  There is no way any taint of profligacy can be hurled at our party, because it is simply untenable to stand over an increase in fees of 11 to 18 per cent.  I would again ask the Minister to review these rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The fees increases announced recently by the Minister for Education in the form of a direction to all CEO of vocational education committees &mdash; increases between 11 and 18 per cent in third level fees in vocational education colleges &mdash; constitute a savage and totally unjustified imposition on the families of those students attending these colleges.  The most seriously affected students will be those undergoing diploma and degree courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our spokesperson on education has pointed out in great detail the effects these increases will have on the families of the students concerned.  In replying I would hope the Minister would advance a valid reason why these increases cannot be linked with the consumer price index. For example, how can one justify increases of between 11 and 18 per cent when the Taoiseach informed us no later <Col N="1089" /> than last week that he hoped for an inflation rate of around 1 per cent by the end of this year?  I hope the Minister will reply to these questions.</P>
    <P>There is ample evidence to suggest that students are now dropping out of regional technical college courses once they have finished their certificate course because they cannot afford to undergo diploma and degree courses.  Having completed the certificate course, if a student has no real opportunity of gainful employment, he or she will continue to do a diploma or degree course.  Most third and fourth year diploma or degree students receive no grant, rendering it impossible for them to continue their studies at these colleges. Yet it is an accepted fact that degree and diploma courses are becoming increasingly necessary for employment, that the standard of education required for all types of employment has risen in recent years.  That is regrettable, but is an undeniable fact.  There are sufficient, well educated young people walking the streets without this Government imposing these increases which will be seen as obstacles in the way of young people continuing their studies.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of these fees, the Minister is well aware &mdash; coming from Athlone where there is a regional technical college &mdash; that the parents of students attending courses at any third level institute must meet subsistence, board and travel expenses.  For example, they must pay for travel to and from these centres and for equipment needed in the course of their studies.  A cost of £2,500 and upwards would not be uncommon to maintain a student at one of those colleges. The Government should not place obstacles in the way of those people doing their best to give their children an opportunity they may not have had themselves to further their education.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the regional technical colleges was heralded as a landmark in the history of Irish education, it being contended that at long last the Government recognised the need to make a system available to young people whereby they could receive a practical, third-level education at a reasonable <Col N="1090" /> cost.  It is that reasonable cost that is at the centre of this debate.  These colleges were located outside the traditional centres of education &mdash; Dublin, Cork and Galway &mdash; in an effort to regionalise third level education.  Experience has shown that these colleges have been a success. It would be unfortunate that any Government would impinge on that success.  The proof of their success has been illustrated in the number of students who availed of the opportunity afforded them locally at these colleges of education.  The sons and daughters of many families who would not otherwise have had an opportunity of furthering their expertise in a particular field are grateful for the role played by these colleges.  The opening of regional technical colleges in Letterkenny, Athlone, Dundalk and Carlow has brought practical, technical education to the provinces.  This most welcome move must not be interfered with lest the years of toil put into the establishment of these colleges be lost forever.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to seriously reconsider his directive to the CEOs.  The location of these colleges in the provinces was felt to constitute an integrated educational system under which young apprentices could be given block releases to undergo courses at these colleges.  Carpentry and fitter turners are two that spring to mind.  In most cases this has turned out to be a great success both from the employers' and the students' point of view.  It is only fair that young people should be afforded every opportunity to attain the highest possible standards in their particular field.  We have students attending full time day courses and part time students who attend night classes. Many citizens avail of this facility.</P>
    <P>Given the high cost of university education and the competition for a limited number of places, those from the lower income groups could avail of the technical and practical courses offered by the VECs.  The total number of students attending these colleges last year was over 17,000.  Most of these young people will be affected by the proposed increases.  When discussing this important matter we must not lose sight of one <Col N="1091" /> of the reasons students pursue these courses.  The reason is that standards have increased and a certain standard of education is required for even the most menial type of job.  Everyone is trying to better their standard of education.  As job prospects become more difficult, greater pressure is brought to bear on young people to attain higher qualifications.</P>
    <P>Lack of employment is the biggest single cancer affecting our society.  The Government have done precious little to alleviate this problem for young people. A short time ago we heard about Fine Gael's proposals to reverse the trend in unemployment.  The Government do not need to be reminded of the current position. Every public representative understands the heartbreak of young people seeking employment.  They all have excellent standards of education and <i>curricula vitae.</i> Yet they are unable to obtain gainful employment.  It is regrettable, but it is a fact.  This Government stand indicted on their record in this area.</P>
    <P>What are we educating young people for?  To emigrate?  Recent statistics show that the rate of emigration is on the increase.  This is effective in so far as it keeps down the numbers on the live register, but it is not doing anything for the morale of the people.  I have had experience of parents calling to my home and asking me to find some kind of work for their children who, they say, will emigrate if they do not obtain it.  It is well known that the unofficial emigration of young people to America is at an all time high.  This is not something of which any Government can be proud.</P>
    <P>A letter issued to the CEOs regarding running costs for the financial year ended 31 December 1986.  A condition of the financial allocation is that the provisions of the letter are to be fully implemented. The net effect of this is that the Minister is using a stick with which to beat the VECs into implementing these fee increases.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>I am also to state that the financial allocations now being authorised are on the basis that the instructions <Col N="1092" /> notified in circular letter CF1/86 regarding tuition fee increases have been fully implemented and that further revenues will accrue to the colleges in respect of fee increases from September 1986.</P>
    <P>This is an unfair imposition to place on CEOs.  If a VEC does not implement these increases the shortfall in receipts will not be met by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>All third level institutions are experiencing great difficulty in balancing their budgets at present.  Most VECs will have no option but to impose the fee increase proposed by the Minister.  Fee increases should be linked to the consumer price index.  In that way students, and more importantly their parents, would have some idea of the likely fees for the duration of a course.  To arbitrarily impose increases of the nature proposed by the Minister in his directive is scandalous and the Minister should withdraw the circular letter.</P>
    <P>In the amendment to our motion the Minister recognises the low base on which the increase is based.  Our spokesperson has dealt fairly with the reasons for that low base.  Since he recognised this low base, did it not occur to him to question the reason for it?  It is to allow as many young people as possible to avail of these courses.  If the Government are changing their policy on this the Minister should say so.  University is increasingly becoming the preserve of the rich.  Where are the young people who cannot afford university education to go to?  VECs were located in rural towns in order to encourage as many young rural people as possible to avail of courses there.  As a result of these courses many young people are now enjoying a better standard of living and have greater job prospects.</P>
    <P>Is this increase the thin end of the wedge?  Will we see another major increase next year?  I hope there will be a change of Government and thus a change of policy.  The Minister pointed out in his amendment that the majority of students attending VECs are in receipt of grants.  That may be so, but what about <Col N="1093" /> the unfortunate student who is not, or what about the person who fails part of his examination and has to repeat a year without grant assistance?  Are they to be cast to one side?  The Minister will turn the clock back ten years if he continues down the road on which he has started. If the increase in fees which he proposes is implemented, all progress towards social mobility will be halted.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Government are not alone in their thinking on the question of education funding. The Progressive Democrats, in outlining their policy recently, mentioned education cuts.  I would regret if this happened and if, once again, only the very wealthy will be able to afford a third level education. I should like to ask the Minister to seriously review the directive and to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the substantial improvements made by the Government in the number and level of grants available to third level students,</P>

      <P>(3)  the low base on which the recently announced fee increases have been calculated&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that in debates of this nature in this House, which are essentially political debates, it is the duty and traditional role of an Opposition to indulge in special pleading which by definition is special and narrow and designed to put only one side of an argument or a case and may not fully explore all the issues.  That is what we have had this evening.  It is my task in this debate to put the whole question of the fees payable for the next academic year in the third level colleges of <Col N="1094" /> the vocational education sector in perspective. I have to note the rather ambiguous format of the Opposition's motion.  The ambiguity, instead of being a matter for criticism by me, is something on which I would compliment the Opposition because they call for a significant reduction in the rate of increases in these fees.  That marks a certain maturing of the Opposition with regard to their approach to the financial and budgetary constraints of the system.  Some time ago a motion from the Opposition would have called for the total abolition and removal of the increases in the fees.  It is a mark of the growing up of the Opposition and I hope it will extend not merely to the Spokesmen but to the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Significantly the Opposition did not attempt to say what a &ldquo;significant reduction&rdquo; would be.  Deputy Nolan did not go as far as his colleagues on the question of financial rectitude and wanted the circular withdrawn.  He said that when there would be a change of Government &mdash; while he used the word &ldquo;when&rdquo; I would use the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash; there would be a change of policy.  It is noticeable that he did not indicate what that change in policy would bring with it. It is common case between both sides of the House that there should have been an increase and what we are arguing about is the level of that increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition have not given any indication of what they think the level of increase should be &mdash; that is their privilege, it goes with the position the Opposition find themselves in.  The Opposition do not have any responsibility, but the Government have the responsibility of providing educational services for pupils at all levels &mdash; primary, post primary and third level.  The Government also have an obligation to balance the competing <Col N="1095" /> claims of various sections of the community and all the economic, commercial and social interests, for their part of what is a limited amount of finance.  The Government have to make a decision to try to achieve what they consider the most equitable and reasonable solution having regard to the competing claims.</P>
    <P>In the national plan, which was referred to by Deputy O'Rourke, it was signalled that higher education fees would increase.  The words she quoted, &ldquo;somewhat faster than the rate of inflation,&rdquo; are correct.  Thankfully, inflation has fallen much faster and to a much greater extent than was anticipated.  That brings with it corresponding reductions in the other costs which may face students and the public.  While inflation has fallen, and the increases when linked specifically to inflation do not maintain the same ratio as anticipated, nevertheless one cannot ignore the beneficial effects of the fall in inflation on other expenses that will be incurred by the students concerned.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should go to the national plan and indicate the reasons for the decision to increase higher education fees.  The main reason was to ensure that there would be other funds available for other sectors of education.  One of the main areas where we wanted to divert funds was the primary sector.  We wanted to assist the disadvantaged areas of the primary sector.  Progress has been made in two important ways in that area.  The number of remedial teachers has been increased and the pupil/teacher ratio in disadvantaged inner city schools has been significantly improved.  We hope to continue with the extra assistance to those areas because it is of critical importance in dealing with another problem touched on by the Opposition &mdash; the question of access or entry into third level education from the more socially deprived economic groups.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that the question of fees is the main reason why people from the lower socio-economic groups do not participate in third level education.  This is a most complex question and it has been the subject of much sociological <Col N="1096" /> study.  There seems to be no doubt but that other factors, apart from the mere question of money, are very important. Social and attitudinal elements are important, as are the questions of individual ability and home environment.  It is clear that children from disadvantaged backgrounds at four years of age start school at a disadvantage compared with their peers even at that young age.  Unfortunately, that maintains itself right through primary and post primary education. That inhibits the desire, the wish or the capacity to proceed to third level education.  It we want to widen the catchment of people going to third level education we have to remove the educational disadvantages that are in the primary area and, to a lesser extent, in the post primary area in the more disadvantaged parts of our country.  Money has been diverted to provide a better pupil/teacher ratio, more remedial teachers and to give more attention to the disadvantaged areas.  It is only by dealing with the problem in that way that we will give the pupils self-confidence, change their attitudes and enable them to proceed to third level education. I do not think anybody could cavil at a Government decision designed to impose moderate fee increases on the third level sector so as to ease the general education budget and improve the lot of the seriously deprived in the seriously disadvantaged parts of the country.  That is the strategy that lies behind the Government's decision to approve these fee increases.</P>
    <P>It would be a mean person indeed who would object to that strategy or complain about it and want the fees reduced.  As I said, we must put all these things in perspective.  Though the Opposition were inclined to play down the point in the amendment that the fee increases have been calculated on a low base, that is a fact which cannot be gainsaid.  It must be remembered that those fees are way below those payable in the universities and the NIHEs.  There is no denying that they are considerably below those fees.</P>
    <P>That point is of importance when we consider equity and the hardship touched on by the Opposition &mdash; a fair point &mdash;<Col N="1097" /> but it is an equally fair reply to say that we must view these fees in the total perspective of third level education.  In a comparative perspective the vocational education colleges have a much more preferential regime <i>vis-á-vis</i> fees than the universities and the NIHEs.  The other side implied, though they did not specifically state it, that the increase in fees is inhibiting access to vocational colleges and that the availability of ESF grants for only two years will provoke drop-outs.  I do not think any Deputy will say that there is any lack of applicants to take up places in the colleges, so the argument about impeding or inhibiting access falls flat when faced by the hard fact, indeed the difficulty we have had as part of the burgeoning demand for places in third level education.  There is no question of access being impeded.</P>
    <P>It is hardly fair to students who decide not to finish their third level certificates to suggest that they are drop-outs.  It may well suit their particular employment desires and career opportunities to go. Some may go because they feel they do not want the financial burden of going further.  But to give the blanket reason that they all drop out because they would have to face the fees in the third year is hardly logical or true.</P>
    <P>The Opposition made the point that these fee increases are impeding the RTCs in their role of providing skilled people with technological qualifications to serve our new industries.  I cannot see the connection.  Once the colleges are full and are turning out students with degrees and diplomas each year in the numbers they are doing, they are fulfilling their role.  I know, and I am sure Deputies on the other side know from their contacts with industries in the catchment areas served by these colleges, that industrialists are very satisfied with the numbers of graduates and their quality.  I do not foresee that the proposed modest increases in fees will in any way inhibit the RTCs in fulfilling their role.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have been indulging in the special pleading which is one of the nicer things of being in Opposition, but they have to see this whole problem <Col N="1098" /> in perspective, the total volume of resources available and how they are to be allocated.  The mechanics of distributing the resources for the vocational education colleges is through the VECs, and Deputies opposite are conversant with the workings of those committees.  Circulars have issued to those committees indicating to them what the fees will be in the coming academic year and it is the duty of those committees to apply the fees and to provide financial schemes for the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In theory, the committees will be entitled, if they so decide, to cut expenditure on some other part of their activities and not pass on the full fees to the third level colleges.  That, of course, would put the committees in the very dilemma that I am faced with in distributing the moneys I have to allocate.  They obviously would not want to cut back on the vocational schools or the provision for adult education, or assistance for sport or the various other expenses that VECs meet.  They would have to order their priorities in the same way I have to do, and establish a basis of distribution so as to do equity as far as possible between the competing demands on a limited purse.</P>
    <P>There is no point in Deputies opposite saying that the committees are constrained legally and absolutely in how they allocate their budgets.  They have discretion within an overall limit.  I would again urge Deputies, in their special pleading, to put the matter in perspective so that all of us in this debate, listening to it or reading of it, would become aware of the full picture and not just look at this matter from a particularly narrow perspective, so narrow that at times it can be downright misleading, and damaging because it is misleading.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to realise that the total cost of running the third level colleges in the vocational sector &mdash; the nine regional technical colleges, the Limerick College of Art, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Cork City Schools of Art and Music &mdash; is estimated this year at £64 million, of which fees make up £8 million with a limited amount from non-fee sources. When they are taken into account, <Col N="1099" /> the balance to the taxpayer is £55 million. The amount received by the colleges from fees represents £1 in every £8 expended on the running of the colleges. Putting the matter in another way, the taxpayer must provide £7 out of every £8.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one cannot say that there is not a significant contribution by the taxpayers.  This is not Government money, it is taxpayers' money.  It is a very significant contribution by the taxpayers. If there was to be a significant reduction, unspecified by the Opposition, it would mean the fee reduction would have to be made up by the taxpayers in extra taxes, or some other sector would have to be deprived.</P>
    <P>As I said when I opened this is a question of the most equitable distribution of limited resources.  These extra fees have been put on in accordance with the policy set out in the national plan so as to provide more resources to help the disadvantaged part of our community, to increase the assistance available in the disadvantaged inner city areas, to increase remedial teachers, to improve the pupil-teacher ratio in those areas not now represented by students in third level education.  The main reason why they are not attending third level education is not financial but social, attitudinal and educational.  I make no apologies for these reasonable increases in thrid level vocational education fees to give me money to help those unfortunate people in the deprived parts of our cities.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, recognising&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the social and economic importance of a cost effective education system with equal opportunity of access at all levels;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  that this requires that those who can afford to pay towards the cost of their education do so, in order that the <Col N="1100" /> Government can positively discriminate in the distribution of resources in favour of those who cannot afford to pay;</P>
    <P>(c)  that it is simplistic and socially counter-productive to approach this problem by repeatedly raising third level fees without reference to ability to pay,</P>
    <P>calls for:</P>
    <P>(i)  A comprehensive review of the present system of grants and scholarships, which has clearly failed to facilitate equal access to third level education for those who cannot afford it;</P>
    <P>(ii)  A facility for payment of VEC third level fees in a number of payments.</P>
    <P>I proposed this amendment because this party found themselves having a choice of endorsing the approach outlined by the Minister in his amendment or supporting the approach outlined by Fianna Fáil in their motion.  As far as we are concerned it is not a real choice and thus we see the need to put forward our own amendment which clearly indicates our approach towards education and our general approach towards the whole system of State grants and subsidies.</P>
    <P>As a party we do not support the idea of paying grants and subsidies, of paying scarce State resources, universally across the board and not paying them in selective areas where they are most needed and this is particularly the case with regard to education.  The system of financing third level education, the grants system adopted some 16 years ago, has not succeeded in opening up access to third level education.</P>
    <P>Those of us who want to see an opportunity through our educational system of giving the disadvantaged and the deprived some opportunity of attaining social mobility and of having some opportunities in life, believe the only way it can be done is to have a proper system of education, by opening up access to education and by ploughing back limited State <Col N="1101" /> resources into the areas of greatest need. For that reason we believe those who can afford to pay a contribution towards their education should be asked to do so.  After all, it is individuals and not the State who benefit from higher education.  For that reason the failure of successive Governments to plough back resources on a selective basis into areas where they are needed, and the failure to give resources to individuals as opposed to ploughing them directly into institutions, meant that many individuals have not benefited from the enormous State resources we spend on education each year.</P>
    <P>It is unfair in a time of high taxation to ask all taxpayers to continue to subsidise third level education for the tiny few who benefit.  That is unacceptable at a time when we are trying to make the taxation system more realistic and when the burden cannot continue to remain so high on the PAYE sector.  If that is the approach this party adopt we must follow through with all the consequences.  It is not fair to say this party are in favour of cuts in education &mdash; Deputy Nolan made that point, but it is not true.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will listen to my speech.  He should stop his usual practice of interrupting.  If he wishes to do so he may speak afterwards. There is virtually no scope for a reduction in the amount of resources we spend on education but there is great scope for redirecting those resources, for being selective in how we apply them and for making sure that those in real need benefit as opposed to spreading the resources evenly across the board. Because of what we have been doing up to now there has been an appallingly low level of access to third level education, particularly in the case of those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The limited resources available, particularly in third-level colleges, are not being utilised to the greatest extent possible.  For example, we could have four terms in the school year, more weekend and evening courses and <Col N="1102" /> greater use of our educational resources in general.  That applies also at first and second level.  In many areas there are fine school buildings &mdash; I am well aware of this in my own constituency &mdash; but the excellent school facilities are not used for many months in the year.  Yet, in those communities people are crying out for such basic facilities.  As a country we have to re-examine our approach to such matters. We must make sure that resources are used to the maximum extent.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I hope that in the few minutes available to me I will not have interruptions from the opposite benches.  This is another attempt by the Opposition to try to convince the public that the Government are endeavouring to diminish the status of education, are trying to cut back on resources and to penalise the impoverished and poorer sections of the community.  That is rubbish.</P>
      <P>After first and second level education, third level education is the most important element in the training of our young people.  Expenditure by the State is very important but it is constrained to some extent by the amount of money taxpayers are prepared to pay.  The previous speaker hit the nail on the head.  We are contributing a considerable amount to education but sometimes I wonder if that money is being utilised to the full.  Are we getting the best value?  As the Minister pointed out, it was indicated in <i>Building on Reality</i> that there would be some attempt to claw back some of the investment in third level education.  The numbers availing of education at that level have increased dramatically in the past few years.  Now I understand there are 18,000 students in regional technical colleges and of that number about 13,000 are in receipt of grant assistance of some kind or other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Students in third level education are in a privileged position.  Many children do <Col N="1103" /> not even get as far as second level and those who do often have to leave after a short period.  The Minister is endeavouring to direct resources to help in that area and that is something I support totally. A few years ago any student with five passes in the leaving certificate could apply for and secure a place in a third level institution.</P>

Where we provide grant aid to students, at least they should be able to continue through third level education and secure a qualification at the end of their course.  The reality was that a considerable number of students were not able to qualify and it was essential to improve the quality at entrance level.  I supported the action of the Government at the time and I continue to support it.</P>
      <P>When this Government came to office they provided a considerable increase in the level of grant aid for third level students.  The maintenance grant was increased from £600 to £1,200 and inflation was between 20 per cent and 22 per cent.  It is now down to 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>Fees are different.  We could have a better level of administration in some of our third level institutions, but I am not getting involved in that area.  I heard Deputy Nolan condemn the Minister and the Department for issuing a circular asking the VECs to work within the resources made available to them. Most VECs endeavour to do that and <Col N="1104" /> they have achieved a certain measure of success.  I do not believe the increase in fees is savage, but we should make better use of the resources available.  At the end of the day the taxpayer is called on to pay the bill.

      <P>About 75 per cent of students in third level institutions are at present in receipt of grants, but a small percentage of students do not qualify for a grant and their parents may have to pennypinch to put their children through third level education.  I have advocated at county council level getting some form of assistance for families who are just outside the qualifying limit and who have one or two, or even three children at third level institutions.  The cost of third level education is sizeable.  The fee for university runs at about £1,200 a year but the fees in the various colleges of technology seldom exceed half that figure.</P>

Mar atá a fhios ag an Aire, ní féidir leis na coláistí gairm oideachais táillí na gcúrsaí a laghdú ach le cead an Aire.</P>
      <P>I want to nail something on the head in relation to our motion.  The Minister referred to the power and authority of the VECs <i>via-á-vis</i> the Department of Education.  During the course of his analysis of the different balances of power and devolution of authority, he used the word &ldquo;request&rdquo; summing up what the Department had approached the VECs around the country to do in relation to fees.</P>
      <P>I want to refer the Minister to a circular his Department issued on 25 March 1986 clarifying the earlier circular of 3 March on fees.  Paragraph 7 of the circular of 25 March stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> I am also to say that the financial allocations now being authorised are on the basis that the instructions, not requests, notified in circular letter CF 1/86 regarding tuition fee increases, have been fully implemented and that full revenue will accrue to the college in respect of fee increases from September 1986.</P>
    <P>If there is any confusion in any quarter &mdash;and it is not very prevalent among committees, who have examined very clearly and legally their authority in regard to fee increases&mdash;that paragraph nails that confusion.</P>
    <P>We have to get down to facts.  The Minister and the Government have taken a decision totally out of line with their policy document, <i>Building on Reality,</i> to impose a very significant increase in fees for courses in the vocational education colleges.  That is a fact which has to be faced.  The Minister commented on maturity on this side of the House, but his political ability to sidestep that area very subtly is an indication of the maturity that has come into that office in recent times.  I do not want to labour the point, but it is very important to establish that the power of the committee in relation to fees, just as in relation to courses, is subject at all times to the sanction of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I want briefly to cover a number of issues.  The Minister's amendment covered substantial improvements made by the Government and the number and level of grants available.  The Minister will have to accept that improvements were brought about in some instances because of a crying need for improvement. The message was coming across very bluntly by way of drop-outs from various courses.  Given the level of inflation at that time, it was very clear that assistance would have to be provided. The Minister's amendment also said that the vast majority of students attending vocational education colleges were in receipt of grants.  It is true that in a number of colleges throughout the country well in excess of 50 per cent of <Col N="1108" /> students are in receipt of grants, but it is not true in regard to Dublin, in that about 50 per cent of students in the Dublin Institute of Technology, comprising the six colleges, receive some form of grant aid but the remainder do not.  That needs to be appraised very clearly.  Take into account with that the fact that Dublin itself, which has been referred to in a number of reports in recent years regarding access to third level education, is noted as having the lowest rate <i>vis-à-vis</i> the entire country and the fact that 50 per cent of DIT students have no form of grant aid, and you have a very serious picture of Dublin.  I do not want to regionalise this in any way because this is a serious national issue for all of our students right across all of the regions, but that point should be highlighted.</P>
    <P>The low base, as Deputy O'Rourke referred to it correctly, is not an argument at all.  The low base had to do with the reason and the perception behind the function of this type of course in the RTCs and the DIT.  This type of course was to serve as an opportunity for third level education for many families around the country who simply had not access to the traditional third level institutions and to bring around the country in a balanced way a level of technical and, more recently, technological expertise that was badly needed and very fundamental to the development of the economy, industry and commerce.  Therefore, that argument does not stand up.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the amendment by the Progressive Democrats.  I am a little at odds as to what it means precisely.  I say to Deputy Harney that I listened very carefully to the elaboration on that amendment because I was hoping that its philosophy would be crystallised for me. I must say, in fairness to the Minister, that he gave a philosophy which we on this side of the House must concur with to a certain extent, although certainly we would not concur with lip service when substantial commitment is not up front. This amendment here is very baffling because it seems to deftly mix pious aspirations with buckets of ambiguity.  Really the net question for the PDP in relation <Col N="1109" /> to their commitment to third level education is whether they agree with an increase between 11 and 18 per cent in student fees in a sector who are badly disadvantaged.  That question has not been answered.  Perhaps the answer will be best reflected in that party's decision in the Division Lobbies shortly.</P>
    <P>As I said, I support the motion proposed by Deputy O'Rourke that Dáil Éireann condemns these recent excessive increases in third level student fees in VEC colleges in the order of 11 to 18 per cent as representing a total departure from the Government's stated policy, as expressed in their policy document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> and, in view of the importance attached to the technological courses offered in those colleges, calls for a review of the Department's circular letter CF. 1/86 to effect a significant reduction of the rate of increase in these fees.</P>
    <P>I refer to what the Minister had to say about appeals.  Yes, we come to the Dáil here.  It is the forum for an Opposition party to point out to the Minister and his Government where we feel his policies and decisions are going wrong.  We appeal to him out of a genuine concern that he should continue to make third level education accessible to the less well off sectors of our community.  The VEC colleges by tradition cater largely for the middle and lower categories of the socio-economic scale.  I do not think that the Minister will deny that.  I detected no denial of that in what he had to say this evening.  Over the past six years of this decade, particularly since the 1983-84 academic year, the financial burden being transferred directly to the students and their parents endangers the participation of many of these people in third level education.  That has been particularly acute from 1983.  Many students are deeply indebted to borrowing institutions and their indebtedness, in some cases at least, is forcing them out of education. In many cases the indebtedness accruing from what is fast becoming a prohibitive level of fees will prove to be a financial millstone around their necks when they take up employment.  Many of them will <Col N="1110" /> spend years repaying this debt and there is no doubt that they will query seriously their investment in a third level qualification. If that were to arise it would be very sad indeed, given the importance, the status and the international acceptability and recognition of many of these courses.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows well that VECs are statute bound to implement these increases or to suffer the shortfall.  I must say, in fairness, that he admitted to that subsequent to his earlier statement as to requests and options.  I say to him that we are not seeking here to devolve authority to the committees.  In this context we are pleading with him to set the fees at a realistic level where the rate of inflation applying to college fees will be comparable to the rate of inflation prevailing generally; in that context, referring to what Deputy O'Rourke said, to set the rate of increase in fees comparable with those that the Department have decided should prevail in other third level institutions. We cannot accept for a moment that there is any justifiable reason on socio-economic grounds for causing a disparity for a rate of increase in fees as between the VECs and the universities. Referring to bases in this context is irrelevant because we are talking about a different type of student, not necessarily any less qualified or less able, but in terms of his ability to enter third level education. We are talking about a different philosophy to a certain extent in relation to the functions for which RTCs were brought into being.  I know that the totality of the educational provision in all cases must aim at excellence and at meaningful education for life as well as for the place of work.</P>
    <P>Since the 1982-83 college year fees have increased by approximately 210 per cent.  If one takes the additional increase as per the circular letter mentioned this year it will amount to 240 per cent using 1982-83 as the base.  During the same period the rate of inflation within the economy generally has risen by about 22.3 per cent according to conservative estimates.  This indicates almost an 11-fold pace of increase for college fees and, as Deputy O'Rourke said, it contrasts <Col N="1111" /> very sharply with the aspiration of the Government's policy document <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987</i> which envisaged that &ldquo;Higher Education fees will increase somewhat faster than at present.&rdquo;  By any standards the Government are stretching the meaning of this phrase &ldquo;somewhat faster than inflation&rdquo; to incredible proportions. In particular fee increases in VEC colleges since that time have deviated markedly from the policy as laid down in that document <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987.</i> I must point out that when we are talking about college fees generally we are not speaking about money which comes from knitting.  In other words, a parent who pays a £700 fee, the applicable figure for the 1986-87 year for degrees in these colleges, might have to earn approximately £2,100 gross just to meet that fee.</P>
    <P>By international standards our third level fees are scandalously high.  Our <i>per capita</i> income is two-thirds of the EC average, yet our fee levels are at least twice the EC average.  Also by comparison with other training agencies we provide in a rather niggardly fashion for our third level institutions, particularly our VEC sector.  For instance, the average Exchequer subvention for a student in the DIT is approximately £2,600 a year, yet the average AnCO annualised training cost to the Exchequer is £6,900.  It <Col N="1112" /> seems quite ridiculous that a first year apprentice with AnCO gets twice the Exchequer support that a third level student in the DIT or an RTC gets.  The comparisons of costs between such students and students of the other training agencies such as ACOT and BIM shows again a marked discrimination against third level students.  In terms of the quality and acceptability internationally of the qualifications available from the DIT and the RTCs it is ridiculous that our investment is so miserly.  The VEC colleges concentrate on engineering and high technology with other types of courses but those are the premier ones. These surely are the areas where the employment prospects are greatest and where the biggest contribution can be made to the economy now and in the long term.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, given the very likely damaging effects of the proposed increases because of students dropping out, huge burdens in relation to loans and the anxiety and concern which will be caused to all students, to withdraw the circular letter with a view to reviewing it in terms of a more moderate increase in line with inflation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 3 to 5 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or given by a person through his solicitor or a parent, guardian or other person includes, where the context so requires, the solicitor of the person or a parent, guardian or other person, as the case may be&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are being moved to meet the point made by Deputy Woods on Committee Stage that we should make a specific provision to facilitate mentally handicapped people in using or having access to their rights of complaint.  I took his point on Committee Stage, but I made the point at that stage that the amendment he had proposed did not seem entirely to cover the issue.  The amendments I have put forward cover the issue in that they do not limit the assistance that a mentally handicapped or mentally ill person might get through a parent or guardian.  This is to meet cases where we are not dealing with young persons but with perhaps middle aged or elderly persons. The wording of the amendment is <Col N="1116" /> intended to ensure that they can have the assistance of another person.  So the three of them go together as a package.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the somewhat unusual procedure of having a break and the Minister putting together in the interval amendments which he considered might be appropriate.  I appreciate the pressure which the Minister was under for this period to get the amendments technically correct.  I also appreciate the fact that he has included this amendment in the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill before it leaves Dáil Éireann.  I was very anxious that the provisions relating to the under 17-year-olds would be extended to include the mentally handicapped as well.  The Minister has found a means of doing this.  Those who are involved with the mentally handicapped will greatly appreciate this. It also brings this provision into line with the measures we have taken jointly in the House with regard to safeguards.  The Minister's amendment No.1 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 3 to 5 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or given by a person through his solicitor or a parent, guardian or other person includes, where the context so requires, the solicitor of the person or a parent, guardian or other person, as the case may be;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is in the definition section to cover the fact that the Minister is making the second amendment in the later section, section 4 (1), which subsection will now read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the public who is directly affected by, or who witnesses, any conduct of a member and who wishes to have a complaint concerning that conduct considered by the Board shall himself or through his solicitor or, in the case of a person under the age of seventeen years, through his parent or guardian or, in the case of a person who is mentally handicapped or <Col N="1117" /> mentally ill, through his parent or guardian or some other person interested in his welfare...</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment meets the requirement very well.  It means that, first, a mentally handicapped person is included, which I asked the Minister to do on Committee Stage.  Secondly, it means that the Minister's suggestion on Committee Stage that not only should a parent or guardian be covered in that case, but also a suitable person or friend of the mentally handicapped person, which might be more appropriate when one speaks of someone who is in the older age group and is mentally ill or mentally handicapped.  I recognise that the amendment arose from the joint discussion across the House prompted, in the first instance, by the amendments which I put down in that regard and by the Minister's own views and advice on how this could be done.</P>
    <P>The third amendment is as follows:</P>
    <P>In Committee amendment No. 10, in the fifth to seventh lines, to delete &ldquo;his solicitor or, in the case of a person under the age of seventeen years, a parent or guardian&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;the person through whom he makes the complaint&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That subsection would now read as follows: &ldquo;A complainant who makes a complaint to a member under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be presumed, for the purpose of that paragraph, to wish to have his complaint considered by the Board unless at the time of the making of the complaint he himself, or the person through whom he makes the complaint...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That will cover the different circumstances which arise in relation to the mentally handicapped person and the under 17 year old.  The first and third amendments are consequent on making the change in the second amendment.  I thank the Minister for giving consideration to that aspect, for making the appropriate amendments in the time available and for putting them down on Report Stage.  I <Col N="1118" /> am happy that the mentally handicapped and mentally ill have been safeguarded in this way.  I willingly support the three amendments put down by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Before concluding, I should like to point out that there are two textual errors in the circulated text of amendment No.2.  At the end of the third line, it should read &ldquo;through a parent or guardian&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;through his parent or guardian&rdquo;.  This is to line up with an amendment that we made previously on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In the penultimate line after &ldquo;parent or guardian&rdquo; it should read: &ldquo;or some other person interested in his welfare&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 14, to delete &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from an amendment which Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa tabled to paragraph (b) of subsection (6) of section 6, I considered the provisions of the subsection as a whole. Deputy Mac Giolla suggested that it might meet the point that he was making if the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; were substituted for <Col N="1119" />&ldquo;shall&rdquo; in paragraph (b).  Having considered that matter since we adjourned before Private Members' Business, I must say that I am still not inclined to make the amendment suggested, for the reasons I outlined earlier this evening.  In the circumstances dealt with in paragraph (b), the subject matter of the complaints will already have been determined by a court as a result of civil proceedings.  As I said earlier, neither we here in the House nor, indeed, the board should engage in the exercise of second guessing the court.</P>
    <P>Some different considerations arise in the context of paragraph (a) of that subsection. There, proceedings will have been initiated but no hearing of the matter will have taken place.  In those circumstances, I believe that the board should have a discretion to undertake their duties under the Act, even in those cases where it would not be expected that the board would refer the matter to a tribunal in advance of a court hearing.  In short, having reconsidered the matter in relation to paragraph (b) of that subsection and to take an account of the discussion we had earlier, I do not feel disposed to make the amendment suggested earlier.  As I have said, I do not think that either the Legislature or the board should be put in the position of second guessing or looking behind the court's decisions. There must be a point where we have some finality.  That is a proper point at which to secure that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has rightly said, in relation to section 6 (6) (a) that where civil proceedings or criminal proceedings have been instituted and have not been finally determined and the board consider that in those proceedings it is likely that the court will determine an issue relevant to or concerning the conduct alleged in a complaint, the board as they stand at the moment shall postpone the taking of any action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is proposing to give the board discretion at that point.  He says the board may postpone the taking of any action or further action under this Act in relation to the complaint until the civil <Col N="1120" /> proceedings or criminal proceedings as the case may be have been finally determined. I recognise that that would allow the board to take an action they might regard as appropriate while leaving aside actions which they might consider to be inappropriate at that time.  This would, therefore, give the board a discretion. Consequently this is a satisfactory arrangement.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.5:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.  (1)  A person shall not disclose confidential information obtained by him while performing functions as a member of the Board, a tribunal or the Appeal Board, or as a member of the staff of the Board, unless he is duly authorised to do so.</P>
      <P>(2)  In this section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>`confidential' means that which is expressed to be confidential either as regards particular information or as regards information of a particular class or description;</P>
      <P>`duly authorised' means, in the case of a member of the Appeal Board, authorised by the Appeal Board and, in any other case, authorised by the Board.</P>
      <P>(3)  A person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £700 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new section before section 12.  It arises from an amendment on the same subject put down by Deputy Woods on Committee Stage which I undertook to consider before we came to Report Stage.  The amendment before us provides for restrictions on the disclosure of confidential information by members of the board or tribunal, or <Col N="1121" /> by members of the appeal board, or by members of the staff unless they are duly authorised to do so.  The text before us follows the pattern of section 37 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, which deals with the non-disclosure of information by members of An Post and consultants, advisers and members of the staff.  Working on the basis of that precedent I take the view that the amendment before us covers all the matters of concern raised by Deputy Woods' earlier amendment.  I would point out in particular that it would be possible with the authority of the complaints board, or the appeal board as the case may be, to disclose information required for the purposes of court proceedings. It also provides for penalties in line with the suggestion made earlier.  A penalty would be an essential part of a provision of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made my day because I have been arguing in favour of this measure for a long time.  It was included in the original draft Garda Síochána Complaints Commission which I put together some time ago.  I felt it was important to have it included in this section.  I appreciate what was said earlier about the Official Secrets Act having its own partial effect.  It is very valuable to do what the Minister is now doing.  This provides very clearly and positively in this Act a section which will state that in page 15 of the Act, between lines 41 and 42, we are inserting what in effect will be a new section 12.  It is in line with what I suggested earlier, that is, that a person shall not disclose confidential information obtained by him while performing functions as a member of the board, a tribunal or the appeal board, or as a member of the staff of the board unless he is duly authorised to do so.  In this section the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; means that which is expressed to be confidential either as regards particular information or as regards information of a particular class or description duly authorised in the case of a member of the appeal board, authorised by the appeal board and in any other case authorised by the board. <Col N="1122" /> Subsection (3) is the penalty section. It states that a person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £700 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both. Some people may feel that this is a little draconian.  As the Minister suggested it applies in other Acts.  It also applies in the disclosure section in relation to the office of the Ombudsman.  It is an important provision.  In the Ombudsman Act, 1980, section 9 deals with secrecy of information. It states that information, or a document, or thing obtained by the Ombudsman or his officers in the course of or for the purpose of preliminary examination or investigation under this Act shall not be disclosed except for specific purposes.</P>
      <P>It is valuable to have it stated quite clearly and explicitly in the Act so that it is there as a clear reminder to anyone involved.  This is very important not only for the members of the board but also for the confidence in the board generally and for the members of the Garda Síochána who might be dealing with the board.  It is very important that press leaks do not take place from a board such as this. These matters can be quite sensitive and very confidential and should be dealt with in that way.  This is a protection for the members of the Garda Síochána and for the public who are involved in any way with the board.  I hope the business can be conducted in a dignified and confidential way with information being disclosed only for very genuine authorised purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too often we find from the experience of bodies and boards that matters are leaked out mischievously by somebody along the line.  It is a very disappointing occurence and can be very damaging to the individuals involved.  As a nation we should learn to deal with these matters with genuine integrity, honesty and dignity. If we could, there would be much more confidence in the organs of the State.  It is very valuable to have it clearly and explicitly stated in the Act.  Having sought for some time to protect those <Col N="1123" /> members of the force who are in any way involved with the activities of the board and also those members of the public who are involved, I am very pleased that the Minister has decided to put down an amendment on Report Stage.  We have great pleasure in supporting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalties proposed are the same as those which apply in the case of the failure of a witness to appear before a tribunal or appeal board.  The maximum monetary penalty provided for under the Official Secrets Act, 1963, was set at £100 which would be the equivalent in today's money of somewhere over £700.  The other sanction provided for in the Official Secrets Act was imprisonment for six months, which is repeated here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 24, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  the membership of the Appeal Board shall not include any person who is or has been a member of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides that the membership of the appeal board shall not include either serving members or ex-members of the Garda Síochána.  This amendment brings the provisions in relation to the appeal board into line with those relating to the complaints board in respect of which on Committee Stage I moved a similar amendment.  Of course, the position of the Garda Commissioner or his nominee had to be protected in relation to the complaints board.  This amendment together with the one which I have just mentioned will substantially meet the concerns set out by Deputy Woods on his Committee Stage amendment No. 45. Part of that amendment stated that a member of any one of these boards should cease to hold office on reaching the age of 70.  It is matter of settled practice on the Government side <Col N="1124" /> that the Government do not appoint persons to semi-State boards who are over the age of 70.  I would prefer to remain with that practice rather than to enshrine it specifically in an amendment of this kind.  What it means, of course, is that serving members of these boards who reach the age of 70 during their period of office continue on until the end of that period of office but are not then reappointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that in this respect also the Minister has made my day.  It is crucial that the appeal board be entirely, absolutely and without reservation seen to be independent so that the members of the Garda Síochána can look to that board and say that it is going to be completely independent if it goes to an appeal situation.  The members of the public can do likewise.  This is perhaps the compromise in the overall arrangement.  I regard it as a very valuable development.  My amendment was for a serving member of the Garda Síochána and I would not have been so concerned about someone who would have been a member previously.  The Minister has taken that point and has raised it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have been concerned.  In any event, the main point is that the appeal board can be seen by those who will be involved to be clearly an independent board.  The appeal board will consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.  It will be appointed from time to time as occasion requires by the Government and, subject to the provisions of the Schedule, will hold office upon such terms and conditions as the Government may determine.  The appeal board is a very select, specialised small board.  In terms of its membership the chairman of the appeal board shall be a judge of the Circuit Court.  At least one <Col N="1125" /> of the ordinary members of the appeal board shall be a practising barrister or a practising solicitor of at least ten years' standing.</P>
      <P>If the chairman of the appeal board ceases during his term of office as such chairman to be a judge of the Circuit Court or if an ordinary member of the appeal board who is a practising barrister or a practising solicitor at the time of his appointment ceases during his term of office as such member to be a practising barrister or a practising solicitor, he shall there upon cease, in the case of such chairman, to be such chairman and to be a member of the appeal board and, in the case of such ordinary member, to be a member of the appeal board.  The position in relation to those is laid out quite clearly.  By ensuring that the appeal board will be clearly seen as a final court of appeal in any instance it will strengthen the body very considerably.  It will ensure that it commands wider respect and recognition in its independence in relation to the appeal system.  While, as the Minister knows, I from a purely public administration point of view believe that it probably would be desirable to have that board independent of the Commissioner, with the arrangements which are now being made there will be provision for representatives of the Garda associations as well as the Minister and the Commissioner. That in a way will keep a balance between management and the members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the appeal board is concerned, this amendment will make it quite clear that it is independent, with a judge at its head.  This will help to resolve any problems which might arise later on, because we get occasional cases where there may be much public concern about a particular issue.  Fair enough, we are only talking about the odd or rare issue; but as we all know in this House those issues do occur from time to time.  When they do we have to be able to point to some totally independent system which will deal with those kind of cases.  As I said earlier, the vast majority of cases can be dealt with by having a system which people can rely on.  But there will be occasional problems which will call for a <Col N="1126" /> very clear and total independence.  The appeal board will provide that kind of independence.  With the Minister very clearly making this arrangement and accepting part of my amendment, it will strengthen the appeal board in this Act.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that occasions will arise when the Minister of the day, the members of the Garda Síochána and Members of this House, will be very glad to be able to point to the appeal board as constituting a totally independent complaints system.  They will be able to say to people whom it may be difficult to satisfy, because of individual complaints, grievances or whatever: &ldquo;There it is.  It is totally independent of all involvement by the Garda, it has gone to that appeal board and that is that.&rdquo;  We in this House can point to that as an excellent system over which we stand completely, there being no question about its general operation with regard to independent appeals.</P>
    <P>I am very happy that the Minister has made that arrangement quite clearly by way of this amendment.  I can go home happy in the knowledge that some of the things he has done by way of amendments here this evening constitute a good day's work.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister says about the second part of this amendment&mdash;the age of 70 in general practice&mdash;that it would not be the intention to go much beyond 70.  I very much welcome the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as I read it, has gone a long way from what was originally intended, that is, constituting a totally independent complaints Bill.  It will not provide for an independent system of investigating complaints made against members of the Garda Síochána.  In neglecting to provide a fair and impartial complaints system, an adjudication of complaints, the Bill will fail to satisfy the Garda or the general public.  A certain amount of disquiet is felt by the public and by members of the force.  When the public realise that the Commissioner or his representative is on the board, certain fundamental questions will be posed now and in the future, such as, whose interests will the Commissioner represent. Without imputing anything to any particular commissioner&mdash;particularly the present incumbent of that office&mdash;I am talking about human nature and frailty, all of us being products of our environment, when it might appear to the public that the Commissioner might lean towards the members because he will be protecting his force.  I am not saying it would be his intention to take sides but, even if unconsciously he does so, it would be understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand I believe disquiet is felt by members of the force themselves. Many of them will not be happy with the Commissioner or his representative on the board.  One can envisage all sorts of circumstances arising in which members of different rank from top to bottom could be subjected to investigation. Again, human nature being what it is, members on the way up might suddenly find themselves on the way down.  It would be difficult to keep one's inside knowledge, prejudices or feelings separate from the job of investigation.  Probably one would be influenced by one's <Col N="1128" /> experiences.  Therefore I do not believe it will be a completely happy marriage having such representatives an the board. A certain amount of disquiet will be felt by members of the force from time to time&mdash;it being a very large organisation of almost 12,000&mdash;and there have been many examples in the recent history of the force of members being subjected to investigation.  They themselves will not like to be investigated by their peers or other officers.  That is one reason Deputy Woods' recent amendment of the disclosure penalities would be welcome; it might discourage gossip of stories.  But certain members of the force may not be happy being investigated by their peers or other members.  In my view that disquiet may give rise to a demand for an independent complaints tribunal.</P>
    <P>A lack of confidence on the part of the public or the Garda in the complaints system is sufficient to allow of a useless complaints procedure.  Indeed a lack of confidence on the part of both of those groups will be certain to make that complaints procedure unworkable.  I hope that will not happen.  My remarks are not intended to undermine the Minister's good intentions or those of the drafters of the Bill.  Rather are they made by way of critical comment in the interests of social justices for everybody.</P>
    <P>Were one searching for reasons why the Bill should not be passed the most important, in my view, is that its provisions will bring into law what I would regard as the remaining repressive provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. This will constitute an attempt to impose law and order from above which cannot be done in a democratic State.  Yet that is what we intend to do increasingly.  Such law and order must emanate from the grass roots of our society, be protected by the wise usage of authority, impartial, independent and incorrupt administration of justice.  That is the only way we shall achieve social justice for everybody. Failure to recognise those facts will mean that we will change from a democratic to a totalitarian State.  These constitute but small steps along the way but it should be remembered that many small steps <Col N="1129" /> end up in a sizeable journey, in my view, in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>Many important points were made by Members of the House, by members of the Garda Sióchána and by the Irish Council of Civil Liberties.  Unfortunately, the indecent haste with which, admittedly by agreement, the Second and Committee Stages were passed represents nothing more than a mockery of the legislative process.  That is why we have ended up with ill-considered and flawed legislation which will contribute to the monumental disrespect shown for the democratic process.</P>
    <P>I did not see anybody kicking down the doors in order to make a contribution.  It is very disappointing to come into the House expecting a Committee Stage debate and not be able to contribute because of the system which we have where numbers count so much on both sides.  One would have spent countless hours preparing for the different sections. I was mainly the victim of the Opposition today when they scuttled the debate.  The Government did not ask for the debate to end at 11 p.m.  It was to be open-ended but I heard on the monitor that it was to end at 11 p.m.</P>
    <P>No criticism can be levelled at the draftsmen because they worked very hard.  The Bill should not be passed as it stands because it will not do what it was originally intended to do.  It does not allow the board to initiate inquiries into methods of policing in particular areas. That will be of great concern to people in particular localities and trouble spots. It would only be available if there was an independent police authority which is the direction in which I would like to see us going.</P>
    <P>Another reason why the Bill should not pass as it stands is that, although a tribunal of the board is to adjudicate on complaints, its procedure is not balanced. The hearings will be in secret and that is something which always leads to suspicion and rumour.  Some of these points were made in the ICCL's submission. Another reason is that the process is not genuinely adversarial since the complainant is not allowed to examine the <Col N="1130" /> report or cross-examine witnesses or have legal aid.</P>
    <P>We are very good at drawing on foreign experience when it suits our argument but we do not seem to be capable of making our own decisions in relation to our experience.  I do not see why we cannot use the experience both of the public and the gardaí because it is in all our interests to get this right.  Foreign experience shows that in this type of hearing the complainant is placed in the same position as a rape victim and faced with irrelevant, humiliating and threatening questions.  A member of the Garda will be sent to carry out an investigation. From the moment they open their door they will be intimidated.  The Garda uniform intimidates many people.  I do not think that even if the garda was in plain clothes the position would be changed.  It is sad but that is how it works.  It is a them and us situation.  There seems to be a pulling of strings to protect a few.  I do not know what they are worried about. It says a lot for society that the majority are a threat to a small number.  That should not be.  It shows a lack of faith in the homogeneous Irish, our history and all we have gone through together that we still have to drag in draconian measures and look on our own people as the enemy who must be hounded in order to protect the few.</P>
    <P>I hope the gardaí wake up and see what is going on.  They should not allow themselves to be put on one side or the other.  It victimises members of the force as well as members of the public.</P>
    <P>My comments have been made in the interests of social justice.  I am not hitting out at the Garda force which is something I have been accused of because of my contributions in this House.  I have not prefaced my remarks by saying what a wonderful, glorious and incredible police force we have because I talk straight.  The Bill does not provide for a fair hearing for the complainant or the accused garda. It is best summed up in the words of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties who described it as a radically flawed half measure.</P>

      <P>In their report the Ó Briain Committee recommended safeguards for persons in custody and for members of the Garda Síochána.  They stated at page 18:</P>
      <P>The investigation of complaints by members of the public against the Garda Síochána should be brought into line with more enlightened practice in Western Europe.  A complaints tribunal with a strong independent element should be set up.  We do not feel called upon to spell out how its membership should be composed, although the desirability of having an expert penologist and an experienced criminal lawyer suggests itself.</P>
      <P>When the Ó Briain Committee recommended the setting up of a complaints tribunal I do not think they realised the complexities involved.  I did not think they realised the difficulties involved in establishing a tribunal which would be acceptable and workable.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  This morning I said that all Members had done their homework on this over a long period, like the gardaí.  All questions were debated openly and honestly and different points of view expressed.  I have always held the view that the board, and the Garda, would benefit if a member of the force was not on that board.  I still hold the view that that would be preferable but the Minister has to deal with all the practicalities and is in a position to judge the implications in relation to these arrangements. In my view we have reached a valuable and workable compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were debating amendment No.48 on Committee Stage I was put out of the House but I will not refer to the arguments I put forward on that occasion.  The contents of the Bill have been given careful consideration by all Members and we have analysed the Minister's amendments.  We could continue the debate for a long time but the Bill before us represents a reasonable approach.  The Garda, and the Minister, regard the provisions in the Bill as workable. Tonight the Minister went one step further and ensured that the appeal board <Col N="1132" /> will be totally independent.  That is a valuable aspect of the procedures and I am sure it will be relied on by people in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly has been critical of the Bill.  The Minister is anxious, now that the different aspects of the legislation have been considered, to get the Bill through the House.  We face a heavy schedule here between now and the summer recess.  I have been here up to 11 p.m. on many nights in recent weeks and it appears that I will have some late nights next week.  I will be involved in three Bills this week and I have to do a lot of homework in connection with them. It is important that before the summer recess the Garda should be able to operate under the powers we gave them in the Criminal Justice Act because they have a difficult task in dealing with the crime problem.</P>
    <P>From the outset I agreed that the Garda should carry out the investigations as long as there was a procedure which would allow the board to carry out an investigation independently if it was felt necessary in a specific case.  The Minister has acceded to our request in that regard. We can rely on the Garda to do a good job in regard to this but circumstances may arise when it may be necessary to have an independent investigation.  The board will have the power to appoint a chief executive to carry out the investigation if it is deemed necessary.  That is a reasonable provision to deal with exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>There was some confusion when the Minister introduced the Bill between the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations and the complaints procedure.  The confusion arose in regard to section 7 (9). When I read that section, and considered the arguments put forward by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, I was of the opinion that an element beyond what we had in mind was being introduced.  I felt we were being led into something we did not want to become involved in.  I always saw a difference between the internal disciplinary code for the Garda, which I considered to be a matter for the Commissioner and the <Col N="1133" /> gardaí and the need for a complaints procedure for the public.  I was concerned about the conduct of gardaí arising in the course of duty.  I was pleased the Minister took the trouble to enter into discussions and consider suggestions put forward by the Garda.  Many of the amendments we tabled today arose out of those discussions. It is clear that the Minister has listened to representations and is prepared to recognise difficulties.  In that sense the process has been worth while.</P>
    <P>We are happy with the amendments that were sought by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda Representative Body.  I am happy that their experience in this area has been recognised by the Minister today.  I am pleased that the old question of the informal resolution of complaints has been included in the Bill.  It was important to include that because, while people may highlight specific problems, we must recognise that many complaints can be sorted out informally.  We must treat many of these complaints informally.  It is no use making mountains out of molehills.</P>
    <P>One of the most important things is that the Garda will know we stand behind them, and though we have a duty to protect the public from the occasional garda who might be erring in his treatment of suspects, we have a duty to stand behind the Garda when they are doing their work properly.  Of course, sometimes when a garda goes to apprehend someone he, himself, comes in for tough treatment by a person who might break his teeth instead of walking quietly beside him to the Garda station.  It is all very well in the corridors of power in Leinster House to talk about the niceties, but so long as gardaí conduct themselves in the discharge of their duties it is our duty to stand behind them and give them all the support and resources available.  However, when they step outside the normal procedures laid down, it is in everybody's interest, particularly the Garda, to ensure that citizens will be dealt with fairly.</P>
    <P>The procedures laid down in this Bill will be very helpful to the Garda.  The <Col N="1134" /> two pieces of legislation, this Bill and the Criminal Justice Act, will provide safeguards for the public and protection for the Garda.  We are now at the Final Stage of this Bill and on its passage the Minister will have the mechanism to put both Acts into operation, together providing safeguards and powers for the Minister to ensure that complaints against the force will be investigated properly.</P>
    <P>We have a particularly fine body of young gardaí who have been recruited in recent years.  They will be looking for leadership and encouragement and it is important that the Minister will provide these, and he will have the Oireachtas behind him.  In this Bill the Minister included many of the suggestions, all of them constructive, which we put before him and we hope that this Bill, together with the Criminal Justice Act, will help the Garda to make major advancements in defeating crime.  We hope these pieces of legislation will strengthen the hands of the Garda in the fight against crime.  The security and general safety of our citizens are of utmost importance to both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister's officers on the way in which they have contributed to the process of passing this Bill through the House.  They have done great work in pulling together the strands of the various debates that occurred not only in the Oireachtas but outside this House.  These officers are very often forgotten, but we must remember that they keep a very good bureau, an excellent filing system which they are able to bring to our assistance quickly during the different Stages of a Bill.  Their work frequently goes unrecognised.</P>
    <P>We can see their work in the Ó Briain report of 1978 and those responsible for that report would be proud tonight to see this measure being passed in its comprehensive form.  We all hope the measure will work when put into practice.  I congratulate the Minister on the positive attitude he took in regard to the proposals put before him by all sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the last chapter <Col N="1135" /> of this very important Bill.  We had a worthwhile in-depth debate inside and outside the House and all of us have learned much from it.  I learned a tremendous amount about the different stages of drafting legislation and I join with Deputy Woods in acknowledging the work done by the Department's officers.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but with somewhat mixed feelings.  It is something we have worked for since 1978 or since the publication of the Ó Briain report started a discussion and a debate on the matter. With the operation of the complaints board and the safeguards we have introduced, the extra powers under the Criminal Justice Act will be implemented.  I hope that what we have done here will achieve the necessary balance and provide the safeguards we believe are necessary.</P>
      <P>This debate did not take place in a vacuum.  Many things were happening outside that caused the public to believe both increased powers and the complaints board were needed.  I repeat what Deputy Woods and Deputy Skelly said, namely, that we should have preferred if the complaints board were completely independent.  We were afraid the board might not be perceived as being impartial. That is something we will monitor as time passes and as complaints are processed. I hope the amendment by the Minister will ensure that the board will be completely impartial.</P>
      <P>I ask that there be the widest possible representation of expertise and experience in the membership of the complaints board.  That board will consist of a chairperson and six members.  I hope that both sexes will be represented on the board.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (6) of the First Schedule states:</P>
      <P>Where a casual vacancy occurs among the members of the Board, the Government shall, as soon as may be, take such steps as are necessary to fill the vacancy...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope such vacancies will be filled as a matter of urgency.  Above all else, we <Col N="1136" /> must ensure there is full access to the board and that full information with regard to such access is made known to the public.  It is essential that the board be seen as open to everyone and that information be distributed to all levels of society.  People must be made aware that the board are not elitist but that access is open to all and that it is a matter of right rather than privilege, for people to appeal to the board when they have a complaint.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly expressed some fears with regard to confidentiality.  I hope that we will have not only reports from the board but perhaps also have a monitoring system.  I take the point that in certain sensitive cases people may not appeal to the board if they are not certain with regard to confidentiality.  That is a human response and it must be taken into account.  The human perception of how the board will work will be a major factor. We must have an assurance they will work in an objective and impartial way and I suggest that some kind of observer cum researcher might be attached to the board to study their operations and procedures. Thus, in an impartial way that person could report to the public on the matter.</P>
    <P>Members of this House have concerns and fears that the board may not work in the way we would wish.  We should leave ourselves open to the prospect of making changes where they are needed.  I would like to believe that we are not closing the door to the matter but are leaving it open to make any necessary amendments in the light of the monitoring I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I hope the board will have the structures and facilities necessary to allow them to work in a practical, open and just way.  This will ensure that the gardaí are not seen in a &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; light.  I should like members of the Garda Síochána to realise that their rights are also being safeguarded as well as the rights of the public.  Thus, out of this long debate I hope will come a sense of community because if this debate showed anything it showed us that what we need is that sense and a sharing of responsibility.  We should not try to offload responsibility to the Garda Síochána and ask them to carry <Col N="1137" /> the burden of all the complexities and difficulties in society.  It is my hope that out of that shared responsibility will come the kind of society we spoke about so passionately in the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by thanking Members of the House for their work on this Bill.  As Deputy Skelly and Deputy Woods pointed out, the work did not start with the publication of this Bill but goes back even further than that.  I am sure my colleagues on this side of the house will allow me to express particular thanks to Deputy Woods for the way he approached the Bill.  I can assure the House that not only has the Bill got a combing but the Minister also got a combing which is sometimes as important.</P>
      <P>Seriously, the Bill has demanded much from the House and the House has given it.  For a long time Deputies on this side have put a good deal of research and thought into the provisions of this Bill and connected provisions in other Bills recently before the House.  The House has done an extremely good job.  In spite of what some members may think about the Bill, I conclude from the debate that the House has taken its responsibilities seriously and has carried out its duties with proper care for the implications of what it is doing.  I do not share some of the more gloomy views of the Bill which have been expressed, not because I am a natural born optimist or that others are natural born pessimists but because of the balance we have built into this Bill and the relationship that exists between this Bill and provisions&mdash;I was about to say other provisions&mdash;in the Criminal Justice Act.</P>
      <P>This Bill is at its Final Stage in this House but that is not the final stage of the Bill.  We have another process through which I will have the pleasure of going, but other Members will not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be tempted to <Col N="1138" /> wish that the Deputy could be with me because that would be churlish, but perhaps another day.  As I said, the Bill has passed through this House and it is my concern to have this Bill and the regulations for the treatment of persons in custody in place and in force during the summer of 1986 so that we can bring the complete package into operation because it is important that that be done.  I will direct my efforts to bringing about that result.</P>
      <P>In many ways this Bill breaks new ground.  It provides the framework and the instrument by which the general public, our neighbours and citizens, can make known any complaints they may have about the Garda Síochána and can see that those complaints are taken seriously, whether they are dealt with informally as provided in section 5 or formally as provided in section 6.  I know there are difficulties and that a great many people for one reason or another find a certain amount of difficulty in making contact with officialdom.  It is important that I put on the record that there are people who, even with the structure set out in this Bill, will find some difficulty in bringing themselves to the point where they will make a complaint. This is not something that is peculiar to dealing with the gardaí.  We all know there are people who have difficulty making contact with officialdom, whether it is applying for a medical card, making a complaint about a member of the Garda Síochána, complaining about an ESB bill or anything else.  We meet these people every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without wishing to be contentious, I would like to say that, like Deputy Skelly, I represent a constituency with a population of over 100,000 people but, unlike Deputy Skelly's constituency, it has a large rural element.  I might be forgiven if I say it often seems that my constituency is more a microcosm of Irish society than any other constituency because of the particular balance between urban and rural in Kildare and the fact that large parts of the county are becoming outlying suburbs of Dublin.  There are a great many people in my constituency who <Col N="1139" /> have difficulty in making contact with officialdom.  I do not say that because we are talking about a Garda complaints Bill but to put the matter in perspective.  Very often we find that people who have difficulty in nerving themselves to go to a Garda station or to write to the complaints board would have as much difficulty in applying for a medical card or complaining about their ESB bill.  That is not something the Garda Síochána will be able to cure or that a Garda complaints Bill on its own will be able to cure.  There is a wider dimension to this and I do not intend to venture into it now.</P>
    <P>There are other people who, because they are dealing with the Garda Síochána, may have difficulty in approaching officialdom in the form of the local superintendent or inspector to make a complaint. It is for that reason that we have left it open to any member of the public to get whatever assistance he or she may require and to ensure that the complaint when, and if it is made, is signed by the complainant.</P>
    <P>We had a discussion this afternoon about the kind of assistance we might expect people to have and what provision we should make in the Bill for it.  I was against specifying that people might get the assistance of a doctor, a teacher, a peace commissioner or any other other group Deputy Woods proposed, but I am not ruling out the possibility that people may wish to get assistance from that kind of quarter to help them make their complaint. The board will have the power to investigate complaints properly and fully. I am not alone in this House in saying that the structure we have set up will allow both the general public and the Garda Síochána to be confident that these complaints will be properly and fully investigated.</P>
    <P>I know from his remarks about matters which passed between Deputy Woods and myself while Deputy Skelly was not in the Chamber this morning, that Deputy Skelly uses the monitor.  I would ask him not to hold it against me that I too use the monitor&mdash;it is some time since I discovered the usefulness of <Col N="1140" /> the monitor.  He should not feel very aggrieved that I use the monitor as he does.  Deputy Skelly may have spent a lot of time here on Second Stage, but I spent a lot of time here on Committee Stage, and unfortunately, I seem to be making other Members spend more time on Fifth Stage than is normal, but there are some points that need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go over all the arguments again, except to say this about the system of investigation we have set up. This afternoon I spoke about the necessity&mdash;and I am not alone in taking this view&mdash;to ensure that complaints against the Garda are investigated and dealt with in the same way that complaints against any other member of our community are dealt with.  There would have to be very solid reasons for making an exception of the Garda, providing that complaints against them would be dealt with in a way that would not be used in relation to any other group in the community.  If we insist on the principle that there should be this great difference, then we run the danger of suggesting that we do not have any confidence not in the way Garda are investigated but in the way crime and wrongdoing are investigated.  I am sure that is not the intention of anybody in this House who disagreed with the proposals in this Bill in relation to the system of complaints, and I do not agree with the suggestion that the members of the Garda will be particularly upset at the prospect that complaints against them would be investigated by their colleagues in the force.  That is what happens now and I have not heard that there have been a great number of complaints from gardaí that complaints against them now and even disciplinary procedures taken in relation to them now are dealt with by other members of the force.  Therefore, let us not put up imagined obstacles by not looking at what happens now and projecting them into the future.</P>
    <P>It is suggested, or the impression still seems to be about, that complainants will not get a fair deal in the hearing of their complaints.  Deputy Skelly put this in a particular context when he said that the complainant would be put in the same <Col N="1141" /> position as a rape victim, that the intimidation would start with the appearance of a uniformed person on his doorstep.  I do not agree with that.  If a complainant is likely to have that kind of difficulty in dealing with a garda it is at least open to supposition that the same complainant would have the same kind of difficulty if we had this special independent corps of investigators who were being talked about earlier today.  Of course I realise that a great many people feel a certain reticence when the law appears on their doorstep, but ideally those who have a complaint to make about the Garda should do themselves the favour of following through the complaint they make, using the instrument that is at their disposal, and have at least the beginnings of the confidence required to say that here is a system which they as complainants are making work and are using, a system that was set up deliberately to give them the opportunity of making complaints through a means on which they could rely.</P>
    <P>As far as providing a fair hearing for the complainant is concerned, the Bill provides specifically for the notification and the presence of complainants at various stages in the complaint and for the communication to the complainant of what has been concluded.  No further development of that has been suggested during the debate.  No other means that could help the complainant further have been put forward during the debate. Indeed, what we have provided for in the Bill will give a real, concrete access to people who have a complaint to make through the system by which those complaints are being processed.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if sometimes I seem to ignore Deputy Skelly and sometimes I seem to concentrate on him.  That is the luck of the draw.  I make remarks about points made by other Deputies without identifying them, but since Deputy Skelly is up there at about eye level I take up the point that he made because it is important.  He said that the board cannot initiate inquiries into levels or methods of policing in particular areas.  Of course, he is perfectly right for the simple reason <Col N="1142" /> that it is not the function of the board to initiate inquiries into levels or methods of policing in particular areas.  The board are being set up to provide a mechanism by which complaints about or against the Garda can be processed satisfactorily. The board are not there to do any other job.  I hope that they will concentrate on doing the job that we set them up to do, and I am quite confident that they will. It is not relevant to criticise them for not doing something that they are not set up to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes in the general context and against the general background of this Bill and the other measures that we have been talking about, raised the question of monitoring the operations of the board and asked whether we have a means of ensuring that we know what is happening.  Of course we have, because it would be a responsibility of both the Minister for Justice and this House to monitor what goes on in the board.  The board are under an obligation to make reports to the Minister who in turn is under an obligation to bring the reports before the House so that the House will have from time to time occasion, if it wishes to take it, of discussing the operations of the board.  Members of the House also have all of the other expedients which they try anew every day on the Order of Business&mdash;sometimes successfully, sometimes not; sometimes in an orderly fashion, sometimes not&mdash;but we have all of these instruments at our disposal to bring out the concerns that Members of the House have about the operations of the board and how they are doing their job and of inquiring about just what is going on and whether we are getting the results from the procedure that it is expected to give.</P>
    <P>With that, again I thank the House for the combing it has given to this Bill.  It is probably an eloquent enough testimony of the close scrutiny that the Bill got that we had 66 amendments on Committee Stage.  Personally I regret it if any Member of the House felt that the Bill was dealt with with any alleged indecent haste.  My intention is not at all that things should be done with indecent haste. <Col N="1143" /> Neither is my habit to drag things on for longer than they need to be dragged on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The group I am concerned about who have suffered most from the Shannon not alone in the last 12 months but for 150 years are the farming community from one end of the Shannon to the other.  I am more familiar with the problem from Carrick-on-Shannon to Shannonbridge where many farming communities over the last 12 months, particularly since last August, have lost their incomes and cannot get from their homes to towns and schools without having to use a boat.  Others have had to make a detour of ten miles to get to work.  This has gone on in the Shannon Valley for far too long.</P>
      <P>In 1955 the Rydell report was commissioned and presented to the Government in 1956.  The report contained 11 recommendations and apart from one, which was implemented in 1956, the rehousing of families in the area, nothing has been done since in spite of promises before elections.  A River Shannon authority should be set up to bring all those bodies together to control and manage the Shannon in the years ahead because this is the only way to come to grips with the problem.</P>

    <P>The Shannon, one of the finest waterways in Europe, contributes substantially to the tourist and fishing industries.  It also contributes to power generation and in this connection I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, while the ESB have control of certain gates, the Office of Public Works control others. It is felt very strongly by the farming community, who have suffered so much over the years, that very often those two <Col N="1145" /> bodies do not synchronise in regard to opening and closing the gates.  Farmers believe, rightly, that at times unparalleled blunders were made which cost many of them their crops and indeed their livelihood.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are also involved in this matter.  Over the last number of years, the Shannon flooded much earlier and subsided much later.  Part of this is due to silting, not just of the navigational channel, but also of the sluice gates from peat washed into the Shannon from the Bord na Móna development.  The silt traps controlled by Bord na Móna are not properly managed, thereby causing massive pollution of the river.  Prior to those bogs being developed by Bord na Móna, they were a huge sponge which soaked up water and released it gradually. The bogs are now drained and the water rushes into the main channel which is not able to take it.  All these problems could be dealt with by an inter agency group or a River Shannon authority.  We must recognise the practical difficulties in securing a comprehensive drainage scheme for the Shannon catchment area at present.  However, I am convinced that significant flood relief can be provided within realistic expenditure limits.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister for meeting three deputations concerning this major problem and also for visiting the area to see the problem at first hand.  We can make progress without spending huge sums of money.  When this authority is set up it should carry out a complete survey of the Shannon to find out if we need additional lake storage, river diversions and channel improvements.  Even without doing that, many small improvement works can be carried out within reasonable expenditure limits.  Urgent action on silt clearance and channel maintenance work is required, particularly in the Banagher-Meelick section, with a view to improving the outflow of water in the area.  I am glad the Minister is committed to spending money on Meelick weir to carry out improvements there, including additional sluice gates, which are vital.  Maximum management of the lake storage capacity and control <Col N="1146" /> of water levels in conjuction with the ESB, with a view to minimising flooding, is essential.  The farming community in the area feel that more water could be released earlier on in the year if the ESB utilised Ardnacrusha to its maximum.</P>
    <P>The authority could also examine many other important aspects with a view to improvement.  It is vital to carry out a survey, which will be grant aided by the EC, as soon as possible.  I also ask the Minister to examine immediately the possibility of setting up a Shannon authority within the next few months.  This is very urgent as the livelihood of the farming community close to the Shannon is at stake.  It is frightening to see what has happened there over the last ten months and none of us wants to see a repetition of this.</P>

      <P>I am sorry but some Deputies will be frivolous.  I know the Minister is interested in the problem and I hope it will be solved.  Deputy Naughten <Col N="1147" /> listed the various agencies which would be involved in an umbrella organisation which would have responsibility for various aspects of the Shannon.  It really does not matter what it is called&mdash;a rose by any other name&mdash;but I am convinced that, while the setting up of an overall agency would perhaps seem to have minimal effects, they would be cumulative and eventually there would be an advantageous and beneficial spin off for the farmers in the area.</P>
      <P>We all want to talk about our own constituency and I wish to refer to the area south of the river Shannon.  In one small area alone 15 acres will, in a short while, be completely under water.  I believe the Minister has travelled by boat so she has seen that area.  The plight of the people in May/early June is as bad as it was last September, months earlier, when the Taoiseach visited the area.  The farmers in the constituency I represent are used to winter flooding and land that was no good.  But, for the last two years, there has been no use of callow land at all, and much of farmers land in this area is callow land.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works are responsible for navigation; the ESB have responsibility for maintaining levels for power supply.  But nobody has responsibility for the general maintenance of the Shannon from a civil engineering point of view.  Meelick weir, the river banks, the watercourse itself need to be constantly maintained under a general planned programme of work.  I am talking about housekeeping of a sort, about dredging, the lifting of silt, keeping the eyes of the weir open and maintaining the general area, thus ensuring that any impediment to the flow of water is removed. But the ESB and the Office of Public Works are operating under outdated regulations.  It was most amusing to look at some of the regulations under which they still operate and which are still the legislative framework for their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have no relevance to their work today.  There is no liaison between them or between them and the various local <Col N="1148" /> authorities of the counties through which the river flows.  Deputy Naughten spoke about Rydell.  Rydell visited Athlone and came to our home when we lived in Gentex on the banks of the Shannon all of those years ago and when he went to America and issued his report, draining the Shannon became the siren call for many a general election.  Everybody in this generation of politicians knows well that that cannot be done and none of us would make such a call today.  I maintain there is much that can be done with quite small budgetary expenditure.  I know that in an Adjournment debate one is not meant to talk about extra budgetary expenditure but I am talking about budgetary expenditure which could be contained within the overall Vote for the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I have among my friends many farmers, men and women who are bitterly facing another year of crisis.  I am not being alarmist.  This is fact, on the streets of Athlone and outside Athlone and in south Roscommon.  Farmers are really at desperation point because of what they face.  These are family people with children to bring up and educate and they are talking bitterly of having to get out of farming because there is no future in it and they cannot stay and face it year after year.  They were content to face the winter flooding, but not this.  The Minister has been there and has seen and has learned from it and I hope she can see it within her brief to set up this overall Shannon authority to start the farmers of this area on the road back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Athlone area down as far as Meelick weir people in my constituency are involved in this matter. The Minister recently saw the serious situation caused by flooding.  I want to highlight the major losses suffered by farmers from Doon down to Shannonbridge to Shannon Harbour and all of that area.  This has happened not just this year, not just last year; there has been a continuous loss by farmers over the years. There have been losses of hay, aftergrass, meadows, cattle and so on.  All have been affected by this.  In that area farmers have <Col N="1149" /> suffered a particularly low standard of living because of the flooding.  The Minister saw that at firsthand the other day.  I went to clarify one thing and, that is, the deputation the Minister met was representative of both sides of this House.  I just want to clarify that in case there is any misunderstanding.  It was meant to be an all-party meeting and that is the way it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to try to initiate major discussions between the ESB, Bord na Móna and the IFA.  I would like the Minister to discuss with the ESB the problems that arise when water is held back at the weirs.  Meelick weir is an example; the water is held back and there is a build up of water resulting in flooding of the lands.  The silting up of rivers and lakes is caused by silt coming from the bogs and if Bord na Móna were to provide more silt traps it would help to curtail this flooding, and the IFA have a major input into this.</P>
      <P>What we are speaking about here tonight is a Shannon authority.  It is a major issue.  This is a wonderful opportunity for the Office of Public Works because here we are speaking of the major waterway not in Ireland, not in Britain, but in Europe.  If this Shannon authority were set up and linked with the Erne system and the Ballyconnell canal there would be an opportunity to develop a waterway that would equal the Danube or the Rhine.  If all of this were done it could become a cross-Border project.  A Shannon authority would have the strength to carry out this work.  We are talking about a most wonderful cross-Border project.  Sizeable money would be involved and it would come from Europe. The Shannon authority is something about which the IFA and people on both sides of this House feel very strongly. With a proper approach it could be of enormous benefit not just to the people living in the area but to all of us in this country, North and South.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister now responsible for the Office of Public Works to use her good offices, after viewing the plight of the farmers in the south Roscommon area&mdash;which is my constituency and of greatest concern to me as a Deputy for that area for the past nine years&mdash;to initiate immediate work to alleviate the serious situation which is occurring at the moment.  The flooding in the south Roscommon area now is equal to winter flooding in a normal year.  All the callow has been destroyed.  There is a serious crisis for farmers.  I regret that, when the Minister was in my constituency, she did not feel it worth her while to contact Deputies of all parties.  I must say when I travelled as a Minister of State, I travelled as a Minister on behalf of the State and not as a Fianna Fáil Minister at that time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister to explain why £600,000 which was included in the 1982 Estimate under Fianna Fáil to carry out a feasibility study of the River Shannon was removed by the Coalition Government in 1983.  This money was supported by a £400,000 grant from the EC to carry out a major survey of the river.  Without an EC supported survey we have little hope or likelihood of receiving grant aid from the EC to carry out major works on the River Shannon. I support the setting up of a Shannon authority regulatory body to oversee the development of the river Shannon.  But that will be in the long term.  We must be realistic here tonight and acknowledge that the short-term problems are now <Col N="1151" /> causing a grave crisis.  I appeal to the Minister to carry out immediate works at the Meelick weir to reduce the flooding.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Agriculture to provide additional assistance this year to the hard-pressed farmers of south Roscommon and also of the area of the River Suck which flows into the River Shannon, where farmers are suffering enormous problems.  The flooding happening at this time of the year is the most serious in the history of the State.  It has never reached such proportions as in this month of June 1986.  I appeal to the Minister and her colleagues in Government to give emergency assistance to those farmers who are in crisis.  Many family farmers will be annihilated this year unless something is done by the Government to assist them.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to pursue the idea of establishing a Shannon authority to regulate the whole Shannon river, but in the meantime to get a viability study carried out and supply the £600,000 which Fianna Fáil had earmarked and which was stolen by the Coalition Government in 1983.</P>

      <P>I regret, a Cheann Comhairle, that such an important debate should be spoiled by rancour. I thank my colleagues for sharing the debate across the House and shall take it now in the spirit in which initially it was conducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, my interest in the Shannon is two-fold.  First, under the Shannon Navigation Acts, the <Col N="1152" /> Commissioners of Public Works are obliged to maintain the river as a public navigable waterway.  Second, under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, the commissioners are the authority responsible for arterial drainage.  I fully recognise that many other interests are also involved, such as the Electricity Supply Board, the Department of Agriculture, Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry, Bord na Móna, Environment and Finance, An Foras Forbartha, An Foras Talúntais and other bodies representing local and special interests.</P>
    <P>The problems associated with the Shannon Basin are of long standing with a history of reports and investigations over very many years.  These reports all highlight the complexity of the problem in technical, administrative and financial terms.  Indeed, these very real difficulties may explain the apparent reluctance to date to tackle the problem in a comprehensive manner.</P>
    <P>The August of 1956 Rydell report on flooding problems at the Shannon, commissioned by the then Government after an unusually large flood in December of 1954, proposed, <i>inter alia</i>, that consideration be given to the establishment of a Shannon Basin Inter-agency Committee, or Commission.  Indeed, as I experienced at firsthand for myself, last week, when at the specific invitation of Deputies Naughten and Enright I visited the Shannon and saw the appalling plight of the local farmers of that area, this issue has again arisen.  Indeed, it has arisen with my personal support.  The committee proposed by Rydell would be patterned after similar bodies which functioned successfully in the United States.  The committee, which would include representatives of a wide range of national and local Government authorities and other interests, would act as a medium for correlating various points of view, advising on procedures relating to an overall investigational programme and co-ordinating its effective execution.  It should be stressed that the Rydell proposal envisaged that the committe would exercise advisory rather than executive powers.  Actual execution of engineering, <Col N="1153" /> economic, agricultural and other studies would be retained as a function of each of the regularly constituted Departments or agencies.</P>
    <P>There is already a large degree of co-operation between those bodies with statutory functions in relation to the Shannon, such as the Electricity Supply Board and the Office of Public Works.  While at present no proposals for setting up a statutory authority exist, I do recognise personally the value of setting up an effective medium for giving expression to the views of all the different interests concerned.  I have publicly expressed my support for such a body.  My own view is that it is in everybody's interest, not least that of the Office of Public Works, to deal with one representative body that would be the forum for all discussions and the resolution, it is hoped, of problems as they arise, many of which have been mentioned here today such as silt rafts, flooding and all the other matters, including levels of the river at different points.</P>
    <P>There is however, another factor which must come into the reckoning.  Clearly the question of drainage would form a considerable, perhaps the largest element of any deliberations on the Shannon Basin.  As the House is aware, all planning of arterial drainage has been halted by Government decision pending the outcome of a comprehensive review of arterial drainage policy.  The Office of Public Works are not empowered to do piecemeal drainage except for navigation purposes.  I should like to make that point because a plea has been made to me from <Col N="1154" /> both sides that we should be involved in drainage and the removal of silt at different points.  That is not part of our terms of reference.  We are purely empowered to do such drainage and silt removal as is necessitated to keep the navigation channels open.</P>
    <P>A further Government decision was that the multipurpose feasibility study of the Shannon should be deferred.  This was referred to, including EC funding. The review is under consideration by the Minister for Finance at the moment, who I know appreciates the importance and indeed the urgency attaching to it.  However, unless and until the relevant decisions are made it will not be possible to draw up detailed proposals for drainage of the Shannon, nor to conduct a feasibility study, pending the outcome of that review.  The House will recognise that this would have a direct influence on the question of agreeing proposals among the wide range of interests involved but it is nevertheless the reality of the matter.  It is certainly a factor which must be taken into consideration in determining how best we should proceed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, my support for an inter-agency committee fully representative of all interests must not be allowed to raise expectations pending the outcome of the Cabinet consideration of the arterial drainage review.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 June 1986.</P>

      <P>Aghalane bridge is situated on the border between County Cavan and County Fermanagh.  The bridge was destroyed in an explosion in 1972 and a replacement bailey bridge erected in place of the original structure was destroyed in a bomb explosion a year later.</P>

      <P>In our contacts with the British authorities we have been seeking to reduce the practice of strip-searching to the absolute minimum consistent with the secure administration of the prisons.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy's question it is possible to name only Libya as a country whose Government is clearly implicated in supporing terrorism.  In their statement of the 14 April 1986 the Twelve called upon Libya to renounce their support for terrorism and to respect the rules of international law.  Formal representations along these lines were subsequently made to the Libyan Government on behalf of the Twelve by the representative of the Presidency in Tripoli on 24 April.</P>

      <P>Parts of the Lebanon are subject to continuing violence.  Irish citizens who have decided to remain in the Lebanon have been advised to take all prudent precautions to reduce their exposure to the risks involved in such a situation, for example by avoiding travel in areas most at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, following the worsening situation in West Beirut, in recent months, the Irish Embassy advised Irish citizens in April of the risks to which they were exposing themselves by staying in West Beirut.  The Embassy also advised them of an opportunity of leaving West Beirut, and helped those who wished to leave to do so.  I understand that about seven Irish citizens left West Beirut at <Col N="946" /> that time, and that only about five remain.</P>
    <P>An Irish citizen, Brian Keenan, disappeared on 11 April in West Beirut.  The Irish Embassy immediately went to the place where he was last seen.  They began at once a long series of contacts with local representatives and others who might be able to help.  In spite of all our continuous efforts and contacts and the assistance and support of a number of parties in the area, we have so far not been able to establish the whereabouts of Mr. Keenan.  We are continuing our efforts. I myself have been in contact with certain parties in the area, and my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Paddy O'Toole, availed of his visit to Irish troops in the Lebanon to make further contacts there in this case.</P>

While no joint programme involving areas North and South of the Border has yet been approved under the new regulation, the Deputy will recall that the Irish and British Governments have in recent years collaborated effectively on development projects for the Border regions, under the Regional Fund.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>All the information from the international organisations most directly involved in the fight against hunger in the world would indicate that the short term food situation is reasonably good following good harvests in many of the most vulnerable areas.  As regards emergency aid, the international donor community has successfully concentrated its resources this year on purchasing, transporting, and distributing both imported food aid and stocks purchased locally from surplus areas within recipient countries in those regions where famine continued to be threatened and on providing other forms of emergency relief.  As a result the immediate food needs of those threatened regions have been met.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that, while the immediate threat of famine appears to be over the real answer is to help Third World countries, where the threat of famine is prevalent, to develop and to provide for their own food needs. It is for this reason that our Bilateral Aid Programme is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, where problems of food insecurity are greatest.  In addition to the Bilateral Aid Programme the Government has allocated £300,000 to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a UN body, for an agricultural development programme in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland continues to provide milk powder (valued at £903,500 in 1986 and £834,844 in 1985) to the World Food Programme.  In addition 4,000 tonnes of wheat valued at £760,000 is provided annually under the Food Aid Convention and also channelled through the World Food Programme.  For emergency relief purposes in 1986, the Government has <Col N="948" /> allocated a total of £300,000 for transporting food and for non-food emergency relief in Sudan and Ethiopia including a joint operation with the EC.</P>
    <P>As members of the European Community we support its development and food aid policies including emergency food aid.  The EC provides more than 20 per cent of all food aid to developing countries.  In 1986 a sum equal to IR£464 million is allocated for this purpose.  The Community has established an emergency food aid reserve for 1986 equivalent to 386,700 tonnes of cereals.  A Commission proposal to provide a similar emergency food aid reserve in the 1987 budget has our support.  For longer term development purposes with special emphasis on agriculture and rural development, the Community under the Lome Convention, will provide the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) with over IR£6 billion in aid in the period up to 1990.  Provision is also made for non-ACP developing countries in Asia and Latin America.</P>
    <P>In addition to the EC's food aid and development aid, an interim programme known as the Rehabilitation and Revival Plan is being implemented in 1986.  Its aim is to help eight of the worst hit African countries to recover from the recent famine, to boost their food production, improve food transportation and distribution facilities and, most important, to develop early warning systems which will facilitate the prediction of future famines in these countries before they occur.  To date a total of IR£246 million has been allocated by the Commission and the member states to activities covered by the plan.  A further measure in the EC's campaign against famine is the European Plan of Action to Combat Desertification whose object is to maintain and increase the amount of cultivable land in Africa.</P>

    <P>An additional tonnage of 5.999 million tonnes was established between start-up and 31 December 1985 and other ore in the &ldquo;possible&rdquo; ore category at start-up was subsequently up-graded to the &ldquo;proven&rdquo; and &ldquo;probable&rdquo; categories.  An <i>in situ</i> ore value, derived by multiplying tonnage by price per tonne is not a valid ore valuation approach as it does not take account of ore mineability or of ore extraction and other costs.  In any event it would not now be possible to undertake such a task without an expenditure of staff time disproportionate to the utility of the results which might be achieved. If the Deputy would wish me to do so I can make available to him the consolidated accounts of Tara Exploration and Development Company limited which will provide him with details of the net <Col N="953" /> outcome of the mining operations conducted by Tara Mines Limited for each year to 31 December 1985.</P>
    <P>Tara Mines Limited has paid no dividend to shareholders to-date and has paid no royalty to the State for reasons which I enunciated in reply to a Question by Deputy MacGiolla on 5 February 1986. To date the company has paid £313,000 in corporation tax and £78,000 in dead rent to the State.</P>

And finally, in March of this year an informal working group, composed of representatives from community care services, paediatrics, child psychiatry, the Garda and other agencies working with this problem, was established by my Department to review the present arrangements for the assessment, management and treatment of child sexual abuse in the Eastern Health Board area.

      <P>There is no recognised school of chiropody in this country at present.  The Deputy will be aware, however, that the qualification granted by the School of Chiropody in Belfast is currently recognised for employment by the health boards for the provision of chiropody services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently examining policy relating to chiropody.  At present the main difficulty to be resolved is that of recognition of chiropodists for employment in the health services.  A survey <Col N="975" /> carried out by my Department indicated that there may be up to 100 experienced chiropodists in full time private practice who do not satisfy the training and experience criteria currently applied.  My Department is aiming to bring about a situation where these practitioners can be offered the opportunity for assessment for health service employment.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent allegations to which the Deputy refers.  It is, of course, an explicit breach of their contract for doctors to seek or accept payment from GMS patients.  The Mid-Western Health Board are currently investigating the allegations made on the radio programme, in so far as their area is concerned.  I would urge any person with knowledge of this practice to contact the appropriate health board who will then initiate disciplinary procedures.  I propose to have consultations with the health boards on the practice to which the Deputy refers and I will bear the Deputy's suggestion in mind.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is on temporary release from prison.  While on temporary release, he is regarded as being still in legal custody for the purpose of the Social Welfare Acts and is, accordingly, not entitled to payment of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  However, if his means are insufficient to meet his needs, it is open to him to claim supplementary welfare allowance from his local community welfare officer.  The wife of the person in question is, at present, in receipt of prisoners' wifes' allowance at the weekly rate of £79.10 in respect of herself and 3 dependent children.  This will continue in payment until her husband is formally released from prison.  At that stage, he will be entitled to claim unemployment benefit in respect of himself and his family.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been <Col N="979" /> in receipt of deserted wife's benefit since 1970.  The current weekly rate payable to her is £57.40.</P>
      <P>She claimed and was paid disability benefit from 20 April 1984 to 16 April 1985 based on her contributions in 1982-83. This entitlement ceased from 17 April 1985 as the contribution year governing her claim changed to 1983-84 and she had only ten reckonable contributions during that year.  Disability benefit had been payable at half the single rate because of her entitlement to deserted wife's benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned continued to submit medical certificates in respect of which she was awarded credited contributions until 22 October 1985 when she was considered to be capable of work by a medical referee of the Department.  She was notified of her right to appeal against this decision but so far she has not done so.  Her insurance record during 1984-85 qualifies her for disability or unemployment benefit during the current year 1986 should she satisfy the other conditions for entitlement to these benefits.</P>

On each occasion inquiries had to be made to establish if he was available for and genuinely seeking work. The claimant failed to respond on several occasions to written inquiries by the local office in the matter and it was only on 23 April 1986 that a satisfactory reply was received.  On the basis of information available a deciding officer disallowed his claims on the grounds that he was not available for employment.  He was notified accordingly and of his right to appeal against the disallowances.</P>

      <P>Following a change of address, the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was reviewed and she was assessed with means of £20 weekly with effect from 5 February 1986 derived from benefit from the earnings of the person with whom she was residing.  She was, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £13.80 being the appropriate maximum rate payable in her case of £33.80, less means of £20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> When she later returned to her home address, she applied for a review of her means.  Inquiries by a social welfare officer in the matter were completed recently and her means have been assessed at nil with effect from 27 March 1986. She is, therefore, entitled to unemployment assistance at the maximum weekly rate of £33.80.  Weekly payments of £33.80 will commence this week.  However, as the person concerned was in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the health board pending the outcome of the review, inquiries are being made as to the amount advanced to her.  When the relevant details are obtained, a refund will be made to the health board out of arrears of unemployment assistance due and any balance will be paid to the claimant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was paid flat rate unemployment benefit at the appropriate maximum weekly rate payable in her case of £34.70 up to 12 February 1986, when she had drawn 156 days benefit.  As she did not satisfy the relevant contribution condition, her weekly flat rate benefit was reduced to £32.75 from 13 February 1986.  Also, with effect from that date, she entered a lower phase of <Col N="988" /> pay-related benefit and payment of this benefit was reduced accordingly from £9.91 to £7.93 weekly.  Combined weekly payments of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit amounting to £40.68 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the equality provisions implemented with effect from 15 May 1986 under the Social Welfare Act, 1986, the maximum duration of unemployment benefit payable to married women was increased from 312 to 390 days and, in addition, the weekly flat rate benefit payable to those claimants was increased to that applicable to other claimants.</P>
    <P>The person concerned will, accordingly, be entitled to payment of benefit for 390 days on her claim provided she continues to prove unemployment.

The correct weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case is £16.75, that is the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £62.95 less means of £46.20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The error, which is regretted, has since been corrected and weekly payments of £16.75 will continue pending the outcome <Col N="996" /> of the inquiries on his unemployment benefit entitlement.</P>

      <P>Under existing provisions an old age contributory pensioner is entitled to receive an adult dependant's allowance in respect of his wife while she is in receipt of a short term benefit payment such as disability benefit from the Department. However, the adult dependant's allowance is not payable in a case where the pensioners wife is in receipt of a long term pension payment under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>In this case the husband qualified for an old age contributory pension from 1 June 1979 at a rate which included an allowance in respect of his wife.  She was then in receipt of disability benefit and this continued to be paid to her until she reached age 66 years when it ceased to be payable.  She then qualified for an old age contributory pension in her own right at a rate of £49.05 per week.  The adult dependant's allowance ceased to be payable to her husband and his weekly rate of pension was revised from £84.20 to £51.40 per week.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the contribution year governing the claim.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 26 March 1986 and according to the Department's records he had only 25 contributions paid in the contribution year 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985, which governed his entitlement to benefit from 26 March 1986.  Accordingly, his claim for unemployment benefit was disallowed.</P>
      <P>He then claimed unemployment assistance and his claim was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of his means.  This investigation will be completed as soon as possible and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined in the light of the outcome of the investigation.</P>

      <P>It is presumed the Deputy is referring to the assessment of means for unemployment assistance, which is means tested, whereas unemployment <Col N="999" /> benefit is not.  The amount of unemployment assistance payable in any case is determined by deducting from the appropriate prescribed rate, the amount of means assessed against the claimant.  For example a long term claimant living in an urban area, with an adult dependant and one child dependant could have means of £68.80 and still qualify for a minimum weekly payment of 5p unemployment assistance.  A single person, in similar circumstances could qualify for the same payment with means of £34.90.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 150 together.  Given normal summer weather conditions adequate supplies of locally saved fodder are available in all areas throughout the country.  In 1985, however, the conditions for saving hay and silage were exceptionally bad especially in the west and the north-west.  In such circumstances it is primarily a matter <Col N="1002" /> for local enterprise and initiative to arrange for the transfer of fodder from areas with surplus stocks to deficit areas, as is the case with other commodities. Extremely acute shortages of fodder occurred recently in some areas of the west and north-west as a result of the late spring growth of grass and the Government decided, as an exceptional measure, that army lorries should be employed to help transfer fodder to these areas.  In view, however, of the improved growth conditions for grass in the recent past the need for fodder supplies has been eased and further involvement of army transport is not considered necessary.  Under EC regulations it is not open to me to prohibit or restrict the exportation of fodder.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall the reply given to his Parliamentary Question of 19 November 1985, regarding the development of the general purposes area in St. Vincent de Paul's girls' national school, Griffith Avenue, Dublin 9, indicating that the tender for the construction of this area was significantly in excess of the allowable cost limit, and that it was <Col N="1005" /> necessary to secure suitable cost reductions before further progress could be made.</P>
      <P>Since that date, consultations with the school authorities have resulted in acceptable cost reductions being proposed in relation to the work to be grant aided by my Department and, accordingly, I have authorised the placing of a contract for this project during August next on the basis that work on the project may commence at any time after the last day of the month in question.
