    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1965 the country has undergone major social and economic changes.  In particular, we have moved from a situation of rapid economic growth into a prolonged period of recession and extremely rapid structural change.  This has led to a large increase in unemployment from 7 per cent in 1965 to 17.9 per cent today.  The unemployment problem has been exacerbated by demographic and social factors.  In the 20 years since 1965 the population has grown by 653,000, an increase of almost a quarter, while the labour force has grown by about 150,000 influenced, to some extent, by the participation of women in the paid labour force.</P>
      <P>The current level of unemployment remains unacceptably high.  The growth in unemployment has, however, levelled out and seems to be stabilising.  The increase in unemployment must be seen in the context of an increase in the labour force of 27,000 between April 1982 and April 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain groups in the labour market such as the young unemployed and the long term unemployed suffer particular difficulties.  As regards young people, employment and training programmes are at high levels since the introduction of the youth employment levy in 1982.  In Ireland, the proportion of total unemployment accounted for by youth is now one of the lowest in the European Community despite our having proportionally <Col N="674" /> the highest youth population of the member states.</P>
    <P>Long term unemployment is now a major problem.  Between April 1980 and April 1986, the number of long term unemployed in Ireland increased from 31,000 to 104,000 and now represent 44 per cent of all registered unemployed.  I should explain the term &ldquo;long term unemployed&rdquo; is used to denote people who are 12 months or more without a job.  About 25 per cent of the unemployed have been out of work for three years or more.</P>
    <P>The general employment problem, and the particular problems of youth and long term unemployment, are not unique to Ireland.  In the EC there are 16 million out of work and the figure for the OECD area is a staggering 31 million, nine times the population of Ireland.  As a small, exposed and export-led economy, our ability to tackle the problem is greatly dependent on improvements in the economies of our European partners.  For the EC and the OECD the projections are for an increase in the growth rate during the coming years.  This will not, however, be adequate to reduce unemployment significantly.  In Ireland the outlook is similar.  In spite of increased growth there will be little prospect of a large scale decrease in unemployment in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>In the 21 years since 1965 there have been major changes also in the occupational and industrial composition of our workforce.  The numbers employed in the service sector have increased by over 160,000 and industrial employment has grown by 11,000.  Agricultural employment, however, has fallen by a staggering 165,000.</P>
    <P>All indications are for a continuing difficult employment situation accompanied by major changes with consequential effects for the labour market.</P>
    <P>Quite apart, however, from the changes in the economic and social situation, the last 20 years have seen major changes in what we are doing in the manpower and related area.  For example, in 1965, with the exception of CERT and vocational education schools, there was <Col N="675" /> little or no training being done and AnCo were only on the drawing board.  Today, AnCo are training nearly 15,000 people at any one time.  In addition, we have the comprehensive and community schools, the regional technical colleges, the national institutes of higher education, and increased engineering and scientific capacity in the more traditional third level educational institutions.  There has been the most extraordinary expansion in educational opportunities in that period.</P>
    <P>There have been significant developments also in the assistance we provide to the young unemployed through permanent and temporary employment schemes, work experience and training. In 1981, the year before the establishment of the Youth Employment Agency, employment and training schemes catered for 22,500 young people.  In 1986, employment and training schemes and the vocational preparation and training programme will cater for 66,500 young people.</P>
    <P>In the period since Ireland joined the European Economic Community the form and orientation of our manpower programmes reflect not only domestic policy on maximising our resources, but also the influence of the European Social Fund and its structure.  In the current year the inflow of about £120 million shows how the fund has served to increase the capacity of our employment and training schemes to a level that could not be sustained from our own funds.</P>
    <P>Our manpower agencies have done and are doing a lot to facilitate the general economic development of our country and in particular, to help the unemployed. Despite the high unemployment rate, our labour force are better educated, trained and individually and collectively more productive than in 1965.  In addition, a significant range of measures have been developed to assist the less advantaged and the unemployed.  In 1986, on average over 40,000 are being assisted on various employment and training schemes.</P>
    <P>On my entry to office as Minister for Labour, I undertook to put our approach <Col N="676" /> to manpower policy in this country under the microscope.  I recognised that this called for more than just another change of emphasis within an existing policy framework.</P>
    <P>Manpower policy has a major contribution to make in reducing unemployment through the provision of a trained workforce and the administration of employment schemes.  On its own, however, it cannot solve the problem and is but one element of an overall employment policy.  New policy measures and new working methods are obviously needed to cope with the demands created by the labour market conditions I have described.  On the basis of the policy objectives and the streamlined institutional arrangements contained in the White Paper, I am confident that manpower policy will in the future play a more central role in the development of our workforce and the continued fight against unemployment.</P>
    <P>A number of important innovations characterise the integrated approach which will determine how our employment and training services must be planned and organised in the context of an active labour market policy.  The White Paper has signalled eight important developments.  These are: first, the significance of the emerging change in labour force structure as between different age categories; second that the allocation of training grants to industry will be based on a more selective and strategic approach; third the development of a more flexible, cost-effective, and relevant system of apprenticeship training; fourth that an integrated, comprehensive training system is necessary to provide the skills training necessary to meet the needs of our economy; fifth the practical arrangements which are needed to achieve greater co-operation between the education and manpower authorities in the transition from school to work and in the provision of vocational training and preparation; sixth how changes can be made in the range of employment schemes to improve their effectiveness and in the manner in which conditions reflect labour market circumstances.  The <Col N="677" /> Direct Action Programme is an example of how a consistent and systematic approach can target support to a particular category, like the long term unemployed, on the basis of co-ordination on the part of all the manpower services and the Department of Social Welfare; seventh, the need to develop a comprehensive programme of action to improve the level of access and the range of options available to women in the labour market and, eighth, the development of arrangements to decentralise and devolve the effective delivery of manpower services so as to improve their effectiveness at regional and local levels.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the new policy directions I have identified &mdash; and the improved penetration and effectiveness of existing services &mdash; can only be achieved by integrating the existing manpower agencies into one body.  I know that I have the support of the vast majority of Members of the Dáil, if not all Members, in my belief.  We have had very productive and constructive debates in this House on this topic over the last two to three years.  This is in no way to be interpreted as a criticism of existing bodies, all of which were set up to do a particular job by different Administrations at different times.</P>
    <P>There are compelling arguments supporting a single integrated organisation. There is confusion in the minds of the public as to who does what.  At present manpower services are provided by four agencies, namely AnCO, CERT, the National Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency.  The existence of four bodies makes it more difficult to establish clear priorities between various programmes and to place these activities within a comprehensive economic and social framework.  The increasing rate of change demands quick decisions and points to the need for a single body rather than a four-pronged response.  Finally, the establishment of a single body will lead to economies of scale and better integration.</P>
    <P>The major part of the Bill before us is concerned with the establishment of this new body which will be called the <Col N="678" /> National Employment and Training Authority.  The new authority will take over functions at present exercised by the four existing agencies.  Once the new authority are established, the four existing agencies will cease to exist.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me during this address not to pay tribute to the excellent work done, and continuing to be done, by the staff of the existing manpower agencies.  Many take legitimate and justifiable pride in the work of their organisations. Concern has been expressed over their entry into the new larger authority and whether it might affect their commitment and loyalty.  It is my policy fully to maintain the high level of morale and dedication that is already there and utilise it to the fullest extent for the benefit of the country in a fully integrated body.</P>
    <P>In brief, the functions of the authority listed in the Bill are training, retraining, administration of employment schemes, work experience programmes, placement services, assistance for co-operatives and small enterprises, and the operation of the EC free movement of worker provisions.</P>
    <P>We are also taking the opportunity of providing for the possibility of using existing training expertise to help the economic development of newly industrialised countries.  There are legal doubts as to whether AnCO has the power under the 1967 Industrial Training Act to operate abroad.  The Bill contains a specific provision which gives the new authority power to undertake the provision of consultancy and manpower-related services overseas, but only on a strictly commercial basis.  To ensure that this activity is carried out according to commercial criteria the authority is obliged to set up a separate subsidiary company for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The structural weakness at the core of manpower policy has prompted criticism of the failure of Ministers and their Departments to exercise an effective policy-making role in relation to the State-sponsored bodies under their control. This criticism, familiar to Deputies, maintains that the policy role has been <Col N="679" /> allowed by default to be discharged in practice by executive bodies.  Such a failure results in the functions of the body not being properly located within a comprehensive economic and social framework. In parallel with the establishment of the new authority, I recognise that the Department of Labour need to be strengthened so as to assume responsibility for developing policy as envisaged in the White Paper and for monitoring performance and providing policy specifications to the new authority.  In future, the central control and direction of policy will rest with the Minister and the Department of Labour.  The authority will be responsible for the execution of policy already determined.</P>
    <P>I accept that the distinction between policy formulation and policy execution is easier to draw in theory than in practice. The reality is that policy tends to evolve in part, at least, in the process of its execution.  In that context the authority will also have an important input into policy and a legitimate role to play in advising on policy.  In order to enable the Minister to exercise ultimate control, provision has been made in the Bill to enable him to issue directions and to request information in relation to any of their activities or expenditure.</P>
    <P>In the legislation we are providing for the transfer of the staff in the existing four agencies to the new authority.  We are also saying that there will be no lessening in pay or terms and conditions of service.  It is my intention to minimise any uncertainty over the transfer.  For this reason, I have asked the chairman of AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency, who is also the chairman designate of the new authority, to prepare an organisational structure for the new authority.  This organisational structure will be available soon and will be communicated to the existing chief executives for discussions with their respective staffs early next month.  The structure is not intended to pre-empt a decision by the new authority.  Rather it is intended as a basis to minimise uncertainty and to assist the planning that will allow the authority <Col N="680" /> to become operative as soon as possible. My intention is that the staff should be treated fairly, consistent with the proper functioning of the new authority.</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided to convert the youth employment levy into a general employment and training levy. This decision was taken in the context of the changing age structure of the labour force and those who are unemployed.  By 1990 over half the workforce will be in the 25-44 age group.  This does not mean that there will be a consequent reduction in the provision for youth.  The employment and training activity of youth will be determined in the light of prevailing levels of unemployment.  The removal of the age restriction will, however, ensure a greater degree of flexibility in the allocation of resources in the years ahead and will enable programmes to be adjusted to take account of the changing needs of different unemployed age groups.  It will also reduce the cumbersome administrative constraints required in the operation of schemes for those under and over 25 years old.  In the foreseeable future, I would foresee a major youth dimension in the work of the authority.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to the question of the composition of the board of the new authority. In deciding upon this question I was influenced by the need to have those bodies active in the labour market represented on the board and, at the same time, ensure a small board consistent with effectiveness and efficiency.  I have balanced these two objectives by opting for four employer representatives, four representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, one youth representative, one representative each from the Departments of Education, Social Welfare and Labour, two employee members and two other representatives, including the chairman, to be appointed by myself.  The employee members of the board will be elected by the staff of the authority as soon as possible after the establishment of the authority.  Initially, therefore, the board will consist of 13 ordinary members. There are other options but this composition <Col N="681" /> in my view, represents the best compromise between being representative and being effective.</P>
    <P>I believe that enactment of the Bill before us will make a significant contribution to the development of our workforce and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally this Bill has come before the House.  For years a number of people have been calling for this Bill, not least of them myself.  The fact that Second Stage is being discussed today is to be welcomed.  I wish to deal with a number of points in detail and on Committee Stage I will put down a number of amendments.</P>
      <P>In principle, the Fianna Fáil Party support this Bill because it has been part of our policy for a number of years and since I became Labour spokesman I have been attempting to assist the Minister in bringing this through the various stages.  I am sure the Minister will allow me look back to the last time we had an opportunity to discuss manpower legislation.  On 2 December 1981, at Vol. 331, No. 5, column 959 of the Official Report when we were discussing the Youth Employment Agency, I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an absolute need that the agency have power.  One of our main problems at present is that there is lack of co-ordination between the various bodies and that has tended to undermine a successful attack on youth unemployment.  All the bodies concerned with youth unemployment are powerful in their own right with their own strong views and management and their own institutions which they are anxious to protect.  It is hard to find any common ground between them. They all seem to give different sets of statistics.  That is one of the great arguments for the establishment of one powerful agency.  I presume those other bodies will not operate any more and that the Minister will ensure that there will be effective co-ordination between the schools, the agencies, placement services and Government <Col N="682" /> Departments.  I hope the existing institutions are broken up so as to ensure that there is just one body.  That has always been my view.</P>
    <P>I spoke at length on that day and on 8 December.  Before I came into this House I dealt with youth bodies and I was convinced that the one thing we were not doing was implementing what Seán Lemass intended back in 1964-65.  He made many fine speeches on how he intended manpower policy to develop in the sixties and the seventies.  In the shortest White Paper every produced in this country, that on manpower policy in October 1965, there was set out how the late Deputy Seán Lemass foresaw manpower policy evolving in the sixties and the seventies.  There is no doubt that the comments in that document referred to a different age.  In his contributions in this House in the autumn of 1964 Deputy Seán Lemass made it very clear how he foresaw manpower policy evolving if the economic climate were to change.  Perhaps politicians and administrators generally did not listen sufficiently to the late Deputy Seán Lemass.  He made it clear that he always wished to see manpower policy evolve as a closely knit co-ordinated effort between industry on the one side, and training bodies on the other.</P>
    <P>CERT had been in existence since 1963.  AnCO were set up in 1967, then there was the National Manpower Service and in 1981 the Youth Employment Agency.  I have been convinced for years that they have all been attempting to carry out the same task, their functions were never co-ordinated and they never used the same set of statistics.  While I agree with the Minister that the introduction of this Bill is not a reflection on any individual or any of those bodies, the Manpower Bill of 1965 and the various agencies have outlived their usefulness. They were set up and intended for a different type of economic climate.  I do not believe the people who worked on the 1965 White Paper ever intended manpower policy to disintegrate to the extent that it has.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> I suppose it is a reflection on all of us that it has taken 21 years to review something that has been clearly out-of-date for ten years at least.  We have had no real manpower policy since 1965 and there could not have been greater economic changes than those we have experienced since then.  Throughout that document they spoke of economic growth, the creation of employment, of anything from 60,000 to 70,000 jobs. They spoke of full employment, about the need for the establishment of a manpower agency with offices throughout the country so that employers would be able to find suitable employees quickly. However, the system of advertising and interviewing was too slow for all of those jobs coming on stream as a result of the IDA drive to attract foreign investment here.  It is impossible for the manpower agency to operate effectively with 230,000 odd people unemployed, a huge problem of emigration &mdash; 70,000 over the last five years &mdash; with thousands of young people wanting to participate in training programmes and short-term employment schemes.  When one takes all of those factors into account one can readily see why it has become impossible to allow the present system to continue.  People now accept there must be a fundamental change.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I hope the various agencies, with the exception of CERT, will co-operate in following and implementing what was the philosophy of the late Deputy Seán Lemass, what he wanted to do in 1965.  One must bear in mind what has happened in the intervening years and not take it that these agencies are being abolished but rather are being reintegrated into our economy to carry out the function for which they were first established but in a different way.</P>
    <P>I should like to place on record the first paragraph of the 1965 <i>White Paper on Manpower Policy:</i></P>
    <P>Government policy in relation to manpower will aim at the institution of <Col N="684" /> measures which will help workers to benefit from the employment opportunities which will follow from the achievement of the targets set out in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  The Programme forecasts an increase in employment of 78,000 in the decade to 1970 with an increase of 86,000 in industry and 58,000 in services off-set by a decline of 66,000 in agriculture.  Workers will also be helped in coping with the inevitable structural changes in employment which will arise as these targets are attained.</P>
    <P>The figures about which they spoke then were achieved.  The relevant organisations endeavoured to develop that type of policy for some years and succeeded to a great extent.  For example, the structural change was from agriculture to, mainly, foreign investment-type industry. The structure is entirely different now, with massive unemployment and the requirement on these agencies to try as effectively and efficiently as possible to co-ordinate State resources in the provision of services, whether by way of training, retraining, employment, cooperatives, working with communities and so on.  Clearly they are not doing so at present.  There is a board in AnCO, a council in CERT, there is the manpower agency tightly linked with the Department of Labour.  Then there is the Youth Employment Agency.  I commend the work the people in that agency have endeavoured to do.  While I never agreed with the concept of the Youth Employment Agency I accept that the individuals who worked there over the past five years did all they could to change the climate and create jobs.  Their brief was too wide, the relevant legislation too broad and their capacity to undertake the relevant task in the economic circumstances prevailing over the past five years was limited. Because of that the Youth Employment Agency have failed.  That is no criticism of the excellent staff there who are endeavouring to carry out an impossible task.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> I might make a few points on the recent <i>White Paper on Manpower Policy</i> published in September last because the Bill arises therefrom.  This is the first opportunity we have had of expressing our views on it in this House.  The document more or less lays down what is contained in the other Bills.  There are many comments with which I fully agree, not least those contained in paragraph 4.22 under the heading Hotel and Catering Industry where it is said:</P>
    <P>Training of management and craft personnel for the hotel and catering industry is the responsibility of the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training (CERT).  CERT was established in 1963 and is the oldest of the manpower bodies.  Its main activities comprise industry-based training, school-based training and training for the unemployed in training centres.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4.23 says:</P>
    <P>The tourism industry of which hotel and catering is a vital component has grown rapidly over the last two decades and makes a significant contribution to economic, social and regional development. The contribution of CERT in this area both in relation to the improvement of standards in the industry and the numbers trained has been significant.  In 1985 CERT achieved a 100 per cent placement rate for its trainees within the industry.  It is important not only to maintain but to build on the standards which have been achieved.</P>
    <P>I will remind the House that the relevant legislation is built on the comments contained in that White Paper.  Is it not incredible that, having converted those comments into legislation, effectively the role CERT perform at present is abolished under the same legislation?  I shall revert to that matter later.</P>
    <P>I will give some more general comments on the White Paper which, in broad outline, I consider to be a good one.  Its main thrust is the listing of programmes and schemes, most of which are already being carried out by the various agencies, such as AnCO, Manpower, the <Col N="686" /> Youth Employment Agency and CERT. The objectives of manpower policy, as set out, are too narrow.  For example, they do not include any reference to, or are not linked to, industrial or economic policy.  There is no reference to employment opportunities whether in the manufacturing or services sector.  There are no indicators as to which sectors of industry hold potential for such employment opportunities.  There is a major omission in that the White Paper makes no attempt to develop some of the assumptions contained in previous NESC reports, while regional variations in relation to unemployment trends and employment opportunities receive no mention whatever.</P>
    <P>The White Paper avoids dealing in proper depth with the complementary roles of education and training.  There are no detailed analyses of the existing facilities and working arrangements with the education sector.  This is only treated by a proposal that the Minister for Education would produce a report.  I think the Minister will agree there was plenty of time to produce a report in the number of years we have waited for a White Paper.  The measures outlined on the special labour market are beneficial to unemployed persons.  However, these measures are not linked to job opportunities and job creation initiative and are, therefore, limited in terms of sustainable jobs.  This has been argued, and I would have thought that the White Paper would provide information on the effectiveness of the performance over the years of the individual manpower agencies. There is no evidence to show that such a study was carried out.  I ask the Minister if such a study has been carried out.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that one of the advantages of amalgamation will be that the applicants will in future go to one source. There is no mention of costs or efficiencies. These should have been included in the White Paper to prove the effectiveness of the costings and how the whole operation would actually work. There is hardly any mention in the White Paper of finance and funding.  Despite the fact that the manpower agencies project <Col N="687" /> their budget three to five years ahead, no attempt has been made to project funding requirements and training numbers for the next three years.  That should have been included in the White Paper.  In future we should review manpower policy every five years.</P>
    <P>The White Paper deals mainly with labour market numbers and training policies which are very limited since they are not linked to employment prospects and job creation opportunities.  The White Paper makes little or no mention of jobs even though the legislation is supposed to be employment legislation.  The White Paper fails to produce an overall policy linked to economic development but is concentrated more on the institutional arrangements rather than the broad policy.  I ask why is it necessary to deal in the White Paper with the amalgamation of the training bodies?  The Minister for Labour could at any stage have examined the functions of the manpower agencies and could have arranged to rationalise them if necessary.  The weakness in the White Paper is that it deals with the amalgamation of agencies without spelling out more clearly the manpower policy under which it operates. I agree with what the Minister said in his speech but I still think that there should have been an analysis of what the Minister is doing.  Otherwise there will be criticism.  It is the wish of all of us to improve the situation.  The legislation is for the overall good but it could be a little more effective.  That is the weakness in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify what will happen.  The legislation spells out that there will be a new authority consisting of 15 people: four representatives of the ICTU; four representatives of employer bodies probably nominated by the FUE; three people representing the interests of social welfare, education and youth; two will be nominated by the Minister and two will be nominated by the trade union representatives at a subsequent date.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister when replying to outline the reasons why that is not done initially and why it comes at a later date.  I can imagine why, but it should be on the record of the House.  I would like him to say at what stage those two people will be elected.  I also ask the Minister, what will happen after that? What is the structure under the authority? From reading the legislation and from the White Paper it appears it will be broken into four or five sections but I would like the Minister to clarify it.  I understand from the White Paper that there will be a training division with separate departments in line with what I always called for and what we called for in our policy document in 1985.  There will be an employment schemes division, a regional division, a staff and personnel division and an administration and finance division.  I ask the Minister to confirm that is correct.</P>
      <P>There is very little in the legislation in regard to the regional division.  The whole idea of the legislation is to co-ordinate organisations that are unwieldy and are not working together.  It is no good organising it at the top if it will not go downstream. The legislation does not explain what will happen under the authority.  It states that there will be a regional division. What has happened down the years is that in a certain county a manpower office worked to an extent in conjunction with the social welfare office, with CERT and with the YEA; they all tried to do the one job but were not co-ordinated. The Minister has brought the hierarchies and the bureaucracies together and has centralised them in a way that represents all the individual organisations and I agree with that.  The success of the manpower policy depends on how the matter is followed up in the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no way that we can support the Bill, although we desperately want to, if there is not built into it some device which will spell out how it will be implemented in the regions.  Will it be implemented in the seven IDA regions, in the eight health board areas or in the social welfare offices?  I would favour the seven or eight regions with one extremely <Col N="689" /> strong individual in control.  It could be argued that it would be fundamental to the success of this legislation that the regional director be more important than the person who will head one of the individual sections in Dublin.  It is in the regions that the difficulties are, have been in the past and will be in the future.  We should have regard to that and learn from the lessons of the past 21 years, and in particular the past ten years.  I ask the Minister not just to spell this out in his reply but to bring forward an amendment that will clarify how the regional structure will work.  Otherwise, it will be impossible to support the Bill.</P>
    <P>I continually mentioned the LINC and the COMTEC programmes as being the great area of duplication in the present structure.  If the regions are not defined a gap will appear.  While I totally accept the sincerity of the Minister, if it is not written into the legislation another Minister could change that structure.  He could come under local pressure to set up schemes with county development teams, vocational educational committees or other bodies the same as the LINC and the COMTEC programmes.</P>
    <P>This party will put down an amendment on Committee Stage asking that CERT be excluded from the Bill.  During the years I may have said that CERT should be included or excluded but now we are dealing with legislation and I think that CERT should be left aside but should have a close link with the authority.  We will table an amendment to that effect. It will be interesting to hear the Minister's view on that.  I know that over the years the Minister, like me, has changed his view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure about that.  The Bill has attracted a lot of front bench and back bench interest in all parties and the evidence of that is the long list of Members anxious to contribute.  I hope those Members will get an opportunity to contribute although I accept it <Col N="690" /> is important that the Bill be passed by the House fairly soon.  When similar legislation was introduced in 1981 the long debate that followed proved worth while. Legislation like this concerns all constituencies. There is a substantial lobby in support of CERT and it is only right that I, as Opposition spokesman, should put forward the views of some of my rural colleagues who have close contact with CERT.  That organisation have been deeply involved in tourism down the years.  It is vital that CERT should be left as an independent body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that his White Paper stated that an organisation with 100 per cent success in deplorable economic times was an organisation that should be left alone.  If there is a need to change CERT structurally because the overall authority is being changed that is a different matter but we should not do anything that will damage the way CERT have operated down the years.  Many people admire CERT and recognise the substantial gains they have made.  The hotel, catering and tourism industries are one of Ireland's top employers at a time when many of our industries are reducing their workforce and there is potential for an increase in employment in them.  Their high added value and export earning role makes a significant contribution to the economy. The preliminary figures of CERT's 1986 survey on the scope of tourism indicate that 83,000 people are now in tourism-induced employment, while a further 20,000 are employed in non-tourism catering and the licensed trade.  All sectors in the industry are trained by CERT. The industry has a unique geographic spread and provides employment in the less industrialised parts of Ireland.  It has a low staff turnover, averaging 8 per cent, and 73 per cent of jobs in hotels and catering; 63,000 employed are full time permanent, a higher proportion than is normally perceived.  It remains one of Ireland's few growth industries, in spite of seasonal fluctuations, while manufacturing industry has declined.  The industry offers high employment potential and continues to demand and absorb <Col N="691" /> trained staff.  The only employment available in many towns is in hotels and the catering sector, particularly during the summer.</P>
    <P>CERT were set up in 1963 by Bord Fáilte to provide training for tourism personnel. The need for a specific tourism training agency was recognised by Bord Fáilte only eight years after their foundation. Some four years later AnCO were established specifically to train for manufacturing industry.  CERT are training an industry which is uniquely changeable from season to season, due to factors largely outside their control.  High flexibility and close liaision with the industry are essential in responding quickly to manpower needs.  I am sure the Minister will agree that CERT are the most experienced of the four manpower agencies. Earlier this year the Minister described CERT as an example that all other training agencies should follow and the White Paper has confirmed their position.</P>
    <P>Since 1963 more than 60 per cent of the industry's workforce has undergone some form of CERT training.  About 25 per cent have been formally trained in hotel and catering colleges.  CERT are now clearly identified as the avenue for all careers in the industry.  They are also associated with quality training and employment success.  They have raised the status of the industry as a career option where previously it had little or no appeal to the school leaver.  Demand for places on CERT courses has dramatically increased over the years, from 1,381 applications for normal courses in 1967 to 8,660 applications in 1985.  CERT have consistently achieved 100 per cent placement of their formal graduates and 84 per cent of those on courses for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Demand for trainees by the industry is always high and invariably exceeds the supply available in spite of increased numbers in training.  Between April and June 1985, 1,711 trainees were requested by tourism industry establishments while a total of 1,062 were available, a 13 per cent increase on 1984 trainee numbers. CERT's 100 per cent placement record is <Col N="692" /> directly related to their integrated approach to training which links recruitment, training and placement.  Close staff interaction and mobility ensures careful monitoring of each trainee's progress from the moment they apply for a course to their employment and even beyond. That is to the credit of CERT.  Given the volatile nature of the tourism industry, CERT must be flexible in their responses to the industry's varied needs, matching training with manpower needs and gearing services towards areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>Before the House debates Committee Stage the Minister should have another look at how CERT is handled.  I do not think it would be difficult to prepare amendments that will keep CERT intact as a limited company because there is an educational element involved in their operations.  The Minister has told us that CERT have had a 100 per cent placement rate while the other agencies very from 23 per cent to 32 per cent, the best being 39 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Some figures are higher than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I quoted were given to me in the House recently. I accept that the placement figure may be higher for specialised courses.  If the organisation has a 100 per cent success rate in placement, one must ask why is it considered necessary to change it.  The Minister can leave CERT as a limited company reporting back to the Authority. He will have control and CERT will remain a separate organisation.  The council of CERT will continue to work closely with the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of how CERT help the hotel industry directly.  There are 100 students in Rosslare and between 50 and 60 in the Torc Hotel in Killarney.  Those hotels are kept open in the winter months and it should be possible to expand that service.  It is ludicrous to have hotels idle for four or five months when those establishments could be used to train people for the industry.  Young people will get a good education there, will be living in a <Col N="693" /> college environment and, at the same time, getting practical experience.  I do not know the extent of the discussions the Minister has had with CERT but I hope they succeed.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to table amendments on Committee Stage to put CERT in a special position and at present we have our experts examining the legislation to see how that can be done.  Perhaps the Minister will reconsider amending the Bill in this respect, because I have reason to believe he had other options.</P>
    <P>In its existing role, CERT are a limited company operating under the Minister for Labour, and they have been extremely successful.  That organisation have the ability to take on a number of executive functions in regard to determining and implementing programmes and resources, such as the leasing and purchasing of premises, application of national certification in conjunction with the Minister for Education, negotiating and finalising agreements with other bodies, providing financial support for training programmes, funding arrangements with other institutions, operating commercially at national and international level and managing a commercial subsidiary company.</P>
    <P>It is the belief of people who examined this, and of Fianna Fáil's back-up team, that executive functions cannot be encompassed within the structure of the industrial training committees who are limited to advising and assisting their parent organisations.  The Minister should examine that, because the initial concept when CERT were established as a limited liability company was that they would carry out their wide range of functions with the consent of the Minister. The establishment of limited liability companies by the Government is an acceptable and well proven practice.  We have other models in the State sector, including Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, B &amp; I, the Kilkenny Design organisation, the National Petroleum Corporation, the Irish Sugar Company and others.  CERT hold the view that their status within the new Authority will allow them to be flexible. I think that is a fair argument.  I <Col N="694" /> accept it, and the hotels federation and some of the trade unions have been putting forward the same argument.  Indeed it seems to be a unanimous view.</P>
    <P>The success of the work CERT have been doing might be affected if they are drawn into an area that would seem to be fundamentally different.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister and the draftsmen to go back and consider the whole purpose behind the establishment of CERT. The argument that CERT should retain their legal status as a limited company and that the articles of association and memorandum of CERT would be amended to allow them to assume their new position within the training Authority, substituting the training Authority for the Minister for Labour and the Public Service, would allow the continuance of the council of CERT, who would report to the board of the National Employment and Training Authority in their efforts to implement policies.  CERT would also submit their budgets for approval by the Authority, thus allowing the Minister full control.  By doing that CERT would not necessarily need their own research department because they could link in with the Authority.  The Minister, through his nominee on the council of CERT, could have full control over the operations of CERT.  In that way the Minister would not affect the rather unique position of CERT.  I would be anxious to hear the Minister's arguments to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I refer to Part I of the Schedule which deals with the position of the Authority chairman.  In the initial years there will be difficulties when efforts are made to streamline four very strong organisations, all of which have special positions. They have been in existence for a considerable time and inevitably there will be difficulties in getting them to work together.  We all appeal to them to do that in the interests of the unemployed and of people seeking to be included in courses of training and retraining, short term employment schemes, etc.  Those in these organisations should think of the young people involved rather than concentrate on their own selfish interests. <Col N="695" /> They have proved in the past that they are capable of that: they have shown that they are capable of co-operating with each other very fully.</P>
    <P>It will be important to get this board off to a good start and therefore there will be a need for a full time chairman. Has the Minister given consideration to that?  I suggest there is an argument for a full time chairman.  Does the Minister think that there will not be the number of meetings in the initial years to warrant a full time chairman?  I think that in the interest of getting things going, of getting the five departments set up and of achieving co-operation, a full time chairman should be appointed.  Would it be possible to get a person who would have the commitment to do all those things on a part time basis?  If it is, it seems likely it would be difficult to get a person of the calibre required to knit organisations like these together, given the rates of pay we allocate to part time chairmen in Ireland. For the small amount of finance it would entail over a short period, I think it would be worth having a full time chairman.  I do not think that these organisations could be brought together properly by somebody in a part time capacity.  There will be the normal jealousies and bias among these organisations and it is likely that the chairman will have to deal with those things.  We should have a chairman who will live with this on a full time basis. I do not think a part time chairman could give the necessary commitment, and if that is not there all the efforts of the Minister will fail.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that.</P>
    <P>There are some schemes outside the State in which some of our young people are involved.  It seems from the Bill that in future these can be done only on a commercial basis.  Have these schemes not been successful?  Are they too costly? I am not arguing from one point of view or another.</P>

      <P>I was thinking of projects like the one in Louvain.  I agree with the commercial services.  On a number of occasions in the past few years we have discussed here the kind of services the State provides for emigrants, how we should help them abroad. Though some efforts have been made to work with Irish organisations, I am not sure that we are doing enough.  Here we have an opportunity to tie this into legislation. Last week I met a number of Irish people who have emigrated to America and though clearly they are doing far better than Irish people in Britain, there are many difficulties and there is a need to give them advice, assistance and co-operation. When one is living semiillegally in another country, and in a certain amount of fear, there is difficulty in contacting one's own consul or embassy and these people just do not do that.</P>
      <P>The Americans understand the special position of the Irish immigrants and are not really concerned about their numbers; they are more concerned about other nationalities.  But our people are caught up in legislation and regulations that are tight over there and that are going to get tighter in a few months' time, and we cannot ignore them.  Regardless of the economic arguments as to why they are away, they are away and they are worried. These people have left our shores and, as in the thirties and fifties, they understandably have a chip on their shoulder about how they have been treated by the old country.  The new generation will have the same difficulty in ten or 20 years' time.  While the White Paper mentions the problem, nothing has been done about it.  I would like the Minister to see if we can have a decent advisory structure to help the people who have left, because they are a sizeable part of our manpower base and it is only when one goes away that one realises just how sizeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 25 changes the title &ldquo;youth employment levy&rdquo; to &ldquo;training and employment levy&rdquo;.  We welcome that because it was wrong, with the changes in employment patterns in the last few <Col N="697" /> years, that people over 25 could not benefit from the money that was raised.  Perhaps the Minister would outline exactly how he sees the levy operating now under the new title.  There are difficulties. Despite the fact that the levy was originally sold on the basis that it would help to create sustainable jobs in the community and with co-operatives, more and more of the money is being used for training and retraining rather than in employment. Perhaps the Minister would give us his views on this because, as the European Social Fund cut back on the available resources, the levy will continue to be used for short term training courses and will be of no benefit in the area for which it was set up in the first place.  That would create ill-will in the trade union movement whose members made this fairly major sacrifice when one takes into consideration the high level of taxation. The Minister should spell out exactly how section 25 is to be implemented in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the appointment of a director general.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us how the various departments will be headed, the grades of people to be employed, whether they will be new people or the heads of the present Departments, what type of job functions they will have, whether they will report back to the Authority and so on.  In particular I would like to know what grade of person will be employed as the regional divisional manager.  I attach enormous importance to that position because the person occupying it will be out there in the field co-ordinating and keeping in touch with the various bodies, the educational interests and so on, batting away with those organisations and making the thing work.  That regional manager should be given a certain amount of money so that he has the capability and the power to devise courses, employment schemes and whatever else is necessary to make a significant impact on employment and on the standards of training in this region.  If this position is pitched too low we will be back to centralised bureaucracy before the ink is dry on the Bill. It is vitally important that the person <Col N="698" /> concerned be given the muscle and that the grade is up to the standard of the job he is expected to do, because otherwise we will not attract the right person.</P>
    <P>There are a number of sections on staffing.  In this legislation we are switching people from the State sector to the semi-State sector.  I accept that this may be a delicate issue, but perhaps the Minister will tell us if there are any difficulties, if the safeguards on pay and conditions, tenure and pensions of persons transferred to the Authority from existing manpower bodies, as stated in sections 7 and 8, are agreed and, if not, what stage the negotiations are at.</P>
    <P>Section 4 refers to assisting persons seeking employment elsewhere in the European Community.  Is this part of the legislation restricted to the European Community?  I see how it could be used very usefully outside the EC.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil welcome this legislation and we want to see it work properly.  The legislation should not be vague, leaving out a number of areas.  We hope that CERT will be left as a separate organisation with the tie-in to the Authority, since nothing is lost by doing that, and that the other bodies will be successfully amalgamated into one Authority.  I do not believe the Minister is conceding very much here since their programme, budget, plans and aspirations will have to go through the Authority and that gives the Minister all the power he would wish to have while maintaining what has been the most successful of our manpower agencies in the past 23 years.</P>
    <P>In regard to the regions perhaps the Minister would spell out how they are devised so as not to get back into the situation we have been in in the last number of years.</P>
    <P>An argument has been put forward in regard to the composition of the board. Some people argue that perhaps people from the county development organisations could have a role.  That can be argued one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Regarding the three individuals for social welfare, education and youth interest, will the Minister say whether he envisages that they will be civil servants <Col N="699" /> from those areas or people from a recognised organisation who have an interest in those bodies?  I am not too sure about social welfare and education but in the youth interest the argument could be put forward that the latter would be very useful.  The National Youth Council of Ireland and other bodies have had a big input into much of the work that has gone on in the training areas, have been constructive over the years and were very helpful to the Minister's party in selling the Youth Employment Agency at the time.  We went along with the principle of the YEA on the basis that the National Youth Council of Ireland at the time saw benefit in it and our spokesman on Labour of the day, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, made clear in his 1981 speech that that was one of the reasons we were giving them a chance.  We have never believed that that would succeed.  When one reads that debate it is sad to think that five years later, despite so many of the things we were all highlighting and so many of the aspirations that were expressed then, we have gone such a short distance down that road.  We achieved nothing in that period.  We trained and retrained a great number of people, I suppose, but with no great success.</P>
    <P>The 1965 White Paper and this White Paper deal with the tie-in between the educational institutes and this Authority who are taking up individuals for a period from the time they leave either second level education or third level education and go on into employment.  Regarding the phrase &ldquo;on into employment&rdquo; there is a great argument for much closer links with the IDA and this new organisation. There were difficulties about that in the past because it was all training and retraining and it was difficult for the IDA to admit that this body were doing a fine job.  That was how it started out in 1967 with AnCO who were working closely with the then Department of Industry and Commerce.  The question was who the outside investors were who might come into the Irish economy in the next ten years and what type of areas they <Col N="700" /> were getting into.  From that and the close links with the educational institutes we are lucky that we have invested our money well in the NIHE and in the faculties of engineering in our colleges.  Now we are recognised worldwide as producing some of the best engineers particularly in the high technology areas of biochemistry, chemistry, electronics and general engineering.  There is no doubt about it that our people coming out of third level are of a very high quality.  The IDA working closely with this organisation can maintain that position.  Last week I got great satisfaction on hearing the praise of our engineers from the major companies in Silicon Valley.  The only difficulty is that 800 or 900 of them are over there and not here devising schemes, but I suppose the success is that of our educational system.</P>
    <P>We argue that the IDA should be reviewed in many ways.  How does the Minister feel that this manpower Authority could co-operate and link in more closely with the IDA?  I understand that those early links that were successful and should have been built on were broken up and dissipated because of the conglomeration of organisations we had in the manpower field, and that the IDA links now are more tenuous than real.</P>
    <P>We had some questions here the other day on apprenticeship training.  I agree with the White Paper's statement on page 30 in this regard, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The present statutory apprenticeship system is costly, inflexible and inefficient.  The Government have instructed AnCO, in consultation with relevant interests, to revise and modernise the system.  AnCO's objective will be to develop an apprenticeship system which</P>
    <P>&mdash; is based on standards achieved rather than time served;</P>
    <P>&mdash; ensures a satisfactory balance between supply of and demand for apprentices;</P>
    <P>&mdash; reduces the financial cost to the State of maintaining quality.</P>
    <P>You do not have to read too much between the lines about &ldquo;costly, inflexible <Col N="701" /> and inefficient&rdquo;.  I agree with that totally.  In the 17th century Dublin was one of the best cities in the world for the employment of goldsmiths, silversmiths and all the people connected with the Guildhall and the Tailors' Hall.  We built up a tremendous model of trade for Europe.  All that is recorded and documented and the results of the workmanship are still here and in other countries.  In the 18th century we lost that.  In the 19th century we built it up again and now in the 20th century we seem to have lost it again.</P>
    <P>Young people are more than willing to work almost for nothing if somebody would train them.  People became highly skilled through learning from their fathers and elder brothers the various crafts but there is no mechanism for them to obtain employment.  The trades seem to be totally closed except for a tiny, limited number.  It is sad and at the same time absurd that so few people can get into any trade.  The day will come when we will lose further trade and expertise. I do not know what AnCO's answer is.  I have heard answers but I do not accept the ones I have heard.  There must be a major policy change in this area because we have poured millions of pounds into training but killed the apprenticeships with very few exceptions.</P>
    <P>People have been taken for one year on job training.  More than a few people are going around the country with certificates of one year on job training.  Probably they would build all the buildings we will need in the next ten years if they could finish out their training.  That system is no good.  If I read the White Paper correctly, the standard achieved, rather than the time served is the key line.  The people who drafted the White Paper are wise, they have hit the nail right on the head there.  It is urgent that we bring forward a scheme where apprenticeships in all the traditional trades can be properly trained by the new manpower Authority and then allowed on to the job market.  If we train them for a year in the State training agencies and then throw them out on to the job market they will not be taken on there <Col N="702" /> because they have not got the crafts needed.  Many people who are highly experienced and want to leave the country can say they have the craft and experience but they have not completed the requisite number of years.  They are blocked in every way.  One of the first tasks of the new Authority should be to correct that area which has been very badly handled up to now.</P>
    <P>Despite our great success in education, our almost free educational system and the fact that economics have changed to the degree that people want to be educated, a high number of people drop out at second level and in parts of my constituency some drop out at first level. The White Paper on page 30 states:</P>
    <P>Young people who leave the education system without the ability to compete for jobs need a basic skills foundation course.  AnCO, through its Skills Foundation Programme, is providing such a course as part of its main contribution to the Social Guarantee for Youth.  Young people with low educational levels and without skills are also assisted by the network of Community and Travellers Training Workshops and Social Training Workshops for Offenders, operating in conjunction with the Probation and Welfare Service, which provide access to training and work experience in particularly disadvantaged young people. The future of Community and Travellers Training Workshops will be considered in the light of developments within the educational system.</P>
    <P>That is a mouthful.</P>

      <P>We have a skills foundation, AnCO, social guarantee, community and travellers' training workshops, social training workshops, probation officers and welfare officers.  I represent areas like Sheriff Street and others that I will not mention but that name crops up often.  The present system that AnCO tried to operate takes out a <Col N="703" /> small handful of people over a fairly long period and has a limited success rate.  It does not work.  That is the bottom line.  I do not blame the people in AnCO.  The system is costly and it does not work. This section of the Bill should be deleted. We should look at the people who leave first and second level education and give them some proper training.  If people already involved in the training services work together they can provide basic courses in an orderly way.</P>
      <P>We should recognise that many people in disadvantaged areas are very skilled. They have developed skills and crafts because of their great tradition on the docks and in shipping.  It is not appropriate to bring such people for training to a room in a fancy building with word processors.  The courses must be relevant to the people and available in their own areas.  To take people from Sheriff Street to Loughlinstown is like taking them on holidays and in those circumstances they cannot be expected to apply themselves. I have a lot of experience with those people and it is obvious that the present system is not working.  This section gives the impression that something is being done but it is not really being done.  We must find a way of training disadvantaged young people who have opted out of first and second level education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree but there are difficulties in doing that.  A colleague of mine was almost fired from school in the Minister's area because he rewrote the educational books of the Department. For the first time in ten years he got the departmental inspectors to visit the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of argument for the case that the educational system should be changed in those areas.  It is unfortunate that it is impossible to keep people in a school or on training courses if they do not wish to be there.  However, this is a great opportunity face up to this.  We cry <Col N="704" /> out against the crime and vandalism of 15-year olds in this city and in other towns but we do little except spend money on policing, on jails and on detention centres. We are reluctant to change the formal education system in order to give these people a chance which they are not getting at present.  The parish priest in the area said to me that if he stood outside Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Seán MacDermott Street and watched all the five-year olds and six-year olds coming out he could tell who would succeed and who would end up in crime because of the lack of opportunities.  There is no point in getting angry about them in ten years' time if we do nothing for them in the intervening period.  These people deserve and have a right to expect the resources of a training agency to be used for them.  Other people whose families have worked hard and have achieved a certain level of education are to be congratulated but they are looking after themselves with some State assistance.</P>
    <P>It is no good for a training authority to give success figures in relation to job placements if they do not give a basic education to people who had not got that opportunity previously.  I would not care if the placement figures were nil if they had given basic education to such people. Because we have not learned that lesson, we have crime and deliquency in certain areas.  Now that we are about to co-ordinate our agencies, somebody should be given the task of helping people in those areas, working with the educational authorities and other relevant people.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I will tease out on Committee Stage but I ask the Minister in replying to Second Stage to consider the major points I have made so that on Committee Stage we will have a clearer understanding of what is envisaged. If we can get the view of the Minister and the Department on the points I have raised and an explanation as to the thinking behind the White Paper, it will allow an easier Committee Stage.  I ask for the Minister's co-operation so that we can unite in getting Committee Stage through before the end of this session.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and the White Paper on manpower and I compliment both the Minister and his Department on the work put into this.  I also compliment Deputy Bertie Ahern on his very constructive and reasoned contribution this morning.  This legislation is overdue.  The first two objectives of any White Paper in this area is to get better value for taxpayers' money and to give a better service to the public.  Our first aspiration as regards NETA would be that it will not be a new mega quango. As it does not have the role of being an additional layer of bureaucracy but an amalgamation of existing agencies it will not be a mega quango but every future administration must ensure that that does not happen.</P>
      <P>We need a new departure to deal with unemployment.  We have a minimum of 15,000 extra school leavers per annum looking for jobs.  In the Committee on Small Businesses we are doing a report on technology and it is striking that by 1990 progressively year by year in the US it is expected that manufacturing employment will come down to 6 per cent of the workforce.  Given that 33 per cent of the workforce across Europe is involved in manufacturing it shows the changes that are taking place through computerisation and different technologies that will change the face of traditional employment. Not only do we have to modify our structures dealing with labour market policies but we must improve them because the pace of change is so great.</P>
      <P>The Bill outlines the functions of NETA which is basically related to retraining, administration of all the employment schemes, work experience programmes, placement services assisting co-operatives and small enterprises and the operation of the EC free movement of worker provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like a commitment from the Minister that by 1987 we will see job centres in each county or in each administrative area.  I fully support Deputy Ahern's points in relation to regionalisation. At the end of the day we must have a centre staffed by a number equivalent to the number of placement <Col N="706" /> officers currently in the NMS.  In Wexford with a population of 100,000 people we have two placement officers in the NMS, one for the southern part and one for the northern part of the county.  I would like to see two job centres for County Wexford where somebody could walk in and put down on a central computerised register all the relevant details, the PRSI number, the PAYE number and all other State references.  They could give the job interests and aptitudes in relation to construction work, farming, hotel work and so on.  One should be able to see on a VDU the available opportunities at that time.  Employers should use that job centre to recruit because the level of recruitment taking place at present without any reference to the National Manpower Service is most disappointing. The NMS are starved of resources although, theoretically, they are the window of all this panoply of services, AnCO, CERT and other agencies. That shop window should be an integrated reference point with immediacy of contact similar to that operated in the UK where there is a daily interaction between employers and potential employees.  If there is no employment for the applicant, he or she should be offered work experience or training.  I realise that many large cogs must turn before small cogs move but that must be the unambiguous commitment of the House.</P>
    <P>We have had the 1967 Industrial Training Act and the setting up of CERT in 1963 but it is a cause for major concern that when such legislation is passed there is no subsequent accountability to the House.  Perhaps there is accountability to the Minister but there should at least be an annual or bi-annual report to the House.</P>
    <P>Neither of the speakers who contributed to the debate mentioned efficiency in relation to the existing agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are disturbing because my investigation reveals that within a half square mile of Baggot Street Bridge, 800 people are involved in the deployment of one type of manpower service or another.  Each of those people takes up approximately 300 square feet in an office which costs about £10 per square foot.  That means that approximately £2 million is tied up in expenditure of that sort.  I understand that 600 people are employed in the headquarters of AnCO in Baggot Street and that they have another office just round the corner. This is very disturbing at a time when State resources are very scarce and when there are difficulties maintaining basic payments for the least well off in the community.  These offices are lavishly carpeted and a fortune is spent on daily and other newspapers.  AnCO spent a five figure sum in this regard.  Indeed in this House, Members are supplied with free newspapers.  In these agencies there is an enormous amount of duplication, inefficiency, ineffectiveness and hidden waste under reams of glossy presentation of accounts from European Social Fund figures justifying various items.  I hope that one of the roles of the new body will be to rationalise south side offices which are of no relevance to the people they are supposed to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to underline the importance of regionalisation which was referred to by Deputy Ahern.  Not only should there be immediacy of contact in the job centres but we should have a solitary person responsible for every State employment related service in a given area.  The unit of administration should be on a county basis with a different administration for the larger areas such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  It has been proved that the most efficient unit of administration is the local authority structure of the county councils.  The manager in charge of County Wexford &mdash; or any other county &mdash; should know exactly the number of people who are employed under the various training schemes.  He should be able to put his finger on all the services provided <Col N="708" /> so that there is an integrated product for sale.  At present one agency do not know what the other are doing and there is aggressive competition in terms of the services provided.  For example, the YEA move in one direction in relation to community enterprise and the AnCO community youth training project scheme moves in another.  It is very important that the Minister be able to pick up the telephone to find out what is happening in any county at a particular time.  That is the best way to get an evaluation for future reference in relation to developing and improving schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern also mentioned the future of CERT in the new Authority. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses produced a report on tourism, catering and leisure.  No one is more enthusiastic than I in relation to the development of the tourist sector.  It has great potential, not only in terms of international growth, but in relation to obtaining a greater market share of that growth. It is the only sector which can have an employment intensity that technology will not replace and the only service industry that is wealth creating in terms of exports.  Notwithstanding that, some of the complaints made about the future of CERT under this legislation are not realistic.  I should like to quote from a statement issued by the council of CERT following a September meeting attended by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, which puts into context what the Bill is trying to achieve.  It is contained in <i>Focus</i>, a bi-monthly news letter on youth manpower issues published by the Youth Employment Agency.  It states:</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposed amalgamation of the four manpower agencies, CERT is now satisfied that it will retain its identity within the proposed National Manpower Authority.  It is also satisfied that its training programmes and services for the tourism industry will remain unchanged and that the employment and conditions of CERT staff will not be affected.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the Council of <Col N="709" /> CERT will be reconstituted within the new Authority, to whom it will report. The Council is now addressing the issues relating to the repositioning of CERT within the new Authority.</P>
    <P>CERT will continue to provide the services specific to the hotel, catering and tourism industry along the lines of its Three Year Corporate Plan published last August, many features of which are contained in the Government White Paper.</P>
    <P>The genuine desire that CERT would continue the excellent work they are doing and would in no way be hindered or undermined by this agency was laid out in stark and real terms.  I would be the first to object in this House if the role of CERT was being changed.  I have the highest regard for Mr. Leahy, the managing director, and the management of CERT.  They are a small and efficient organisation.  I would be the very first to object if the baby was being thrown out with the bath water in terms of this reorganisation and amalgamation.  They have a record second to none in terms of placement and the quality of their training which is up to export standard.  As a result, people can go abroad and gain top positions in the catering industry.</P>
    <P>The real issue, and I have to be blunt about this, is that the hotel industry are only paying £44,000 for a service which is costing £6 million to provide.  While I have every regard for the ability of any lobby group to get their way and I have particular regard for the employment-intensive nature of the hotel industry and the seasonal jobs they provide, surely some agreement can be reached on the funding which would preserve the position of the hotel industry and the services which are required without undermining the proposed changes in the structure? The council of CERT have been charged with the responsibility of procuring those services in the past and if they are satisfied, quite frankly, I am satisfied.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the levy which is very important.  The YEA levy is being turned into a manpower levy and bears no relation to age.  One of the things <Col N="710" /> which struck me as absolutely crazy when the Joint Committee on Small Businesses carried out a report on the development of small business co-ops was that under the existing YEA structure if two or three people, be they redundant or whatever, got together and wished to set up a cooperative that depended on whether they were over or under 25.  It had nothing to do with whether they could be successful or not.  It was inexplicable and could not be justified.  That microcosm gives a clear example of the need for change.  Right across every constituency any father of three who is unemployed for six years is just as deserving as any 19 year old who is one or two years unemployed. I do not think that by changing this the needs of the long term unemployed who are over 25 and the youth need are mutually exclusive.  It is time to integrate the services.  I support that change.  Later I will come to specific youth services about which I am worried under these changes.</P>
    <P>The first priority of NETA should be to aid the long term unemployed.  There is no doubt that there is a direct relationship between the employability of people and the length of period they are unemployed. The longer they are unemployed the more disillusioned and bitter they become and the more they move away from the work ethic.  They move into a particular way of life which moves from the pub to the betting office to a family situation.  I fully understand their frustrations.  I am very impressed by the people in my own constituency, whom I never thought I would see working in a fit, working today on the social employment scheme and working very successfully.  I have no doubt that their employability regardless of the duration they are on the social employment scheme has changed dramatically and their attitude to work has changed dramatically.  That must be a priority.</P>
    <P>One thing about which I am very critical is that the existing agencies have got into the numbers game in the areas of training etc.  They have tried to recruit &mdash; not in all schemes because some schemes are specifically for the disadvantaged and <Col N="711" /> it would be unfair to generalise &mdash; the people who are most likely to be recruited any way.  That raises their placement rate.  Therefore, the Minister can come into this House and say that 40,000 to 50,000 people have been put through training.  That suits AnCO and everybody else.  That says nothing for the quality of the service.  We would be doing a much better service if we targeted through the direct action programme in the White Paper the special needs of the long term unemployed even if the success rate is not 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>A hard look needs to be taken at the external training division of AnCO.  Criticism which I have made in relation to the lack of liaison between the NMS and other bodies particularly applies to the external training division.  Some people have provided an excellent service on a contract basis for trainee programmes but that is a typical area where one administrator in a county area could deal with the situation so that there would be proper correlation.  There has been a waste of money in the external training division.  They have tried to make, through the Start Your Own Business Programme, entrepreneurs out of people who have limited potential or interest in enterpreneurship and who certainly do not have the resources.  It would be far better to deal with other management programmes, which I will come to later, rather than use the wrong methods to meet the different needs of different people.</P>
    <P>I would like to see within NETA a strong R and D division.  I do not know if that is provided for in the Bill and perhaps the Minister would respond.  In every walk of life research and development is critical because of the pace of change in society.  Whether that R and D division is responsible for disseminating information on international changes which are taking place in labour market policies or for training or retraining people for sectoral industrial changes which are going to take place, it is critical that there be a strong R and D division <Col N="712" /> either in the Policy Unit of the Department of Labour or at a senior level in NETA.</P>
    <P>One aspect of NETA about which I am particularly pleased and which Deputy Ahern raised is the full time and part time nature of the executive chairmen.  I would like to say, and this is strictly non-political, that in my work on the Joint Committee on Small Businesses I came across John Lynch, the boss of the IPC. In terms of the information, advice and research he gave I found him to be of the highest calibre.  I do not think that one could have a more faithful and more enterprising public servant than Mr. Lynch to run this agency.  Because of his experience in IPC where the unions and the employers run the company he will be able to work his way through.  It is an excellent choice.  I hope however that once the permanent managerial structure is put in place it will not be top heavy. An obvious difficulty is that one has very well paid and very important jobs existing in the four State agencies.  Deputy Fitzgerald will be well aware that there is such a thing as semi-State politics with a small p in terms of career politics etc. Everybody knows this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly can be.  I can see a difficulty there.  It will require all the skills of the new executive chairmen and of the Minister to get agreement because there are wheels within wheels. I hope common sense will prevail, that at the end of the day we will not all have to compromise and that there will not be a top heavy management structure.  We can get into an endless level of consultation and this area can be filled with gobbledegook rhetoric, all kinds of concepts and so on.  At the end of the day it is all nonsense because what we need is one job centre where somebody can go and get a job.  If there is hiring and firing to be done, I hope the boot will be put in, because this needs to be done in the national interest, although I admit it is <Col N="713" /> not in the nature of the Department of Labour to think in such terms.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words about the White Paper on manpower policy.  There are some points I favour but there are certain areas to which greater attention should be given and changes made in the future.  We are dealing here with a wider concept of employment.  A striking point about this White Paper is its similarity to the industrial White Paper with the five year reviews, centralising of the pivotal policy role of the Department and so on. These steps are welcome, as is the greater co-operation between State agencies. Each Department should liaise in the area of the development of policies over a five year period so that they can develop together.</P>
      <P>The White Paper deals with a number of critical issues.  I welcome the direct action programme, the target of which are the long term unemployed.  If these people are not to be disillusioned, they must be offered an alternative opportunity when they go to the job centre.  If they are told by the officials at the job centre that even though they have gone through all the training schemes and programmes there is still no work available, that is a recipe for disaster and will embitter those people.  The direct action programme must be well thought out before it is put in place because if it is not properly presented it could be counter-productive.</P>
      <P>The transition period from school to work is identified in the White Paper. This is of critical importance because one of the first questions school leavers are asked when they apply for a job is what experience they have.  Their only experience may be work in a shop or in another unskilled area.  To get a job these young people find they must have a job.  It is a vicious circle which of their own volition they cannot overcome.  I do not know how effective the VEC schemes have been but I wish them well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the work experience programme is the best basis on which to proceed.  It is very important to bring the maximum flexibility into this programme and that the NMS are more aggressive when they are dealing with employers.  I am in favour of cutting out the abuses of &ldquo;rolling-over&rdquo; Work Experience Programme people once their six months are up because this is very disillusioning for the young people involved.  A better service must be provided because the work experience programme had one of the higest placement rates &mdash; around 70 per cent.  As long as the placement figures are so high, this programme has a great chance of success and that scheme should be developed. One drawback is that the level of payment, £34 a week, is rather low.  Many people would get more on unemployment assistance if they were not means tested. I would like to see that figure increased to £40 or £45 because young people often have to pay travelling expenses.  I would like to see this scheme made more effective because I believe the principle is excellent.  We often have change for the sake of change but minor changes in this area would be helpful.</P>
      <P>In future all recruitment to any training courses should be done through the NMS, the front line of NETA.  At the moment CERT and AnCO are involved in direct recruitment, and that should change.  I am not happy with the way the Central Statistics Office recruit.  Theoretically the CSO work through the National Manpower Service.  When an applicant applies to the CSO he is told recruitment is through the National Manpower Service, but when he contacts the National Manpower Service he is told that the service is used only as a postbox for the CSO.  This is very disillusioning because many applicants are never called for interview.  This adds to the impression that this agency is a joke and that is damaging what we are trying to do in this area.  It is important that people are called for the maximum number of interviews and that there is a proper follow-up for the people who apply for jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the point raised in the <Col N="715" /> White Paper dealing with equal opportunities. This will mean that there is a greater range of services for women.  In some areas, such as the hairdressing training programme, there is positive discrimination in favour of women.  Secretarial work is done mostly by women, and I do not say that in a sexist way, and it is important to develop services for women.  Something which does not seem very viable at first sight is the provision of creche facilities, play schools and preschools. It is in this area that I see growth in labour terms.  If my wife and I had a family and were working and wanted to hire somebody to look after our children I would get no tax relief.  I raised this matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that is not keeping the Deputy back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the election might. We will not get into that.  This area is a haven for the black economy.  It is an area we should legitimise and develop because there are many families who need creche facilities but most of those projects fail because the numbers are not maintained.  Almost every mother could do with pre-school facilities for her children, whether for one day or five days a week.  We need a positive action programme to develop that facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will turn now to areas which should be given greater attention.  The first is job sharing.  Regardless of who are in Government, there is every likelihood, given our demographic structure, our historical rates of employment creation and the likely changes that will take place in terms of automation and of fewer people being employed, that we will need to look at ways of distributing the existing workload among a greater number of people.  There are two ways of doing this, through work sharing or job sharing.  In my view work sharing does not work because it is uncompetitive, it adds to the costs of production.  But job sharing, where one splits the cost of the job, the hours of the job, and everything is split down the middle does work.  Slowly but <Col N="716" /> surely in the health services we are seeing a growth in job sharing.  But we must realise that, in the wider context, many people would be happy with half a job rather than none.</P>
    <P>There is much lip service paid to the increasing amount of leisure time we shall all have.  One way of directly stimulating that is through job sharing.  I believe that the White Paper on Manpower Policy should have addressed &mdash; in central Government-thinking terms &mdash; how we might review our social welfare system, taxation code and employment legislation, such as the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Redundancy Act, maternity protection and other things, in a way which would develop a vibrant job sharing sector throughout all sectors of employment. Aer Rianta have tried it in a small way and some other semi-State bodies also.  We have seen the evolution of career breaks and so on in the public service.  It is very important that there be some incentive created whereby people would have a higher net rate of pay out of their gross earnings on half a job then they would on a full job.  That needs to be developed or, perhaps, some system whereby they would have the same PRSI entitlements on a job sharing arrangement as they would on a full job.  Of course this costs money but it must be remembered that we are already spending huge amounts on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Another area on which Deputy Ahern touched was that of emigration.  I shall say something now which perhaps I should not and will not be popular.  Let us suppose one was a man from Mars looking at Ireland, seeing its demographic structure, envisaging in what way one could increase the level of employment for young Irish people who are bright, well educated, very employable, and who become frustrated because they do not get a job immediately, then have to take a job lower than their expectations, lose that job, go on a training scheme, get married and give up: it is a very despairing cycle.  We must be honest with our people.  We must acknowledge that the growth of our labour force is such that we have not been able to create the <Col N="717" /> jobs.  In saying that we are not throwing in the towel.  But we must realise, within an EC consumer market of 320 million people &mdash; although there are 30 million unemployed &mdash; there are great employment opportunities there partly because, in some instances, Irish people are better educated and partly because they have a genuine sound work ethic, they generally want to work.  That has been proved by generations of Irish people.  We must say to them that, in modern terms, Brussels is as near to Dublin as is Tralee in travel time, that opportunities are changing and our horizons must change.  The required birth rate on the Continent is 2.2 children, per married couple, to retain the employment and population levels.  At present the birth rate is 1.5.  That means that, leaving aside the job shedding that will happen anyway, there will be a huge employment opportunity within the EC.</P>
    <P>Of course, the first thing one is accused of when one says that is that one is exporting the problem, that one is returning to the dark days of the thirties and all the rest of it.  We must be a little more mature and realistic about this matter.  We must set out in realistic terms that there are opportunities for young people, that even if they go abroad for a short time only, they vastly improve their expertise which they can use when they come back to set up their own enterprise and add to the general national management expertise. We must realise that they are doing this country a service.  Instead of turning our backs on them &mdash; I am not contending that anybody in this House says they do not exist &mdash; or using them as a political football, we should have a positive policy not only of endeavouring to assist emigrants but of trying to liaise between NETA and corresponding employment agencies abroad, tailoring their efforts to our third level educational facilities.</P>
    <P>One of the things that appals me is the situation of people who come into my clinics having got their diploma or certificate from the regional technical college, or their BA or other degree out of university.  Take the example of an electronics diploma course or bio-chemistry, <Col N="718" /> some such course, undertaken in a regional technical college.  They will say that they have tried this or that co-operative for a laboratory technician job. They have tried this and that place; they have tried Braun in Carlow and all the big firms.  Firms put their name on file but they have no vacancy.  The first question I ask them is: how are your school colleagues getting on?  They will say that some went abroad, some did not get jobs but, at the end of the day they will say that the college did nothing whatsoever in terms of placement.  That is a basic weakness in our educational system.  There are career pamphlets, there is this that and the other but there is no direct effort made to help people find jobs.  And these people would take jobs anywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would agree with that.  I am referring particularly to the regional technical colleges.  It is as if a job does not matter, that once one has received one's certificate the game is over, they are no longer responsible, which is crazy.  NETA and this legislation are endeavouring to pick up the totally neglected problems of the Departments of Social Welfare and Education.  When we talk about rationalisation and revised structures there must be a greater awareness within those two Departments of their responsibility.  These organisations are endeavouring to pick up the tabs, the broken pieces of the employment opportunities of young people.  We want to get our act together in terms of the new information technology available, to disseminate to third level students and others details of employment opportunites arising abroad and gear our courses in education toward those future job opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area with which the White Paper on Manpower Policy might have dealt and did not, and which is of critical importance, is that of part time work.  We have a farcical situation at present.  For example, if I am on unemployment assistance, which is means tested, and my neighbour, farmer, hotelier, builder or <Col N="719" /> whoever offers me a job for three days only in a week, I am given two choices. First I can take the job, and the prospective employer may say: &ldquo;I will not be stamping your card but you can sign off for the week.&rdquo; Say I worked for 30 hours and I sign off for the week, what happens then?  I sign on the next week.  A social welfare officer comes out and asks how much I earned. Those earnings are treated as means for the following year.  It is crazy.  I have to wait six weeks before it is processed while I am on supplementary welfare allowance, being made feel like a beggar by the community welfare officer.  Any such person would be mad to sign off.  In such circumstances a person will say: &ldquo;I will take cash and I will sign on.  I will do both and break the law.&rdquo; We must realise that an element of the fraud in social welfare is occasioned by the bureaucratic and systematic rigidities of the system. The Department of Social Welfare do not see it as their job to look into this matter. The White Paper on Manpower Policy did not deal with it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Labour to give a lot of thought to a part time or casual work scheme.  I know that a pilot scheme has been introduced in Cork by the Minister for Social Welfare called the part time allowance scheme.  That represents the basis of resolving this problem.  We could pay a single person £25 a week or a married person £40 to £50 a week for 24 hours' work.  That should be done nationally in the job centres by 1 January 1987.  We could then clamp down on the people who are working and signing on because there is no justifiable reason why they should be doing so.  That way we could really get to grips with fraud.  At present there are some legitimate reasons for marginal fraud.  All of this is taking place in the black economy. We could legitimise the whole &ldquo;nixer&rdquo; system.  I hope that the White Paper on manpower and the policy reviews that are taking place will deal with this.</P>
    <P>I am glad that exports are included.  I have spoken to people who travelled to <Col N="720" /> Ireland and I have looked at studies comparing the training systems here and in the UK and there is no doubt that many of the Irish training schemes are greatly superior to any in Europe.  Credit should be given to a number of the instructors. There is potential for rationalisation in regard to AnCO.  I would give the maximum flexibility in this legislation to try to utilise any spare capacity that might arise in any of the State agencies to sell products abroad and earn money for the country.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme is referred to in the White Paper.  It will come under the auspices of NETA.  It is an excellent scheme and I have already mentioned some of its benefits. However, two things need to be looked at.  The supervision varies a lot from scheme to scheme.  In some cases this is getting the scheme a bad name.  More stringent provision is needed as regards supervision or greater resources need to be provided to pay for proper supervision. That applies equally to local authority and voluntary work.  Secondly, County Wexford was picked out as a pilot county for the social employment scheme.  Wexford County Council ran with that ball with a great verve and enthusiasm.  As public representatives, we made a great song and dance about it but the money ran out this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not go into that now.  It is very disillusioning when people <Col N="721" /> put down their names for a scheme and are then told that it has been shelved.  It would be better to say on day one that there is only enough money to cover so much and everything will be settled from the beginning.  The stop-go system does not work.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in the rates for the enterprise allowance scheme since it was first introduced in February 1984. It should be related to social welfare increases at a minimum.  People are being moved from unemployment to self-employment and they are taking risks. They deserve a little support.  I do not know why a person must be on the live register for 13 weeks to be eligible for the enterprise allowance scheme.  It is very hard to explain this to people.  Workers, such as those in Albatros Fertilisers Limited in New Ross or in National Aluminium Limited in Wexford, where there have been closures, get their P45 form when they are made redundant and they then want to set up business on their own. They do not want to be a burden on the State or to draw the dole.  Neither do they want to wait 13 weeks to set up their business.  I do not understand why that condition should be included because it is an extra cost to the Exchequer.  Many people set up businesses every year and they cannot all join the EAS but people who are genuinely made redundant and produce a P45 form should be able to take part in the scheme.  I welcome the expansion of the EAS into all sectors during the period of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The successful nature of the PRSI exemption scheme was not mentioned in the White Paper.  There were 2,000 people taken on under this scheme.  The anomalous nature of aspects of the employers' PRSI system has been referred to many times: in other words, the more people one employs the more PRSI the employer will pay.  It is a tax on jobs.  I know that PRSI should be paid and the Commission on Taxation recommended that PRSI should be paid.  It was studied by the ESRI and the NESC but nothing happened at the end of the day. I know that the Government are not making any money from PRSI.  They are <Col N="722" /> losing money on it.  Its effects should be looked at in terms of unemployment.  I would like to see that exemption continued in 1987 for a limited period to stimulate employment creation.</P>
    <P>We should develop a job card scheme in this country.  I understand that the dockers in Cork operate under a job card system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the social employment scheme and the amount of money that is being spent.  If what I hear about the amount of fraud that is going on in terms of people working and signing for the dole is only half right then there is money there.  With the job card scheme an inspector goes around to check that people have the card.  If it is in the employment exchange they will be in trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That would close down a lot of building sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already tried to ensure that only registered contractors get grants and our record in that area is good.  The more building sites of that nature that are closed down the better because that work should be done legitimately. I hope the Department of Labour can introduce a job card system which would tie in with the different employment agencies.  It would have a central number which would cover tax, social insurance and the self-employment record.  With computer technology it is possible to do that at a low cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go into my criticisms of the Department of Social Welfare except to say that they see things in a very narrow context.  I wish to deal with an area which is of concern to me and that is the small business needs.  It is very important.  I spent the best part of the last three and a half years as chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses looking at the problems of small firms and their needs.  In this context it is relevant in terms of their managerial needs.  The IMI <Col N="723" /> and so on come under the auspices of the Department of Labour and this is referred to in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Anyone who takes the time to study business performance and the output of any sector of industry will come to the universal conclusion that the success or failure of a business depends on good management and nothing else.  Whether in the plastics industry, pharmaceuticals or the construrction industry, in times of high interest rates, high inflation and bad industrial relations, there are people who will will do well and there are people who will do badly.  The characteristic of a small firm is the management structure whereby the same person is the owner, managing director, production manager and salesman.  His limitations are great.  He knows how to produce an article but he does not know how to sell it or how to deliver it on time.  That is our biggest weakness.  We must build up an indigenous manufacturing sector.  The lesson of the black hole was that foreign industry could legitimately repatriate profits abroad.  Indigenous industries are worth a lot more to us because they can only repatriate the money up the road.  They are worth a lot more to the Exchequer and the country.</P>
    <P>One of the obvious limitations of one person concerns is that they do not export.  Up to 80 per cent of small manufacturing firms do not export and I include Northern Ireland as an area for exports. That is a damning indictment of our small firm sector.  Marketing is a management function and it strikes me as peculiar that when we were studying those areas and going into developmental policies the management area did not have anything to do with the people who were charged with the responsibility of developmental policies.  Management did not have anything to do with the IDA, was not the responsibility of CTT or the Department of Industry and Commerce. It is that critical factor that will give a return on the State's investment in terms of free grants from the IDA that struck <Col N="724" /> me as crazy.  I realise the structural problems but this does not make sense.</P>
    <P>We recommended that for small companies a specific managerial developmental programme should be streamlined under the auspices of the IMI, AnCO and the IPC.  We were thinking in terms of a mini version of the IDA company development plan.  We envisaged a handful of people working in that unit to evaluate the problems in different companies, whether they were trading profitably or not.  That unit would set targets for the company and authorise assistance in hiring a marketing expert or a person to assist wherever the inadequacy was in management.  We suggested that there should be a follow-up evaluation and we were thinking in terms of the unit choosing 200 small companies annually and working through the 5,000 small manufacturing firms we have.  I accept that at the outset such a unit would make mistakes but they would learn from them.  We were disappointed that this was not addressed in the White Paper particularly when one considers the amount of work the committee put into this research.  We met the Minister for Industry and Commerce and put those points to him but he told us that they were a matter for the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>If Irish small firms are to be left to a national advisory committee that does not have proper teeth and funding &mdash; I am not saying that such an organisation would be improper &mdash; we should not be surprised if the level of liquidations and closures does not change and we should not be surprised if the appalling export record of small firms does not change. Only policy measures can be blamed if that happens.  It is recognised that in manufacturing there is a management need.  I should like to compliment AnCO on the changes they have made to meet the needs in the retail and distribution sector.  Many small retail outlets are family concerns and when they reach the third generation the chip-off-the-old-block is not as concentrated as it was and the entrepreneurship is not there.  It is important that changes are made through <Col N="725" /> night courses at the VEC's or adjuncts of the RTC system.  Those who own small businesses do not have the time to go to Dublin to attend courses.  Many of them would not understand what was going on. They need practical managerial training and assistance in areas like shop display, proper accounting systems, stock control, planning and organisation, the very rudiments of management.  I would like to see panels of retired executives and graduates being established in the Department to provide a back-up service. Many people would give help for a small amount of money.  There are many retired bankers and executives who could give help to small business in their localities.  I hope the management programme will be able to establish such panels at regional level.</P>
    <P>I would like to see all training in the construction sector put together rapidly. When we were preparing a report on the construction industry some disquieting information came to my attention about the number of apprentices and the number of placings for them.  If one was uncharitable enough one could allege many things such as bad planning in terms of supply and demand.  If the margin of error is what I heard something will have to be done about this shortly.  I hope this does not happen again.  In the construction area there is a greater need for efficiency in terms of integrating design and construction and on-site efficiency. That has not been dealt with.  I hope the national advisory committee will tackle that.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of apprentices.  The Minister will be aware of the response of the CII's manpower policy committee to his White Paper.  There is a need for an urgent review of the apprenticeship scheme as suggested in the White Paper.  We should learn from the experience of our competitors in Europe such as West Germany, Austria and Switzerland.  In West Germany 65 per cent of school leavers at the minimum age go directly into apprenticeship under indenture.  The figure in Switzerland is 75 per cent.  Those young people attend week or day release <Col N="726" /> courses at educational institutions and training centres.  In Ireland only 6 per cent of school leavers go into the same apprenticeship structure.  There are major advantages in revising our training programme by basing it on in-house training. The apprentice has a better prospect of a long term viable job and the pretence or simulation is taken out of the training centre environment.  The apprentice is given a real experience of what it is like to get on with other workers and to go through the different routines of the workers.  Such a system can be mutually beneficial in that the spare capacity in plants that may arise can be utilised.  A trainee who gets his training in a work environment rather than in a training centre has a better chance of getting a job having had real job experience.  I hope that in the discussions that are scheduled to take place those points will be considered.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the disabled who are often forgotten when training is dealt with although there is reference to them in the White Paper.  I commend the role of the rehabilitation board on their placements and on the work of their officers who try to assist disabled people. I realise we have a State quota for public service employment for the disabled but we must develop a higher preferential rate of aid for disabled people generally in the employment incentive scheme and the work experience programme.  I hope a scheme can be evolved within the NRB to bring that about.  I welcome the new role of the Department of Labour, combined with the manpower policy unit.  I hope it will bring about a certain flexibility in operations.</P>
    <P>There are two other areas I should like to refer to briefly.  I will refer first to youth aid, particularly for disadvantaged youth.  It is not so long since the social guarantee was established and I am glad to see that the structure is being maintained. It is more than a year since the liaison committee were set up to implement the social guarantee.  The manpower levy has been changed, but I hope that the youth element in the scheme will be galvanised and strengthened <Col N="727" /> and that the local liaison committees will spot early school leavers in disadvantaged areas so that they will be specifically targeted and guaranteed for monitoring for training and subsequent placement.  I hope the Minister will respond to that in some detail.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to small business co-operatives.  The Oireachtas Small Business Committee drew up a report on this.  There are urgent changes required, for instance, the need to streamline the services in one State agency which would advise on the viability of a project, and to have a one stop shop in respect of all State agencies so that there would be vetting for grant aid approval.  The committee recommended that the ICC would be the best to do that because they have a record of dealing with commercial viability and reality in business life.  The YEA had no experience of this.  This legislation is moving in a slightly different direction, and the ICC are not involved in the amalgamation provided for in the Bill.  The Minister might give further consideration to this.  We need legislation to define a co-operative and the establishment of co-operative venture funds, like the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>We need a strong body like ACOT to develop rules or a blueprint for the development of co-operatives.  Unfortunately, there are more pamphlets than co-operatives at the moment.  I hope that there will be a cohesive policy for small business co-operatives as a response to our employment problem.  It is desirable that it would be based on commercial reality rather than some nebulous suggestion that the State agency want to help, when what we need is to be cruel to be kind.  At the end of the day we should not be aiding undertakings that are doomed to fail.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a particular plea for my constituency in regard to the special facilities given to us.  I hope the pilot schemes will be continued in 1987 and that we will get as many as we can handle.  I should like to see a job centre opened in Enniscorthy.  A subcommittee <Col N="728" /> of the UDC there have made a submission to the Minister seeking an enterprise worker.  The local committee did a detailed report on job proposals in the area through the YEA and I hope the Minister will be well disposed to it.  I ask him to bear in mind that regionalisation as done by the health boards, the IDA and other State agencies would make Waterford the pivot for work in the south-east region.  That would be unfair to places like Wexford and I hope decentralisation will not occur on that basis. There is an AnCO youth training workshop in Wexford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like my party's spokesman, I will not be opposing the Bill on Second Stage but I hope that between now and Committee Stage the points made by Deputy Ahern will be borne in mind by the Minister.  I do not share some of the views expressed by Deputy Yates, though I agree with many of the things he said.  I have reservations and misgivings about this new Authority. It is important that as many Members as possible would contribute to anything that is employment related, particularly when it involves the establishment of a new State body.  Deputy Yates spoke about the danger of a new layer of bureaucracy.  I am convinced of the need for greater co-operation between our various agencies.  The National Manpower Service have made a great contribution both in difficult and in easy times but they were always without adequate resources.  I look with an envious eye at other agencies, AnCO in particular, whose employees have greater flexibility, greater perks and greater remuneration for doing a similar job. Those differences have existed between the different agencies.  AnCO have done and are still doing a great job.  We have been told that there has been AnCO over-expenditure on newspapers.  I do not know about that, but this can be a danger in a big establishment.</P>
      <P>This is one of the fears I would have about this new body, all-embracing as it is.  In reply to Deputy Ahern recently the Minister said that small is beautiful &mdash; he was referring to CERT.  I agree with him. Our experience of big bodies has not been good.  Deputy Yates spoke of accountability to this House.  That is very important.  When I was Minister I found it difficult enough to establish accountability even to the Minister.  There is a danger that some State bodies will grow into empires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the section of the Bill constituting the Authority, if a member of the Authority <Col N="730" /> is elected to either House of the Oireachtas, he ceases to be a member of that Authority.  I know this is in all similar Bills, but I think the time has come to ask ourselves if we should change.  Perhaps he should not have any remuneration if he is a member of the Authority.  But there will be public servants on that Authority, so why not a political person who is elected by and has contact with people. One reason put forward for this condition was that elected representatives might have political affiliations.  But let me give an example.  Say, for instance, Deputy Michael Bell, a former trade union official, were appointed as a representative of this Authority and were elected to this House while a member.  I would agree that his remuneration, if there was remuneration, should be stopped. But why should he not continue, if people in other walks of life can?  Perhaps the Minister would explain that.  Perhaps there are other reasons.</P>
    <P>I have a criticism which I cannot pin on the shoulders of the present holder of the office, but I must revert back to what I believe is the principal reason for the introduction of this body.  That is the establishment of the Youth Employment Agency.  When that was being set up at the end of 1981 I questioned it and felt that it would not make the contribution that it was then claimed it would.  It originated in a Labour Party manifesto; it was ill-thought out and had not been studied through.  The new Government took over on 9 March but on 8 March the chief executive of the Youth Employment Agency was appointed.  That was a bad decision and I was tempted on that occasion to scrap the whole thing except that I might do harm to some young people who might get employment as a result.  But as far as I am concerned that agency got off to a bad start.  I will not go into the uncertainties of the following weeks but within a short time rather elaborate plush offices were acquired, staff were acquired and they were all there before any schemes were introduced. That organisation grew side by side with the three that had already been there. The umbrella function that it was suggested <Col N="731" /> in the House it should have never materialised.  Here we are today introducing a Bill to try to bring in the four agencies.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to this measure despite some misgivings about it.  But CERT is entitled to a special role.  I sorry Deputy Yates has gone but I appreciate the reason he has gone and I am not being critical.  I accept the sincerity with which he made his case this morning.  But let me try to make the opposite case and I think when I make it it cannot be answered.  When I first became Minister for Labour, certain Government Departments did not look favourably on CERT. They felt that CERT should be amalgamated in some obscure way and it was not spelt out how it should be done. There were other bigger agencies who looked enviously at CERT and would have liked to gobble it up.  The Minister is lucky that the then chairman of CERT is not there now.  If the late Michael Mullen were there now and saw this section reducing CERT under this body, he would have the Minister's door knocked down many times and would force the Minister to change his mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting that I am making this case.  I hope I can.  There were problems in the organisation at that time which he, I hope with my co-operation, sorted out.  As a result we saw a complete change in direction in that organisation, a wonderful new chief executive and new dynamism.  Earlier on we were told about the necessity not to over-expend on the buildings.  I was presented with a very elaborate programme of building which I knew I had no hope of getting through Merrion Street or the Department of Finance and recommended that they do something smaller that would fill the purpose.  They did that very effectively and I was proud to open that building in Merrion Road in 1979.  I suggest to the Minister that he recommend to the Council of CERT that that <Col N="732" /> building should now be called &ldquo;Michael Mullen House&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Michael Mullen Training Centre&rdquo;, to in some way commemorate that chairman who has now gone from us.  That man who had such a commitment to and worked so hard for CERT deserves it.  After the initial problems the organisation went from strength to strength.  The hotel and catering industry will have a far greater role to play in the next 20 years than it had in the past 20 years with the expected growth in tourism between now and the beginning of the next century.  We must be prepared for that and CERT have done much in the last decade winning international respect for the standard of our chefs and the awards they have won and so on.</P>
      <P>It would be a retrograde step if that Authority lost its identity.  Regardless of what the Council of CERT has said, I speak as somebody who has had a lot of contact with the hotel and catering industry in southwest Cork and Kerry and I know they would be very disappointed if that were to happen.  I urge the Minister to re-examine on Committee Stage what he has done on this Bill.  The Minister has said &ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo;.  I fear that that organisation might be devoured.  Deputy Ahern went into more detail, but I am making a broad, more general case, This should be examined between now and Committee Stage.  If the Minister comes in with his amendment on Committee Stage we will be able to go all the way with him on the Bill.  I do not suppose the Minister can direct the Council of AnCO &mdash; I could not do it in my day &mdash; but perhaps the Minister would suggest that the centre be called the Michael Mullen Training Centre or Michael Mullen House to honour the memory of that man.  To be fair, I should say that I appointed his successor and I agonised a long time before I found somebody suitable.  He has done an equally good job in that role.  I felt at that time that somebody competent and capable would have to be a successor to Micky Mullen.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. The next concern I have about the Bill which has been referred to by both Deputy Ahern and Deputy Yates is regionalisation.  I will go further than either of those two went.  It is no fault of the Minister or the Government but every time I pass by Bord na Móna headquarters it sickens me to think that those headquarters are centred here in Dublin when they should be in Birr, Portarlington or even Roscrea.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would not object to it being in Roscrea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Roscrea would be nearer to Bord na Móna country and it is in my Euro constituency. Every time I pass those headquarters I think it is in the wrong place and I suggest to the Minister that not even this new Authority should have their headquarters in Dublin.  If he is setting up a new Authority let him base them out of Dublin. We would love to have them in Cork.  The Minister's colleague, the Lord Mayor of Cork, has been saying recently that we need a Government Department or a State agency to be based in Cork.  We would welcome that.  I hope that Cork will be the Minister's choice, but for goodness sake take it out of Dublin.  The Minister will have read more closely than I have the projections for Dublin beyond the turn of the century.  In my opinion they are terrifying, horrific and frightening. How that develoment of Dublin can be coped with I am not sure.  In other words, centralisation is going to snarl up this part of the country and the rest of it is going to deteriorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did a report recently in the EC on regional imbalances in the employment market, which of course are vast.  In the preparation of that report I visited the OECD in Paris, where, I am sure like the Minister, I made some contacts and friends in my time as Minister for Labour. I met one of the officials there &mdash; not an Irishman &mdash; who said to me almost immediately, &ldquo;What is happening in your country?  Why are your Government <Col N="734" /> becoming so centralised?&rdquo;  He was not referring to any specific Government.  Of course.  I took advantage to make my political point and to say that when I left Government as Minister for the Public Service, on my desk was a decentralisation programme that the administration of the day advised the new Government was too expensive, and it was scrapped.  The answer he made to me was that not to do it in the long term would prove far more expensive.  In drawing up that programme I met resistance from all sides.  Centralised trade union people and the permanent administration had no anxiety for it.  This must be overcome. I say to the Minister that the new Authority or agency, despite the difficulties which will be there and despite the fact that some of these Dublin based very capable and competent civil servants will give him all the explanations as to why they cannot be based outside Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of whom come from Cork and do not want to go home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They often are the worst because they seem to want to preserve an identity down there of what they left, because that is nice at holiday times.  However, wherever they come from, the Minister must resist those pressures.  To do so would be a step in the right direction.  Cork could do with this and the Minister's colleague, the Lord Mayor, has been screaming for a Government Department.  In other words, although he does not like to say it publicity, he is criticial of the Government's decision to scrap the decentralisation programme.  The new Authority should be located outside Dublin.  Bord na Móna headquarters sticks in my throat every time I see it. It is not the Minister's fault but it is a reminder of what we should be doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After that I agree with the two previous speakers on the necessity for regionalisation. This legislation, what is covered by it and all the related employment matters and so on, affect every single constituency to a greater or lesser extent. What is often forgotten by the powers <Col N="735" /> that be, as I said in this House last week on the CIE Bill, is that Cork &mdash; which I take because I know it better than anywhere else in the country such as Galway, Mayo, Kerry or Sligo &mdash; is 160 miles from Dublin.  The Beara Peninsula or Dursey Sound is another 110 miles.  That is a long way away.  They are too often forgotten. Other Deputies in this House can go north west or south west and give other examples.  There must be regional development, and on how it is to be done I am open to discussion.  Deputy Ahern has mentioned the two extreme ways by which it can be done, a social welfare grouping of offices or alternatively in the health board areas.  We must have regionalisation into the different counties and this provision must be built into the Bill because if we do not build it in here in this House the chances are that, despite the best intentions in the world, when it leaves this House somebody somewhere will say that regionalisation is not important any more, and it will die.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the functions of the Authority and they are all very important. I have referred to CERT, and I want the Minister to remember my recommendation to the council of CERT that the building in Roebuck be called after Michael Mullen.  Section 4(1) (e) (iii) of the Bill refers to &ldquo;services consisting of the provision of guidance, advice and information in respect of choice of career and employment&rdquo;.  I am very supportive of that being carried under the Authority because we have complained so often of the need for links between industry and education and between education and employment.  I hope that paragraph emphasises the need for the Authority to get into education. We talk about politics &mdash; with a small p. I am not talking about semi-State but about the politics between Government Departments which can be very difficult too.  I hope that the Minister when replying on Second Stage will confirm that this Authority will be enabled to co-operate with the schools and co-ordinate the career guidance levels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the internal <Col N="736" /> market, its size and our being there by 1992 and having about 320 million people to sell our wares and products to.  We must take full advantage of that, and that is why I compliment AnCO on the Louvain project.  I am given to understand that recent statistics show that, while the teaching of the French language is on the increase in our schools, the numbers learning German are going down.  That is wrong and must be tackled immediately.  We cannot hope to penetrate that new internal market to our best advantage without having good, highly trained Irish people with a commitment to selling Irish goods going in there with knowledge of the language that makes them competent to sell those goods in those countries without foreign agents.  Agents have been very useful. They have helped us over the years, but for too long we have been lazily dependent on an English speaking market.  CTT have done their part in language marketing skills and in our time in Government we allocated a sum of money to help them with that project.  The AnCO project in Louvain is a step on the right road but we need more of that.  That is why it is very important that this body be able to say to Education, &ldquo;The numbers in German are going down.  Why is that? Why is there not an bigger increase in the number of people learning French?&rdquo;  We must encourage people involved in tourism to become proficient in continental languages so that when tourists come here they can feel at home and able to communicate with us.  Will the Minister let me know in his reply if this Authority will have power to help in this area?</P>
    <P>There is not a reference to social welfare in the functions outlined here.  Perhaps I have skipped over it but in his reply will the Minister let me know if this Authority will be able to find out exactly what is happening in social welfare exchanges so that there will be proper liaison with the social welfare officers?</P>
    <P>I could be very critical of the failure of this Government in the job creation area. The areas most important to us at the moment relate to taxation and employment but they are not being tackled in a <Col N="737" /> positive forward way by the Government. A lot remains to be done.  I hope this Bill will improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The YEA have not achieved much. Many of their projects have been unsuccessful and wasteful.  The projects have helped some communities but all the responsibility cannot be laid on the shoulders of the YEA.  The YEA got off to a bad start and they could not have shown a different result.  The need for this Authority is largely because of the lack of thought and of research and development that went into creating the YEA.  If this new agency can improve things it will be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>AnCO provides a wonderful success story.  They have grown enormously but, as a previous speaker said, they are overcentralised. I appreciate the needs of the greater Dublin area but even in my days in Government there was a reluctance among the permanent Civil Service to move north of the Liffey.  Regionalisation even within Dublin city was confined and the River Liffey divided the thinking of many people.  Even when office accommodation was very expensive on the south side and cheaper on the north side it was difficult to get people to move to the north side.  That mentality will stifle all that this Bill and other Acts set out to do.  We are slowly strangling and depriving the rest of the country.  One of the things we constantly preach in the EC is the importance of the regional fund. When Dublin city can qualify for the same assistance under that regional fund as the remotest area in west Cork or Kerry, our own regional development will not occur and centralised government will go on.  That must be changed.</P>
    <P>AnCO are a success story and they provide a high standard of skill and training for many young people.  I compliment them on their efforts.  Times are hard and there are many young apprentices in the building trade whose apprenticeships have been interrupted.  AnCO do their best but they cannot absorb all of them. The Louvain project was a great venture and I was proud to visit it during my time as a Member of the European Parliament and to be shown the work that AnCO did <Col N="738" /> in that Irish college.  This project gave young people the opportunity to learn the language and customs of the Belgium people as well as an opportunity to learn the skills of the building trade.  That is a great thing.  I support in this Bill the encouragement to do consultancy training services abroad.  Having been to some of the new member states I am satisfied that AnCO's expertise will be very useful.  It is very important that this Bill encourages us to become involved in that area.  I visited a part of Spain where we were taken to see some industries and the need for training was very obvious as was the need for safety.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service have had many difficulties.  They were a very commited group and I want the Minister's assurance that there will not be redundancies among them and that they will not suffer loss or be forced to move. The Bill will remove some of the divisions but it will not remove all the tensions. It is important that this agency try to eliminate divisions.  It will not be easy.  I would not suggest a person to be appointed as chairman but I support Deputy Ahern's contention that it should be a full time appointment.  The job demands that.  The job will entail a lot of negotiating and a lot of compromise and the success or failure of this agency could depend on it.  A dedicated person will have to try to pull strings together &mdash; strings which will not willingly come together.</P>
    <P>I have a very high regard for civil servants but in 1981 and 1982, when three elections were held, some civil servants felt they were in charge.  I exempt the two people at present in the House from my criticism.  It was a frame of mind which developed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but the Minister should not fall into this trap until he hears what I have to say.  A colleague of the Minister attended a lunch with good, committed Cork industrialists <Col N="739" /> and they were humiliated by not being introduced by name or by reference to their companies to foreign industrialists because confidentiality had to be preserved.</P>
      <P>CERT should be given their own identity outside the new Authority and I will put down amendments in this regard on Committee Stage.  They are closely linked to hotels and trade unions and their governing council cannot be improved upon.  Placement and industrial training is a more general area but hotel and catering generally is a completely different area which is related to a specific industry.  The growth of industrial catering is very important but the tourist industry is even more important.  Our weather is not ideal from the point of view of the holidaymaker but we have other attractions such as golf, fishing, shooting and forestry plantations.  We should be able to sell these amenities to the potential 320 million people who could be attracted here.  I am satisfied there is a vast market to tap and that CERT have a major role to play.</P>
      <P>I was very glad to read in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> this morning that at last a ferry is to be provided although the Government cannot claim any credit for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be too complimentary after four years but I am glad there is good news at last about the ferry as it will help to develop an industry which, for many reasons, has suffered over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister give an assurance that no employees will be affected in any of the existing agencies as a result of setting up this new Authority?  He should also ensure that there is accountability to the House.  The Minister should not be rebuffed by the Department of Education because I can give examples of schools where pupils have to select languages to study for the leaving certificate. However, some schools do not have <Col N="740" /> enough teachers for certain languages which is very disheartening for the pupils. Education should be more closely linked to our potential development in industry and where the jobs will be available.  It is quite in order to have someone from the Department of Education on the Authority but it can create problems because there may be a little tension when that person is defending the Department's policies.</P>
    <P>I again want to emphasise that there should be decentralisation.  However, this can be discussed on Committee Stage because it is very important to have a good Bill.  If the Minister gives satisfactory replies to my questions there will be no problems with this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the Bill as I have been looking forward to its introduction. It is no secret that Deputy Ahern has been calling for the consolidation of the various agencies within the manpower services.  Indeed, he published findings some time ago which underlined that fact.</P>
      <P>I was not here when the Minister was speaking but I read a copy of his speech. I wish to refer to CERT but I do not want to overlook the many fine points in the Minister's speech and the general thrust of the legislation.  It makes sense in a general rationalisation and tidying-up operation to gather together the various agencies which are trying to find jobs and to train people and to disseminate information throughout the country on a regional basis.  I am being parochial in saying I hope Athlone will be one of the designated regions as we already have a major centre for AnCO and a very strong NMS office.  Athlone is ideally placed to take in catchment areas from a great many counties and, as the structures are already there, I hope that the curriculum unit of the Department of Education will be based there also, if the Minister for Education has his way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to be constructive about the various agencies involved.  I am sure that most public representatives must have <Col N="741" /> had dealings with AnCO over the years. They have been very active and correct in the way they have gone about providing employment.  I am always struck by the liaison they have with the National Manpower Service.  That area is particularly productive.</P>
    <P>Due to a lack of forecasting knowledge AnCO have sometimes mounted courses which have not been of relevance to the job market or have often provided courses for which there are no future job opportunities. They are now much more precise in this regard.  Many industries in the machinery line &mdash; again I am talking about the Athlone area &mdash; now seek a young person with a proven AnCO certification. I hope that that preciseness will continue.  It should be at its optimum in this type of regional board where there will be closer liaison with local agencies. While each of the separate agencies have been excellent to a greater or lesser degree or have faults to a greater or lesser degree, they have suffered from being within their own parameters and they have not been able to reach out to other agencies.  I hope AnCO will continue along the path they have been following with regard to the back-to-work scheme for women and will continue to promote women throughout their career structures and will take on more women as trainees in their various courses.</P>
    <P>It is alarming to note that the number of women taking part in these courses is very low.  I am not blaming AnCO for that.  The fault lies in the educational system.  Deputy Fitzgerald touched upon the fact that the take-up by young women of subjects which appear to be outside the traditional area has been very low. Great emphasis will have to be placed on that fact because the traditional job market has contracted particularly in the secretarial area.  I get increasinly angry when between 30 and 40 young women who have just finished school tell me that they are going to do a secretarial course. The increase in office technology and techniques has meant that the market for secretarial skills is diminishing greatly. <Col N="742" /> Yet, more and more women are doing secretarial courses now with the vague idea that at the end of that course they will obtain an office job which is clean and comfortable and pressure free and which will lead to something very safe. As the market has contracted, those jobs are not there for young women.  I hope that this agency will aggressively and actively attack those assumptions and disturb the complacency of teachers, parents and young people who still think that after the years of recession that the Civil Service or safe office job with a pension is still there for the taking.  Those days are long gone.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Fitzgerald who said there was a bias against language courses in second level schools.  That has resulted because of the cutbacks in education which were made at the end of 1982.  Since that time if a teacher leaves, dies, gets ill or moves away, the principal cannot replace that teacher.  Post-primary or secondary schools cannot replace that teacher.  Therefore, the principal is faced with the problem of changing about the choice of subjects to comply with the decreased number of teachers.  If girls have the skill or the IQ necessary they should study a subject like honours maths.  This subject is very important for later development in the chemical or engineering industries.  Classes in honours maths, the science subjects, woodwork and languages have had to be restricted except in community and comprehensive schools.  Secondary and vocational schools have not been able to cope with the fall-off in teacher numbers. That is the reason classes in German and other subjects have not been held.  Only 4.6 per cent of leaving certificate students took German in 1985.  That is an appallingly low number.  Deputy Yates mentioned that our job market was now Europe because of the declining birth rate in those countries.  As a result, learning the languages of those countries will become more important.  No longer should French be the mandatory subject to be studied.  German and Spanish should be also taught.  The latter has <Col N="743" /> become the fastest growing language in the Community.</P>
    <P>AnCO in their new format should adopt an aggressive approach with regard to the recruitment of women into their training courses.  They should consider the relevance of the type of courses they provide.  We cannot afford superfluity of courses in areas where there will not be jobs in the future.  Our training courses will have to be geared towards the economic wants of the country or the markets we are seeking to enter.  Three or four years ago it would have been quite acceptable for one to do a course for which there did not seem to be a market but we cannot afford that any longer.  We have to concentrate on courses where the openings will be.</P>
    <P>AnCO have been a proven success.  I saw a survey recently which showed that the uptake of AnCO students into jobs is very good.  If there was follow-up would it show whether that uptake was of a lasting quality?  Did those courses enable the participants to move from one area of job opportunity to another?  From my own knowledge, and it is quite extensive within the Athlone area as we have a major centre, I know that the National Manpower Service have been doing a good job, sometimes in very bad circumstances. The new agency is to be called NETA.  There were many objections to the terminology.  It was one area where people accepted the word &ldquo;manpower&rdquo; to mean person power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a more accurate description of the title.  It includes the word &ldquo;employment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Manpower Service have suffered greatly from the provision of technology in the carrying out of their duties.  I shudder to think what Dublin must be like where huge numbers pass through the agency daily.  Even in Athlone which services Mullingar and other areas a large number of people come to be registered.  Their cases have to be followed up and they have to be sent for interviews for particular jobs.  To provide that service <Col N="744" /> demands very sophisticated technology. I have found that the personnel in the manpower offices are very committed to their jobs and try to do their best in very difficult circumstances.  If there is only one job it is very difficult to deal with 50 or 60 people who are looking for that job.  These manpower officers will gain by being in daily contact with the other agencies and co-ordinating their activities. I hope that in this streamlining the NMS will retain their very excellent personnel, particularly the youth placement officers.</P>
      <P>In the Athlone area one officer was designated as the youth placement officer.  Anybody under 25 years of age looking for advice or for a job went to see him.  Young people leaving school could attach themselves to the youth placement officer in Athlone because he was sympathetic to their aspirations.  We were very lucky in Athlone because we had a very dedicated officer.</P>
      <P>I viewed with a little alarm the removal of the word &ldquo;youth&rdquo; form the youth employment levy and hoped this did not mean there would be less emphasis on youth.  For many years to come there will still be a great need for emphasis on youth training schemes, youth employment, youth placement and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the NMS go more into schools.  With the Youth Employment Agency they have been engaged on the social guarantee scheme and the schools have co-operated in this venture. But in this new format I want to see the agencies becoming more public and breaking down the barriers between education and work-training.  I realise I should not be saying this because sometimes people in education feel that education is their area, and that classrooms are to instil educative values in young people.  That will never change because the values of education remain constant. Appreciation, knowledge, worth and personal development will always be the mainstay of education.  Young people leaving school know that the world is changing and there should be a balance between opportunity and training and information about the world outside <Col N="745" /> school.  I do not think education should be divorced from the outside world.  I would like to see a more workmanlike relationship between the new agency and the school authorities, not just the comprehensive and vocational sectors but the secondary system as well.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there was the schools-industry linked scheme in which I participated as a teacher.  Deputy Tom Nolan was Minister at the time, and Athlone and Finglas, Dublin, were the two centres chosen for the pilot scheme. That was a very useful scheme because not alone did the career guidance teacher volunteer to go on the committee, but a notice was put on the board in my school that if any other teacher wanted to go on this committee, she would be very welcome.  I joined that committee and found it very helpful.  It broke down barriers between parents, industrialists, workers, teachers and students.  I never saw an evaluation of that schools-industry link.  As a committee we ceased after about two years but we carried out a series of pilot programmes.  I am talking about 1979-80 when the world was still full of golden opportunities.  When I became a Member of this House I put down a parliamentary question asking if the results of that scheme had been evaluated. The reply I got was that it had not been evaluated.  I believe there should be a strengthening of that schools-industry link and I would like to see that happen.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the work done by the Youth Employment Agency.  Of course they have had their failures.  Anything worth its salt will have a fair share of failures because new ideas may, of themselves, evoke hostility, sometimes outright resistance and, at best, a hesitancy of response.  In some areas these ideas proposed by the Youth Employment Agency have been ideological and innovative and some of them have even been a success, but I want to talk about their input into the education field.  I had not been spokesman on Education very long when I was invited to launch school videos which had been made by a committee of the YEA in conjunction with guidance councillors.  The Department <Col N="746" /> seconded a serving teacher to work with this committee, which was composed of representatives of ICTU, guidance counsellors and young people involved in the Youth Employment Agency.  They made more than two dozen educational videos that were geared towards the 15 to 18 age group and which showed the world at work.  These films were very informative and useful.  There were two basic films. The first told students how to prepare for an interview and the second identified the various agencies and what the agencies could do for young people.  Obviously that film will have to be updated.  The message in these films was extraordinarily simple because they immediately clarified for me problems I come across regularly at my clinics.  When young people come to me asking about jobs I ask them if they have been to the NMS and put down their names.  I tell them they must keep going back there and keep in touch and I ask them how they dress when going for interviews. That video answered all these questions. It gave sound, sane advice.  The message was that young people should go after jobs, the jobs do not come to them, that young people must get training and keep looking for jobs and that there are agencies there to help them, but young people in school are not being told about such agencies.</P>
    <P>People may say there are guidance councillors in most schools nowadays, but there has been a reduction in those numbers regrettably because of cutbacks.  I commend these officers for their work on the committee which produced these videos.  These officers may have been reluctant to get involved in the beginning, but those I have spoken to are very pleased with the results because they realise these films enhance their role rather than diminish it.  There is need for much more to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>Career guidance officers and guidance councillors were first employed at a time when girls were prepared for the Civil Service, a profession or a safe office job. At that time there was an immediate place for the school leaver, but that is not so any longer.  The emphasis must change <Col N="747" /> and the role of the guidance counsellor must change too.</P>
    <P>It would be one of my wishes that career guidance counsellors would have their role evaluated, that they would see all of what I have mentioned as an enhancement of their role, as a sort of step-up-the-ladder for them.  In many schools now they are devoting some hours to counselling and some to teaching. I should like to see that role expanded into the general teacher body. It should be remembered that every teacher in a post-primary school, faced with a class of 30 to 40 pupils, becomes a guidance counsellor or a life skills counsellor. They are there to teach English, French, history, chemistry or mathematics but they are there also to advise and guide their pupils on many aspects of life which arise in the course of their work and some subjects lend themselves to that.</P>
    <P>This kind of guidance activity should be extended into the broader school curriculum affording second-level teachers that opportunity by way of their mediation skills.  I should like to see inservice courses for teachers so that they would be able to utilise their mediation skills, thereby expanding their everyday role.  Those videos and the deliberations giving rise to them have had an enormous impact on inculcating into young people a practical appreciation of the outside world and how they should cope with it. I do not know whether the work of that committee is continuing &mdash; I am sure they are not sitting back &mdash; but have taken up other activities.  I would hope they would continue that type of work because it is dependent on constant research into changing work patterns not alone here but throughout the world.  That kind of activity should be ongoing, should be the subject of constant research and remain an integral part of the Youth Employment Agency when it is subsumed into the new NETA.  I hope I shall not be spokesperson on Education for this party much longer; in other words, I hope there will be a general election.</P>
    <P>I have always been interested in this <Col N="748" /> area throughout my years of teaching and because of my industrial background growing up in Athlone.  Education should not be threatened by a spill-over from any agency.  Those agencies must now have a public face in the marketplace, display their wares, say what they are about and are doing.  If that is done openly between the Departments of Education and Labour it can only be to the good of young people which is what we are all about.  There is a need to make education generally more relevant to the outside world.  Indeed there is an important Bill in the offing &mdash; the National Board for Curriculum and Assessment Bill, 1986 &mdash; which it is hoped to give a Second Reading to in the House next week.  Its provisions intertwine with many of those contained in this one.  It proposes a broadening of the curriculum, continuing research and development into the world of learning and a link-up with the various agencies.  Therefore it is timely that these two Bills are before the House.  Indeed the two Ministers who produced them are to be commended.</P>
    <P>I want to talk now about CERT.  The Minister will know what I have to say. No doubt he has heard the same from other speakers and will hear it repeated as our debate continues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that comment.  Here again I feel implicated in the educational sense.  That is why I am gearing what I have to say more toward the educational aspect than any other.  We all know that CERT has been a great success.  Of course, the other agencies have also, to a greater or lesser extent.  CERT is unique in that, first, its name is identifiable.  I hazard a guess that if one went out into Kildare Street, stopped three people in a row and carried out one's own opinion poll asking them what is CERT, they would say it has something to do with hotels, with training young people for jobs in the hotel industry. They would know immediately what it meant, and that is some achievement. <Col N="749" /> I have followed the activities of CERT since their inception.  I remember when my family owned a hotel, the Hudson Bay Hotel in Athlone, and when my father was a Deputy we participated in one of the first CERT training schemes for students.  At that time those courses were carried on in the Great Southern Hotels in places like Bundoran and further north.  Would the Minister think about taking his hands off CERT, leaving them a separate identity, because they have been a success not just nationally but internationally as well.</P>
      <P>It can be said that the White Paper on Manpower Policy published in September last successfully addressed all of the relevant manpower issues and their relationship to education over the past 23 years.  That is some time to have been in existence and to have gone from success to success.  CERT have a record of innovation, having adopted an enlightening approach to all of their activities.  In particular they are to be complimented on the way they have co-operated with the existing educational establishments and maintained an educational component in all of their courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the links between CERT and the VEC educational system date back to 1963 when CERT took on an unplanned system and developed it within the educational system.  Now there are CERT students in seven colleges throughout the country, some 2,000 of them, grant aided, with a 100 per cent job placement record.  I am now talking about the third level sector.  I shall come to second level and the vocation preparation and training programmes in a moment.  It does not make any sense to interfere with a system which has met with such success.  CERT has been the result of years of careful planning.  They have never operated outside the educational sphere, have never duplicated existing VEC facilities.  I wish the same could be said of other agencies. As we know, they have their national craft curricula and their certification board which took over the City and Guilds very successfully, and have been <Col N="750" /> recognised for so doing.  The board represent the ideal model for integrating education and training, all of which is relevant to what I am saying.</P>
    <P>The CERT formal training activity for school leavers is undertaken within the VEC system and avoids duplication.  It also ensures regionalisation about which we spoke earlier.  It guarantees an educational dimension in training programmes, demonstrating the longstanding, co-operative relationship between them.  They have also taken on board the transition of pupils from educational establishments to working life, a dominant theme in the White Paper. They were the real forerunners of the vocation preparation and training courses, their model proving to be the formula for the later development of those programmes.  I would have a word of warning in general about the VPT courses because, with the intake of other countries into the EC, the moneys to be devoted to these courses will diminish. Therefore we should be thinking of other ways of offsetting that shortfall.</P>
    <P>CERT were also the first of the manpower agencies to introduce into their full time courses the important personal development programme of social and life skills.  As I have said, all of the CERT courses do not just cover the basic skills necessary for such development but have a component, liberal arts stream.  It would be very wrong if that important element of NETA were to be removed.</P>
    <P>There is so much more I could have said.  I want to compliment the Minister on the social employment scheme.  The Minister knows from the personal dealings I have had with him that I consider that scheme to have been very innovative and expertly handled by the National Manpower Service.  Long may it continue. I hope the Minister will receive the necessary finance for next year and that the numbers will increase from 10,000 to 30,000, disregarding what Deputy Yates said about getting hung up on numbers.</P>
    <P>I commed the Bill but I would ask the Minister to exclude CERT because they have been too much of a success to be subsumed and lose their identity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions in this House, the policy of the Government is that the closure of cross-Border roads and bridges is counter-productive both politically and in terms of security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate the significance of Lackey Bridge and the inconvenience its removal has caused to people residing in the locality.  I have frequently raised the question of Lackey Bridge with the British authorities, whose co-operation would be required if this cross-Border bridge were to be reconstructed; in their response they have referred to the security problems which would arise if this <Col N="752" /> crossing point was again restored.  I will continue to raise this matter with the British authorities with a view to a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is a permanent British army presence 200 yards from the bridge? It would not be a threat to security to have the bridge open as all traffic has to pass that army checkpoint.  It is ridiculous that the army presence is there where there is no crossing.  It has seriously inconvenienced farmers and business people over the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Leonard said about the inconvenience, particularly to the people of Clones.  I met the traders in Clones on two occasions about this matter.  I take the point that I got from both deputations which I met that there is a British army presence on the far side of what was the bridge.  For that reason there should not be a security problem.  I said this to the British authorities on a number of occasions without, I am sorry to say, success in having the bridge reopened.  I will continue to press to have Lackey Bridge reopened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point worth bringing to the notice of the British authorities.  Members of the EC Social and Economic committee visited the Border regions and accompanied them across that footbridge and around that area.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the qualification required to act as (a) Irish Consul and <Col N="753" /> (b) Irish Consul-General, abroad; if he will undertake a review of all such appointed persons to ensure that those holding such appointments have the maximum knowledge of modern Ireland and are geared to the greatest possible degree towards promoting Ireland, its needs and to representing its citizens abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the position regarding honorary consuls as opposed to the career civil servants who staff our Irish consulates abroad.  The functions of honorary consuls are to provide basic consular services in return for a nominal honorarium and a proportion of any consular fees they may collect.  They are themselves expected to bear the costs of providing staff time and premises.  The officers in question are not carrer civil servants and they have no diplomatic role.  The consular functions of such officers relate mainly to providing consular documents or certificates, accepting applications for Irish visas, helping or advising Irish citizens in emergencies, providing certain passport services, and similar matters.</P>
      <P>When candidates for the post of honorary consul are being considered special attention is paid to the person's overall suitability, the closeness of their links with Ireland, their standing in the community, the extent of their knowledge of local conditions and connections, and whether they have suitable accommodation from which to operate as honorary consul.</P>
      <P>On appointment an honorary consul is sent a full set of instructions on the provision of consular services to Irish citizens together with general requisites of their offices.  They are provided with information material on Ireland and receive on a regular basis the publications of my Department.  They are briefed by my Department on their visits to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would stress that honorary consuls can, and do, provide routine up-to-date information material on Irish conditions and many can also provide <Col N="754" /> useful contact points for those interested in business dealings with Ireland. However such appointments are made primarily with a view to providing consular services on an honorary basis for our citizens abroad.  I am satisfied that the primary aim of the system is achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I ask the Minister if he is happy with the situation which allows a great variance in the performance of Irish consuls and consul-generals abroad?  Many of them would not even be able to pronounce the name of this House.  Will he agree that people meeting these consuls abroad look on them as representatives of the Government and State of Ireland?  Will he ensure that they have at least a minimum knowledge of modern day Ireland so that we do not have the sort of embarrassing situation which Members of this House witnessed where a consul told a member of a foreign Parliament that women were still being arrested daily for bringing in contraceptives at Kings Bridge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would imagine, given the fact that these are honorary consuls, some of them have been in that position for a great number of years.  They vary in nationality and in background.  They are appointed to very many countries all over the world and in some cases there are a number of those people in the one country.  There is bound to be a variation of performance in those circumstances. It might be a little bit of an exaggeration, and I am sure Deputy Mitchell will agree, to say that many of them could not pronounce the name of this House.  I do not know which honorary consul is the subject of the anecdote which he has just related.  If he gives me that information I will look into it.  There might have been a change in that location recently but I am not sure whom he is referring to.  In a system like this where people are not paid, they are there because they are of Irish ancestry, and many of them were born in Ireland &mdash; I know of one case where a man is married to an Irish woman &mdash; there is bound to be variation in the level of commitment to the job and the <Col N="755" /> ability of people to absorb material which is sent to them about Ireland.  There is bound to be variation in the enthusiasm and energy with which they pursue their role as honorary consuls.  The ideal situation would be that we would have career civil servants in every country in the world but we must cut the cloth to suit the measure.  We just cannot afford that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that there is at least one Irish consul who cannot pronounce the name of this House.  Many people who hold the office of Irish consul and Irish consul-general certainly operate at a high level and are very competent and very able.  Will the Minister take steps to ensure that all those holding the office know the minimum about modern day Ireland.  If they have been out of the country for a long time steps should be taken to update their knowledge and to brief them on what is happening in the Ireland of the twentieth century.</P>

If they visit this country they are brought into the Department and given a thorough briefing on modern day Ireland.  I am always glad to get comments from those who come into contact with honorary consuls, whether they are criticisms or praise.  In the case of criticisms we could do something about it to see what is the point of conflict and in the case of praise it would be useful to pass it on to the honorary consuls themselves.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if a submission has been made to the British authorities for the annual review of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 1984; if he will state the Government's attitude towards this Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>No figures are available for the number of people, whatever their nationality, who are stopped, questioned or searched under the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Britain.  The numbers of people detained in connection with terrorism in Northern Ireland have shown a steady decline since 1979 when 857 people were detained. In 1984, 159 people were detained; in 1985, 194 people were detained; and this year 182 people had been detained up to 30 September.  I would point out that since March 1984 the Act no longer refers exclusively to terrorism in connection with Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that the possibility of abuse of powers and of discrimination against Irish citizens is inherent in the PTA legislation and in consequence, I make representations concerning the scope and method of operation of the Act to the British Government on a regular and ongoing basis.  These representations have been aimed at ensuring that the legislation is applied in an equitable manner and that abuses are avoided.  The measures necessary to defend lives and property from IRA and other terrorists violence in Britain are a matter for the British Parliament and Government.</P>
      <P>Steps have been taken to appraise the British Government of the Government's views concerning the PTA in the context of the annual review now being conducted by Lord Colville.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of Irish citizens have been detained for long periods before being brought to trial?  Is he aware of the <Col N="757" /> increase in the number of PTA arrests and the number of Irish citizens being stopped, searched and questioned under that Act?  For example, in 1985 55,000 people were arrested under the Act while in 1984 the figure was 47,000.  Will the Minister agree that the operation of the PTA is an issue of priority given the lack of response to demands for justice in the Guildford four and Annie Maguire cases? The Minister mentioned the annual review of the Act and I should like to know if he is aware that the debate in the British Parliament has been brought forward to February, something that has taken people by surprise?  Is the Minister aware that submissions have to be made to Lord Colville not later than tomorrow due to other commitments by that individual? Has the Minister made any submissions to Lord Colville?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we made a submission about a fortnight ago.  The Irish Ambassador in London went with a long submission to Lord Colville on the renewal of the PTA which, as the Deputy said, will come up in February for debate. Lord Colville's report must be with the British Government in mid-January. With regard to the figures quoted by the Deputy I should like to state that I am not sure how anybody can compile such figures.  I am aware of where the Deputy got the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know where the Deputy got his figures from but I cannot see how anybody can authoritatively compose figures of those who were stopped and searched but not detained.  It does not seem possible to be able to do that.  I accept that the figures quoted by Deputy Andrews have been published. The point about the PTA is that every democracy has to introduce legislation to protect itself against violance and the British Government have done that.  We have Acts on our Statute Book that have the same aim.  I am concerned to see <Col N="758" /> that the Act is not used against the Irish community in Britain, the vast majority of whom are extremely good citizens and law abiding.  I am concerned to see that the Act is not used as a trawl to gather in Irish people on an information-seeking basis.  We have expressed that concern to the British Government in regard to the PTA.  There have been improvements in its operation in recent years and it no longer exclusively applies to those engaged in violence in the North of Ireland.  However, a number of matters concern us.  One is that a person detained under that Act can be held in communicado for 48 hours.  We have a much more liberal regime in that regard.  I should like to add that we do make very strong and lengthy representations about the Act and we have done so to Lord Colville who is reviewing it, always recognising the right of a democracy to introduce laws to defend itself against terrorism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the nine cases brought to the attention of the British Commission, people who were arrested and detained under the PTA and released after periods ranging from four to 15 months in custody when they were declared innocent of vague conspiracy charges?  Do such occurrences worry the Minister?  Will the Minister explain the attitude of the Government to the renewal of the Act particularly in view of the lack of response by the British authorities to the cases of the Maguire family, the Guildford four and the Birmingham six, people who have served more than ten years in jail in Britain?  In that context does the Minister feel that the PTA should be renewed?  Have the Government a policy on that?  Are they for or against its renewal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my reply I outlined the Government's position on this.  We recognise the right of democracies to defend themselves against terrorism. I do not think there is a direct relevance between the Maguire, Guildford <Col N="759" /> and Birmingham cases to the PTA although I understand why the Deputies should mention them.  With regard to the other nine cases I should like to state that one of our early concerns about the operation of the PTA was that so many were detained under it and so few charged.  We were concerned that so many people were being brought in, held and released without being charged.  That has changed; fewer people are being brought in and a higher percentage of those taken in are being charged.  The Act is operating in the way we would expect it to.</P>

Without being critical of the Chair I must point out that the Chair ruled out a question of mine on the Birmingham six, the Guildford four and the Annie Maguire case on the basis that they had been raised a number of weeks ago but I must point out that there is serious concern about the lack of progress in coming to a resolution about those cases.

The Irish Ambassador made representations on behalf of the Irish Government along the lines of the statements I made in the House, that the Act should not be used to trawl in Irish people and where people are brought in and detained they should have charges preferred against them, if that is what the police have in mind.  We expressed our concern that under the Act people can be kept <i>in communicado</i> for 48 hours which would not be the case here.  We have been making the same case with some success over the years and I hope we will have more success this year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the limited sanctions against South Africa agreed by the EC in September 1986, have yet been fully implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The 12 member states of the European Community agreed on 16 September last to take further restrictive measures with regard to South Africa.  These consisted of decisions to ban new investment in South Africa and the importation into the Twelve of iron, steel and gold coins from South Africa.</P>
      <P>On implementation, the EC Foreign Ministers took an immediate decision to suspend the import of iron and steel in the framework of the ECSC Council with effect from 27 September.  The modalities regarding the bans on gold coins and new investment took slightly longer to arrange.  A Council regulation banning the importation of gold coins from South Africa was adopted on 27 October, at which time also Foreign Ministers of the Twelve approved a proposal to ban new investment through action to be taken by individual member states.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank has been apprised of the measures taken with regard to new investment in South Africa and the import of gold coins from that country and has arranged to refuse all applications for new direct investment in South Africa and for approval for payment related to the importation of gold coins from South Africa until further notice.  The Revenue Commissioners have also acted to ensure that no gold coins are imported privately and without payment.  All imports of steel are subject to the issue of surveillance documentation issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and since the September decision no documents for imports of South African steel apart from exceptions provided for under the ECSC decision have been issued.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not <Col N="762" /> think strange the alacrity with which the EC agreed on sanctions against Syria compared with their reluctance to take sanctions against South Africa?  Would the Minister agree that the withdrawal by Barclay's Bank and other private firms with major investments in South Africa puts the efforts of the EC to shame?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The withdrawal of the bank and of another firm announced this morning, show up the EC for not having moved very fast or far, despite urging by this and other countries that we go further.  As I said when I last answered questions here on this subject, consensus is essential in these matters. Once we agree, we cannot move without consensus, this means that the EC will move only at the speed of the most reluctant of its partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to open a passport office in Cork in January 1987. From the outset, the office will advise personal and telephone callers on passport matters and will accept and check applications for transmission by special courier to the Passport Office in Dublin which will continue to be the main passport issuing office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is imputing that there is a direct link between the opening of the passport office in Cork and emigration.  If that were so, the highest number of passports issued in the country's history would have been during the Deputy's period in this office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>To commemorate the UN International Year of Peace a programme of projects and activities was prepared by my Department in co-operation with various Governmental and non-Governmental organisations.  The main focus of these activities was on the promotion of peace and reconciliation in Ireland.  It also took due account, as appropriate, of the wider international peace issues of disarmament, economic and social development and respect for human rights.  The programme includes the following:</P>
      <P>Adoption by Dáil Éireann on 21 March 1986 of a resolution marking the International Year of Peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special issue in March 1986 of the departmental bulletin <i>Ireland Today,</i><Col N="764" /> devoted to different aspects of Ireland's contribution to the promotion of peace.</P>
    <P>Four public meetings with participation from North and South and from both traditions in Ireland, focusing on the contribution of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to peace and reconciliation in Ireland.  These meetings were organised by the Glencree Centre for Reconciliation and held on 3, 10, 17 and 24 June 1986.</P>
    <P>Planned study visit to Siamsa Tíre, the National Folk Theatre, in Kerry by members of the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain, involving the British-born children of Irish parents, as part of the process of bridge-building between the people of Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>A development educational workshop on links between peace and economic and social development organised by the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace from 30 June to 5 July 1986.</P>
    <P>The preparation of a module for primary schools, due for completion in 1987, providing information on the relationship between disarmament and development and its bearing on peace, the links between peace and poverty and Ireland's approach to these topics.</P>
    <P>Contribution to the cross-Border inter-denominational Peace Week schools award scheme for primary and post-primary schools, which was specially expanded in 1986 to mark the Year of Peace, on the theme &ldquo;peace-making has no frontiers&rdquo;, and which was organised jointly by the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, the Irish Council of Churches, Trócaire and Christian Aid.</P>
    <P>While the projects have been funded as far as possible from existing financial resources, provision was made for additional expenditure of £10,000 from a special departmental Year of Peace fund.</P>
    <P>In addition to the activities organised or financially assisted by the Department of Foreign Affairs, An Post issued two <Col N="765" /> postage stamps on 21 August 1986 to celebrate the Year of Peace.  The Department of Education have encouraged school civics classes to devote a substantial proportion of their time this year to peace studies.  A circular to this effect was issued to schools on 29 August 1986. There are no further activities planned to mark this occasion.</P>

      <P>The Minister made that to sound very impressive.  On 5 December last year I asked the Minister what were his proposals.  He said he had a budget of £10,000 for the promotion of the International Year of Peace.  Did he succeed in increasing that budget or was he confined to £10,000?</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister was anticipating congratulations.  I merely said he made it sound impressive. The Minister referred to meetings of the Irish Council for Justice and Peace.  Is that part of the Minister's promotion of the International Year of Peace?  He referred to articles published in the magazine <i>Ireland Today</i> and to four public meetings which propagated the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Does the Minister consider that a contribution to the International Year of Peace?  That is simply part of the job of the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he is propagating Government policy, but it is not a contribution to peace.  He suggested last year that the Department of Education would be the Department to promote peace in schools. At the very end of his reply he referred to recommendations in regard to peace studies.  Has anything specifically occurred in regard to peace studies in schools?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The expenditure of £10,000 is from my Department only. I said at the end of my reply that the Department of Education have encouraged school civics classes to devote a substantial proportion of their time this year to peace studies, and a circular to this effect was issued to schools on 29 August last.  The Deputy apparently has a very poor opinion of civics teachers in Ireland if he suggests they have ignored the circular.  I am sorry to hear that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will detail the efforts that have been made to establish the whereabouts etc. of Brian Keenan kidnapped in the Lebanon; and the progress that has been achieved to bring about his release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Brian Keenan, a native of Belfast, has been missing in Beirut since 11 April 1986 when he failed to appear for classes at the American University. To date no group has claimed responsibility for his abduction.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to detail all the efforts which have been made to locate Mr. Keenan.  However, I can tell him that during the past seven months my Department have been repeatedly in contact with all parties in the region that might be able to provide assistance.  We have been in contact with a recently released French hostage and our Charge d'Affaires in Beirut is pursuing inquiries on foot of this contact.</P>
      <P>In addition, our embassy in Beirut has ensured that the case receives maximum publicity in the local media.  Appeals from the Keenan family have been transmitted through the embassy to the local television and radio stations and a letter from Mr. Keenan's mother was published in the local newspapers.  The embassy also arranged that an edited Arabic version of a BBC interview with the Keenan family be broadcast on Lebanese television last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deeply concerned by this case as, <Col N="767" /> I am sure, is the Deputy and all the Irish people.  His abduction is all the more inexplicable given our good relations with the Lebanon and its people and the general appreciation of our role with UNIFIL in the region.  I can assure the Deputy that this matter will continue to receive my personal attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his reply and to accept his assurances that everything possible is being done.  Although no group have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of Brian Keenan, has it been possible to establish which group are responsible and what their affiliations are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not.  Given the situation in the Lebanon, and in Beirut in particular, the composition of these groups and their affiliations frequently change as they merge into one another so that their loyalties are to different political bosses from time to time.  We have not been able to identity at all who he was abducted by.  The only clue we had as to what might have happened was when the French hostage was released a short while ago and he said that where he had been he had been given an indication by another prisoner that a person had said: &ldquo;I am Irish&rdquo;.  That gave us some grounds for hope.  Since then we have spurred our efforts by way of a television programme last week on Lebanese television and by way of letters from Mrs. Keenan in the Lebanese papers in the hope that this will prompt someone to come forward and help us to get him released.  It is a most tragic case.  The fact that Mr. Keenan who is holding an Irish passport should be abducted for no known reason, with no known demands, and held for this period of time is a frightful hardship on his family.</P>

I am aware of reports that individuals from Northern Cyprus recently visited this country.  It was an entirely private matter and the Government was not involved in any way.</P>

    <P>It has been the policy of successive Governments fully to support the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus and the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to work out a negotiated solution to the problems of Cyprus on that basis.

I would therefore like to take the opportunity again to remind Members of the Oireachtas of my wish that they not distunit <Col N="771" /> regard the policy of successive Governments in their contacts with representatives of that separatist &ldquo;state&rdquo;.</P>

The Minister is no doubt aware that members of his own party and members of Fianna Fáil invited these people from Northern Cyprus here.

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware of the <Col N="773" /> recent sinking of a Russian nuclear submarine and of the emission of radioactivity from this submarine; if he is further aware that the Irish Sea is being used constantly by Russian, American and British nuclear submarines; his views on whether the consequences of an accident in the Irish Sea would be catastrophic for this nation; and the steps he has taken to ensure that such traffic would be banned from the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the sinking of a Soviet &ldquo;Yankee&rdquo; class nuclear powered submarine in 18,000 feet of water about 600 miles north-east of Bermuda on 6 October 1986.  Following an inquiry to the Soviet authorities we have been informed that there was and is no possibility of a nuclear explosion on board the submarine or of radioactive pollution of the environment.</P>
      <P>The sea between Ireland and Britain is, for the most part, international waters and can be used by the submarine vessels of any country.  Ireland's national control ends at the three mile limit of our territorial waters.</P>
      <P>The Government are naturally concerned that an accident such as the one involving the Soviet submarine near Bermuda should not occur in the Irish Sea.  We, therefore, attach considerable priority to our efforts in the UN framework to promote concrete arms control and disarmament measures aimed at reducing, and eventually eliminating, all nuclear weapons.  Ireland supports the continuing negotiations in this field between the two super powers, who possess the largest nuclear arsenals, and hope that agreement can be reached on substantial reductions in these weapons. We believe that this is the most effective means of working towards the elimination of the danger posed by nuclear submarines in the Irish Sea, and elsewhere, bearing in mind that it would not be realistic to expect that any nation would agree to surrender their rights to travel through international waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have already taken action in relation to the safety of Irish vessels at sea, and particularly in the seas <Col N="774" /> surrounding Ireland, which has been a matter of particular concern.  An initiative that we have sponsored at the International Maritime Organisation aims at focusing attention on the problems posed to fishermen by submarine traffic with a view to securing a halt to incidents which have caused material and personal damage in recent years to fishing vessels in the Irish Sea as well as in other waters. We will be working to secure the acceptance of this initiative at the biennial meeting of the assembly of the IMO in November 1987.</P>

      <P>While commending what the Minister and the Department are trying to do in this area, let me ask the Minister if the Government will consider seeking an international convention from the appropriate international maritime organisation which would ban, or at the very least restrict, the operation of nuclear submarines in narrow stretches of water such as the Irish Sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>About 18 months ago we examined all the various organisations with whom we thought it would be possible to raise this matter.  It is quite limited, you will find when you examine it, as to where it can be done.  The organisation we decided was the most appropriate, the one that was meeting soonest and might be the most effective, was the International Maritime Organisation.  The Deputy will understand that there will be a conflict here between the necessity for &ldquo;secrecy&rdquo; as seen by the super powers who own these submarines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>By its very nature the submarine is a secret boat.  Our concern was that while travelling underwater in what we recognise are international waters they no not damage either by pollution or, as happened in two cases in the Irish Sea, by dragging under boats.  We will be striving to get a reconciliation between those two points.  I would like to see what the Deputy has referred to, <Col N="775" /> that in narrow strips of water such as the Irish Sea all submarines would travel on the surface as is required when they travel in national waters.  That is one of the points we will be putting forward.  Given the nature of the relationship between the super powers and the fact that the Irish Sea is a waterway for submarines going up to one of the NATO bases in Scotland, I hope that the disarmament talks will have progressed to the stage by the time conclusions are reached that nuclear weapons will be no longer on board submarines, although I hold out no hope on that.  However, we must continue to press that around our Irish coasts submarines do not endanger either our waters or our fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made these suggestions to the three powers concerned at the time the last boat was lost in the Irish Sea, the response being more or less what I have given to Deputy Collins, that they are international waters, they have a right to sail in them and submarines sail submerged.  If one Super Power has a submerged submarine the tendency is for another one to tail it and shadow it to see where it is going and what it is doing and so on.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 24 together.</P>

    <P>The Government are committed to preserving Ireland's neutrality outside military alliances.  Membership of any military alliance would not be compatible <Col N="777" /> with this policy of neutrality.  The question of joining NATO does not, therefore, arise.  In the recent interviews to which Deputy Haughey refers, the Minister for Defence said that he was in favour of this policy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are commited to preserving our neutrality outside military alliances, and joining NATO would be incompatible with that policy.  As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, I have no objection to a debate on neutrality taking place in this House if somebody wishes to put down a motion to that effect.  I would give my views.  Such a debate would have a value only if every Deputy from every party was free to speak his or her mind without the constraints of a party Whip. Our history in that regard has not been good.  A debate on neutrality with every Deputy relieved of his or her party Whip, if that were possible, would be of value and I would be delighted to take part in it.</P>

What are foreign Government to think of our neutrality when the Minister for Defence, with no reprimand, states that the policy is totally illogical and that he would have no hang-ups about joining a military alliance?  Would the Minister for <Col N="778" /> Foreign Affairs like to avail of this opportunity here this afternoon to dissociate himself from such remarks?  Will he agree that if his ministerial colleagues announced they would have no hang-ups about joining NATO this is bound to increase suspicion about the language in the Single European Act which states that the high contracting parties consider that closer co-operation on questions of European security would contribute in an essential way to the development of a European indentity in external policy matters?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (1) concerning visits of naval vessels to our ports from the United States of America, the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and France, if the Government has at any stage asked for guarantees in writing from the above nations, that their vessels were not carrying nuclear weapons and were not on military exercise, if so, the dates on which these guarantees were requested, and, if not, the reason; and (2) concerning the visits of naval vessels to our ports from the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United <Col N="782" /> Kingdom and France, the written assurances which have been given to the Government by these nations that their vessels were not carrying nuclear weapons or were not on military exercise; and the dates on which these assurances were given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government do not seek written guarantees or assurances of the type referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>When an application for a foreign naval vessel to visit an Irish port is received by my Department, we consult with the appropriate authorities to establish that the visit does not form part of a naval exercise and that the vessel is not carrying nuclear weapons.  If, following these consultations, my Department are satisfied that the proposed visit complies with these criteria, then permission will normally be granted for the visit to take place.  It is not the practice to disclose details of the verification procedures employed in this connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is now time to examine our procedures for checking out whether visiting naval vessels have nuclear warheads on board, having regard to the situation that exists?  I accept that a system has operated here for a considerable period where we determine whether such vessels are part of a NATO military exercise.  Will the Minister agree there is a growing demand for more to be done to see to it that vessels bearing nuclear arms should not be allowed to our ports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the conditions we laid down, that vessels bearing nuclear arms are not allowed in.  I gather the Deputy means that we should be able to verify for ourselves whether vessels are carrying such weapons.  Given the attitude of the countries who possess nuclear weapons, we will not be given that information so the only alternative is to say that any vessels capable of carrying nuclear weapons will not be allowed to enter our ports.  At the moment we are laying down our policy for these countries and we believe that when they know the <Col N="783" /> criteria we lay down they will not send vessels containing weapons to our ports. We can certainly do what Deputy Collins says.  We could change the rules to ensure that no vessel capable of carrying nuclear arms would be allowed into our ports but I am willing to accept the word of countries on both sides that they will not breach our regulations and I welcome contact with the sailors on these ships with our people.</P>

      <P>We can certainly adopt such a line but the policy of the super power is not to release such information because they may give an advantage to the other side by knowing that that ship is carrying nuclear weapons.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, if, in the light of Ireland's involvement in the Lebanon with the UNIFIL force, he considers it apropriate for Ireland to be involved in diplomatic sanctions against any state or states of the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government share the profound concerns of their European partners at recent acts of international terrorism.  Within the Twelve, we have participated in the endeavour to develop an agreed European strategy designed to assist in the eradication of this evil which threatens the citizens of all our states.  In this connection, the Twelve have made it clear that states which sponsor or support terrorism cannot expect to have normal relations with them.</P>
      <P>This approach is a political one aimed at discouraging any involvement by any state in acts of terrorism.  The measures elaborated in this context have been taken after careful consideration and are proportionate, appropriate and in accordance with international law.  The Twelve have also emphasised, within the framework of their political approach, that they stand ready to co-operate with all concerned states in the effort to defeat terrorism.</P>
      <P>The UNIFIL operation in South Lebanon is one which is mandated by the Security Council of the United Nations which has frequently called upon all the parties concerned to co-operate fully with the force for the implementation of their mandate.  The Government are of the view that UNIFIL are entitled to such co-operation and that in particular they are entitled to the full support and co-operation of all the states in the region.</P>

      <P>The European Minister are trying to adopt a uniform approach to terrorism, not just among themselves, but also embracing other countries.  The fight against terrorism has been expanded to the Council of Europe with the intention of speaking to the Arab League and the Gulf States so that as many countries as possible will be involved in the fight against international terrorism.  It is one of the major plagues of the eighties and it is appalling to think that people cannot travel by boat or aeroplane without the danger of being blown up.  We must all combine to fight terrorism although I am not suggesting that anybody in the House disagrees with me.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give his views on the immediate short term future role of the UNIFIL forces, in particular the Irish section of that force, in South Lebanon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The mandate drawn up by the Security Council is about eight years old and, at the time, the Government were invited to contribute troops to the peace-keeping force whose primary <Col N="787" /> aims were to restore government to South Lebanon and to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops.  Clearly, neither of those parts of the mandate have been fulfilled.  There is less stable government in the Lebanon now than before and the Israelis are still there.  However, UNIFIL have brought stability to South Lebanon in the only part of the country where they operate.  This position is kept constantly under review, especially when the mandate is being renewed by the Government. It may be argued that the mandate has not been fulfilled but the force are performing a useful function in the area which has dictated the Government's policy of renewing the mandate each time.</P>
      <P>It has been a very difficult period there over the summer because of increased instability in South Lebanon.  As the House knows, one of our officers was killed and there were continual snipings and attacks on UNIFIL forces in July and August.  Happily, these attacks are less frequent although the French indicated over the last 24 hours that they intend to withdraw some of their forces when their mandate comes up for renewal in January. Our Government will have to examine this matter because the probability is that we may be asked to contribute more troops.  Without wishing to pr-empt the Government's decision that would be quite a difficult thing for us to do.  We will have to examine the last six months in Lebanon very carefully including the decision of the French Forces to withdraw some of their force and the failure, I use that word advisedly, of the Security Council to finance the force as had been undertaken by them when the force were set up in 1978.  These are matters which the Government will have to consider between now and January.  I do not want to pre-empt the decision the Government may come to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that I always listen carefully to the views of the representatives of constitutional nationalism in Northern Ireland.  It would be to the advantage of all of us in this House if everybody here did likewise.</P>
      <P>In the television programme marking the anniversary of the Anglo Irish Agreement, I said that I was glad to pay tribute to the RUC, that in my view the RUC had changed greatly in the last 12 months and that I would be happy to see young men making a career in the RUC.  I stand over that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 7 of the Anglo Irish Agreement sets out the object of making the security forces more readily acceptable to the nationalist community and specifically mentions &ldquo;action to increase the proportion of members of the minority in the RUC&rdquo;.  Paragraph 8 of the Hillsborough communique stated that the Intergovernmental Conference would at their <Col N="790" /> first meeting address the improvement of relations between the security forces and nationalists and would consider ways of underlining the policy of the RUC and of the armed forces in Northern Ireland that they discharge their duties even-handedly and with equal respect for the unionist and nationalist identities and traditions. I can tell the Deputy that the Intergovernmental Conference at their first meeting and at their meetings since then have been addressing these issues as set out in Article 7 of the Agreement and paragraph 8 of the communiqué.</P>
    <P>I have on many occasions placed on record the Government's appreciation of the professionalism and dedication of the RUC in enforcing the law even-handedly and in protecting nationalists as well as unionists &mdash; particularly during the summer marching season when the members of the RUC and their families were under the constant threat of intimidation and attack from the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, in the light of the cover up of the Stalker affair, the continued use by the RUC of plastic bullets and Supergrasses and the handling of the marches on 12 July last, the nationalist population have no reason to have complete confidence in the RUC?  Would the Minister now agree that his call to nationalists to join the RUC was made without adequate consideration of the difficulties on the ground and of the sensitivities of the situation?  Would the Minister also agree that he was clearly exaggerating or over-estimating the benefits of the Anglo Irish Agreement to date if he thought sufficient progress had been made to enable nationalists to join the RUC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on that occasion that one of the objectives of the Anglo Irish Agreement was to increase the confidence of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland in the administration of justice and the security forces.  Anybody who has looked at television in the last 12 months will see that it was not the <Col N="791" /> nationalists whom the RUC were attacking and that the RUC were not being attacked by Nationalists.  Again, I pay tribute to the courage, dedication and professionalism of the RUC over the last 12 months.  I am sure it would be unnatural if every single member of a force that size should change completely in that time.  There are bound to be individual Nationalists and pockets of Nationalists who will find fault or have cause for criticism of individual officers or a group of officers of the RUC but generally in the last 12 months the RUC have behaved in a professional and even-handed way.  It would be a suitable career for many young men in Northern Ireland if they wish to join the RUC.  Keeping the law is a very honorable thing to do.</P>

For instance, if you take a young boy or girl who is doing a course with AnCO, especially an apprenticeship course, they are trained for about one and a half years. They are then asked to leave and to go out and try to find somebody who will sponsor them to complete their period of apprenticeship.  We are doing a terrible injustice to young people in this service. I have known many young boys and girls who have gone through a period of one and a half years training and who then applied for a job.  They left the interview for that job being told that they were half baked apprentices.  It is morally wrong that we should be training our young people for that kind of future.  If they are admitted to an AnCO course, they should be allowed complete the full period of apprenticeship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 12 months go I put down questions in this House to three different Departments, Social Welfare, Labour and the Public Service, in the hope that I would get some information or that some record would be kept of those unfortunate young people who are considered half backed apprentices.  This is an appalling state of affairs and is a terrible <Col N="808" /> injustice to inflict on our young people. I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to this aspect of apprenticeship training with AnCO.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand why there is so much duplication of functions between AnCO and Manpower.  A young person is first interviewed by Manpower, then sent to AnCO to do a course where they undergo another interview.  There must be some way of stopping this type of duplication.  It is like a young person applying twice for one job.  AnCO, or Manpower, should be the body to carry out the interview and to make the assessment. These are the areas to which we will have to give very serious consideration because this kind of duplication is costing the State a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>It is sad that a young boy or girl who is not prepared to continue education after primary level does not have any knowledge of the services which are available to them.  Rather, they come on to the streets and are misinformed about the services that are available.  If appropriate leaflets or booklets were distributed in the schools at that stage, they would be of great benefit in helping the young people to decide what kind of career is available to them.  I believe the disadvantaged youth should receive particular attention, especially those coming from disadvantaged areas.  If one visits these areas and discusses the position with people who are voluntarily giving their time and effort to the community associations, what do they say?  They tell us nobody is taking an interest in those people.  We should be placing all our emphasis on those people.  We should help them, encourage them, and impress upon them that they have a future and that they should be guided by the many services we are setting up to help them.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is dedicated to helping these people and that is why I hope that any criticism I make today will be of benefit to him and to our young people.  Nothing in this Bill conveys the impression that the Government will deal with the problem of unemployment. Unfortunately what we have here is a Bill <Col N="809" /> to shift administrative responsibility from four organisations to one.  There is no proposal to reduce the size, the cost or the manpower of these bodies.  On the contrary, significant proportions of this Bill are devoted to cast iron projections ensuring the transfer and preservation of all features of the existing bodies and an implicit view that the present activities of these bodies will be expanded and developed in the years ahead.  One must question the fundamental philosophy underlying the area of industrial training and temporary employment schemes. One can anticipate the legitimate training needs of industry and there is no question but that the State has a role to play in this area but the State should also ensure that industry pay all the costs.  That is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>There are other areas which will come under the aegis of this Authority, for instance, employment schemes, job placement and so on.  Serious reservations must be entered because in recent years it has been demonstrated that the National Manpower Service were hopelessly unsuccessful in placing people in employment and it has now been transformed into an agency which promises and administers temporary employment schemes.  This is true.  As far as young people are concerned the psychological effect of this administration is that this service provides temporary employment; there is nothing permanent about it.  There is no future. It is just something to keep young people off the streets for a short period.</P>
    <P>Why should it be necessary to enable the Authority to promote their activities outside the State?  This would seem to be providing a means so that AnCO can go around Europe wasting taxpayers' money.  I question this.</P>

      <P>I believe this a complete waste of money and I do not think that service has achieved anything.  Another point I want to raise is the job of director general.  What will be the salary for this position?  Will it be a political appointment? I have always suspected political input, especially in top jobs.  Whether it be right or wrong a political appointee is directed to carry out the instructions of the appointing Minister.  The time has come when this kind of political input should be removed from services of that kind.  We have seen instances of the appointment of somebody by one political party today and tomorrow, when there is a change of Government, another move to make another political appointment. I have seen disastrous consequences on account of such appointments.  When one approaches any of such appointees they will say: Well, I have been appointed by the Minister and naturally I must carry out a Minister's instructions.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to find some neutral body to interview prospective candidates for the job of director general of this Authority, a person who will have all the qualifications necessary to fulfil the post rather than have any political input.  In fairness to the potential candidate and the people he will be serving it would be far better that he be completely divorced from any political intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must examine the growth and development of training and temporary employment schemes, putting an end to the cynical, cosmetic approach to employment.  In our recent document entitled <i>A Nation that Works</i>&mdash; a blueprint for jobs, fair taxation and social justice &mdash; we proposed a number of things in this area.  We contended that the rip-off from external training courses run by AnCO represented a reduction in the administrative overheads of AnCO, <Col N="811" /> CERT, the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service.  We also proposed the cessation of the uncontrolled expansion of employment schemes not properly policed, reviewed, examined, and for whose effectiveness nobody can vouch.  We believe there are areas where community work could be fruitfully undertaken by unemployed people but that such should come under the auspices of the relevant local authorities. We are not using local authorities to the extent we should.  After all, they are the people on the ground who know exactly the kind of employment available to young people.  Of course there are public representatives serving on local authorities who inform their executive officers of the areas in which employment is most urgently needed.</P>
    <P>Let me take the example of my own city, Cork, one of the most depressed areas in terms of employment in recent years.  I know of local authority housing schemes, comprised of anything up to 500 houses, with 500 families living in them where, if one found 50 people employed, that would be a lot.  In Cork there is the Mahon area of Blackrock.  Then one can look to the other side of the city, at Farranree and Gurranebraher.  The people on the ground there are the members of the local authority, co-ordinating their efforts with the executive officers of the authority, who know best the kind of work and where it is available for young people.  We are not availing of that kind of information that is available from local authorities.  We can set up any type of body we like but, if they are not prepared to establish some link with local authorities, then I fear for their future. The Minister should give this matter serious consideration.  I recall the Minister being in the Mayfield area of Cork a year or so ago when he heard the views of the people, people giving of their time and effort voluntarily, in promoting the welfare of young people.  These people must be consulted at all times as far as the employment of our young people is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> I want to place emphasis on apprenticeship courses.  I would ask the Minister to put a stop to this waste of time and effort on the part of young people.  I acknowledge that it removes them from the unemployment list for the period of their apprenticeship but we must realise the damage we are doing them.  If nothing else, this new authority should prepare a record of such young people throughout the country so that we will have some follow-up.  I would appeal to employers, when employing people, that they give what I might call unbaked apprentices consideration.  They find themselves in a wilderness looking for some employer to give them another one and a half years work.  If that were done, even if they had to emigrate later, they would have a trade or some worthwhile qualification.  In replying I hope the Minister can assure me that the thousands of young people who have undergone one and a half year apprenticeship courses with AnCO &mdash; now walking the streets of our towns and cities in search of employment &mdash; could be given an opportunity of completing their apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>I may have further comments to make on Committee Stage.  I felt I had to emphasise the hardship being experienced by young apprentices.  I know the hardship and anxiety it creates in homes, the anxiety of a boy coming home from an AnCO course saying: I have now completed my one and a half year course, where do I go from here, who will give me a job for the remaining year and a half?  If the Minister could resolve that problem he would be doing young people a great service.  I know of the Minister's interest and dedication in this field and I would ask him to give it special and careful consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and its basic philosophy.  I welcome also the publication in September last of the White Paper on Manpower Policy.  I might commend the Minister on its production. As he points out in that document it is approximately 20 years since a White Paper on manpower policy was published.  That was in 1965.  That was <Col N="813" /> the year I finished my training and left University College Dublin with a degree. I was reflecting on the enormous changes that have taken place in the skills needed in our workforce and on the difficulties that face young people nowadays compared with 1965.  I qualified in September 1965 with a pass science degree.  When I had not got a job five weeks after I received my degree &mdash; I was the last of my group to get a job &mdash; my mother thought I would be unemployed for the rest of my life.  By the sixth week I had a job in industry where I stayed for nine years.  If I were to come out of college now with the same kind of degree I would probably find it extremely difficult to get employment.  People need all sorts of extra skills nowadays to be of value to the different industries.  We have gone through very changing times and it is a disgrace that it has taken 20 years to produce another White Paper on manpower policy.</P>
      <P>In the past 20 years we tended to flounder around, pick up policies, try them out and cast them aside if they were not the right ones.  In recent years we have been getting the act together.  This policy paper has helped and has led to the Bill before us.  It is interesting to note, and I am sure it was relevant to the preparation of this White Paper, that in the NESC report entitled <i>Manpower Policy in Ireland</i> and published in 1985, it is recommended that it is time we rationalised the number of agencies now springing up and undertaking functions that in some instances were overlapping resulting in a great deal of confusion. That report states at pages 263 and 264:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will have become clear at this stage from some of our earlier comments that we do not consider the existing agency structure in the manpower area to be altogether appropriate.  The functions of formulating and executing policy have become intermingled both within the Department and in some of the agencies and this has led to some confusion of roles which has made it <Col N="814" /> all the more difficult to articulate an overall strategy.</P>
    <P>The NESC recommend three ways in which this inappropriateness could be tackled but they opt for the creating of a single executive agency embracing all existing bodies in the manpower area. One may ask why this did not happen and why these bodies sprung up on their own.  It is part of what happened in recent years when new needs became identified and responses were required quickly.  The Department set up new agencies in order to answer that need as quickly as possible. In hindsight, to deal in an <i>ad hoc</i> way with manpower policy, was probably not the best course to follow.  I welcome the fact that we are now beginning to stitch it all together.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the criticism that arises from the overlapping of a number of the agencies.  The overriding problem I have found in my constituency work is the utter and total confusion among people for whom these agencies have been set up.  One may wonder why there is still confusion because there is a great deal of time and money spent advertising these agencies and trying to spell out what they are there for.  Most people do not read about these agencies and do not know why they are there until perhaps they become unemployed or need the services of one of them.  They then start to look at the different acronyms that represent these agencies, whether it is the YEA, AnCO or some of the employment schemes.  I sometimes wondered why there was a lack of willingness on the part of the agencies to make information available about each other so that if a public representative or a member of the public found that one agency was not suitable to their needs, that agency would know where to send them.</P>
    <P>When one considers that in 1981 there were 22,500 people under 25 years of age in training schemes and that by 1986 that figure had grown to 66,500 one will realise that the training and preparation of young people for employment is very big business.  I find it difficult to go along with Deputy Wyse's contention that people who take part in training and who do <Col N="815" /> not immediately get employment are the worse off for having done the training.  It is necessary to make sure that the training is relevant, effective and useful to them but it is false to say that even if a person cannot get a job after completing a year or a year and a half of training, he is worse off than if he did not have the training.  He must be the better for those extra skills and the extra confidence gained from the training.  I would hate to see us abandon programmes on the basis that young people cannot get jobs automatically at the end of the programme. That would be a very shortsighted policy to adopt.  Maybe I misunderstood Deputy Wyse.  Is he recommending that we abandon AnCO or YEA programmes because young people find they are not immediately getting jobs after taking part in those programmes?  As somebody who has sat on interview boards for various organisations I realise that people look for the extra training, the extra skill and the extra confidence that a young person exudes from having taken part in those programmes.  Even if we had full employment as there was in 1965, we would still need a relevant and effective training system so that people have the skills they need.</P>
    <P>I find the National Manpower Service a total mystery.  I can never find out why I continually get complaints from people who are on lists in the National Manpower Service for two, three or four years and never get an offer of a job.  When I contacted the agency I was told that that could not be possible yet I continue to meet people who have been unemployed for a couple of years and have not had any contact from the agency.  I hope that this Bill and the rationalisation it will bring about will convince me that the National Manpower Service is working properly.  Undoubtedly, it was set up to find jobs for people.  Deputy Wyse was correct in saying that a lot of their work involves steering people through the temporary works schemes and the enterprise allowance scheme.  That is part of their work and they are doing it effectively. Constituents I have spoken to have told <Col N="816" /> me they have been able to obtain all the relevant information they require but there must be more concentration on their overall role, to find employment and steer people towards proper jobs.  It is a mystery why they do not concentrate on that role.</P>
    <P>It is surprising how ignorant people are about what to do when they find themselves unemployed.  They sign on at the unemployment exchanges, get their payments and then complain if they are not called for jobs.  However, very often one discovers that they have not signed on with Manpower.  Those people think that when they sign on at the local employment exchange they are indicating they are available for any job that may turn up at local authorities and so on. It should be obligatory on those drawing benefit or dole to sign on with Manpower. People should be made aware of the importance of signing on with Manpower. The Department should embark on an information programme and hand out leaflets at the local exchanges highlighting the importance of that.  It is extraordinary that one must continuously remind people that jobs are not offered to them simply because they have signed on at the exchange.  It is difficult to get across to them that they must sign on with Manpower also.  When people hear of vacancies in local authorities they approach councillors and TDs for help and when they are asked if they have signed with Manpower their response, in most cases, is that they have not.  There is nothing one can do to have such people interviewed for the job if they have not signed on with Manpower.  There must be an automatic tie-in between signing on for welfare and signing on with Manpower. I hope the Minister will deal with that matter later.</P>
    <P>A body like AnCO, because of its size, will always come in for some criticism. There is no doubt that that organisation have been extremely effective, particularly in recent years.  There is a recognition that it is not enough to train people if the qualification obtained is not needed in industry.  The people involved are not <Col N="817" /> much better off with the AnCO qualification in that event.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that most of the AnCO courses are directly relevant to what is required in the workplace and in the subsuming of AnCO into the new body I hope those in charge of training will ensure that local centres are kept aware of the needs of industries in their catchment areas.  It is not enough for AnCO officials to compare notes with their colleagues in other centres.  That is not what they are employed for; they are not there to play one centre off against another.  Those officials must investigate the different industries and ascertain the type of skills required before they arrange their courses.  That work is being done at present and I hope it will continue under the new body.  I have heard many colleagues from rural areas praise AnCO officials who organise courses but it is easier to discover the needs of industries in rural area and adapt courses accordingly.</P>
    <P>AnCO receive an enormous sum of money from the European Social Fund. In 1986 the ESF grant was in the region of £55 million.  There are those who criticise AnCO and accuse them of devising courses and training programmes in order to be able to claim money from the ESF. I do not know if that is true but some people believe it is.  It essential that we do not allow that to happen.  Every programme prepared by AnCO should be relevant, effective and efficient.  Programmes should not be prepared so that we can draw money from the ESF and reduce the number on the unemployment register.  We need to monitor what is going on and how the money is being spent.</P>
    <P>In 1986 a total of 2,304 people were employed by AnCO, according to the White Paper.  That is more than the biggest company in Ireland.  It is because that body employ so many people that they are open to criticism for wasteful spending.  There is an onus on the Department of Labour, and on AnCO, to ensure that all schemes are effective.  There is also on onus on AnCO to ensure that their schemes are for the right people. <Col N="818" /> AnCO schemes are funded by the ESF, the youth employment levy and the Exchequer.  They are Government schemes and not the property of any AnCO officials or members of community organisations or local bodies who may organise them.  People organising such schemes at local level tend to adopt the courses as their own and sell them as if they are financing them.  AnCO should be careful and examine the credentials of the groups running the courses.  That may be done now but I do not think it is effective in all cases.  Some schemes are almost hijacked by local people.  I had occasion to complain to AnCO because their posters are being used in my area to promote an individual.  The poster was very political and it was not appropriate for AnCO to allow that to happen to their literature.  After my complaint the posters were withdrawn.  I urge AnCO to check out the credentials of those running local courses.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the YEA. Deputy Wyse emphasised the need to train our young people.  It is interesting to note the comments of Alan Graham, President of the National Youth Council of Ireland, on the White Paper.  He said that much of the White Paper had focused on the new mega agency, the national manpower authority.  He said that the National Youth Council of Ireland were adamant that there must be a specific provision for youth in the new structures.  He wanted to see the expertise of the YEA retained in the new setup and it was also of concern to him that the Government, and the public, might believe that by submerging the Youth Employment Agency, dropping &ldquo;youth&rdquo; from the employment level and removing age restrictions on youth employment schemes they have somehow removed the youth employment problem at a stroke.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is important that the Government should continue to focus on the huge growth in the 15 to 25 age group.  We must continue to recognise the special needs of that sector.</P>
    <P>It appeared to me that the YEA were running into the difficulty of drawing the <Col N="819" /> line between dealing with people who are 25 and those who are 25 years and six months.  The agency should be able to look at job prospects for people who are older than 25 years of age.  There would be no point in people working in a vacuum unless people could take into account what would be available for them after the age of 25 years.  Recently the YEA came to talk to the enterprise and employment committee of Dublin County Council and concern was voiced that although the agency's terms of reference allowed them to deal with people between the ages of 15 and 25 years they had to keep themselves acquainted with the availability of work for those older than 25 years, because it was appreciated that life does not stop at 25 years.  The agency said they were concerned always about the progress of the people who came to them.</P>
    <P>It is important to reflect on the enormous amount of money being spent on youth programmes.  In 1986 the total spent by a variety of agencies and groups on work schemes will be £154.9 million, whereas in 1981 it was only £48 million, an enormous increase in the meantime. It is a sad reflection on the numbers who have to avail themselves of these schemes because of shortage of employment. However, I do not look on it all as being negative.  At the end of their training the people involved will be much more skilled in preparation for our emergence from the recession we have been in.  Therefore, the money will not have been wasted. Even though the money is being spent and many people are benefiting, it does not allow for complacency because we must be examining what is being done with the money.  This new training authority will be able to do that.</P>
    <P>When touring around some of the AnCO centres I found that one of the most effective sectors is that catering for the renewal of skills or the improvement of skills, particularly for long term unemployed people over the age of 40 years. Those people felt they had been thrown on the heap, never again to get jobs.  The emphasis behind the social employment <Col N="820" /> scheme was to give people two and a half days work every week and to let them use the rest of the week to increase their incomes by doing some other work without being disqualified for unemployment benefit or assistance.  One of the snags attached to that scheme is that many who would qualify under it do not have the skills or other requirements to utilise the other two and a half days per week. Courses for people in the older age group allow people to get themselves slowly back into the workforce, whether in house building, home decorating, electronics, plumbing or other skills so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a friend yesterday who had spent an entire weekend trying to get an electrician to do a simple job.  She could have got somebody to rewire the whole house, somebody who would light up a supermarket, but she could not get a simple job done: the electricians were gone into the big time and there was no one left to do simple little jobs.  Therefore, it is important that the schemes I have been referring to should be continued. They will enable people to come back into the workforce who would otherwise be depending on the State.</P>
    <P>There will be four trade union members on the new authority.  Something has happened in the last few years in regard to temporary employment schemes.  When they were announced it was made quite clear that they would be temporary in order to spread them around as much as possible and give as many as possible the opportunity to attain skills.  What has been consistently hapening is that trade unions have been lobbying for those who come in on those schemes to be kept on.  It is a very severe lobby.  When the environmental work scheme was being phased out there was a terrible furore in several county councils. If the trade unions had got their way, automatically any vacancies that arose in local authorities would be given to people being employed on the temporary schemes.  That would have meant that those older than 25 years could not get anything from a local authority.  That defeated the purpose of those schemes. <Col N="821" /> Trade unions must bear that in mind, and I am glad to see that there will be trade union representatives on the board, working in unison with the agencies that are to be combined under this Bill.  I hope those union representatives will play their part and realise the reason for these schemes.  We are similarly getting a heavy lobby on behalf of those on temporary schemes in the Civil Service.  It was made quite clear that this training would be for a year only, but we are now being told that those people must be given permanent jobs as they become available.  It is important that everybody would understand the position in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the other agency, CERT, which will be subsumed into the new authority.  It is important to remind ourselves why CERT were established.  CERT are a State agency established in 1963, probably the first set up with the primary function of co-ordinating the education, recruitment and training of staff at all levels for the hotel, catering and tourism industry, giving priority to tourism.  CERT are the only agency who have a very specific function &mdash; the others, including AnCO, are very broadly based, catering for a variety of skills.  CERT are one of the great success stories, an extraordinarily effective body. I have personal knowledge of it because my mother works in one of the training colleges for catering.  Many times I have heard her talk of CERT and the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>There seems to have been a misunderstanding about what would happen to CERT when the new authority would be set up.  My understanding is that there was a commitment to ensure that CERT would have a life of their own, that they would be left with their specific function in relation to the hotel, catering and tourism industry.  The head of CERT in a statement welcomed the amalgamation of the four manpower agencies and said he is satisfied that CERT will retain their identity within the new authority.  I can find no clause in the Bill or in the Minister's speech that says it will retain its own identity.  Whether that is an omission or I am just not able to follow the Bill as <Col N="822" /> closely as I should, I do not know.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the major part of the Bill is concerned with the establishment of the new body to be called the National Employment and Training Authority and will take over functions at present exercised by the four existing agencies, and that once the new authority is established the four existing agencies will cease to exist.  To me that means total amalgamation and the disappearance of CERT as we know it.  It is at the moment a limited company, and I strongly urge the Minister to look again at how he intends to deal with CERT in this new training authority.  I know that the council of CERT has put forward recommendations as to how they could come under the unbrella body.  I would be totally against them being isolated from this umbrella body because they are part of the training system so there is a need for them to be in some way unified with this new authority.  But they have put forward recommendations which other speakers have outlined.  They have suggested, for example, that the new council of CERT would report to the board of the National Employment and Training Authority to whom it would submit all training programmes and budgets for final approval.</P>
    <P>Their concern, and the concern of the hotels industry, is that this agency which has had 100 per cent employment record will no longer be able to identify for their industry the people who are specially trained for them.  CERT is probably one of the smallest agencies going in under this heading and they are concerned that they will be so subsumed that they will have no identity at all.  The hotels industry have been very concerned about this and have been lobbying to have the Minister look at it again.  They thought they would retain their identity as witnessed by the speech by James Nugent in <i>Focus</i> magazine.  But now they feel they have been let down in some way.</P>
    <P>I know I am not the first to say it but could the Minister look again at this organisation to see whether he can adjust the Bill to allow them to still have some autonomy, to continue to certify their courses, give their diplomas and set down <Col N="823" /> the kind of courses they think are relevant to their industry.  It is the only group that is very specific in the industry they cater for.  If one goes to AnCO and trains in electronics one can be employed by everybody, and in the hotel industry also; nearly every industry these days needs people with expertise in electronics.  But CERT are very specific and are undoubtedly one of the success stories here.  We should be careful not to do anything to turn them into something less than the 100 per cent success they have been.</P>
    <P>In closing I would like to commend the Minister for his obvious enthusiasm for getting our manpower policy out of the sixties and into the eighties and making us recognise that employment and the chances of employment and the different skills required are not what they were in the sixties.  Whether we like it or not employment will never be as available and as full as it was.  We must look at employment in a much broader way.  This body will help us to do that.  We must train for work, for our leisure time, for community activities; we must train people to realise that employment and occupation do not always have to be measured by the amount of money one earns.  One can get great job satisfaction out of using skills and talents in areas where perhaps one is not getting paid at all or is being paid very little.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill and I hope that he will look again, for Committee Stage, at some way he can ameliorate and lessen the worries of CERT.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill in a qualified way because it has long been Fianna Fáil policy.  Particularly has it been the brainchild of our spokesman, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  We in Fianna Fáil have seen the proliferation of new schemes some of which have succeeded, some of which have failed and quite a few of which have led to a dead end. There has been considerable overlapping and covering up.  There is obviously plenty of money for the schemes, for the public relations jobs to pretend that <Col N="824" /> everything is well, and for hanging out the bunting and the tinsel.</P>
      <P>But the time is long past for this change.  I compliment the Minister on stealing the ideas that we put forward, and we welcome them.  I am glad to see the Government taking up some of the ideas we had because I do not believe they have too many of their own.  God knows, the Government were too busy hanging on to their own jobs last night, 80 of them or 81 if we count the Ceann Comhairle, to bother about jobs for other people.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister for Labour has seen the light and deathbed conversions are very welcome.  In the last days of the Roman Empire even some of the emperors were converted to Christianity. I cannot imagine how emperors were converted but I did not think Tánaistí or Taoisigh would be converted.</P>
      <P>The plan is to replace AnCO and CERT and the National Manpower Agency and the Youth Employment Agency with this umbrella body called the National Employment and Training Authority.  Some people referred to it today as NETA.  I thought it might be &ldquo;NEATA&rdquo;.  Anyhow I hope it will be &ldquo;neeta&rdquo; and I hope it will be &ldquo;beta&rdquo; and I hope it will be more relevant to the needs of Ireland today.</P>
      <P>However, in regard to this umbrella body, I agree with the previous speakers' remarks about CERT.  I am aware of the very prominent part played by CERT in the hotel industry.  I have seen their good work at first hand.  I believe that when something is going well it should be left alone.  It is a good maxim to change something only when one is sure it will be replaced with something better.  CERT are good at their job and have proved their worth.  The finished product is good and well sought after.  The trainees from CERT are sure of getting jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure also that the hotel and catering industry could be built up into the biggest money spinner in Ireland next to agriculture.  We should foster it because it will provide employment and encourage investment in the country.  There is a general call from all sides of the House <Col N="825" /> that CERT should have a life of its own and an identity of its own.  I am afraid it will be amalgamated into this group and we will have a dull uniformity of all bodies.  We have one success story that we should leave to itself.</P>
    <P>In Kildare we are very partial to a dead cert.  But I hope this CERT will be a live CERT and left on its own.  But I feel very dubious when I see a Bill like this and wonder if it is just another sop to the tattered remnants of the Labour Party as they totter along with their unwilling partners in their last few days in office. There will not always be O'Leary's to give the Government the kiss of life and there will be plenty of Joe Berminghams to stand on their oxygen tubes when they are struggling for survival.  But we will always have the case of the dying wasp stinging people and I dread the thought of the director general being appointed by the present Minister or by any Labour Minister for that matter.  As well as that he will appoint 15 ordinary members so he will have a captain and a full team. That is what I read into the speech I saw.</P>

      <P>If the Government are rejected in Finglas they can be fairly certain they will be rejected in Ferbane as well.  So I hope the Minister has another think about that and will put the proper people in &mdash; people who will do the job.</P>
      <P>I note this new Authority will see as part of their work assessing persons seeking employment elsewhere in the community. Also they would undertake a provision of consultancy and manpower-related services overseas but only on a commercial basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Wyse's remarks and I compliment the Minister, although some might construe that as an admission of defeat and an acceptance of emigration. It is good to see people facing up to reality.  This Government have failed to provide jobs at home and at least he was frank enough to say they are going to give them the best chance possible to better themselves abroad.  Recently a man came to me with a proposal.  He would employ labour and was confident that he could find 300 to 400 jobs for people in Holland and possibly in Germany. They would be working in the EC anyhow, and we talk about a common market and mobility of employment. Some of these jobs were in the building trade but other skilled workers were required such as nurses and hotel workers. His big worry was that he would need funding for the project.  In some of the schemes it could well be 90 days from the time they would enter into the contract with him before the money would be available to them, 300 to 400 people in jobs for about three months represent a sizeable amount of money.  Of course, immediately the funds started to flow and their wages came they would pay back every penny.  He asked if there was any possibility of grants being available to him within the Department &mdash; although this was purely a commercial undertaking &mdash; to fund this enterprise.  The answer I got, which I expected, was that it was &ldquo;no go&rdquo;.  Therefore, that enterprise fell by the wayside and he said he would go elsewhere, possibly to Britain for the funding required.  I believe the man was intelligent.  He made a success of his life <Col N="827" /> and business abroad and got the contacts that would have given Irish people the jobs abroad.</P>
    <P>I hope the idea the Minister mentioned will fill the need which please God, will not be a need forever.  Deputy Seán Lemass could say in his time to the skilled workers &ldquo;Come back to Erin&rdquo;, and we hope that after a period of solid, single party Government here, Deputy Lemass's son-in-law will be able to say the same thing and tell those people to come home.</P>
    <P>Regarding education and languages, we are a most insular people and we are desperately ignorant as far as linguistic accomplishments are concerned.  We are at a frightful disadvantage.  The only advantage we have is that in the main people know some English and no matter where we go we can utilise that, but when we are forced to turn to anything else we are badly served indeed.  Up to now it seemed that the emphasis in most schools was on French.  I am glad that it is turning a little towards German.  Education should not be seen as divorced from jobs. I see them as complementing each other, and I regret there is not as much liaison as I would like to see between the two Departments.  I hope we will overcome that language barrier.</P>
    <P>The section in the Bill providing for jobs for people abroad is nothing to be ashamed of.  Instead of protesting that 30,000 young people are now emigrating, we should help and guide them.  We should not just sweep our surplus young people across the Irish sea or see them maybe slip illegally into the USA, where life is not all roses for them at the moment.  Whether they are classified as wetbacks or greenbacks, they are being sought out and there is a danger they will be sent home where there is nothing much for them.  Therefore, it is out duty to press the US, if they are our friends, to open the doors a little wider and provide visas and work permits for our young people.</P>
    <P>I am worried at the lack of emphasis in this Bill on education.  Education is a training for life.  We have evolved a <Col N="828" /> reasonably good educational system and I have seen it from both sides of the desk. This Government and other Governments have changed education in some ways.  I will not go on to the matter of discipline, but some of the changes were not for the better and if we could row back a bit many of us would gladly do so. Education is proposed to enrich one's life.  That is grand if you have a few bob in your pocket to buy the necessities of life.  It is easy then to talk about enriching it, but education cannot be divorced from reality.  It can be reasonably broad at national school or primary level.  By right the emphasis there should be on the three Rs.  They are priority areas that have been allowed to decline.  Perhaps in years to come somebody will get the bright idea that the curriculum should be changed again and will resurrect table books, learning by rote and other things that have been thrown out of the window. Possibly in 20 years time some guru in the educational world will find that these things were necessary.  However, second and third level education must be linked with the realities of life after school. There must be links between the person leaving school and the opportunities that exist in the workplace outside.</P>
    <P>Developments in the European Communities Twenty-eighth report published in July 1986 on page 66 deals with a formal meeting of Ministers and I quote paragraph 13.14.</P>
    <P>A paper containing an action programme for employment growth was presented jointly by the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy for the purposes of an initial exchange of dues. The initiative concentrated on the following four main areas where action might be taken in tackling the problems of employment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;promoting enterprise and employment,</P>
    <P>&mdash;flexible employment patterns and conditions at work,</P>
    <P>&mdash;vocational training,</P>
    <P>&mdash;long term unemployment,</P>
    <P>and proposed a number of specific measures in each area.  The paper will be discussed further by the Council <Col N="829" /> at its informal meeting in September, 1986.</P>
    <P>I note the emphasis there on vocational training.  Long before any of these bodies we are speaking about today surfaced or were thought about, vocational education was a pioneer in doing the very job the Minister is trying to do, and that sector existed on a shoestring.  I have experience of the vocational system as it exists in my county of Kildare, and I defy anybody to get better value for money than that vocational education system gives.  They are being screwed to the ground with regard to expenses, and 1 per cent of their budget is allowed for administration.  As the system has expanded more pupils have availed of it. They are the unsung heroes of vocational training.  Moneys that are showered elsewhere could well be channelled in that direction and thus yield a better return. Let me tell you that in a certain vocational school all comers are enrolled and accepted.  There is no such thing as creaming or streaming of pupils there, and 84 per cent of the pupils who enrol in the first year persevere and stay in the school and gain their leaving certificate. Is that not a fairly good result?  Those results are achieved with the lowest outlay of money <i>per capita</i> in the country. Will Members not agree we are getting good value for money there?</P>
    <P>I would say that up to now education and labour have been divorced.  There has been a tug-of-war between the two Departments.  They are overlapping. Each of them have looked after their own interests, have wanted to make sure of their perpetuation and there has been very expensive duplication.  Some of them had embarked on empire building. Certain sections had no scarcity of money while great pruning took place in other sections.  This must stop and we must ask ourselves some questions.  This year why did 1,100 students present themselves for first year BA examination with 600 night students on the same quest?  We must have freedom of choice and we cannot tell people what they should do, but what <Col N="830" /> is to become of all of these people afterwards? Are they all for export?  Is it realistic to allow them to spend three to four years in an institution studying to pass an examination to find at the end of two or three years that it is a dead end? Why in other faculties do we allow so many first students to enroll and then we make a conscious decision before the papers are even examined that 50 per cent will fail because there will not be places for them next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate being allowed raise this issue.  I invite the Minister to make a comprehensive statement in relation to what has been announced as his decision to invite the IMF to conduct an examination of our taxation system and to make recommendations in relation to a self assessment programme. It is clear that the IMF examination is due to commence on 1 December.  The Minister should clearly specify the terms of reference for this IMF examination of our taxation system.  I want the Minister to place those terms of reference in the Library of the House because this is an unprecedented step.  Having regard to the implications of IMF intervention it is very important from the point of view of maintaining confidence in the economy both here and among external interests who are constantly watching progress or lack of it in our economy that the Minister clearly states the exact background and the purpose of this visit.  The Minister must make a statement which will allay fears.  The Minister should say clearly if this IMF visit is solely on the initiative of <Col N="831" /> the Government and if not the Minister should explain how it came about, at whose suggestion and the purpose of it. If it was on the initiative of the Government, why did the Government make this step?  Is this an attempt by the Minister or some elements within the Cabinet to create a position prior to the preparation of the budget, which will limit the possibilities of argument and discussion on the budget even within the Government, so that the Government can point to the IMF recommendations to justify Government actions?  Such constraints might be used by elements in the Government to say that certain decisions are not open for discussion.  The Minister has, this evening, an opportunity to clarify this matter.</P>
      <P>If this was a Government decision it was not justified.  There are many international organisations and consultancy groups who could conduct the same examination without the implications of an IMF intervention.  The OECD is one organisation which could advise and make recommendations in terms of economic co-operation and development internationally, including recommendations as to improvements in the tax system.  The Minister has said that included in this delegation will be people who have experience of the US revenue system of self-assessment.  It would have better suited our position had the Government decided to invite directly on a bilateral basis, people from the US federal authority to come and give their views.  Self-assessment extends beyond the United States.  I would refer to the final report of the Commission on Taxation which I established over six years ago.  In a very comprehensive section, self-assessment, which is one of the areas that the Minister indicated as justifying IMF intervention, is referred to from Chapter 4.17 onwards.  I will give an example from the report.  It says at paragraphs 4.19 and 4.10:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We examined the tax system of other <Col N="832" /> countries and found that self-assessment in various forms operates in many different countries including Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Sweden. However, the best known example of full self-assessment is the United States system.  We studied the United States system in detail and a delegation from the Commission visited Washington D.C. to investigate the operation of self-assessment.</P>
    <P>Our discussions with the United States Internal Revenue, the Department of the Treasury, public representatives, tax practitioners, accounttants, lawyers, economistst and members of the largest commercial &lsquo;tax preparing&rsquo; firm in the United States, gave us a very full picture of the operation of self-assessment.  We raised the arguments which had been made to us concerning the system and we investigated all aspects of the self-assessment procedures.</P>
    <P>I have not time to go into the proposals they make based on that comprehensive examination giving them that very full picture which is incorporated in the final report which was published in October 1985.  If the Minister felt it was necessary to get direct advice why did he not go to the Commission on Taxation who spent months doing that examination in a very professional way?  The Minister should explain why he overlooked that commission. Apart from the implications of ignoring this last report of the commission, this is a matter of extreme urgency.  This was a matter of extreme urgency in 1980 when I set up the Commission on Taxation.  I recognised then that tax inequity, to which the Minister referred in his recent statement, was a matter calling for the earliest possible action.  I recognised that the level of taxation and the distribution of the tax burden required immediate action after the most exhaustive study.  Six years later, instead of acting on these recommendations, the Minister is postponing action until he will not have responsibility for it.  That will put constraints on an incoming Government because the <Col N="833" /> matter should have been discussed on a bipartisan basis and, in the national interest, we could have received full information before this dramatic and stark announcement.  It is reasonable to expect that the Minister presiding for the remaining short period of the Government would have consulted with those who, more than likely, will have the responsibility of introducing long-needed reform.</P>
    <P>I will give some figures to illustrate the extent of the problem since 1983.  I will read the following gem by the Minister for Finance from <i>Budget 1983</i>, page 21:</P>
    <P>Some of the Commissions recommendations do not depend on the adoption of the general package put forward and can be considered on their individual merits.  I am satisfied that changes should be made without further delay in a number of areas along the lines recommended by the Commission and I will refer to those later.</P>
    <P>Instead of making changes along the lines recommended by the commission we have moved in the opposite direction.  At the end of 1982 the overall tax burden amounted to £4,053 million of which £1,459 million represented income tax. In 1986 the figures for the overall tax burden are just short of £6 billion.  There has been an increase in total tax of a huge dimension of 66 per cent.  I know one must allow for inflation but it does not account for such a huge growth since 1982.  Within that huge growth, income tax has increased from a total of 24.7 per cent to a total of 27.6 per cent now.  It clearly demonstrates that the tax system has become overburdened and, as the Minister acknowledged, a penal disincentive against investment, work and everything we want to promote.  It is time the Government stopped making statements of intent and setting targets that have not and will not be realised.  Instead, they should present us with a little action.</P>
    <P>On coming to office the Government set targets in regard to the budget deficit and unemployment which were as meaningless as their present targets as was demonstrated last night.  They promised <Col N="834" /> to reduce the burden of taxation, especially on the PAYE sector.  I quoted examples in global terms but I will now personalise it.  A single man earning the average industrial wage in 1980 of £5,916 &mdash; the single man is the simplest to quote &mdash; would need £3,183 more in his pay package to have the same spending power after tax as he had in 1980 when the Commission were set up.  He would need about £13,500 to have the same standard of living.  That figure demonstrates the burden and the growth of taxation on the economy.  It is the greatest problem facing us as a direct consequence of the policies of the Government.  We have already forgotten <i>Building On Reality</i> but we will never forget the 1983 budget when the Government introduced such high levels of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister need not say that they have taken some action in accordance with the recommendations of the commission because they have reduced the highest rate of tax to a lower level.  They increased the rate to 65 per cent in 1983 and they are merely bringing it back to its former level.  They also increased the top levels of VAT in 1983 and that, too, has merely gone back to its former level. That is not progress.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that the tax system is over burdened and creaking to such an extent that it is causing immense frustration to those trying to operate the system in the Revenue Commissioners. It is equally impossible for those who are trying to cope with forms and procedures in business.  People are crucified by the tax system.  I will give an example which should commend itself to the Minister in terms of self-assessment which my party have adopted as a policy.  It is quite clear that some self-employed professional people are not paying their fair share, which is why we want this system introduced immediately, but it is equally clear that the tax inspectors are not able to cope with the burden of proposals, allowances and other matters submitted to them by those who can afford the most sophisticated accountancy advice.  Files are piled high in the tax office and individual <Col N="835" /> tax inspectors cannot be expected to cope with the mountain of work generated through the current system of forms and procedures.  We are getting nowhere and making it impossible for everyone concerned to cope with the system.</P>
    <P>The system of self-assessment, whether on a computer spot check basis or on a deliberate basis to go after certain areas, would enable those with the primary responsibility to say they wish to check an individual's accounts.  The public would know that those who cheat the system will be penalised.  Self-assessment is a tidier way and a better way. Finally, if we are talking of self-assessment, and we have the advice of this commission based on the experience they have gained, it does not warrant the intervention of the IMF.  If the Minister thinks it does, I would be obliged if he would explain to us their terms of reference, how they came here and what are the limitations on their functions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a large problem in the tax system at present in respect of outstanding amounts of uncollected tax. These arise mainly because in the first place taxpayers are not obliged in all cases to submit audited accounts.  Frequently the Revenue Commissioners have to issue an estimate of the tax which is due to, so to speak, frighten the taxpayer into complying with the basic requirement of submitting accounts so that the commissioners can assess his liability.  Frequently also, in the absence of agreement about these accounts there is a system of appeals on the part of the taxpayer and that can be a very prolonged process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the situation arises that there are outstanding demands from the Revenue Commissioners for very large sums of money which are either on appeal or have been issued solely to frighten the taxpayer into compliance.  When the account is finally settled, after many detailed hours of costly time has been <Col N="836" /> consumed by accountants and the Revenue Commissioners, the actual amount due may well be no more than one-fifth of the amount in the estimated assessment that was issued.  Therefore, we get the situation where the public assume that there is a much larger amount of outstanding tax actually due than there is and we also have the situation in which tax which should have been paid early is paid late because of the cumbersome procedures involved in deciding how much is actually due.  Money is paid late and not to the amount of the estimate which is issued by the Revenue Commissioners and which very often political commentators assume to be due but which usually is only due to about one-fifth of the amount of the actual estimate issued.</P>
    <P>This contributes to a situation of grievance in our community where those in the PAYE sector frequently assume that the total amount of the estimate issued is actually due when in fact only about one fifth of it is due while at the same time as a result of these figures being issued people in the self employed community feel that the figures being published paint those in the self employed sector as owing more than they do.  Therefore, the system is not only costly and cumbersome and failing to collect money which is due but it is contributing to a sense of distrust and mistrust not only of the tax system in general but within the community as between different sections.  The present system also has the major defect that it is a very costly system in terms of the cost of collection.  It is very costly for the Revenue Commissioners in that they have to deploy large numbers of staff to examine every individual account including accounts of taxpayers in respect of which they discover that there is no difficulty at all and the time in retrospect is therefore wasted.  In other words, valuable time which could be used to go after likely evaders is used up in checking and rechecking the accounts of compliant taxpayers. It is also a costly system from the point of view of those paying the tax.  For example, it is estimated that in respect of PAYE paid over by employers the <Col N="837" /> additional cost to the employer of complying with the tax regulations is 6 per cent on top of the amount of PAYE he or she pays.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a study in the United Kingdom on the collection of VAT estimated that the compliance costs with the VAT regulations in Britain, which are similar to ours, amount to about 11 per cent of the amount of VAT actually collected in Britain of which four-fifths falls on those paying the tax, namely, the traders involved. Therefore, we have a system which is, (a), not collecting the money and, (b), is extremely costly so far as the taxpayers are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been estimated that in the United State the administrative costs involved in tax collection as a result of the use there of a system of self assessment are about half those that obtain here and also that their capacity to collect the tax is consideably enhanced. That is why I have decided that we should seek to introduce a system of self assessment in Ireland for tax purposes.  I have decided that we will publish a discussion document setting out the improvements which are to be obtained and also the difficulties which are likely to arise from the introduction of a system of self assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation recommended self assessment.  However, in a very bulky report, a report which ran to literally thousands of pages, the total amount of space devoted to the actual implementation of a self assessment system covered only 14 pages. Fourteen pages in a document of that size does not represent a practical manual which would enable the Revenue Commissioners to administer such a system.  Therefore, before introducing the system we need to take the report of the Commission on Taxation a step further.  We need to bring to this country people who have practical experience in working such a system, who will work in the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="838" /> for a period and who from their experience will advise the Revenue Commissioners on how the different practical difficulties which exist with regard to a self assessment system can be overcome. This is to be done with great speed.</P>
    <P>The group which will consist of one official of the IMF plus two officials who have worked in the United States Inland Revenue will arrive here on 1 December and will present a report to me before the end of the month of December.  They will work for a full period of three weeks in the Revenue Commissioners' headquarters and elsewhere.  They will send in information and advice to me during that three week period at the end of which they will present me with a report. There is no question of any delay being involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions that will have to be answered are the following: (1) the level of deterrents which will be necessary to ensure compliance; (2) whether self assessment requires the introduction of a current year basis for the self employed as far as tax is concerned; (3) will there be an initial revenue loss in the first year; (4) what redeployment of staff is necessary and, (5), what initial additional compliance costs might there be for taxpayers.  The terms of reference of the study are, first, to look at the administrative implications of the introduction of self assessment; secondly, to examine the audit procedures used in tax investigations and, thirdly, to advise on any other matter concerning tax administration and enforcement which the team feel it would be useful for them to advise on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The genesis of this study is that the Government decided last October that there should be an expert from overseas and with experience in this area introduced to the Revenue Commissioners. We consulted a variety of international organisations, including the OECD, which we found did not have the expertise the IMF have.  The IMF said they could give us the name of an individual but they <Col N="840" /> felt that before so it would be better if they did an on-the-spot investigation here with a team of people.  We accepted that advice quickly and they are coming here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They will give us immediate advice on what to do about self assessment and on the other questions of practical improvement in tax administration.  Arising out of that advice and out of further discussions with the IMF team we will decide on any additional expertise we need.  It is my intention to act very quickly on the recommendations received.  As I say, they will be received before the end of December.  I expect to be able to make decisions on these reports early in January and these decisions will be announced promptly so that a more efficient tax system can be implemented starting as quickly as possible.  My concern in this area is to get action on this and by bringing in the best available outside advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was deeply disturbed by the gruesome killing of Mr. Olalia.  This and other violent incidents in the Philippines in recent months have been a cause for continuing concern.  I understand that President Aquino has established a committee of inquiry into the murder and offered a reward for information on those responsible.  For this reason, I have not made any representations to the Government of the Philippines on the matter.</P>
      <P>Ireland along with its partners in the Twelve, fully supports President Aquino in her efforts to end human rights abuses. Last March she set up a presidential committee on human rights to investigate missing persons, killings, torture and other crimes.</P>
      <P>President Aquino has also committed herself to negotiating an end to the armed conflicts which persist in the Philippines. It has been announced that her representatives have signed today an agreement with representatives of the National Democratic Front for a 60-day ceasefire to take effect on 10 December.</P>
      <P>At their meeting in London on 10 November 1986 Foreign Ministers of the Twelve welcomed the significant progress made by President Aquino towards restoring democratic institutions in the Philippines, notably the completion of work on a new draft constitution and looked forward to the national and local elections to be held in the Philippines in 1987.  They emphasised their strong political support for President Aquino in her efforts to consolidate democracy in the Philippines, revive the economy and bring about national reconciliation.</P>

      <P>On 4 November my Department became aware of media reports alleging misuse of Irish passports by US personnel acting with the knowledge of the US authorities.  Immediately on learning of these reports our embassies in Washington and Tehran were instructed to contact the US and Iranian authorities.  I was also personally in contact with the US Ambassador to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of all the information from these conversations I sought a meeting with US Secretary of State, Shultz.  The meeting took place in Vienna on 7 November.  On behalf of the Government I told the Secretary of State that any misuse of Irish passports was totally unacceptable.  The Secretary of State accepted that position.</P>

      <P>The original estimate was £311,000.  The scheme executed is not directly comparable with that originally planned.  Due to site restrictions the original proposal did not meet the Garda needs fully.  The acquisition of extra ground subsequently enabled additional works to be executed to augment the planned scheme.  The actual final cost figure for all works will not be available for some time but is estimated at approximately £400,000. This figure takes account of the additional works.  It also includes the extra cost of wages and materials arising from inflation over the period of the contract and of an increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, both of which are allowable under the contract terms.</P>
      <P>Building works have been completed and the gardaí are in course of occupying the building which should be open to the public in a matter of days.</P>

The health board and the association are discussing alternative locations for the facilities for the elderly. My Department would consider favourably any proposal from the board to include day facilities for the elderly in the proposed new health centre.</P>

      <P>Survivors' pensions are payable to widowers under the social insurance system in limited circumstances, where a woman in receipt of a contributory old age or retirement pension, which included an increase for her husband, dies.  In that situation the widower is entitled to survivor's benefit at the same rate as the contributory widow's pension, provided he is incapable of self-support by reason of infirmity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A widower's pension is also payable <Col N="802" /> under the occupational injuries benefit scheme where an insured woman dies as a result of an occupational accident or disease leaving a dependent widower who is incapable of self-support by reason of infirmity.</P>
    <P>Widowers who are unemployed may qualify for unemployment benefit or assistance under the usual conditions. Widowers with dependent children who are in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance can receive a &ldquo;housekeeper&rdquo; allowance in the form of an increase in payment in respect of a person who has care of the children.</P>
    <P>The provision of pensions to widowers generally on the same lines as the existing schemes for widows would have very significant financial and other implications. This matter will be reviewed however in the context of the examination of the whole area of financial support for single parent families generally in the light of the recommendations made by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 22 August 1986 and her claim was allowed at the appropriate rate.  She received weekly payments of unemployment benefit until 17 September 1986 when her claim was reviewed to establish whether she continued to satisfy the condition of genuinely seeking work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the review, her claim was disallowed from 18 September 1986 on the grounds that she was not genuinely seeking work.  There was no evidence to <Col N="803" /> show that she was making any attempt to find a job.</P>
    <P>She appealed against the disallowance and at an oral hearing on 10 November 1986 she was given the opportunity to present her case.  The appeals officer also disallowed her claim.  She last signed the unemployed register on 13 November 1986.</P>

      <P>Resulting from the implementation of the second phase of the EC directive on equal treatment for men and women in social welfare matters, the person concerned is in receipt of unemployment assistance of £36.60 weekly. This rate includes the special transitional payment of £10 which was awarded to alleviate the loss of an increase in respect of his wife who is receiving disability benefit in her own right at the weekly rate of £41.10.  This rate was increased almost £5 a week under phase one of equal treatment.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the recent Government decision to provide additional relief in cases such as this, the person concerned will now qualify for a further transitional payment of £10 with effect from 19 November 1986, thus increasing his weekly rate to £46.60.  Arrangements have been made to have all arrears due paid to him within the next week.</P>
