      <P>I object to the proposal in the Order of Business to take No. 8 without debate today.  It refers to the Building Control Bill which is being referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation and I was anxious that the referral be debated in the House.  This Bill went through Second Stage nearly two years ago and we are now being asked to refer it to a committee.  There is no indication what this committee will do with the Bill. The Bankruptcy Bill went before a committee and was with it for almost two years.  In this case there is no indication whether the committee will be dealing with Committee Stage.  As far as I am aware, there are no Deputies from The Workers' Party or any independent Deputies on that committee.  The referring of the Bill to the committee is a denial of our rights to have an input on Committee Stage.  For that reason I object very strongly, first of all to the fact that this motion is being taken today without debate and, secondly, to the fact that it is being referred to the committee in this cavalier way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a highly technical one, as indeed was the Bankruptcy Bill.  It seemed appropriate to refer it to the Joint Committee on Legislation which was established for the purpose, <i>inter alia,</i> of dealing with Bills of this kind.  That committee will deal with Committee Stage of the Bill and the Bill will then come back to this House for Report Stage, at which point it will be open to any Deputy to put down amendments. I hope I am right in saying that and that I am not misleading the Deputy. If I am, the Ceann Comhairle will correct me.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 is in the name of Deputy Woods. May I suggest that amendments Nos. 8 and 9 be discussed together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1926" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(a) There shall stand established a fund to be known as the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund.</P>
      <P>(b) The fund shall comprise monies contributed in such sums as shall be agreed between the Minister and any interested business or commercial parties.</P>
      <P>(c) The Minister may by regulations provide for the payment of awards from the fund to interested businesses or commercial parties who would not otherwise be entitled to compensation under the Malicious Injuries Acts 1981 and 1986&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to put forward to the Government the concept of the establishment of a criminal injuries compensation fund.  We know that certain businesses, particularly those in the inner city, have great difficulty in getting insurance cover and they also suffer greatly from crime and vandalism. The effect of the Minister's proposals in the Bill will be to leave those businesses at the mercy of the insurance industry.  We know from experience that some of them cannot get insurance cover. I have spoken to members of the Garda Síochána and they tell me this will create a breeding ground for protection rackets. Many of the businesses will have to give up and move out because they will not be able to obtain insurance.</P>
      <P>There is a special problem here.  It is not a question of distributing the cost of insurance over the population nationally and saying that the impact will not be too great.  The reality is that Dublin suffers more than most places because of insurance costs and this particularly affects small businesses.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses considered the insurance problems of small firms and they saw the need to provide for instances such as those mentioned in our amendment.  In their report they made the following comment:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> We feel that the burden of Property insurance in high risk areas should be shared by the community as a whole, in conjunction with the insurance companies, with the ultimate objective of ensuring that business continues in these areas.</P>
    <P>We see the right of businesses to Property insurance in these high risk areas as being just as important for urban renewal as the existing high levels of Local Authority expenditure on new housing in many of these areas and the urban renewal incentives announced by the Government on 23 October 1985.</P>
    <P>They were deeply concerned about the problems facing businesses particularly in the inner city areas.</P>
    <P>We reiterate the recommendation contained in our Second Report for a scheme which would be confined to designated high risk areas ... this recommendation would be implemented prior to the enactment of the Malicious Injuries Bill 1986.</P>
    <P>They were aware that this Bill would soon be introduced and they could see the adverse effects it would have on businesses in centre city areas.  Deputy Yates was chairman of this committee, Senator Lynch vice-chairman and the committee members were made up of Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators.  They looked at this problem and found it was very serious.  If this or any other committee looked at other facets of this Bill they would find that special problems are being created.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say the Minister for Justice will have discussions with another Minister and that something will come out of these discussions.  That is not the way to proceed with this kind of legislation. The Minister should do his or her homework before he or she comes into this House and he or she should put before us the measures which will deal with the problem that will arise directly as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurers Bureau provide <Col N="1928" /> for cases where no motor insurance is provided.  This is a very valuable administrative arrangement.  In 1985 the bureau paid approximately £8.6 million in claims.  This operation was set up by the industry, operates in conjunction with the Minister and provides a very important service.  The bureau make payments having considered all the circumstances of each case, and they work out the practical difficulties which may arise when companies try to offload particular types of cases.</P>
    <P>If we can have an operation like that for motor insurance, it should be possible to have a criminal injuries compensation fund.  It is not only my view that difficulties will arise as a result of this legislation, but the Oireachtas joint committee have also said this.  Deputies on both sides have highlighted the difficulties they see for businesses, especially small businesses, in the inner city areas of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  I agree that this matter will need detailed consideration and that the Minister will have to decide how this legislation will be implemented.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (c):</P>
    <P>The Minister may by regulations provide for the payment of awards from the fund to interested businesses or commercial parties who would not otherwise be entitled to compensation...</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to consider this matter if this Bill passes, but why not do it now before the Bill comes into law and before the compensation which is available at the moment is removed?  For many people in the affected areas the only insurance they have at present is the malicious injuries compensation.  If the Minister removes that, they are left without any form of compensation and they will have no alternative but to close their businesses.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made about this matter from business people in the inner city in particular, but also from business people throughout the country because they envisage difficulties arising as a result of the passage of this Bill.  There is panic in some areas about this, particularly in Dublin.  In an article <Col N="1929" /> in <i>The Irish Press,</i> 18 March 1986, Tom Coffey of the Dublin City Centre Association took a realistic view and said that insurance companies could not bear continuing losses and claims without raising premiums and that the structural problems in the city would have to be tackled to combat crime and vandalism.  He pointed out that last year the Dublin City Centre Business Association, whose members employ about 15,000 people, published a discussion document entitled &ldquo;Towards a More Efficient Dublin&rdquo; and called for more strategic management of the resources in the city, and in particular, tackling the crime and vandalism problem.</P>
    <P>He went on to say insurance cover for small shops ranges from £600 to over £2,000 a year, depending on the location. Already there is a variation for small shops.  He then said that if the premiums were considered high at that time they would rise dramatically when malicious damages were no longer paid for by the Exchequer.  He said there was no indication given that council rates would fall but the insurance firms would have to make up the difference.  This is a question the business people in the inner city have raised.</P>
    <P>We learned last night that approximately £4 million is going from the local authorities.  If that is not being charged will the rate of the business people particularly in these very hard pressed areas be reduced?  Do the Minister or the Government intend just to take up and use for Exchequer purposes generally the savings which would accrue in that area? I ask the Minister of State when she is commenting to let us know the Government's view on that question as to whether the rates which will be alleviated to the extent of £4 million and which are levied mainly on these business premises will be reduced now as a result of that saving arising from the abolition of malicious injuries compensation.  Do the Government intend to reduce the rates since this money is being contributed directly by the businesses involved who would like to know the Government's <Col N="1930" /> intentions in that respect?  If it is intended to reduce the rates at least they will have some resource to meet the extra insurance charge which will arise and which they will have to pay if they can.</P>
    <P>This very serious problem is one facet of the whole question of removing malicious injuries compensation.  To deal with that we put down amendment No. 8 and we are proposing that the Government meet the business interests and the insurance interests involved in these areas particularly and consider the setting up of a fund such as we propose.  It will be open to the Government to decide subsequently whether they want to contribute to the fund or whether the moneys which will be saved as a result of a reduction in rates could go into that fund.  There is a starter, a straight switch of the £4 million which is being collected from the business community into such a fund.  The Minister of State and her colleagues will have to decide on that.  Our proposition here is to provide something on a parallel with the Motor Insurers' Bureau for businesses and industries, particularly in the inner city areas, and to some extent on the outer city fringes where special circumstances obtain.  The insurance industry, the business interests and the Minister all are involved and have responsibility in this.</P>
    <P>The Government's responsibility arises because of lack of control of crime and vandalism, and as long as crime and vandalism run at the present high level it will be necessary to have some means of dealing with the fall-out from that crime and vandalism.  It seems obvious that if the Government want to apply the Garda resources to these areas to provide the safeguard and back-up required, that can be done.  If it is done it will be effective because we have every confidence that the Garda, if given the opportunity and resources, can deal with the matter. However, the resources being applied to the special problem areas are not adequate to meet the problems in those areas, and as a result the businesses are not receiving the kind of protection they need.  There is the special crime force of approximately 68 members who can be <Col N="1931" /> moved about the city on a flexible basis to give back-up where needed, but they are far too small as a support force for the number of instances of high crime and vandalism.  If the Government were to increase that force they would probably prevent a great deal of vandalism. Therefore the Government have responsibility and an interest.  It is not enough for them just to withdraw the moneys which they are placing into criminal injuries compensation and then take up the £4 million which is already being contributed by the businesses.  I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about amendment No. 8 and particularly about the £4 million which is at present being collected through rates from the businesses and which could be available to use otherwise.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister of State replies to Deputy Woods I would like to make a few brief comments on the section and on the amendment.  I am sure that the Minister of State will agree that as this Bill and its sections are debated, as they have been last night and this morning, it is evident that the terms of the Bill are very far-reaching and will have a very great impact on individuals and property owners.  I do not think that the people who drafted the Bill envisaged that it would or could have the effect which it will have if passed through the House in its present form.  Deputy Woods last night and this morning has pointed out a number of major weaknesses in the Bill which will leave individuals and property owners extremely vulnerable to the many elements in society who are intent deliberately on damaging and destroying property.  The Minister of State pointed out that the Bill made provision for the exclusion of damage caused by whom she identified last night as mainly subversive elements.  I must say to her that other elements are operating in society&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but nonetheless <Col N="1932" /> I must make the point that other elements are operating in society who will deliberately damage property and no protection is being provided for the citizen in the section in that regard.  It is all very fine for the Minister to say that these people can protect their property through insurance, but surely she must know that, particularly in Dublin and urban areas, it is becoming extremely difficult in the first instance to get insurance.  When you get the insurance it is even more difficult to meet the cost of the premiums.  The inevitable result of increased insurance premiums arising from this proposal will be greater overheads in almost every area of operation.  However, I am not so much concerned about that; I am concerned about the effects on the ordinary house-holder, the ordinary family who find it difficult, if not impossible, to provide insurance cover for their family home.  It is quite possible that these homes will be the target at some stage for vandalism. Will we now abandon those people and tell them it is hard luck if their homes are damaged by vandals?  We are now dismantling the only scheme available to compensate people in cases of that kind. Dr. Woods referred to the committee of the House which examined this aspect of insurance and came to the conclusion that society should share the cost of malicious damage to property.  If we abolish this scheme, some alternative emergency fund such as that advocated by Dr. Woods should be seriously considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies.  The suggestion put forward by Deputy Woods would at least be a compromise when the public are abandoned by the Government. It is extremely unfair to put any citizen at risk by doing away with this provision.  The life savings and hard work of men and women have gone into providing a family home.  Crime and vandalism are the products of our failure to <Col N="1933" /> deal effectively with economic and social reform and if we abandon our people in the sense that we have failed to provide jobs for them, will we also abandon them when their homes are damaged by vandals? The Minister should seriously consider introducing some form of compensation fund which would be a safeguard for those who cannot provide adequate insurance for damage done by vandals as a result of the breakdown in law and order.</P>

      <P>I support the views of the previous speakers in relation to a criminal injuries compensation fund. Motorists are compensated as a result of a fund set up to cater for those who have suffered as a result of other motorists not having insurance.  We have serious reservations about this Bill, which must be obvious to the Minister by now.  There is very deep concern at the disregard for property.  The Cavan-Monaghan constituency has suffered more than any other area, especially Monaghan, which has been affected so much as a result of the troubles in Northern Ireland.  Many Government Deputies seem to make light of our case and do not seem to care about the problems in regard to compensation.  The Minister should seriously consider this amendment because we have grave reservations in regard to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister for State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Minister for State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment because there is no question of there being a State subvention available for such a fund and, therefore, there is no reason for my Department or any other Department to have a role in administering a fund of this nature.  The administrative resources necessary would not be available in my Department.  If business or commercial parties are interested in setting up such a fund there is no reason for it not being administered by one of the existing trade associations.  As to the detailed provisions of the amendment, I envisage difficulties in organising a fund where contributions are made on a voluntary basis and, again, I do not see any <Col N="1934" /> role for a Government Department in involving themselves and trying to secure agreement on the amount of such contributions.</P>
      <P>The final paragraph of the Deputy's amendment is so widely framed that it could cover any kind of damage, even that covered by insurance.  With regard to the obtaining of insurance, to which Deputy Woods referred, in this amendment the Deputy is attempting to deal with cases where businesses might have difficulty in obtaining insurance cover as a result of this Bill.  As I said in my reply on Second Stage, we recognise the concern expressed by Deputies and I informed the House that the Minister for Justice would contact the Minister for Industry and Commerce about the matter.  As a result, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce is taking up the matter with the insurance industry with a view to seeing if there is any way to help to alleviate any problems which may arise.  As part of that consultation process, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce could raise the question of a fund of the type in question but, as I said, there would be no question of any State support.  It would, however, be open to interested businesses to approach the insurance industry directly in the matter and this may be more appropriate.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to the Motor Insurers' Bureau but the major difference between motor insurance and property insurance is that there is a minimum insurance requirement in law for motor vehicles and there is no such requirement in regard to property.  Therefore, one cannot draw a direct parallel with the Motor Insurers' Bureau.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods asked about the saving to local authorities.  Of course, this will vary, but it will be a matter for local authorities to decide how they will use such savings which will accrue as a result of passing the Bill.  With regard to Deputy Hyland's point, the Bill will have little or no effect on house insurance or on its availability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in effect is saying that no provision has been made and that, although discussions may take place afterwards, no homework has been done in advance of this measure being passed.  It is purely a sop to suggest that a Junior Minister at another Department will have a chat with somebody about the matter and that the Minister for Justice has no responsibility in this area.  The responsibility which I see resting with the Minister for Justice in this area is that he is responsible for law and order, which has broken down in many areas.  Businesses are suffering as a result and, therefore, the Minister is responsible.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to cast aside these people and say that once he gets it out of this Act he has no responsibility any more and it is somebody else's worry. The Minister should be saying he is not prepared to do away with this malicious injuries code until other arrangements are made to deal with the victims of crime and vandalism.  That is his responsibility if he is in any way concerned about the victims of crime.</P>
      <P>It can be argued that a business which subscribes to an insurance company for many years and then has a major fire which, it transpires, is maliciously caused and where this only occurs every 20, 30 or 50 years, should be able to claim from an insurance company in any event.  But that is not what we are talking about.  We are talking about shops and businesses being repeatedly vandalised.  One shop I know of was raided 13 times in the last three months and vandalised.  How can normal insurance deal with that?  It is not a normal situation and these people are in that position because of the breakdown of law and order because of the Minister's inability or unwillingness to tackle this basic problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This happens not only in the city centre but throughout the country.  I have had letters from business people around the country who are worried about the impact of this on their business.  One of the letters I received, dated 22 July 1985 attaches a copy of an endorsement which is being issued by insurance companies. It says that it looks as if our Government <Col N="1936" /> are considering doing away with this Act; that those who are pressing for doing away with the Malicious Damages Act on the basis that such claims should be met by the insurance companies are not conversant with the facts of life for insurance companies who have a right of selection; that as malicious damages claims are likely to occur he cannot see insurance companies renewing a policy following such claims.  They were given a malicious damages endorsement applied on 16 July 1985 because of the Government's intention in this area.  The endorsement states that if during the currency of this policy the right of the insured to compensation for malicious damage to property is removed or diminished as a result of the repeal or amendment of the Malicious Injuries Act, 1981, the company reserves the right to alter the scope and/or terms of cover provided by the policy with effect from the date of any such legislative change.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot come back afterwards and say these problems were only discovered after the Bill was debated in the Dáil.  The Minister cannot say afterwards that I did not point out here in the House the problems the Government are creating for ordinary business people who are trying to make a living and cannot manage to do so because the Government will not put the resources into dealing with the question of law and order. The Minister cannot come back later and say nobody told them about this.  There have been a whole series of submissions which I am sure the Minister has also received.  Many articles have appeared in the newspapers reporting threats made to people in shops in Dublin.  It is almost impossible to get insurance cover so that a very serious problem is expected to arise in the Dublin area in particular.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 is as follows:</P>
    <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(a) Applications in accordance with the Acts shall be made to a tribunal which shall be known as the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> (b) The Minister may by regulations provide for the constitution and procedures of the Tribunal.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are not trying to tie the Minister down to every detail here.  The Minister said my provisions are too wide.  But it is intended to give the Minister and nobody else power to act within that.  In amendment No. 9 I am suggesting that we should have a tribunal known as the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. I ask the Minister to seriously consider this.  I ask the Minister to include in that tribunal some of the areas I mentioned last night, for example, community centres, charitable organisations, primary schools which are suffering a great deal at the moment, and sporting organisation which may be designated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous for the Government to remove the protection from those voluntary groups.  I do not know where the Minister and the people on that side of the House live; who they talk to or who they are in contact with.  The insurance for a simple community centre is now over £2,000 a year.  For bigger centres it is a great deal more.  What will happen to them when this Act is removed?  They will not be able to pay this insurance, and these are all people who are putting their time and sweat and energy into combating crime and vandalism by providing other outlets for young people in the community. That applies to the sporting organisations, the community centres and so on.  These are great people, marvellous citizens doing tremendous work voluntarily and giving of their own time in these areas.  They will find it hard to continue in the business they are in, a totally constructive and helpful business for which they receive nothing but the satisfaction of helping young people.</P>
    <P>I suggest there should be a criminal injuries compensation tribunal to take up some of these areas.  The malicious injuries code could be amended and altered and filed down but certain items which deserve support should be continued under it.  It could be taken away from the court process and personal <Col N="1938" /> criminal injuries could be tied in with that.  This morning before I came here I met people, as I do each morning in the constituency, and one of those people was the parent of a 17-year-old doing his leaving certificate who was mugged in St. Anne's Park on the north side, going home innocently in the evening with a friend of his.  They were set upon by five or six young men.  He was beaten on the head with a metal object by one of the gang.  The medical people thought the damage was not too serious at first, but he has been receiving treatment in the Richmond Hospital.</P>

      <P>Damage to spectacles, dentures and any such items is covered. Since 1 April last, compensation for his pain and suffering will no longer be paid. I had to tell his parents that, if this attack had occured before 1 April, he would have been compensated for the pain and suffering, just as he would still be in the North of Ireland and England &mdash; but not under this Government now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting that the Minister should redraft the whole scheme, taking in personal injury compensation, criminal and malicious injuries and damage to property and having them dealt with under one tribunal.  The Personal Injuries Compensation Tribunal has been very successful.  It has worked very well and there are no legal expenses.  The average cost is low.  It deals with people who are mugged, as well as those whose property is damaged.  The Minister should set up a criminal injuries compensation tribunal and let it deal with both aspects.  If she does not do that, then on return to <Col N="1939" /> Government we will do it and rationalise the situation.  We will compensate people for their pain and suffering.  The treatment meted out to those who are the victims of crime is little short of scandalous.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Government can come to the House repeatedly with repressive measures, with the present high incidence of crime and vandalism. I come across such cases every day and have become incensed at the treatment which people are recieving from the Government.  This Bill is a clear example of such treatment, both in relation to personal injuries and to damage to property.  Personal property is, of course, included under the Malicious Injuries Act and it is proposed to wipe this out.  I do not know if Deputies on the other side of the House fully realise what is happening in that respect.  I object very strenuously to it.</P>
    <P>If a person comes to the assistance of a member of the Garda Síochána in the case of a stolen car, there will be no malicious claim with regard to the car which may be damaged.  The pain and suffering of the individual concerned will not be compensated, either.  The Government's proposals here are entirely unsatisfactory. They are not appropriate to the age in which we are living.  It is ridiculous for Deputies to refer back to legislation of 1836 as justification for action being taken in the present onslaught of crime.  It shows how far removed the Government are from the reality of crime.  The amendment of the Malicious Injuries Act is an unwarranted attack on the victims of crime.  It is removing their twin props which are, compensation for pain, suffering and loss and loss of and damage to property.</P>
    <P>In replying to amendment No. 9, I ask the Minister to give us some of the information which was not available last night and which she undertook to provide this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy seems to be suggesting in respect of amendment No. 9 is that a tribunal and not this House <Col N="1940" /> should decide who should be entitled to compensation.  We could not agree to this.  The actual wording of the amendment would not allow this, in any event. The phrase &ldquo;in accordance with the Acts&rdquo; means that the Act would determine who is entitled to compensation and the tribunal would have no discretion. The only effect of the amendment would be to transfer responsibility for administering the malicious injuries scheme from local authorities and the court to a criminal injuries compensation tribunal to be established.</P>
      <P>As was stated in the introductory remarks on the Second Stage debate on the Bill, the question of transferring the whole burden of administering the scheme to a central authority was debated at some length during the passage of the 1981 Act through the Oireachtas. Valid arguments were presented both for and against local authority involvement. These arguments crossed party lines.  The Government favour the continued involvement of local authorities for very much the same reasons as were advanced in favour of such involvement during the debates on the 1981 Act.  The involvement of local authorities means that the services of their professional and other staff can be used at minimal cost in processing malicious injuries claims on the spot.</P>

      <P>The services of professional and other staff will be at a minimal cost, rather than having the expense of a new structure.  On the other hand, to transfer the responsibility to a tribunal would necessitate the setting up of a new and expensive organisation with legal and other specialist staff which would greatly increase the cost of the scheme, while the <Col N="1941" /> removal of the responsibility from local authorities in respect of the very restricted scheme now proposed would hardly effect significant savings to them.  I oppose this amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's request for information which I gave a commitment last evening to supply, he sought figures for compensation paid out under the malicious injuries scheme in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  I gave the figures for the Dublin city and county areas.  I shall repeat the figures for those areas now.  I have the figures for the years 1980 to 1984, inclusive.

      <P>Yes, it was a survey of 500 claims in relation to the postal districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the transfer to the criminal injuries compensation.  It would not necessarily involve this transfer.  I know that the Minister has to say something against it.  It does not necessarily mean an administrative transfer of the whole system.  It is very amusing that after this Bill is passed there will not be anything to worry about in terms of transfer.  There may be some residual cases to be dealt with but there will be very few new cases.  If we do not have any bombs and explosions by subversive organisations there will not be anything left.  I do not think the administration <Col N="1943" /> will be a burden on anyone in the future because there will not be anything to administer.</P>
    <P>In relation to the procedure, if there is to be a criminal injuries compensation tribunal then the normal administration of the collection or gathering of information could process through the local authorities.  There will be a decision in relation to the operation of the scheme and the criminal injuries tribunal for compensation for criminal injuries personally inflicted.  That tribunal works very efficiently. As the Minister knows, the cases are dealt with very speedily and effectively by that tribunal.  If there was a modified scheme &mdash; I am not talking about a wiped out scheme such as the one we have here because there would be nothing much left to administer after this Bill goes through &mdash; then I believe there would be scope for a tribunal to decide on these matters.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 (b) states that the Minister may by regulation provide for the constitution and procedures of the tribunal.  That leaves to another day the preparation of the regulations which would apply to this tribunal.  If we could get the Government to agree today that there should be a tribunal which would deal with these matters and that there are some aspects of this scheme which are worthy of being continued, then we would feel that we had done a service to the community.  The Minister said that there would be very little left after the passing of the Act, and I agree with her. I am suggesting that the way to go about it is to modify it, to amend it, to change it and to reduce the expenditure where this is possible, but to leave a scheme that meets the requirements of those who need it most and those who are the most hard hit victims of crime and vandalism which we experience today.  It is for that reason that I proposed that there should be a tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not seem to be disposed towards accepting this concept.  I can understand that.  I appreciate the Minister's position.  The Minister is here under particular riding instructions. <Col N="1944" /> She has been told by the Minister for Justice and the Government to push this thing through and to have done with it. The Government have decided to wash their hands of the victims of crime by virtually abolishing the compensation scheme.  The Minister for Justice told us that the purpose of the Bill is to reduce the impact on the Exchequer.  I appreciate the Minister's position and, of course, he is not disposed to make any compromise in the circumstances.  The step being taken here is a very uncompromising hard faced act by the Government, pulling the prop from under the victims of crime in the same way as they did in cases of personal injury.</P>
    <P>The local authorities will be the organisations who will pass on claims to the tribunal for decision.  At the moment the tribunal dealing with personal injuries are very efficient.  Can the Minister tell us what her estimate is of the administrative cost of the scheme &mdash; the cost to the local authorities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That reply highlights what I have been talking about.  We do not know what we are talking about because the costs have not been quantified.  We do not have even an estimate, and this points to the fact that the Government simply decided to do away with compensation for the victims of crime.  They do not even want to spend too much time considering what the cost is.  It is obvious that the Government have not considered the cost of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a big point that the scheme will be administered by the local authorities.  When I ask a simple question I am told the Government have not even considered the matter.  They say: &ldquo;We will give you an odd sop, and please do not annoy us&rdquo;.  The Labour Party are trotting along blindly behind the Government. I warn them that the fall-out will be considerable and serious.  What does the Minister think would happen if there was a referendum on this subject?  How would the people vote?  Are we not lucky to have a Constitution to protect the <Col N="1945" /> people?  However, we are doing away with juries in civil cases because there is no constitutional safeguard to them as there is in the case of juries in criminal cases.  There is no constitutional protection for the victim of crime.</P>
    <P>I will be putting this amendment to the House as a gesture to show that there are alternatives to this Bill.  The victims of crime will suffer.  This morning I spoke to the parents of a young man who is in the Richmond Hospital as a result of injuries received.  I told them that from 1 April the son will not get compensated for his pain and suffering because the Government wiped out the scheme of compensation.  In future I will have to tell people that any damage to their property will not be compensated for by the Government.</P>
    <P>The week before last I met a man who had suffered injuries while helping the Garda to arrest two car thieves.  A car theft was reported and the Garda gave chase.  The stolen car was damaged and in the process two other cars were damaged. One of the thieves was aged 19 and the other was 16 years of age.  A CIE bus driver on his way home tackled the bigger one &mdash; the two boys had left the car when it crashed.  The bus driver hurt his shoulder while helping the Garda who then got out of their car and apprehended the two people.  That man has to try to drive a bus but he will not get compensation for his pain and suffering because the scheme was done away with on 1 April.  If any of his personal belongings were damaged while he was tackling the car thief he will not get compensation. These are the things the Government are doing.  Incidents like I have just referred to should be a warning to the victims of crime.  They should be a warning to Labour Deputies who, I am sure, have people calling to their doors every week. The props are being pulled from under the victims of crime.</P>
    <P>I met the people who are running the victims' support groups and they are very worried.  What will they tell victims of crime in future?  They meet many victims and they should be able to tell those victims that the State will look after them <Col N="1946" /> and help them.  They should be able to tell them to go to the Criminal Injuries Tribunal.  All that they can tell them now is that they will receive no compensation. Those groups are finding this difficult and embarrassing.  In Northern Ireland and Britain if a person receives personal injuries the State steps in and gives support. As well, the State is there to see that people will be looked after if their property is damaged.</P>
    <P>All I can do is to warn the Government about the realities.  There is a way to deal with these problems and make savings but not to the extent to which the Government want to make them.  These savings could be made by following the lines we have suggested in the proposals we made both last night and this morning. There should be a criminal injuries compensation tribunal which will in a <i>bona fide</i> way compensate for real losses and ensure that people are compensated both for personal injuries and for damage to their property or belongings.</P>
    <P>That is what I am suggesting the Government should do.  We will do so if the Government do not.  There has to be a statutory system to deal with the question of support to victims of crime.  If the previous scheme had been a statutory one, the Government could not have wiped it out at the stroke of a pen on 1 April.  Because it was not statutory this mean and uncaring Government, after blindfolding their backbenchers, made a change from 1 April.  That will come home to roost.  More and more people will find the Government do not care for them when they are victims of crime. They will come along to their Deputies and to the tribunal and ask what is wrong and that there does not seem to be anything for them.  People will have to say to them the Government are not interested and have closed down this scheme.  They have done away with compensation for pain and suffering.  That has many implications. In some cases the physical damage to a person may be small and the damage in terms of property may be small but the real damage is the trauma which arises from rape and mugging.  It is principally <Col N="1947" /> their loss of security.  Their traumas and fears become very real after the experiences of crime and mugging.</P>
    <P>Previous Governments used to say that they were concerned and would compensate, even in some small way.  There were modest compensations.  Average compensation was £4,500.  There was nothing wild about that.  Even those pursuing Thatcherite policies could not regard that as being very big.  The trouble was that there were too many of them.  Too many of these ordinary, common citizens were coming along with this type of problem. We had to stop them.  The problem was not the size of the individual claim, it was not even the legal expenses, it was just that there were too many citizens coming along.  They were a nuisance and a drain on the Exchequer.  The solution for too many victims was to pull away the compensation which they had.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his Second Stage speech said that the involvement of local authorities means that the services of their professional and other staff can be used at a minimal cost in processing malicious injuries claims.  I would like to ask the Minister of State if discussions have taken place with local authorities regarding how this scheme will be administered and operated in the future.  How will the county council staff and the Garda, who will have to be brought in on a number of cases, be compensated? Also on Second Stage I drew attention to an anomaly which exists in the present Act.  We had a situation in County Monaghan where the Garda superintendent refused to certify a claim which was attributable to the troubles in Northern Ireland.  As a result, there was an award for £300,000 for a private house.  While the council were reimbursed to the tune of £230,000, it meant a loss of £70,000.  When the Garda superintendent refused, the county council had no forum of appeal against his decision, not even to the Ombudsman.  This is an area which should be examined, because in all cases there is a form of appeal.  In that instance the local authority had no <Col N="1948" /> form of appeal.  As a result, it cost them a substantial amount of money which they did not have.  This should be examined closely.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the House that in his Second Stage speech the Minister indicated that no amendments would be considered or accepted which would involve a cost factor.  This is a cost saving measure.  It seems extraordinary that Deputy Woods can talk about savings.  He spent last night and this morning introducing and suggesting numerous cost factors or measures which would increase spending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment No. 9, in which he suggested the setting up of another organisation, is nonsense. The work of the local authority in terms of administering the scheme is at a minimal cost with the exception of Dublin.  I did not answer the Deputy on that, but it is a minimal cost.  It is there and it is professional people who deal with claims.  It is nonsense on the Deputy's part to talk about setting up a separate tribunal.  In today's terms there would be very expensive costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Leonard also asked about providing some appeals mechanism if a certificate is refused by a chief superintendent. The example he quoted was in relation to a non-statutory scheme under which the Government reimburse local authorities the full cost of compensation awarded against them for damage caused by the use of explosives relating to disturbances in Northern Ireland.  Under the new scheme the full costs of all awards will be met by the Exchequer.  That scheme will terminate once the Bill comes into effect.  There would then be a statutory scheme in its place.  A question on whether an organisation of the type mentioned in section 2 of the Bill was involved will in the event of a dispute on the issue be decided upon by the courts.  Provision of a certificate by the chief superintendent is intended to help <Col N="1949" /> the applicant prove that such an organisation was involved.  If the chief superintendent refuses to give a certificate, it will be open to the applicant to use other evidence to prove to the court that such an organisation was involved.  In the light <Col N="1950" /> of that, there does not seem to be the need for any further appeals mechanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), lines 16 to 18, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) The Minister may grant a licence to An Post or subsidiary thereof authorising the holding on behalf of the Minister of the National Lottery.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give effect to what has been stated by the Minister, his predecessor and by the Government outside the House, namely, that the authorised legal person will be An Post.  The Bill as it stands reads:</P>
      <P>(a) The Minister may grant a licence to a person authorising the holding on behalf of the Minister of the National Lottery.</P>
      <P>(b) Not more than one licence under this subsection shall be in force at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If ever there was a Bill in which the <Col N="1955" /> general statement of intent, outside the House and during the Second Stage debate, is not reflected in the terms of the Bill, this is it.  If the intention is to give authorisation to An Post to conduct this lottery, then there is no reason, certainly not in drafting or in law, for not mentioning An Post specifically in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The last day the Minister said to do this would be unduly restrictive.  I do not see how he can suggest that to do what he said he proposed to do, and is determined to do, is unduly restrictive.  If someone says his firm and exclusive intention is to appoint An Post, then I do not see how he can argue that it would be unduly restrictive if that were written into the legislation.  In this instance we are taking the Minister up on the statements which he made and which emerged from the Government, since this lottery was announced.  We simply want this translated into legal effect.  May I suggest that we take my amendment No. bl with this amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment b1 proposes that we delete &ldquo;10&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;5&rdquo;.  Subsection (3) reads as follows:</P>
      <P>When a licence is granted to a person for the first time, the duration of the licence shall be such period not exceeding 10 years as the Minister may determine;</P>
      <P>On the last occasion the Minister said that if we inserted An Post specifically it would make the legislation restrictive because, if at any time the Government wanted to change the licensee, they would be confined by legislation.  My case is that legislation can be changed by a very simple amendment.  I do not believe it would meet with opposition in this House if the Minister of the day came here and said there were good and cogent reasons why we should delete the provision for An Post and substitute somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I proposed that a period of <Col N="1956" /> ten years be deleted and substituted by five years is that the specific and exclusive designation of An Post would come up for review within five years.  That does not mean that An Post will not have their licence renewed; it means that the Minister of the day would be empowered to renew the licence.  I am not arguing about why An Post were selected because that discussion is over.</P>
    <P>We are not prepared &mdash; and if the Coalition were in Opposition they would not be prepared either &mdash; to empower the Government to nominate any person to run the lottery.  I can think of a number of persons with substantial funds who might be contributing to the Government parties at present, or who might contribute to our party in Government, or who might even contribute to both, who would like to get their hands on this lottery which has as near to a guaranteed income as one is ever likely to get under State control and regulation.  No one in this House could stand over a provision which said that, although they know what the Government would like, the Bill entitles the Government to give the authorisation to any person.  We do not accept that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment which deals with the nomination of An Post as the company with the franchise for the National Lottery.  Government statements made outside this House have no legal standing.  The public are not prepared to accept a pig in a poke, and during the recent referendum they were not prepared to accept statements made by Ministers outside the House.  Last Thursday they decided to vote on what was in the Act.  In this case the same is <Col N="1957" /> true.  We are very sceptical of the Minister's statement as regards the allocation of this franchise to An Post.</P>
      <P>As Fianna Fáil spokesman for Posts and Telegraphs and Communications I know a number of pressures were mounted for the Government to appoint one of the national handlers, Frank Flannery and Company, to front a very large organisation to take on this position.  At the Cabinet table An Post won out at the end of the day due, to some extent, to the involvement of the Labour Ministers who had to support a legitimate semi-State organisation.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment and to nominate An Post as the company which will be allocated the franchise for the national lottery.  Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment to reduce the number of years from ten to five makes it even more attractive for the Government to accept both amendments.  The Minister will not lose face if he makes a decision here and now to accept those very reasonable, well thought out amendments which will improve the standing of the national lottery in the public mind.  An Post have already geared up to receive the franchise and are in a position to mount this lottery on behalf of the Government and they will be doing an excellent job for the Government and the Department of Finance in operating this franchise.  An Post have a very efficient management team and over 2,000 outlets throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Labour Party Members who are not present to support that very important semi-State company. The union representing the workers of that company is a strong supporter of the Labour Party.  Therefore, the party should support the union and the workers in An Post by guaranteeing that An Post will be the company awarded the franchise. Statements by Ministers outside or inside this House are not regarded with great credibility, and let us be honest about that.  Quite a number of statements were made here about a proposal to set up a commission to organise the streets of <Col N="1958" /> Dublin.  That proposal has been turned down and will not become legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Very elaborate press conferences were mounted to announce that proposal.  The same applies to many other proposals which the Government have announced outside this House.  By supporting Deputy O'Kennedy's amendments we will improve the Bill and make An Post the company who will be allocated the franchise, and guarantee that in legislation.  If that does not prove satisfactory or work out well the Government will be in a position in five years to review the position under the provisions of the Bill.  I believe that An Post will be in permanent possession of the lottery if it is allocated to them.</P>
      <P>If this legislation is passed without our amendment the Government again will come under mounting pressure from some of their national handlers to have this franchise allocated to strong Fine Gael supporters and that will destroy this lottery once and for all. Over 51 per cent of the people would not support a Fine Gael-fronted lottery.</P>

      <P>Now I can see very clearly what the Opposition problem is, but I think they are unduly concerned.  Deputy Leyden's contribution is contradictory of what Deputy O'Kennedy said.  Deputy Leyden talked about the Labour Party being very closely associated with An Post and the workers of An Post and about that being a reason for them to support this but Deputy O'Kennedy made it very clear that he did not want to see that kind of association by implication with any Government party selecting either supporters or people who would be sympathetic to their policies.  That seems to be a contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us leave that aside and talk about what is in front of us.  Deputy Leyden said that we should accept these reasonable amendments because they are well thought out and carefully considered.  I submit that they have not been well thought out and carefully considered.  Let <Col N="1959" /> us look at the body of legislation before us and see what the Bill attempts to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a habit of saying that.  Let us see what the section attempts to do.  The precautions in other parts of the Bill that affect this section are absolutely essential.  &ldquo;Scrutiny&rdquo; is a key word in the Bill and not only by one set of auditors but by two sets of auditors because we are dealing with the public's money and we must be very careful.  The Minister must also be very careful because every aspect of the operation and performance of the lottery as set up under the Bill and the dealings with public money must be accounted for.  I have no doubt that neither Deputy O'Kennedy nor Deputy Leyden who in future could be Ministers wants to put a Minister into a position where he has to answer for irregularities or inflexible measures in the Bill which would cause public concern about the use of this money, because the buck will stop with the Minister.  Without saying much about it, let me refer to the only experience we have had in relation to a sweepstake lottery.  There was a great deal of public concern about that, to which I referred on Second Stage. Nobody here wants to be put under a microscope at this time.  What was acceptable or what one could have turned a blind eye to 20 or 30 years ago would not be acceptable now.  In fairness, this is a very well compiled Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the section, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the section.  Under the amendment we are discussing we are considering whether we will put the name &ldquo;An Post&rdquo; into the Bill. If I say &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; it is because I am talking about other aspects of the Bill which refer to this section.  With respect to An Post, if the name of any company is inserted in the Bill then the Minister and the Government of the day are tied into going <Col N="1960" /> along with that company no matter how their performance turns out.  I wish An Post every success in their joint venture with the Government but there is no guarantee that it will be a success.  I would like to draw Deputy O'Kennedy's attention to this.  He said that to all intents and purposes we are talking about guaranteed income.  I submit that that is the interpretation that most people have.  It is almost guaranteed income.  It is a question of collecting the money and, provided you are not totally inefficient, there will be a bonanza at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>I am sure that, as I asked on Second Stage, limits will be put by the Minister on the earnings and administrative and overhead costs in the running of the lottery, but has Deputy O'Kennedy considered failure?  Has he considered losses?  These things sometimes fail.  For example, a lottery in North America lost $50 million in its first year's operation. What would happen if An Post lost $50 million, $40 million or $10 million in the first year of operation?  What would happen if the lottery was so unfortunate or badly run that it continued to make losses and it was written into legislation that An Post were to run this?  I know that the Minister may have other strict powers under the Bill to meet those circumstances but I see no good reason for putting anyone's name in.  We have had recent failures of semi-State companies. Deputy Leyden has a very close association with An Post because of his spokesmanship in the last couple of years and he has confidence in them.  I have confidence in them but we have had failures, very big failures, and the fall back has been on the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister removed a section because of criticism, which is a generous concession.  This section is also protected by other sections &mdash; for example, the setting up and appointment of a scrutineer to look after the operations on behalf of the Minister at certain times. The definition of a lottery is a game of chance or mixed chance and skill.  That also applies to football pools, and it may well be that the company running this lottery will need more help which the <Col N="1961" /> Minister may have to consider under the powers reserved to him in the Bill.  He may consider putting in a section whereby the company, with his approval, could enter into a lottery with other organisations, perhaps in different countries. There would be benefits to be gained from this and perhaps he might wish to work in tandem with Littlewoods or a lottery in Massachusets which would attract American tourists here as a result of offering trips to Ireland as a prize in the lottery.  It would boost the coffers, but there is no guarantee that it would be a success and that is why the Minister should immediately appoint a scrutineer when the company are established so that the company can be helped to get off the ground successfully.  In this case An Post are involved, but no matter who are involved they are breaking new ground. We can gain from the experience of lotteries in other countries, some of which have been successful.  They have mainly succeeded in collecting money, which was their objective in the first place.</P>
    <P>I can see the worries of the Opposition and, as Deputy O'Kennedy reasonably said, if the shoe were on the other foot we would be looking for guarantees that patronage would not be distributed on behalf of the Government to any particular body.  This Bill is to protect the citizens and the Minister and it is much better not to include the name of a company because there would be difficulties in the future, in the event of failure, in regard to extracting the company from the legislation. I venture to say, as a means of reassuring Deputies O'Kennedy and Leyden, that it is extremely unlikely that anyone will ever be able to take the running of the lottery away from An Post, no matter what happens because of the pressure by employees and because the Minister has removed a section of the Bill.  There would be a public outcry and the Labour Party, if they are associated with An Post, would consider that An Post should retain the running of the lottery.</P>
    <P>If the lottery is a money-spinner, I hope it will not be at a cost to the State, or just for the sake of creating jobs, as is <Col N="1962" /> the case with the Army, which is costing £272 million per year.  I am worried about the efficient operation of the company.  I concede that I thought An Post would be written into the legislation and I was surprised at the omission.  It was an enlightened and perspicacious decision because it ensures the flexibility which the people demand.  The options of the Government and the Minister of the day should be open to monitoring and examining the performance of the company running the lottery on behalf of the State, because there is always public criticism and an outcry when a semi-State body loses money or fails.  Even the employees of these organisations have never demanded that they should be allowed to operate if the company are losing money. In the last few years the Government have tried to make semi-State bodies operate on a commercial basis and that has been the policy in regard to An Post. They successfully brought in two captains of industry to An Post and Bord Telecom and there is no doubt that the chief executive of An Post intends to do the same here.  They will set up a separate subsidiary which will have to work in order to survive.  If legislation is required to keep a business in existence I submit that such a business should not be kept going.</P>
    <P>The company running the lottery will, by their performance and profits, stand on their own two feet and, if they do not, it behoves the Minister of the day to withdraw their licence at the time of renewal or before it.  If I were on the Opposition side I would point to the other sections of the Bill which I cannot now mention because the Chair has guided me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope the operation will be successful and, later on, I will have the opportunity to talk about the job creation possibilities in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Goodwill is the hallmark of my political approach. Deputy O'Kennedy will accept that I have very carefully monitored the Second Stage debate and have taken on board a number of the points made by speakers on both sides of the House.  That approach is in accordance with my conception of parliamentary democracy.</P>
      <P>On this issue I cannot agree with the Opposition.  Deputy Skelly has covered the ground quite fully and has cleared the air on this point very well.  Essentially what we are putting through the House is legislation to enable the Minister to appoint a licensee to operate the national lottery on his behalf.  If we are talking about enabling legislation it is neither necessary nor appropriate that the group nominated to run the lottery should be identified in the Bill.  It must also be borne in mind that there are a number of conditions precedent to the award of the licence that have to be discussed between the Minister and the propective licensee and therefore, in the immediate sense or looking further down the line, it would be quite anomalous to specify who the licensee would be.  The practicality of the situation is that the Government have decided to enter into an arrangement with An Post to run the lottery through a subsidiary to be specially established for that purpose.  There have been many discussions between my officals and An Post on this issue.  These discussions are proceeding very satisfactorily and I have no doubt that they will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion very quickly after the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore at this stage I would suggest that on this issue Deputy O'Kennedy is like Don Quixote charging at windmills and his collegue Deputy Leyden is like Sancho assisting in the charge, scattering a few innuendos en route that stretch <Col N="1964" /> fiction to its limit.  These innuendos are so ridiculous that I would not even bother to deal with them.  Reason and logic support the approach adopted by me on this suggestion.  I have listened very carefully to the points made by the Opposition. Accommodating as I have been on this Bill, I see no grounds for altering the view I have that this section should stand as an enabling section.  On the passing of the Bill the Minister can complete the arrangements with An Post.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifies that a licensee is appointed for a period not exceeding ten years.  When the Government made their decision in relation to An Post they decided that the first licence granted to An Post would be for ten years.  The duration of any subsequent licence will be determined by the Minister of the day. There are considerations to be borne in mind in relation to the initial licence. There is the question of starting up costs, capital expenditure, the possibility of online computer facilities and so on, and it does not make sense to proceed with an arrangement which would involve a fair amount of State expenditure without a reasonable guarantee of the continuance of the initial appointee.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate any problem about the way An Post will handle this operation and there are other provisions in the Bill which protect the Minister.  I speak about these in general terms and not specifically in relation to An Post.  There is an entitlement under section 30 to issue a directive, to revoke the licence in certain circumstances, or to put in a manager or administrator on behalf of the Minister. So the Minister's position is fully and adequately protected.  In all these circumstances, having talked out the situation and bearing in mind the way I have reacted to the points raised on other sections&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant by way of corroboration of the fact that I have <Col N="1965" /> seriously looked at all the points raised and have modified my approach on a number of sections, taking on board points raised by people on both sides of the House.  But on this issue I suggest that Deputy O'Kennedy should agree with me that this section should stand.  Reason and logic dictate that it should stand.  On that basis I suggest that he might consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>The issue here is not the Minister's bona fides; it is not whether the Minister has responded to points made on Second Stage; it is not the intentions of the Minister or the kind of political representative he is or the manner in which he discusses things in the House. If it were I could sit down now and say &ldquo;Thank you very much&rdquo;.  The issue is that the Oireachtas is charged with giving effect in law to what we propose and want to do.  Then the law as passed is the only guarantee that it will be done.  It is time that we, whether as Ministers or as officials advising Ministers, became much more precise in presenting legislation. Good intentions mean nothing.  The courts say every day of the week that what is stated even in this House is of no consequence when it comes to an issue to be determined in law.  The Bill as passed into law is what is important.  That is the reality.  Generalisations do not come into it, and I hope the Minister will not think I am being unreasonable or unduly critical when I say he has generalised, that he says it is neither necessary nor appropriate to be specific.  That is not good enough.  If the Minister gave me authority, legal, parliamentary or otherwise, to support that statement I would say that perhaps I could listen and be influenced.  However, a general statement of intent and the statement that it is neither necessary or appropriate to be specific is not good enough, more particularly because &mdash; and I do not want to turn the Minister's own words against him &mdash; he went as near as makes no difference to actually contradicting what he was arguing for.  I will remember to take up this very important and enlightening point when we resume this debate.</P>

I do not understand what the Deputy is getting at, or the purpose of this.  I am very anxious to secure the success of the occasion.  Whatever proposals the Opposition make in regard to it, I shall certainly want to consider constructively.  I shall consider the suggestion made by the Deputy and enter into communication immediately with his party on the matter.</P>

      <P>The total number of temporary posts being created in the Central Statistics Office for the computation and analysis of the 1986 census of population is 181.  These comprise 72 in 1985, 104 in 1986 and five in 1987.  The 72 posts in 1985 were met by direct levy on Civil Service Departments, 52 and AnCO, 20.  The 104 posts in 1986 are being met by a levy imposed on the wider non-commercial public service. The ministerial functional areas for the levy are as follows: Health 29 posts, Environment 29, Agriculture 20, Industry and Commerce 12, Labour ten, Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry two and Public Service two.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the posts to be levied as between the different bodies under his control would be a matter for each Minister, subject to overall coordination by the Minister for the Public Service in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  A decision on the filling of the five posts in 1987 has not yet been made.  As regards cost, the procedure is designed so that there will be no net cost on the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that these are temporary positions and that with the high unemployment we have in the country it would be an opportunity for the Government to give part time employment to some unemployed people?  Does he not agree that, due to the fact that positions are being frozen within the public service and particularly at local authority level where there is already a reduction in finances, he is eroding the level of service available to the people from the local authorities throughout the land?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree. We are talking about 29 posts in about 34 local authorities, which is infinitesimal. The Deputy should agree that we are trying to do this job, which is a short term job, within the total public service wage bill.  The way we are doing it results in a saving.  It would cost the State £339,000.  It is an exercise in good financial management and generally good management overall.  That is the way we should be looking at expenditure on all issues.  We should see what we can do to save money and to make better use of the finance we have and the personnel we have across the public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that permanent positions in the public service and in local authorities are being frozen to allow for the fact that 181 temporary people will be employed to compute and analyse the census of population? Does he not agree that this is denuding the level of service available to the people?  Is it not a negative decision by the Government instead of employing people on a temporary basis to do this job?  It should be the function of the Government to get the job done as a matter of urgency and to create some hope for the large volume of unemployed people throughout this land at present.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that it is a negative approach.  For the first time it is a positive approach to the management of finances.  The sooner we come to grips with this the better and stop codding ourselves into thinking that we can raise money here and there and that once the demand arises we can find the money and spend it.  That is not the way we will get our finances in order.  We have to start making savings where we can.  This is a positive approach and I am glad to see that we are operating in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 19 and 107 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to Coláiste Chrónáin, Clondalkin, and post primary school accommodation generally in that area, must be viewed in the context of the decision of April 1986 viz.  Coláiste Chrónáin vocational school to transfer from the Nangor Road building to the new Deansrath building.  Coláiste Chillian, the all-Irish post primary school, to transfer from the old building on Monastry Road to the Nangor Road building. These decisions were made following detailed evaluation of all the factors involved, including the recommendations of the advisory council on post primary accommodation in the greater Dublin <Col N="1975" /> area, and the views of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  These views had been made known to my Department and were confirmed to me by a deputation I received from the committee in March last.</P>
    <P>I have recently received some written representations from interested parties expressing concern at my decision as outlined above, and I have met with a deputation from the parents' committee of Coláiste Chrónáin recently.  It is not normal practice to disclose names of members of deputations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling Deputy Mary Harney.  She has the question down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm that the County Dublin VEC asked for this school to be moved?  Can the Minister tell us whether or not he intends to meet a further deputation from the parents' association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to make the arrangements revealed in my reply were made following detailed evaluation of all the factors.  These were considered by the advisory council on post primary accommodation and also by County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  Both of these bodies were in agreement and conveyed to me that the arrangements now proposed are the most sensible and most satisfactory arrangements having regard to the needs of the area and the availability of resources there.  I am aware of the concern of the parents' committee of Coláiste Chrónáin.  I met them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy O'Leary, he is aware that I have indicated to him that I am giving favourable consideration to meeting these parents again.  I believe that I should talk to them again and Deputy O'Leary has asked me to do so. In principle, I have no objection to doing so.  Whether we get any further or whether we will resolve their objections <Col N="1976" /> I do not know but I think it is right that I should talk to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House what detailed evaluation of the situation in Clondalkin at post primary level was carried out before the decision of his predecessor, Deputy Gemma Hussey, now Minister for Social Welfare, under which Coláiste Chrónáin would remain in its present location?  Does he not agree that she carried out a perfectly adequate assessment or evaluation? Does he not agree that it seems rather remarkable that a decision by a Minister would be reversed so shortly after a firm commitment was given to the parents whose children had settled into that school for over one year and integrated with their teachers and with the whole educational set-up there?  Consequently, it is reasonable for the parents to be as angry, as they are.  I understand that they are picketing the school today.  This is likely to give rise to some further difficulties in having an organised and happy educational establishment in Clondalkin.</P>

      <P>A question, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What influences precisely gave rise to the rather unusual step of this change of decision by two Ministers for Education within the space of a short couple of months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only deal with the facts as they come before me.  I am not aware of all the information that became available to my predecessor or the stage the evaluation had reached when she indicated her thinking on the matter. Having been advised as I have been and made aware of all the factors in that area, it seems to me it would be flying in the face of common sense to leave Deansrath, a new school with a capacity for 1,000 pupils, with the most modern facilities including a high class gymnasium, empty so as to leave the pupils in Coláiste Chrónáin where they have been for only a year and could not really have settled in, and proceed to spend scarce <Col N="1977" /> public funds on building a totally new complex for the all-Irish school.  It seemed to me that the logic of the situation demanded that the Nangor Road complement of pupils should move to Deansrath, a comparatively short distance away with a modern school with excellent facilities including an ultra-modern gymnasium, and move the Irish school into the vacated building at Nangor Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a higher proportion of pupils in Coláiste Chrónáin come now and will come in the future from the Clondalkin area?  Is he further aware that if this move occurs to Nangor Road and from Nangor Road to Deansrath, most of the children will have to travel one mile on average and their school will be used in the main by pupils from outside the Clondalkin area?  That is the nub of the parents' grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that.  I am sure all these factors informed the thinking of people closer to the area than I, the Advisory Council on Post Primary Accommodation, which was set up to advise on precisely these issues.  There are, of course, the views of the County Dublin VEC.  Both bodies would have been aware of all of these factors and having taken them all into consideration one has to make a judgment on what is the best balance.  The best balance is in favour of the decision that has been made.  In a situation like this, it is difficult if not impossible to arrive at a decision that will please everyone involved.  We should bear in mind that we must make the most rational use of the resources available.  The distance is less than a mile. It would be very difficult to explain the expenditure of public funds on building a new all-Irish school and at the same time leave the Deansrath purpose-built secondary school idle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister recently receive a submission with new information from the County Dublin <Col N="1978" /> VEC and, if so, has he given it consideration? Has the Minister given consideration to a request to meet another deputation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am considering that request favourably.  I am not aware of any new submission from the County Dublin VEC &mdash; it has not come to me.  I would be surprised if there is anything new or startling in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with me that the furious response of the parents there indicates that there is more involved here than implementing a merry-go-round within the space of a mile, as the Minister described it? Though appreciating the fact that he is prepared to meet them again, can the Minister assure the House that he is prepared to retain an open mind?  Can he indicate if a resolution was adopted by the VEC giving an opinion?  In the light of all these things, including the resistance of the parents, will he be influenced to review the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to meet the parents as requested by Deputy O'Leary and the other Deputies.  It is desirable that I would meet aggrieved groups to see if I can assuage their unease and, on the other hand, if they can adduce any new and cogent reasons which might compel me to reconsider the decision.  I will approach the meeting with an open mind but I will require some stronger reasons than those I had from the earlier deputation.</P>

Each building project in course of planning ... will be examined in the context of post-primary school resources generally in the catchment area to <Col N="1980" /> determine the practicability of integration, or, alternatively, co-ordination of facilities.</P>
    <P>Discussions on the matter have been held with representatives of County Galway Vocational Education Committee.  I have instructed my Department that the review of this project be concluded as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that this case has been going on for a long time and that the conditions in the schools are very bad &mdash; there are leakages, overcrowding and many prefabs. In view of the large investment which the Department have made in private second level schools in that catchment area, in view of the fact that this is the only fully State controlled school in that catchment area, would he ensure that an immediate decision will be made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education when the Government will issue their planned discussion document on all aspects of third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion paper which it is proposed to issue relates not to all aspects of third level education but to meeting future demands for third level education and derives from a commitment to that effect given in the <Col N="1990" /> Programme for Action in Education.  I hope the paper will be published in the not too distant future but I am not in a position to give the Deputy a date for publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that he cannot give a date for the publication of the document. Would the Minister agree that the huge upsurge in the numbers seeking entry to third level colleges makes the publication <Col N="1991" /> of this document and its findings extremely important to ensure proper planning for the next decade for third level needs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. As she is aware, there has been a massive capital commitment for building at third level stage provided by the Government but other measures are necessary.  They will be addressed in this paper.  I agree it is important that the paper be issued as soon as possible.  I have to take some of the blame for the delay because it is available in draft form but due to pressures of one kind or another since my appointment I have not got as far as giving it final approval.  Hopefully, from next Friday there will be more time available for many important tasks such as that.  I share the Deputy's anxiety to see it published early.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister has said that the document is in draft form.  As there will now be more time to devote to it, can it be expected for the new third level year beginning in late September-early October this year? I would also like to ask the Minister if he is aware of the proposed infrastructural development at third level, namely, the new regional colleges which are a long time in gestation?  Does the proposed discussion document talk just not about places but also about the grant-loan scheme?  In other words, does the proposed document envisage aspects other than the provision of places?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer not to discuss the contents of the document at this stage.  Its thrust is to meet future demands for third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be published before the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my ambition.  It is a discussion paper.  It will be open for submissions which will then have to be considered.  It is too soon to say when the implementation will take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that, due to cutbacks, Our Lady of Victories national school, Ballymun Road, Dublin 11 will have classes of over 50 pupils; if he is satisfied that children can be adequately taught in these circumstances; if he will sanction the appointment of additional teachers for this school in time for the 1986-87 school year; if he will agree to meet a delegation of the school's parents association to discuss the problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing of national schools is determined in accordance with a schedule related to the average enrolment levels in the schools.  There have been no cutbacks in the staffing levels of national schools and the present schedule has been in operation, unchanged, since September 1982.</P>
      <P>The schools referred to by the Deputy are in a position where, due to a fall in the average enrolments, a number of teaching posts are likely to be suppressed in accordance with the rules; unless the appropriate average enrolment figures are achieved for the quarter ending 30 June 1986.  The size of individual classes is a matter of organisation within the particular school but under the terms of the present schedule the average class size would be substantially less than the figure mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A number of schools are seeking special additional teaching assistance for the 1986-87 school year on the grounds that they are catering for disadvantaged areas.  The circumstances of these schools will be assessed in September next in the light of available resources and in the light of actual enrolments and class organisation at that time.  The application of Our Lady of Victories School will be dealt with accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the correspondence which was sent to him by the parents' association in connection with this <Col N="1993" /> matter.  The Minister referred to the average size of classes.  The parents' association indicate that as a result of the loss of teachers there will be some classes of up to 50 pupils and the principal will have to take on teaching duties.  Does the Minister not regard that as inappropriate and is he aware that there are a number of children attending this school from the New Town Estate, Ballymun?  Is there not a need for smaller classes in these circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the size of classes were to be as the Deputy said, I would have to agree it would be unsatisfactory but I am advised that that will not be so, that the size of the classes and the teacher quota will be determined when the enrolment is completed next September.  Then it will be a matter for internal organisation. Having regard to the present schedule relating to average enrolment levels I understand that that schedule should permit a staffing figure which would permit, in turn, classes considerably smaller than the numbers suggested by the Deputy.  In addition, there is the possibility &mdash; I cannot say that it is anything more than that at this stage &mdash; that the school might qualify for extra resources arising under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  They will be competing with other schools and assessments will have to be made as between the competing schools in the context of the greatest need.  The schedule relating to the average enrolment will apply to this school in September next and I will ensure there will be no classes of the size suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister has said from his information that the classes will not be of that size I can only go on the basis of what the parents have told me.  Could the Minister indicate from his knowledge how many classes are expected to be in the school in September and what size will each class be?  Could the Minister also indicate whether he will be prepared to meet a delegation from the parents' association?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be imprudent to guess what the position will be in September. Our experience is that the projections for September very often are significantly out of line with the actual position in September.  These projections are made at Easter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not expect that because the trend is beginning to descend.  I would not like to hazard a guess at this stage.  As I indicated in a reply to an earlier question, I am not averse to meeting deputations but to do so now would be premature.  We will wait until after September to see if there is any problem then.  At that stage the Deputy can contact me and we can see if it is necessary to meet the parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will give a progress report on the implementation of the national youth policy; and if he proposes to give the Dáil an opportunity to discuss the policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Kenny) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Kenny)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the national youth policy, responsibility for implementation of the policy has been transferred, together with appropriate staff, from the Department of Labour to the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>In line with the consultative status of the National Youth Council of Ireland, the council have recently submitted their comprehensive views on the implementation of the policy.  Discussions have been held with a number of vocational education committees with a view to the establishment of local youth service boards. Additional funds have been made available in the current financial year in respect of youth affairs and in relation to capital grants for recreational facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of the transfer of staff to the Department of Education and the resulting establishment of the nucleus of <Col N="1995" /> the community education and training division in the Department, the implementation of the policy will gather momentum over the coming months.  I would anticipate, therefore, that the Dáil would be given the opportunity to discuss the policy in the next session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that there will be an opportunity to discuss this matter next session.  Since the Costello report was discussed in this House, there was concern that this report should be given equal attention.  What progress other than that stated in the reply has been made in the implementation of this report?  I accept that consultations are going on.  Have any youth service boards being established to date? The Minister mentioned the allocation of additional finance for youth services. How much money has been expended to date on the implementation of the programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The setting up of the local youth service boards will be as envisaged in the report.  None has yet been set up. Informal discussions have taken place with the CEOs in Dublin city and Waterford city regarding the recognition of Comhairle le Leas Óige and the Waterford youth committee as ad hoc boards, as envisaged in the document.  Proposals have been submitted by VECs for each of the other urban areas indicated in the policy for the early establishment of ad hoc boards, that is, County Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork city, Limerick city and Galway city.  Further proposals have been received from other VECs and these are being examined.  I hope to make an announcement at an early date about the establishment of the selected areas. There is also the question of capital grants for recreational facilities.  The Deputy will be aware that a £2 million allocation has been made for the implementation of the youth policy this year and an announcement will be made in due course about its expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that it is difficult to implement standards on a very broad scale which would be to the satisfaction of everyone, but I would hope that Comhairle Le Leas Óige would be properly structured as envisaged in the document.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the percentage of second level school students who took German in the leaving certificate examinations; and if he has any practical plans to encourage more schools to include this subject in the curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 3.5 per cent of school candidates who have entered for the leaving certificate examination in 1986 have been entered for German.</P>
      <P>The syllabi for German have recently been radically reformed at both intermediate and leaving certificate levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The examinations in German at intermediate and leaving certificate have been reformed to take account of the syllabus changes.  Listening tests involving tape <Col N="1997" /> recordings of authentic German were introduced in the 1985 examinations. This year face-to-face orals were held at leaving certificate for the first time.</P>
    <P>I am confident that as a result of the reforms in syllabi and examinations the perception of German as a difficult language will change and that the numbers taking it will increase substantially.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was never aware that there was a perception of German as a difficult language.  Would the Minister agree that there has been a drop in the number of students taking German, since the figure quoted in 1984 was 4 per cent? In the light of the fact that Germany is the major investor in Ireland, after Britain, investing six times more than France, would the Minister agree that there is a distinct anomaly in that over 60 per cent of leaving certificate students take French while only 3.5 per cent take German?  Has the Minister any practical proposals, arising out of the recent Dáil debate on education, for discriminating positively in relation to the supply of teachers of German to selected schools on an experimental basis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true to say that the numbers have been dropping.  They have been increasing slightly and the figure of 4 per cent must have been a rough approximation.  The actual numbers have increased from 1,595 in 1984 to 1,742 in 1986.</P>

      <P>The percentage in 1984 was 3.48 per cent, while in 1985 it was 3.41 per cent.  This year it is 3.5 per cent. The figure is static.  I am anxious to see the study of German taken by more pupils but essentially there has to be a demand from parents and pupils.  I should like to be able to contribute to the making of that demand and we have taken a very significant step in the changes made in the syllabus.  It is now a much more interesting syllabus with less emphasis on the <Col N="1998" /> academic side of language learning and more emphasis on the practical use of the language as a means of communication.</P>
      <P>That is not to say that the literary aspects will be neglected because obviously the language cannot be taken fully as a subject unless both the literary and communications aspects are covered. I hope we will see an increase in the number of students taking German.  I am not aware that there is any difficulty with regard to teaching it.  If a sufficient number offer for German I understand the facilities can be made available by my Department in terms of allocating extra teaching resources to take account of that demand.  I would certainly not discourage any experiments by way of, perhaps, asking one or two institutions to concentrate on it and canvass support among parents and I will actively look into it to see if it should be done.  Essentially we have to give the parents and the pupils the choice.</P>

      <P>The Minister intimated that if necessary there would be provision of resources by the appointment of teachers of German to schools, but the cuts imposed on second level schools have meant that subjects such as this cannot be taken up in preference to core subjects.  Would the Minister agree that in a European context we must know the language of the people with whom we are dealing?  I take the Minister's point that he will provide extra teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, where there is a sufficient demand and all other things being equal.  If only one or two students in a school wanted to take German it would probably be impossible.  It is something that will have to be built up gradually. The position cannot be turned around overnight.</P>

      <P>A total sum of £1.2 million is available in 1986 to meet existing commitments and for allocation to new projects under my Department's capital grant scheme for the provision of youth, recreation and community facilities.  A large number of grant approvals in 1985 has involved the carry-over of considerable financial commitments to 1986.  Consequently, it has been possible to assist only a limited number of new projects so far this year.</P>
      <P>A sum in the order of £300,000 is available to my Department in the annual estimates for allocation and expenditure in the current year on new projects of this nature.  An additional sum of £500,000 is now being allocated and this will enable further applications to be considered.</P>

      <P>This report was released on 24 June 1986 and is a detailed investigation and survey which had three objectives:</P>
      <P>(a)  to examine the factors which lead to success in securing appointment and promotion in primary schools teaching and to assess whether these factors differ for men and women.</P>
      <P>(b)  to examine the factors which influence teachers to seek promotion and to determine whether they differ as between men and women.</P>
      <P>(c)  to establish the attitudes of men and women towards equality of opportunity in primary teaching.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it would be helpful for me to comment in the form of a reply to a question, which must of its nature be brief, on the findings of such a comprehensive report.  I can inform the Deputy, however, that in the past two years, in consultation with the patrons, school management authorities and the teachers' organisation, new procedures for the selection of principals and teachers in national schools have been agreed. I am confident that these procedures, which make it mandatory to have at least one man and one woman on every selection board and which require boards to have regard to the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, will achieve greater equality in the primary teaching profession.</P>

      <P>As I undertook in my reply to questions on this subject on 23 April 1986, I arranged that senior officials of my Department meet representatives of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland to discuss the issues involved.  The meeting took place on 25 May 1986.  I have carefully considered the views of the association as expressed at that meeting but I <Col N="2005" /> am still of the same mind that the certificates should be endorsed in the circumstances outlined in my earlier reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the association are not aware of the position but I accept that notification may have been sent out in the last few days.  Is the Minister aware of the extreme disquiet among parents about this matter?  I have spoken to many parents and they are genuinely distressed at what they see as an obvious disadvantage to their children. The Curriculum and Examinations Board envisage changes in examination structures which will endorse an element of oral and practical competency in most subjects in the future.  In view of that does the Minister not feel that a dramatic change such as a special endorsement on certificates of pupils with learning disabilities will severely impair their chances of employment?  Will the Minister agree that in many instances it will lead to those young people not being called for interview for a job although they may be eminently suitable for the vacancy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that we had a long question and answer session on this issue two months ago.  At that stage I indicated the reasons why it was felt that an endorsement was necessary. Essentially it is to preserve the integrity of the certificates.  There is no reason why it should, and I do not have any evidence that it has, prejudice any of the holders of such certificates.  I cannot anticipate what the new Curriculum and Examinations Board will do with regard to assessing, marking or certifying examination results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should imagine some form of certification will have to be continued although probably some element of assessment <Col N="2006" /> will be introduced also.  It will be a matter for the board how they wish to treat these certificates, whether they are to be accurate on their face or whether they are not to be endorsed.  If they are not endorsed it could lead to the accusation that they are not accurate on their face, that they are concealing the fact that the pupil concerned was given special facilities.</P>
    <P>Obviously I sympathise with the parents and we have given careful consideration to their views.  One area where changes could be made that would preserve my position while going some way towards meeting the anxiety of parents would be the actual form of endorsement to be made.  Possibly it could indicate the nature of the special facilities awarded. That would be an improvement.  If there is any apprehension with regard to the attitude of employers, I shall take an initiative in addressing publicity material to employers to reassure them that there is no question of the holder of an endorsed certificate being any less intelligent or less worthy a student.  Both of those points were suggested by the parents and they are worthy of consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disturbed about this and because of that anxiety I pursued the matter by way of an earlier priority question also.  In 1973 the Department saw fit to initiate special procedures for State examinations for pupils with learning disabilities and they have served everyone well.  Why after 13 years did some anonymous person out of the blue get the idea into his or her head that the certificates should be endorsed?  No matter what publicity the Minister may engage in, to a potential employer the receipt of a certificate that has a special mark on it will put that applicant in the &ldquo;no go&rdquo; category.  I agree that some philanthropic-minded personnel manager may see it as his duty to investigate further but in general the people concerned will be put at a disadvantage.  Does not the putting of a mark on a certificate place the person in a special category?  I am appalled and distressed at what is happening here.  It is unfair from the <Col N="2007" /> educational and social points of view and it is showing discrimination against the pupils concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is completely ignoring the other side of the coin.  I can understand the compassion and motives on which she bases her argument.  It is no joy for me to have to reject such an argument based on compassionate grounds but we must look at the entire picture.  In this case the entire picture involves the integrity of a State certificate. It is wrong to suggest this came out of the blue at the behest of some anonymous person in my Department. For a long time we have been worried in the Department about the integrity of the certificate because of the lack of this endorsement following the special facilities introduced 13 years ago for pupils with handicap.  The change was made not to prejudice the pupils but to preserve the integrity of the certificates.  If this endorsement were not on the face of the certificate it would mislead people.</P>
      <P>I can see no reason why it should not be possible subsequently to explain fully and thoroughly to prospective employers the form of assistance given, whether tape recorders or anything else.  The Department can help in giving this assurance to employers and I shall see that they do help in terms of preparing appropriate publicity material.  A prospective employer will be assured that the standard of learning and attainment and the IQ of the pupil are in line with his peers and the results shown on the certificate, taking into account the special facilities given because of the handicap of the pupil.  I cannot accept that pupils will be prejudiced.  Steps can be taken to make sure of this through the publicity mechanisms I have suggested.  Sometimes the correct decisions are not always the easiest to make.  However, in this case I am satisfied the correct decision is the protection of the integrity of the certificate on its face.</P>

      <P>A total of £750,000 is being provided this year for a programme of special measures for primary schools in disadvantaged urban areas.  The special measures from which participating schools benefit include grants for the purchase of books and equipment, the sponsorship of home-school-community liaison initiatives and special in-service training for the teachers in the schools concerned.  A total of £500,000 has been allocated towards these measures in 1986.  In addition, funds have also been provided for the relief of school debts and also for pre-schools for travellers' children.  The allocation of the available funds for 1986 is as follows:</P>

      <P>Recently there has been much publicity about many city schools who are facing extreme difficulty because of the lack of funds.  Question No. 23 dealt with one such school.  The Minister mentioned a sum of £200,000 in respect of the relief of school debts but I say that amount is a drop in the ocean. For many schools because their pupils come from a particular background they cannot have the usual cake sales, bingo sessions and all the attendant activities that must be held nowadays to run a school satisfactorily.  Indeed, many of those activities serve as a community focal point and they are good in themselves. However, because of the areas in which the schools mentioned in this question are sited, the boards cannot raise the necessary funds and the principals are becoming more and more harassed and bothered about the business end of trying to make ends meet.  They cannot devote all their time and talents to dealing with the educational needs of their pupils.</P>

      <P>It was for those reasons the Government introduced this scheme of assistance for disadvantaged areas and, for those reasons, in a time of economic stringency the amount was increased from £500,000 last year to £750,000 this year.  Obviously we would like to give even more.  Nevertheless I am satisfied that the assistance given is of extreme importance to the schools for the socio-economic reasons advanced by the Deputy.  The sum for the relief of school debts has been calculated as a proportion of the entire sum available, taking into account the Department's <Col N="2010" /> knowledge of this aspect of the problem of the disadvantaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The school was closed on 31 August 1985 and at that time the Department gave a commitment that the buildings would not be used as an annexe to Trinity House.  They further stated that they had no plans to reopen the school as a child care institution.  Since then, efforts have been in train to find a new owner but no Government Department have yet formally indicated interest in the premises.  At an informal level the Department of Justice appeared to be interested at one stage but there was no follow through.  No final decision has been taken with regard to its future educational use in that no new owner has yet been found.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that the decision to close Scoil Ard Mhuire was the wrong one to make and with hindsight it could be viewed as detrimental to the type of young persons who received guidance and education, and who were given a chance in life because they were in Scoil Ard Mhuire.  In view <Col N="2011" /> of the great number of young people we read about who are sleeping rough and who come from unsatisfactory homes without any steadying influence, may I suggest that the Minister and the Department reopen this school because the problems have not disappeared?  In fact, the problems facing disaffected young people have increased dramatically. A very valuable use could be put to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware of the difficulties encountered with regard to the amalgamation of the school.  The Department closed Scoil Ard Mhuire for two reasons.  First, the number of referrals to this school had declined sharply over the last few years of its existence and there had seldom been more than 30 to 35 boys resident.  It was also noted that the cost of keeping a boy in residence at Scoil Ard Mhuire was far higher than at the other open special schools at Finglas and Clonmel.  Second, there is an increasing trend towards dealing with the problems of delinquency at local level in small community based projects.  This trend was reflected in the Department's decision in the summer of 1985 to continue with the new encounter projects.  As the Deputy is aware, these projects had operated on a pilot basis since 1977 and it was felt that their continuance would lead to a reduction in the number of children requiring residential care.  It was also felt that there is sufficient accommodation for the type of person who would be referred to Scoil Ard Mhuire available in other centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may, I will summarise what was said before we adjourned and I hope my summary will not be unfair or inaccurate.  The Minister said this was an enabling provision and that it was neither appropriate nor necessary to designate An Post.  A generalised statement like that is not adequate to ensure <Col N="2057" /> that the purposes for which legislation is passed will be implemented.  To say something is neither necessary nor appropriate without backing it up by legal authority, parliamentary precedent or a precise statement, is not good enough. While I do not question the Minister's good intentions, this issue is not about intentions but about the legislation when passed and what it will mean in law.</P>
      <P>It is time we were much more precise in the laws we pass as distinct from making vague generalisations, which has been the practice for all sides to engage in from time to time.  The Minister indicated in support of his thesis that it was his intention to have An Post run the lottery but he said there were a number of conditions precedent to the appointment of An Post, a number of matters to be resolved in discussion to the satisfaction of the Minister before An Post are nominated.  I am not arguing that matters which should be resolved in discussion should not be discussed, but the Minister appears to be saying that what we thought was decided has not been decided, that the conditions under which An Post would operate this lottery have not been determined at this point and that before An Post are appointed, there are conditions and precedents that will have to be satisfied.  It is clear that it has not yet been decided in the proper sense of a legal decision that An Post will be the body authorised under this legislation to conduct this lottery. The impression conveyed was that all this had been done but we cannot leave this matter in doubt.  There is grave doubt as to the exact state of the decision to nominate An Post to run this lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated that, because it is not really appropriate for the spokesman on Finance, I am not necessarily entering into the issue as to whether it should be An Post or somebody else, but it seems to have been decided in intention that An Post would have responsibility, and there was consensus on all sides of the House on that.  However, I am concerned that nobody else, no commercial company or profit making enterprise in the commercial area, could be nominated or have someone nominated to conduct what will <Col N="2058" /> be almost a guaranteed money maker despite what Deputy Skelly says.  Deputy Skelly quoted one case in the USA&mdash;I do not know to which one he is referring. If, from his considerable experience, he pursued that further he would find that more than half of the states in the USA and almost every country in Europe conduct lotteries, federal or state in the case of the USA and national in the case of the EC countries, and everyone of them shows a very considerable profit, with perhaps the exception Deputy Skelly mentioned and I do not know why that exception, if it exists, is so.</P>
    <P>The Minister said An Post should be nominated on the conclusion of the discussions between An Post and the Government.  What further discussions are to take place between An Post and the Government?  Before bringing legislation in here to give effect to his general statement of intention on the authorisation of An Post, I would have thought all of that would have been determined. Otherwise it could be a considerable time, subject to very lengthy discussions and difficulties, before this idea of a national lottery gets under way.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two further points by way of comment on the Minister's reaction to my proposal.  The Minister has repeated that this is an enabling section and after all of these discussions have taken place the Minister can act. We want to ensure that the Minister acts now in accordance with the stated intention. The previous Minister with responsibility for sport, a man with bona fides equal to his, said that this is the intention, but why do we say that, after all of these discussions, this Act enables the Minister to give effect to it later? Equally, if the Minister decided that the discussions were not working to his satisfaction &mdash; I thought they were concluded &mdash; we could not question in the Dáil whether he was going to authorise A or B.  It does not matter who it is.  It may not be some of the people to whom my colleague, Deputy Leyden, referred to this morning who have known associations with the main Government party and who are involved in other activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> The Minister would have to apologise to nobody because in so appointing, say, the Rehabilitation Institute, or anybody else, he would be acting strictly in accordance with the law as passed here.  That will not be so if he says his intention is to nominate An Post.</P>
    <P>In relation to the five or ten years, the Minister seems to think ten years is a little bit too long if the thing does not work and, while it must be given a little time to work, I accept that.  However, I would have thought that whoever was organising and managing this lottery would know within five years whether it was going to work.  I do not think you would have to wait until ten years had passed.  I know that ten years is the maximum under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Not more than ten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not have to be ten.  Ten is the maximum.  I would have thought five more reasonable having regard to the fact that the expectation and the eventual result would be that, in effect, the Minister would simply extend the licence, which he has power to do under the Bill and which we do not question. He could simply extend the licence for another five or ten years.  We are not questioning that.  We are not trying to take all power from the Minister.  I will not pursue this matter further.  I hope I have made the case objectively and fairly on the basis of legal principles and not general statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make a passing reference here because Deputy Leyden mentioned this matter.  We heard a fair number of general statements in recent weeks.  That is all over and I do not want to have that issue brought up again, but it is important to recognise that general statements of intention from Ministers here or elsewhere are of no consequence when you are talking about Statute law.  It is time we in this House recognised that once and for all because that is our responsibility. We are here as legislators, not just as politicians who made statements of general intent.  I am concerned that what <Col N="2060" /> we pass into law here is in line with what we say we want to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little disadvantaged here amongst the lawyers and I want to get a layman's interpretation of the section from the Minister and to ask him a few questions in relation to it.  I was very pleased some months ago when the Government announced that the franchise was being granted to An Post.  I felt they were the most competent and capable organisation with a ready made mechanism to do a good job on this lottery.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister if I am right in assuming that negotiations are still going on between the Department of Finance and An Post, and why he cannot write into legislation at this stage that An Post are being nominated by the Department to run the lottery.  Is it that whilst negotiations are taking place such action would put An Post in a kind of commanding position which would interfere with the negotiations?  That is my interpretation as a layman of the Minister's reason for not including it in legislation.</P>
      <P>Is it beyond doubt that An Post will have the franchise?  I understand that the Minister has announced it.  I was well aware of the Government's announcement some time ago and, as I said then, I was very pleased that they got the franchise because at that stage I was making representations on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been critical of the Bill in some areas and I want further clarification on it.  In relation to the second amendment tabled by Deputy O'Kennedy, I feel that ten years is the better of the two options.  The launching of a lottery is a very detailed undertaking and, having studied lotteries in other countries, my experience is that it will be a full five years before it reaches its maximum, in other words, before it is fully developed. The first year will be just the launching; it will be just founded.  The second and third years will see an improvement and at the end of the five years it will level off.  If we write into the legislation that <Col N="2061" /> An Post should have the franchise and at the same time accept Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment, what will be the position of An Post at the end of five years <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister?  We have spent a considerable time discussing a section which is not the most important one but I should like the Minister to clarify the position.  Is it because negotiations are still taking place?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Creed summed up the position well in regard to this section.  With respect to Deputy O'Kennedy &mdash; I appreciate that a decision was made by his party to find grounds for opposing this Bill &mdash; the points made involve much ado about nothing.  I accept Deputy O'Kennedy's view that, when putting legislation through the House, we should ensure that it is legally sound. Whatever about the position adopted by Deputy O'Kennedy's party, we expect him, on reflection, to appreciate that enabling legislation is required so that the national lottery can be set up and got under way.  The Minister's power under section 3 is an enabling power, which is the proper procedure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Creed mentioned the relationship between the Minister and An Post. I confirm and it is proper that I should give the full facts in this regard &mdash; that a decision in principle has been made by the Government to award the franchise to An Post and to issue the licence for a first period of ten years.  These decisions have been conveyed to An Post and discussions have taken place between the representatives of the Government, officials of the Department of Finance and An Post and have proved very satisfactory. At this stage, the agreement on the financial arrangements for the running of the lottery has been finalised but that does not take from the fact that, after the Bill is enacted, further discussions will have to take place and we cannot do this until the enabling legislation is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to finalise the terms and conditions of the licence and discuss the draft memorandum and articles of association of the subsidiary company to be set up.  We will also be involved in other <Col N="2062" /> discussions regarding rules for the lottery games and so on.  I do not see that this takes from the view which I presented to the House that essentially we need enabling power to get this matter wrapped up.  In some ways it could be said that the combination of the two proposals from Deputy O'Kennedy on this section are contradictory because, on the one hand, he suggests that the position of An Post should be enshrined in the Bill while on the other he suggests that the terms of the licence which we propose to grant should be halved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The decision arrived at by the Government as soon as the Bill is passed is to grant a licence to An Post on a ten year basis.  If we accepted the amendments proposed by Deputy O'Kennedy, what would our position be at the end of the five year period?  We could be in a very difficult position, for example, if the operation of An Post was not entirely successful &mdash; perish the thought &mdash; and if we wanted to give consideration to another body we would not have the power to do so.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the two proposals put forward by Deputy O'Kennedy whereby he wants to remove the power of the Minister of the day when a licence comes up for renewal &mdash; perhaps <Col N="2063" /> I am misreading his proposal &mdash; but my understanding is that he wants to nominate An Post for all time.  Am I correct in that assumption?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify the matter.  The Bill provides for what is necessary today but I am sure the Minister is aware of the fact that legislation can be amended if necessary.  In this instance the amendment would simply be to delete An Post and substitute another company. I do not see why it should seem so complicated. We should do what is required.</P>
      <P>There are other important issues to be dealt with but it would have been much better, before the Minister introduced the legislation to the House, to have concluded negotiations and discussions with An Post.  Perhaps Deputy Creed is right; it might give An Post too strong a hand in negotiations&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but if An Post will do the job, discussions and negotiations with them should be concluded before we give them the power to do so. The public may be surprised to know that although we decided that An Post would get the franchise, discussions could still go on for quite a time.  We could toss this around for a long time but our legislation should be very clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we have discussed this point <i>ad nauseum</i>.  Let me conclude on it by indicating that I do not think there is a whole lot between us.  As I see it, now that Deputy O'Kennedy has clarified his position, he feels that the Minister should come back to the House at the end of a five year period rather than having an enabling power to consider somebody else, whereas I feel it is more sensible to have enabling legislation to re-appoint An Post, or somebody else if it was suggested that it was in the national interest to do so, when the matter comes up for review after ten years, a period which should give them a <Col N="2064" /> proper chance to become fully established. Discussions with An Post are very far advanced and many matters have been agreed with them but there are certain matters that cannot be finalised until we have the legislation.  As soon as the Bill is through the Oireachtas it is my intention to complete these matters at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I would like to make two points.  The period stated in the Bill is a period not exceeding ten years.  The Minister has indicated that the period of the first licence is to be ten years, even though the Minister could decide any number of years up to ten.  This is also covered under section 30 because the Minister really has power to do whatever he wants and may, in the public interest, make a direction in writing.  He has power to make those changes.  The other point is that the terms and conditions referred to by Deputy O'Kennedy should, I imagine, be discussed under section 9.  I hope we get to section 9&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which deals with the remuneration of the licensees.  So we are not going to discuss that.  I thought it was going to be discussed there and I would like to say a few things on that.  The last thing I would like to point out is that he is very naive if he believes that lotteries around the world are making fortunes. Lotteries have their ups and downs.  They have very bad periods where they are losing money as well as periods where they are making money and it is well to remember that.  The Minister himself went back to the fifteenth century to see when lotteries began.  Let me point out that the lotteries went back to the time of Sodom and Gomorrah when Lot asked the Lord to spare them if he could find <Col N="2065" /> 50 just men.  Lot probably held a lottery to see who the first 50 would be to get out of the city.  That is when they started.</P>
      <P>It is not a foregone conclusion that they will make money.  I very much doubt that lotteries will be a success here because of the size of the population and that is why I feel the Minister should give himself the option of linking up to a bigger lottery in a bigger centre of population, such as Great Britain, the United States or Europe.  The Minister still has the power to do that and this might be done in the course of monitoring and scrutinising the situation within the company &mdash; I would prefer to call it a company because we have to have that flexibility.  We cannot tie ourselves into a named body that might make an unholy mess of it, and be unable to extricate ourselves.  I think the flexibility is there to make sure that whoever is operating the lottery will do so successfully on behalf of the people.  If they do not I hope that, despite the squeals that may come from whatever body are operating it and their employees, the Minister will exercise his powers under sections 30 and 31 and under section 9.  It is an absolute must, as Deputy O'Kennedy said, that the terms and conditions be definitely laid down.  I hope we will get to section 9 so that we can talk about that because there are pitfalls there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important to say, even though we will discuss it on section 9, that the fact that 40 per cent goes for prize money means that the 60 per cent will cover the fund which the Government hope to use to do all the things they want to do.  This would cost a maximum of 20 to 30 per cent; the remaining 20 per cent will have to cover everything from overheads, marketing, sales processing, tickets and so on.  This is important because if the criteria under which the company must operate are not laid down they could be in a loss-making situation if they cannot work within that 60 per cent.  I hope the Minister will lay down such criteria later on because we are talking about everything from renting an office block to employing people, to buying, equipment and so on.  I would prefer to leave it until we reach section 9 provided the Minister bears in mind that he might have to refer back to this section.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Moneys paid into the Central Fund pursuant to section 8 of this Act shall be applied for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951) and the health of the community, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such (if any) other purposes, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in my opening remarks on this Stage of the Bill, I did consider what was said in this House on Second Stage.  I decided that my course should be to respond positively to the constructive remarks of the Deputies on both sides of the House.  The Government had earlier made it clear that there was no intention whatever that the surplus funds from the lottery would be used for general Government purposes and also had made it clear that the proceeds, after expenses and prizes were met, would be devoted to certain beneficial uses which had already been announced.  I had not the slightest doubt about the commitment in that regard, but I was somewhat concerned, in the light of the remarks made here, <Col N="2068" /> that there could be any confusion or misunderstanding on the part of the general public, arising from those comments, as to the beneficial use of the proceeds.</P>
    <P>I felt that the proper response was to put down the amendment which I have now proposed, which will incorporate in the Bill and specify the various beneficial uses as already announced by the Government.  Sport was mentioned in my closing speech on Second Stage.  Sport and recreation are very significant elements. National culture, including the Irish language, and the arts were among the areas already announced.  I take the point that it would be better, from the aspect of securing community acceptance and having greater credibility for the whole scheme to have these included in the Bill.  I am quite prepared to do that and that is why, having listened to the Second Stage debate, I decided to put down this amendment.  As far as I can see, I am <i>ad idem</i> on this point with Deputy O'Kennedy, who was one of the Deputies to raise this issue and whose amendment seems pretty much on the same lines as mine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I make the point that I have had the advantage of having the amendments which I propose put together for me by the parliamentary draftsman.  That has to be borne in mind as well.  Otherwise, there is not a great deal of difference between the two proposals except in one instance.  I feel it necessary still to reserve the power to the Minister to add in due course other purposes as the Government may determine from time to time.  I believe that power which Deputy O'Kennedy has not included in his amendment should still be incorporated in the Bill.  It is necessary. I can go into a little more detail if the Deputy does not accept that.  The other amendment is consequential and we can take it after discussion on the present amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish this issue were one simply of the Minister's good faith. If it were, I should have no problem, but the question of accepting the word of the Minister is not the issue.  I accept his good faith in this matter.  First, I welcome the fact that the Minister was influenced by what we said on Second Stage debate to amend what he proposed initially in section 5.  That is a measure of the Minister's readiness to consider positions. However, what he is proposing by way of an amendment does not, in fact, give effect at all to what we proposed and what I understand the general intention of this House to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister has done is to specifically mention sport and other recreational activity, national culture, including the Irish language, the arts within the meaning of the Art Act, 1951, and, he goes on, the health of the community. He also adds at this point, and &ldquo;such (if any) other purposes, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time&rdquo;.  He has accepted the general concern about these <Col N="2070" /> areas and is going to name them, as if that in itself is effective, because it is not.  In naming them, he adds two very significant elements, first, the health of the community &mdash; and I cannot imagine anything more broad than that &mdash; and secondly, &ldquo;such (if any) other purposes, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time&rdquo;.  If that is passed, the Government are entitled to spend in whatever proportions they so determine from time to time, such amounts of money, be it for any purpose other than those which have now been specifically mentioned.  Clearly, that is far too broad and vague.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this is an enabling provision.  I certainly agree; it enables the Minister or the Government of the day to do exactly what they wish with the money.  The Act would not impose any obligation on them beyond saying that some of the money would go to sport, but it would not even have to.  Let us assume that some would, but it could be an extremely small amount.  If what the parliamentary draftsman has done is to give effect to what the Minister asked him to do, I suggest that the Minister go back to the parliamentary draftsman and get him, if he is worth his keep at all, to make the thing much more precise.  He could do it in the form that I have suggested.</P>
    <P>As far as I understood it, particularly from the former Minister of State, Deputy Creed &mdash; and I am not talking about the debate on the last day but generally &mdash; the bulk of the money from the proceeds of the lottery would go to sport or sporting and recreational facilities. What one means by the bulk one could argue about, but clearly if there was a main target area it would be sport and sporting and recreational facilities.  I think we all agreed on that.  We certainly responded in that way at all Stages. Without going into the history of it, on the last occasion Deputy Creed reminded us of where the original proposal came from and I can accept that.  It came from Cospóir or some group in that organisation to his predecessor, Deputy Tunney, so I am not claiming credit for anybody <Col N="2071" /> in this instance.  We all endorsed it and I want to see that endorsement translated into law.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that in the most precise, simple terms &mdash; and there is no harm in being precise or simple in drafting legislation &mdash; in my amendment I stated that these moneys would be for the promotion of sport, sporting and recreational facilities, charitable and voluntary philanthropic purposes, the arts and culture.  Incidentally, I would be prepared to acknowledge that the Minister's reference here to national culture, including the Irish language, is probably better than mine.  My amendment goes on to say, &ldquo;provided that not less than half of the total proceeds shall be applied for the promotion of sport and sporting and recreational facilities&rdquo;.  That is what we all want.  That is as simple and precise as can be expressed in law and would not leave any doubt before any court as to whether it was being implemented in accordance with our general intention.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister either to indicate whether he is or is not in favour of seeing at least half of these funds going to sport and sporting and recreational facilities.  If he is not in favour, then I can understand the position.  If he is, I see no reason why he should not give effect to our wishes so that any future Minister who may have his maws or his jaws fixed on this nice fund will not be able to get it for other purposes.  I am sure that the Government, with half yearly returns such as we had yesterday, would be glad to say; &ldquo;Here is an extra £50 million which we can put on the right side and meet all our commitments&rdquo;.  That is not the purpose behind this lottery.  I do not intend to argue about the educational aspect as my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, will deal in greater detail with that.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general purposes the Government may determine, which in my view are far too vague, the Minister has specifically included the health of the community.  We cannot get anything much broader than that in the health area.  Does the Minister know how much <Col N="2072" /> is being provided or expended in the current public expenditure budget this year for the health of the community?  If he does not know I will remind him.  The figure is £1.213 billion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister has the figures.  That goes towards the health of the community.  I am not arguing, and no one on this side of the House is arguing for a reduction in the health services.  I will not go into the arguments already made.  Those services are absolutely essential and are not developed to the point at which they should be.  Wherever the funds to provide for adequate health facilities for our people are to come from, it certainly should not be by swallowing up the funds from the national lottery.  If we are talking about £30 million or £40 million for sport, where would that figure go in relation to £1.213 billion being spent on health?  Is it the Minister's intention to make sport the target area?  If so, he should say so, as my amendment states.  The all too general power the Minister proposes in paragraph (b) is so general as to make paragraph (a) meaningless.  Paragraph (a) has good intentions.  The various elements and interests are mentioned.  Paragraph (b)  gives the Minister power to do what he likes.  There is a very strong case for supporting sport and recreational facilities and this is what we should do.  That is what my amendment proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>A very important aspect of what we have been discussing in this Bill is the success or otherwise of the lottery. It is a new venture, a new proposal and something to which people are not accustomed. If we have a successful lottery it will be a very pleasant duty for the Minister or whoever distributes the proceeds of the lottery.  If we have not a successful lottery the whole thing will blow up in our faces.  This is one of the sections of the Bill which I referred to as a very important section.  There are two important factors in the promotion of a lottery. <Col N="2073" /> One is the prizes.  I compliment the Minister as I feel that that aspect is reasonably well covered.  The Minister mentioned in the Bill and it was also mentioned on Second Stage that a minimum of 40 per cent should be devoted to prize money.  The prize money is an important factor to people who are investing a small sum each week in a lottery.  They look at the prize money that is available.  This shows people that the prize money is adequate and attractive.</P>
      <P>The other aspect which is equally important &mdash; I would say it is more important in this case &mdash; is the whole idea and the whole objective of this proposed lottery.  I do not wish to repeat what I said on Second Stage but we cannot have some abstract objective for the public.  In the amendment the Minister says &ldquo;the purposes of such one or more of the following, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time, that is to say, sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951) and the health of the community, and&rdquo;&mdash; this is the important one &mdash;&ldquo;such (if any) other purposes, and in such amounts, as the Government may determine from time to time&rdquo;.  If my interpretation of that is correct it means we are writing into legislation that the proceeds of the lottery could be spent on almost anything and to any amount.</P>
      <P>I want to go back to the case I made in relation to sport.  I join with Deputy O'Kennedy in thanking the Minister for listening to the views of the people on all sides of the House.  The Minister said that the significant portion of the proceeds would be devoted to sport.  At least there was some progress in that regard.  Anybody who is promoting a lottery and trying to get the public's perception of that lottery correct should realise that sport is the main and primary attraction for the general public.  I have had some experience of dealing with the 67 governing bodies of sport in this country who represent over 1.25 million people.  They have high expectations of this lottery.</P>

      <Col N="2074" /> In 1983 the allocation for sport was £619,000.  I know it is now about £1.5 million which is a fairly major increase. There is pressure from the sporting organisations to try to get a regular funding mechanism, in other words, that there would not be a stop-go situation, so that they could plan in advance, that they could arrange for international events for 1987 because they would have some idea of what was available to them.  There can be a fairly wide definition of the word &ldquo;significant&rdquo; in the Minister's speech.  At least it is a commitment that sport has a kind of priority in this lottery.  If the sporting organisations and the governing bodies saw that they would benefit significantly, from this lottery that would mean the success of this lottery.</P>
    <P>Will the proceeds from the lottery which will be devoted to sport be in addition to the annual allocation?  There is a strong economic case to be made for the promotion of sport.  I spoke on Second Stage about the major voluntary contributions and the very generous sponsorship which are available and the value of getting young people involved in activities of all kinds.  There are many areas in sport apart from what the grant-in-aid is intended for.  I am talking about what we had in this House some time ago, for example, the outdoor education centres and recreational facilities.  The recreational facilities grants were withdrawn some time ago.  If this lottery can be made successful it could be a major source of finance for the promotion of sport.</P>
    <P>We have certain facilities for recreation, we have sport centres, and there is a case to be made, economically, for the building up of such facilities.  I agree with some of the points made about the health of the community, but if you ask people to become involved in a lottery whose proceeds will be devoted to the health of the community, to recreation, the arts and culture, I do not believe you will make it attractive enough to be a success. If that is to be written into legislation, anything goes and you will have applications from Connemara and throughout the country for vast sporting facilities.  I should like the Minister to <Col N="2075" /> examine that aspect of the national lottery, which is a completely new concept.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy spoke about the huge sums devoted annually to the health of the community.  When you regard the proceeds from this lottery as a contribution to health funding it will be a very small amount.  In a single year it would be less than £2 million or £3 million &mdash; I do not know what the contribution of the Irish Hospital Sweeps was annually.</P>
    <P>It will be important to try to sell this lottery and we must have an objective that will be attractive to the people.  I think the Bill caters very well for the prize money and I am not worried about that part of this section.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has referred to some of the points made both on Second Stage and this week. However, I regard the Minister's amendment as inadequate and I would hope he will support our amendment.  I share Deputy Creed's viewpoint about making the lottery a success.  Deputy Skelly told us that some lotteries in the US were financial flops.  People contributing to this lottery and buying their weekly or monthly tickets will need to know they will be doing it for a good reason.  It is all right to say it is &ldquo;for the health of the community&rdquo; but in the political climate of the day, if there is a shortfall in the funding of any of the Departments, I am sure the Government will hijack some of the proceeds of this lottery to fill that gap.  If the lottery is to be a success people will have to understand that the proceeds will go to the promotion of sport, culture, the Irish language and the arts, but we must impress on them that the main purpose will be the promotion of sport.  Since the idea of the lottery was first mooted seven years ago it has been thought by people that the proceeds would be devoted to the promotion of sport. People will have their flutter and they will be more likely to do it if they think their money will be devoted to sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thrust of the Bill will be dissipated if we are to believe some of <Col N="2076" /> the words used by the Minister.  We were told that the money will be dissipated among several worthy objectives, unspecified, &ldquo;as the Government may decide from time to time&rdquo;.  That is not good enough.  As I said earlier, the Government from time to time may find themselves short of money and decide to hijack some of the proceeds.  We are suggesting that the proceeds will be used as an addition to the amounts annually voted in the budget for education and sport.  There is nothing in the Bill or the ministerial amendments to guarantee that.  I am afraid that these funds will go into the general coffers of the Government.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not attract the public to involve themselves in the lottery.  People have been talking about the proper equipping of sports centres and of a national sports centre.  If any of us was to attend a sports meeting tonight and asked the people what they thought the proceeds should be devoted to they would say it should go to the provision of a national sports centre.</P>

      <P>I will come to that.  I have spoken about the need for such a centre in Athlone.  I put it to the Minister to tell us what proportion of the proceeds will be applied to sporting and recreational facilities.  Would he not meet us half way in our amendment which would have selling value for the lottery.  Does the Minister appreciate the therapeutic and medical values of sports promotion? Has the Minister consulted with his colleague, Deputy Barrett, on these matters?</P>

      <P>I accept without qualification the points made by Deputy Creed. It was always thought that this lottery would be used to fund an area which we cannot afford to fund, and not for recreation and sport.  I have always said that we do not understand the arts or culture and that we will not be able to improve the arts we have already.  The only use we make of our culture is to entertain foreign dignatories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say, as I usually do, with the exception of Deputy Haughey's attempts.  I would like to bring reality into this situation.  As Deputy O'Rourke has said &mdash; and I accept her sincerity &mdash; it is the gathering of money. If we go back to biblical times, Christ spoke about the tax gatherers.  We are going to gather a tax.  We are going to call it a lottery.  Let us take it a bit further. It is a very inefficient way of gathering money as opposed to taxing people.  I am 1,000 per cent certain that those involved have never thought about lotteries.  If they had thought deeply about it we would not have put them in.  There are spin-offs.  This Bill will go through, because everybody is in favour of it except myself.  I have to put on the record what I feel about it.  We should use the lottery for the best possible purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With our young population I see the need for facilities which we have never had.  All those of my age group and older know that when we were young we had no facilities whatsoever.  We did not even have a place to swim.  Sport will do nothing to feed the nation and will not employ very many.  As we are trying to put most people on unemployment assistance or social welfare payments, we need this kind of activity to keep our minds off other things.  I am not trying to be insulting when I say that this is an inefficient way of raising money as opposed to taxing people, but I would like to see a headline that this lottery is a voluntary tax not only on the poor but the stupid.  We are guaranteed a minimum 40 per cent payout. We are talking about a huge amount of money and ridiculously laughable odds of up to one million to one.  The odds are so ridiculous that only stupid people will buy the damn things because one has no chance of winning.  If anyone were to tell me that they were going to buy a ticket for £1, that the prize money is £1 million and that their chances of winning are one million to one, I would say that they were totally stupid and they were thick, unless they wanted to give the £1 contribution <Col N="2078" /> to the State, which is another way of looking at it.  If the Government collect enough pounds they will be able to build the things they want to build and we would not have to waste 60 per cent of it on overheads etc. in order to pretend we were doing something worthwhile.  If something is worth doing in the life of the nation, it is worth taxing people for.</P>
    <P>At present countries are getting out of lotteries.  Governments have made pronouncements on them.  Ministers have made pronouncements on them.  Sociologists have made pronouncements on them and everybody have made pronouncements on them because they are immoral.  They are an immoral way of collecting tax.  I am surprised to hear otherwise very sensible, mature and learned people going on about this lottery as if it is something wonderful.  This lottery is a disaster for our people.  It is a tax on the poor; and today I have said it is a tax on the stupid.  On all the race courses around the country at present those who attempt to buy tickets for these accumulators or prizes, I forget the name of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the accumulator, but it is something like that.  Anyway, very few do it and none of the regular punters does it because the odds are so long.  That is what we are asking people to do.  Let me say one other thing which is very important and which I hope will not be forgotten.  At some time in the future we will review the situation. Everybody has the best of intentions.  Not only is it a tax on the poor and the stupid, but it will also cause unemployment. Nobody has considered that.  It will definitely cause unemployment.  The only way we can get around that is to do something similar to what has been done <Col N="2079" /> in the football pools in England and that is to keep it manual as much as possible. Then we will be able to create, just like they had in the Sweepstake ten year ago, 1,000 jobs for people who are generally unemployable, such as widows.</P>
      <P>Remember that what we are doing is collecting a tax in order to keep them going.  The sad part is that most of the money is going to be swallowed up.  We do not know whether or not it is going to be able to make a profit within that 60 per cent.  If we spend that 60 per cent in importing technological equipment such as terminals in order to run the lottery, we are also at a loss.  Apart from the fact that it is going to compete with sweeps, horse racing, dog tracks, pools etc., the profit motive is based on the fact that we will have a monopoly.  The company going to run the lottery will have a monopoly. I want to point out those things when we talk about where the money should go.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been generous in trying to meet Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment.  If what Deputy O'Kennedy is afraid of happens and if, as Deputy O'Rourke has said, the money is hijacked and brought back into the general coffers and absorbed into the Estimates, as has been mentioned, it will be laughable.  The Government would be a laughing stock if they did that.  It would be a fraud.  The Government would then be saying that they were going to collect money under false pretences in a lottery and would use it if they got into trouble. I do not think that any Minister of any Government has that intention.</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's point and can see that she is worried about it. <Col N="2080" /> If that happened not only would we not deserve to be in Government, it is unlikely we would be in Government because we would be way down past scraping the barrel in trying to get this few extra pounds.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy made the argument for the Minister.  In the health area spending is at £1.1 billion.  If £20 million were added to that it would be swallowed up.  What reason would the Government have for doing that?  If a Government were thinking politically, they would be more inclined to spend the money in the way Deputy Creed spoke about.  If we were that badly off, it would do something for the unemployed and in providing facilities for a nation that was crippled.  Have we to stoop so low as to start taking the pennies which are going to be handed up by the less well off, from whom most of the money in lotteries comes?  I would not have any worries about that and I would be quite happy, even with a Fianna Fáil Government or a Progressive Democrats/Fianna Fáil Government, to leave the section as it is, allowing the Government to apply the moneys for such purposes as they may from time to time determine.  The only genuine worry is that it might be blatantly and deliberately used to promote the policies of whatever Government happen to be in power.  If that is the concern, it is a genuine one, but it is catered for by the structure of the other sections.  In the long run a company will be spending the money and that is where the attention of the critics should be directed.  We must make sure that whatever company has this power cannot abuse it &mdash; for instance, by using the same suppliers as are used at present.  I will refer to that point again. I do not know whether the Minister should tie his hands again by taking that amendment.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Rourke about the public perception of this lottery.  We are certainly not going to go back over 2000 years and do as Lot did by looking over his shoulder because he did not pay out the proceeds of the lottery he ran. Perhaps that is why he was turned into a pillar of salt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2081" /> We are really splitting hairs and being oversensitive.  The Opposition are being very sensitive to the powers being given to the Minister or the Government.  If a change of Government comes about and we are in Opposition we will be very happy to see this lottery properly set up so that there will be no criticism of it. That is the general intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go back into Biblical history but I will go back a few years and remind Deputy Skelly what happened to the youth employment levy. That is one of the reasons we are anxious to have this section changed.  The Government's intention in relation to this Bill was shown when the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, was asked to take it.  If one examined the history of this legislation one would have to go back to the days of Deputy Jim Tunney and Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn and the former Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Donal Creed.  There is no doubt that the perception of the vast majority of people was that this national lottery was designed to promote sport and the provision of greatly improved facilities for large numbers of people.  I am not talking about very specialised facilities, although they too are important.  Deputy Creed would also like to see the proceeds of the lottery spent for the benefit of the majority.  I would refer specifically to the community games which are being run very successfully with very scarce resources. Extra funds could provide great benefits.  There is reference to the health of the community but I suspect this means the few miserable pounds now coming from the Sweepstake.</P>
      <P>Deputy Skelly claims this is a very inefficient way of raising money.  I suppose the Government have thought of every other means of taxation and this is probably the least painful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public perception of this lottery is vital to its success.  It will not succeed if the public suspect that the money is to be used as part of general Government revenue.  Deputy Creed obviously carried out a lot of research on this matter, but <Col N="2082" /> the Government's intentions were shown when the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service came into this House with this Bill rather than his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>We are short of first-class facilities for a number of sports.  Swimming is an example.  There is no 50-metre pool which is a standard utility for international swimming.  There was tremendous criticism recently after an international soccer match about the state of the pitch.  There is no doubt that the vast majority of young people feel that the revenue from the lottery should be devoted to sports facilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment is reasonable and goes some way towards meeting the various points raised on Second Stage.  I acknowledge that the Minister has gone some way to meet the points made by Members on Second Stage but I cannot understand his reluctance to accept Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment.  The Bill is supported by the vast majority of Members and I do not see why the Minister will not copperfasten the various percentages in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will forgive me if I am a little suspicious.  It is my view that he is anxious to hold the first lottery a short time before Christmas so that the people in a festive mood will support it.  I do not think there is any festivity left in the country following the activities of the Government in recent years.  The hope is that following that first lottery the Minister for Finance at budget time in January will have a little extra in his back pocket to spread the goodies.  Approaching the general election the Government hope to be able to spread jam on the margarine people have had to use up to now.</P>

I have never seen so much difference about a Bill the principle of which is accepted by so many Members. The Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to his eloquent plea.  What strikes me about the discussion is the similarity in the approach suggested by Deputy O'Kennedy and the amendment I tabled.  There is one essential difference in that I consider it necessary that we should retain a degree of flexibility so that other purposes could be added.  I want to knock on the head any suggestion that there is any intention to use lottery funds for general Government purposes.  I should like to reiterate that all the receipts after expenses and prizes are met will be devoted to official uses as already announced by the Government or such further beneficial uses as will be announced. It is my view that it is proper and appropriate to write into the Bill the general beneficial uses already announced by the Government.</P>
      <P>There is an acceptance that I have tried to respond to the positive views expressed by Members on both sides.  However, I believe that the enabling power is necessary in case the Government of the day decide to use some funds for other beneficial purposes.</P>

      <P>It could happen that such an organisation would not be operating directly in the area of sport, culture, the arts or health.  My hands would be tied in that event and I could not fulfil my commitment.  The proposal I put forward gives me a degree of flexibility to enable me to fulfil my commitment.  I should like to give another example.  This morning I was given a letter from Comhairle Náisiúnta na nÓg in regard to the lottery.  I have not had an opportunity to take any advice on whether the proposal in the letter can be accommodated under subsection (a) and I am not saying the proposal cannot be covered but I want to use that letter as an example.  If I find that the official uses I have outlined do not cover the activities sponsored by that organisation I will not be able to help them.  There is a need for flexibility to facilitate such organisations.</P>
      <P>The House should bear in mind that the Bill provides for full visibility of what is done in regard to the lottery.  There will have to be a public announcement in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of any such purpose and it will be possible to have it debated in the House.  There is no possibility of underthe-counter activities in regard to the proceeds of the lottery.  I hope that by reasoned argument the Opposition will see the need for this flexibility.  I have every confidence in the Irish electorate returning my party to power after the next election but there must exist a remote possibility that the main party in Opposition might some day in the near or distant future find themselves on this side of the House.  I am sure in that unlikely event their Minister would not like to have his hands tied on this issue. A worthy cause, which may carry the endorsement of all sides of the House and the public, may be presented to the Minister who would not like to have his hands tied in regard to the granting of funds to it.</P>

      <P>The Government, in announcing the lottery on 17 October 1985, said that the proceeds of the lottery would be used to assist sport and recreation, the arts, culture, the Irish language and health.  There is nothing new about the health element and I want to knock any suggestions or suspicions in regard to that.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy made some play of the use of the phrase &ldquo;of the community&rdquo;. When the papers came back from the parliamentary draftsman I asked why these words should be included and it was made clear to me that if the word &ldquo;health&rdquo; were left in on its own it could be legally interpreted as meaning animal health or some such thing.  The reason for inserting the words &ldquo;of the community&rdquo; was to make it quite clear we were talking about human health.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to point out that many existing bodies are doing outstanding work with regard to health.  I am sure colleagues here subscribe to many of them and, if I may be forgiven for being somewhat parochial, perhaps I could quote the example of Cork Polio.  There are many similar organisations doing excellent work and I consider it quite proper that their work might be helped by giving them a portion of the proceeds of the lottery.  I am sure most Members here would agree with me on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>They are also included in my amendment.  It appears we are not at odds.  Perhaps we are approaching the target from two different directions but we are allowing the Minister of the day the flexibility to achieve the same result.  As I expected, I was very impressed by Deputy Creed's pleas on behalf of sport.  He was capably supported by Deputy Calleary, a quite natural thing in view of his background.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy used the word &ldquo;target&rdquo;.  I confirm that sport will be the main target area of the lottery.  Deputy Creed said he would like to see sport and recreation having a kind of priority and I can confirm that this will be so.  I also confirm that the amount allocated from the proceeds for sport and recreation will be significant and that it is the intention of the Government that such benefits will be additional to existing supports.  Sport as a beneficiary was foremost in the thinking of the Government when they decided to establish the lottery and I have no doubt that substantial funding will be available from the lottery once it is operating successfully.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke referred to a national sports centre.  I agree we need a fully equipped sports centre but I shall not get into any hassle as to its location.</P>

What is being put before the House is an enabling procedure that we hope will permit an increasing amount of money to be available each year for the purposes we have outlined.  Of course a national sports centre could be one item to which the money could be put.</P>

    <P>Deputy Skelly made a point which brings out the fundamental difference between Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment and my amendment.  I think some degree of flexibility should be left to the Minister but so far Deputy O'Kennedy does not agree with me fully on that <Col N="2087" /> point.  Deputy Skelly summed up the position very succinctly when he said we would be silly to tie our hands.  I agree with him and I also think that a degree of flexibility, with all the safeguards already provided, should be available to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In my amendment I have set out specific commitments.  I have proposed that not less than half of the total proceeds should be provided for the promotion of sport and sporting and recreational facilities.  As I understood it, that is in line with all the general statements and intentions set out by the various Ministers over the years and reechoed by the Minister today.  If we want to achieve what we agree is necessary, I suggest the Minister should accept my amendment.  Nothing he has said has convinced me there is any reason for not accepting it.</P>
      <P>My first responsibility in Government, and one I enjoyed greatly, was as Parliamentary Secretary with responsibility for youth and sport.  I established the first sports council, the predecessor of the present Cospóir.  Those of us who have had dealings with community organisations have been greatly impressed by them and I should like to think we could go a stage further and specifically commit not less than half of the proceeds for the promotion of sport and sporting and recreational facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he does not want to have his hands tied.  I am not trying to do that.  My amendment does the opposite because it also uses the words &ldquo;charitable and voluntary philanthropic purposes&rdquo;. That would cover any general intention as referred to by the Minister.  My amendment also speaks about &ldquo;the arts and culture&rdquo;.  In a way, I prefer the Minister's reference to &ldquo;the arts, national culture, including the Irish language&rdquo;.  I would like to be associated with that, but we are talking about giving effect to what was agreed.  We will not reach agreement on who will be responsible in Government in one or two years' time.  I will leave that to the people.  Any punter or anybody <Col N="2088" /> with a shrewd eye to the political scene will come down very heavily on the fact that it is money-on that the Minister and his party will not be in Government in a few years' time.</P>

      <P>We are not trying to tie the hands of this Government but we want to enter into a commitment which will be honoured by every successive Government and which will be part of the legislation we pass.  As my colleague, Deputy Calleary, alias Séan Kelly in the days when he was playing two sports &mdash; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who was a rugby player and supporter, will appreciate that he had to use the two names because he was very proficient in both Gaelic football and rugby &mdash; said, sport is the attraction and will sell the lottery.</P>
      <P>There is no point delaying the House any further.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment, which covers all the points raised and most important, ensures that half the proceeds of the lottery will go to sporting and recreational facilities. We are not talking about intentions. I do not doubt the Minister's intentions, but I am anxious to ensure that the law we pass will guarantee what will be done with the proceeds of this lottery.  That is why I believe my amendment deserves the support of the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and I are not very far apart in our intentions except that I believe there must be a certain degree of flexibility.  I have given a very strong commitment to sport and I do not believe it is necessary to actually write those commitments into the Bill. We need to have a certain degree of flexibility and I have already outlined the reasons why.  I do not have the slightest doubt but that sport will gain significantly from this lottery but I do not believe it should be written into the Bill.  I would remind Deputies that my amendment was put down having listened to the various contributions made on Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4a:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Voluntary organisations whose sole purposes are the promotion of the well-being of the handicapped, disadvantaged and underprivileged shall be authorised by the Company to act as Agents for the sale of Lottery tickets for the purposes of sale through their individual organisations subject to an agreed commission and a proportion of the profits of such sales at a rate not less than 20 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are anxious to ensure that the funds of voluntary organisations, their fund raising activities and the various resources at their disposal for entirely desirable and commendable principles should be not only protected but enhanced as a consequence of this legislation.  Many speakers on all sides of the House, while supporting the idea of a lottery, have naturally been concerned as to what impact it will have on voluntary organisations. It will have all the resources of the State behind it; it will be in a monopoly and will have the resources, financial and otherwise, to gather the maximum amount of available money for the purpose of the lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all conscious that there is a definite limit on the funds available from the community, even for desirable purposes. We are very concerned that the consequences of launching the lottery will not be to undermine the role and function of the many voluntary organisations who have made a magnificent contribution to the wellbeing of society generally.  Nowadays, <Col N="2094" /> one hears far too much negative criticism of the condition of society, the lack of direction, idealism and purpose. We also hear criticism in relation to vandalism and breakdown of the family and their causes and we must address ourselves to these problems.</P>
    <P>The most effective way to do this is to encourage people not just to concentrate on their own immediate, personal, selfish needs but to become involved in the voluntary work of so many of these organisations, especially those dedicated to the wellbeing of the handicapped, disadvantaged and underprivileged.  A characteristic of what is best in our community over the past 15 or 20 years is that so many of these organisations have become entrenched in the community and have won considerable support and respect from them because of the work they do. We should ensure that this legislation will not undermine those organisations, particularly the positive effect they have on society.  I know they had discussions with the Minister &mdash; it is no secret and I am not breaching any confidences &mdash; and they also had discussions with me as the appropriate spokesman for the Opposition. I was greatly impressed by the case they made and this amendment is to give effect to that case.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations should be appointed as commission agents for the sale, through their own organisations, of lottery tickets.  If the lottery is set up before this commitment is entered into and this arrangement made, it is almost inevitable that, as the lottery is launched and funds are made available by the community for it, these organisations will be immediately disadvantaged unless we link them to the lottery system.  They would be the ideal people to link to the sale and distribution of tickets through their own organisations.  This does not mean they would have the right to compete &mdash; if that is the word &mdash; with the normal channels, for example, sub-post offices of An Post.</P>
    <P>However, they could act as agents for the sale of lottery tickets through their individual organisations.  That would guarantee that these organisations, who <Col N="2095" /> have been so effective in raising funds for their very laudable purposes, would also be enabled to do the same in respect of the sale of lottery tickets on a commission basis.  If that is not done, all these voluntary organisations, who are household names dealing with the handicapped and so on, will be placed at a great disadvantage when the lottery is launched.</P>
    <P>The promotion of the lottery, the publicity attached to it and the specific channels of sale through An Post and otherwise will mean that unless voluntary organisations are recruited as agents &mdash; with a very defined purpose and limited channels &mdash; they will lose out.  I am sure nobody here wants to see them in that position.  We would all like to see them not only maintaining their position but enhancing it.  This can be achieved by giving them commission on sales, referred to in section 6, which enables the company to authorise such persons as it may determine to sell national lottery tickets.  The total number of persons will be determined by the company with the consent of the Minister.  I propose that here the organisations should be specified &mdash; for example, organisations concerned with the well-being of the handicapped, disadvantaged and underprivileged.</P>
    <P>If the Minister follows through to form, his response will be that he does not want to tie his hands even though his intention is to help these organisations.  He may say that as it stands at the moment he is free to authorise such persons as he wishes.  It also means that he need not authorise certain persons.  While the Minister should have a certain discretion in this area, there should be specific provision for these organisations.</P>
    <P>I mentioned also that there should be an agreed commission.  That is a matter for the promoters of the lottery and the organisations to work out the appropriate commission and arrangements by which they would actually effect the sale of the tickets.  I would suggest that it should be not less than 20 per cent of the profits, which is not excessive.  I might have said 30 per cent or 40 per cent but I say not less than 20 per cent of the lottery, for <Col N="2096" /> other purposes, would take 80 per cent. That is about as good a balance as one could strike.  We would like to see that 30 or 40 per cent but at this stage I do not know enough, any more than the Minister does, about what the receipts from the lottery would be.  But if there is a commission and a 20 per cent profit this would enable them to have a guaranteed income dependent on their own promotions to enhance or maintain their income which comes almost exclusively from voluntary activities.  I have little doubt that, given the challenge, they will respond very effectively and that not only will they protect their own interests and the interests of those they are concerned about but they will enhance the proceeds of the lottery by really using this opportunity to expand their own activities through their own organisations.</P>
    <P>I will end by asking who is going to gain from this.  The handicapped, the disadvantaged and the underprivileged will benefit.  The Minister might say that they are covered in general terms by the Department of Health.  This is far too broad.  While I recognise it as an important target area that can cover anything from building hospitals to health administration and that it already accounts for £1.213 billion, I am anxious for the success of the lottery so that our own people, who have shown a magnificent response in this area, will continue to treat those who have been visited with handicap, who are disadvantaged or underprivileged as special, because they are.  We all acknowledge that.  If one watches the various sporting activities on television or at community games we are never more inspired than when watching those organised for the handicapped.  People get a sense of fulfilment just watching the sheer joy and happiness that accrues to these people who have a special place in our society.  I do not need to say any more.  The facts speak for themselves.  I ask the Minister to recognise the role of these organisations whose job it is to help these people.  The Minister will be doing a great day's work if he responds to our proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the sentiments of Deputy O'Kennedy in putting down this amendment.  I realise that we should support this section of our society.  The Minister can do that himself or through the company by allowing them to be an outlet for the sale of tickets.  It has been done before, but unfortunately it does not work.  It does not work because once voluntary organisations get exclusivity like that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not exclusive to them.  Their purposes are exclusive but they would not be exclusive sales agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are given tickets and are in this category they get this 20 per cent commission.  It is aimed at those people.  It does not work because the organisation give the job to either a company or people with experience who will get involved in selling the tickets for the benefit of the organisation and pass the cheque back to them.  But then we are into the old Catch 22 situation which we have always had with those organisations collecting for charities and voluntary organisations dealing with the Third World in that much of the money goes on administration, promotion costs and so on.  That was tried in another lottery in Canada and it was abused to such an extent that eventually they dropped it and left it open because they could not control it.  The company could do it if they wanted to.  But there is another snag, that is, that fixing a figure of 20 per cent means that 80 per cent goes back to the lottery company and then there is an assumption that in that 80 per cent there will be profit for the central fund and the remainder will go for general overheads and administration of the company. There is no guarantee that there will be anything left for the lottery fund if we go along that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third element is one in which I see the most danger, and one cannot write everything into the main legislation.  It is important that all outlets allowed to sell tickets would operate on an equal footing <Col N="2098" /> with the main company so that the company, especially for commission purposes, cannot use all their own outlets and lump them together so that their sales would be greater than anybody else's and therefore they would be entitled to more commission.  The company control the volume of tickets going to any particular outlet and can also ensure that their outlets receive supplies as a priority.  I know one cannot itemise everything in legislation, but that is very important from the equity point of view.  Equity, honesty and the uprightness of the whole system have been very carefully taken into account in the drafting of the legislation, hence the law section dealing with the scrutineer's appointment.  If a wrongly numbered ticket is drawn and a dispute is involved as a result, the blame might fall back on the Minister.  That is why we have these protective sections included in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but as far as one can see regarding the organisation of the lottery and the conditions under which it is organised, there is very little likelihood of the Minister being blamed in regard to the running of the lottery.  The Bill is rather well drafted in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Deputy is right, but I think the buck will stop with the Minister.  It is important that his office be protected all the way through by independent auditors and scrutineers and that we do not include in the legislation an amendment such as this which could cause complications and problems by abuses creeping in, not on the part of voluntary organisations but of other business organisations, consultants and outlets that do get involved and have got involved in a very big way internationally through voluntary Third World and charitable organisations.  It was discovered that as little as 10 per cent and 5 per cent of the money collected for the disadvantaged poor of the Third World eventually found its way to them.  Perhaps the Minister might mention whether, under the terms and conditions, <Col N="2099" /> he could incorporate the commission aspects.  If he is satisfied after examination, that it could work, I would have no objection to taking it on board and it is a rather unique and clever way for Deputy O'Kennedy to try to help those who are inevitably going to be affected as a result of the setting up of this lottery, which I think is his main concern.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He is concerned that they are going to be hammered.  There is no question that not only lotteries but bingo pools, and also horse racing will be affected as a result of setting up the lottery. In the legislation the Minister can if he wishes, if he does not accept that amendment, take account of or perhaps advise the company to take account of this.  The company's interests may conflict, for example, with the Government's interests or the policy of the Government of the day.  I have the impression that some Members think that because it is An Post that are going to be the first appointee or licensee, they will automatically be working in favour of the Government, the Government employees.  That is not necessarily so.  A company's interests will not be the same as those of the Government.  That is another reason why it is important that the Minister reserve on to himself the power to be able closely to scrutinise the operation of the lottery, direct it and make orders as it gets going.</P>
      <P>The intention is that the lottery will be for the benefit of those bodies to which Deputy Creed has referred and ultimately for the benefit of the taxpayer, even though I think that may not be possible. They are the sentiments and that is what it is attempting to achieve.  I wonder if it would be advisable to take this on board, given the experience internationally of other lotteries.  It took them years to get the lottery back out of the system and the Minister might be better advised to look at it from arm's length.</P>

It is necessary that safeguards be built into the legislation to protect the voluntary organisations. A group of organisations for the handicapped have grouped themselves together.  I gather that there are 40 included, but there are many other smaller organisations and charities that will suffer severely when this lottery is set up.  They advertised in the past but will not have the power and wealth to compete in advertising with the new operation.  That type of organisation will be severely hot.  I have grave reservations about that.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to see my friend, Deputy Skelly, in support.  He spoke out vehemently against another Bill which was being introduced into the House some time ago and was instrumental in having it withdrawn.  This was a form of lottery or gaming.  No Government should be involved in a lottery because it gives bad example.  No matter what guarantees are given by the Minister, there will be only so much money to go around.  There are 40 very deserving charities that call themselves the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped.  They have done much-needed work in the past and I hope they will continue to do that.  All of those charities grew out of voluntary subscriptions and their own type of lottery. Many in recent years have been helped, aided and assisted by the health boards or the Department of Health, which may be the same thing.  They will have to face further restriction because they will not have the type of funding which is available to a national lottery. One voluntary organisation that comes to mind is the Cork Polio and General Association, which had done tremendous work in our area, and Deputy Creed is as familiar with this as I am.  They are suffering at present because of the economic climate and there will be further restraints imposed on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> There will be further restraints imposed on them because they will not have the moneys available from the sources they had in the past.  At the end of the day people will only have so much money to spend on lotteries, to buy tickets or to take part in non-stop draws.  We, as politicians, suffer enormously from having to purchase tickets.  I am concerned about this, especially for the voluntary organisations.  I have just singled out one which will have its problems.  It has given a service to the community by aiding the physically and mentally handicapped. I do not think any words of ours would be able to thank them for what they have done.  It was done basically through voluntary subscriptions, lotteries and pools.  Those organisations have made submissions to both the Opposition and to the Government.  They made very worth-while suggestions which the Minister should bear in mind.  He should look at them sympathetically because of their nature and the type of work that they do.  Being offered an agency is not very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The moneys collected by all Governments can often stray into central funds.  The money for the youth employment levy has strayed.  In a tight budgetary position there will be leakages and it will be hard to come to grips with the problem.  Because of the State involvement a certain amount of political representations will be made to get increased funding for organisations above and beyond what the allocation may be.  I do not agree with this.  It will be embarrassing for the administrators and for the Minister.  He will have a certain amount of authority, discretion and power and will be able to make recommendations. That is a weakness and a reservation which I express about the lottery.</P>
    <P>We are being told that the vast majority of the population in the years ahead will be in the greater Dublin area.</P>

      <P>It seems that there will be a further weakening from the <Col N="2102" /> point of view of rural areas, small towns and villages.  The money will be inclined to gravitate towards the Dublin area for projects in Dublin.  The rural areas will not get their fair share of what will be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might not be there.  There will definitely be damage done to voluntary and charitable organisations.  I received a submission which states that damage is likely to be done to the fund raising programmes of voluntary organisations for the handicapped by the national lottery.  It will entice away from them some of their subscription income.  The scale of the damage will be at its highest for those bodies promoting weekly pools and instant number games.  That is very definite in the climate in which we live.  There will be an erosion of the funding of those organisations for the reasons I stated. The submission states further that the degree of impact lessens but is nevertheless acute for infrequent lotteries and door to door collections.  We must remember that the money is collected by voluntary people who give up their time.</P>
      <P>In this new operation we will have a bureaucracy.  We, as politicians, have to deal with them from time to time.  We will now have another one.  We will have administrative costs we could well do without.  Those are the weaknesses I see from the point of view of the voluntary and charitable organisations.  We should have a certain amount of professional sport but, at the same time, our priorities should be to look after the handicapped and the retarded people in our society. This is all being done very adequately by voluntary organisations.  Many are now suffering because of our budgetary position. A large percentage of funding will now be taken from them because of this new development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give the impression to the House that I am not <Col N="2103" /> in support of voluntary organisations or organisations who do what I would describe as very commendable work for the community.  Of all the sections of the Bill, this is one of the areas where we should not under any circumstances restrict the Minister in any way in writing into the Bill any action we feel should be taken in this area.  My personal opinion, and it is the opinion of others too, is that if there was one national lottery, if all the lotteries were under one umbrella, it would be a more effective and efficient way of raising funds, which is the purpose of the lottery.  Listening to some of the contributions one would get the impression that the Minister for Finance is introducing a lottery &mdash; which I hope will be successful &mdash; and we will go out to the highways and byways and say to the voluntary organisations: &ldquo;Make your claim if you feel that this has militated against your lottery in any way.  The Minister, the Exchequer and the proceeds of the lottery are there to redress your position&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When we talk about channelling tickets through all those organisations the principle may be good.  We will get the goodwill of the organisations and of people who have been involved in lotteries for a considerable time.  However, if we do that to the extent that the amendment proposes, we are creating an administrative monster and sinking the lottery.  That is one area about which I am very concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Cospóir, the National Sports Council, made their submission to the Minister in 1979 it was included in that submission that voluntary and existing lotteries should be looked at, that those who were doing charitable work and providing a service in the community should not be weakened in any way and their work should be recognised.  How do you recognise or assess the damage being done by a national lottery?  This is why I say the Minister's hands should not be tied in any way.  If any one of the long list of voluntary or charitable organisations comes to the Minister when the national lottery is in existence and says: &ldquo;We have <Col N="2104" /> lost hundreds of thousands of pounds,&rdquo; how does the Minister deal with a situation of that sort if he is restricted in this legislation?</P>
    <P>The national lottery will militate against the fund raising efforts of smaller voluntary organisations if we force them to submit audited accounts of those efforts.  If you insist on insuring them against carelessness or negligence it will be too much for them.  The State and the national lottery will come to the rescue anyway no matter how much money has to be made up.  This is a dangerous area over which the Minister should be given control.</P>
    <P>Which voluntary organisations will benefit from the Bill?  We have been given a long list of them during the past 48 hours and I agree with Deputies who complimented them on the valuable work they do.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in those who promote sports for the handicapped. Anybody who had the honour to attend the Special Olympics, to which we invited 15 nations, would appreciate the valuable work that organisation do.  I would be worried about the voluntary organisations and the charitable organisations which have not been listed.  We have the Simon Community providing accommodation for the homeless, and valuable work has been done by other such bodies.</P>
    <P>There is a job here for the Minister and he must sit down and work out some agreement or arrangement with voluntary organisations because it will be necessary to control them.  There is a large amount of duplication of voluntary effort because of the multiplicity of charitable organisations.  There is considerable wastage because of competition between so many bodies.  We should like to know which organisations will come under the scope of this Bill.  There are some organisations who have dubious objectives.  It is a difficult job for the Minister and I agree that he should have the maximum possible flexibility.  My point is that we do not want the national lottery to militate against those organisations, but at the same time we must be realistic and approach the matter in a cautious way. <Col N="2105" /> For that reason, I suggest to Deputies opposite that they should not press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the work of the voluntary organisations referred to by Deputy Creed.  Their efforts will not be diminished by this Bill. When we are considering this matter we must bear in mind that most lotteries run by these bodies earn subscribers not for monetary gain but because people wish to support these charities.</P>
      <P>The first point that must be dealt with is that the establishment of the national lottery with very big prizes should not diminish the efforts of those organisations and the excellent work they are undertaking and will continue to undertake. Very extensive discussions have taken place between officers of the Departments of Finance and Justice in regard to the various concerns expressed by these organisations and an effort was made to come up with responses to those concerns.  There will be four specific areas in the Government's response to the concern put forward by representatives of voluntary bodies.  The first is the existence of restrictions on advertising and publicity provided for in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  Continuation of those restrictions would affect those bodies in the promotion of their lotteries side by side with the national lottery.  The restrictions will be lifted.</P>
      <P>More important, there are limits on the prize money those organisations are able to offer.  At present those limits are governed by the 1956 Act.  Lotteries operated under Garda permit cannot exceed £300 and lotteries governed by District Court licences have a maximum of £500.  A case has been made for substantial increases in the prizes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>How much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 34 of the Bill enables the Minister for Justice to increase the figures substantially.  The £300 limit on lotteries under Garda permit will be increased to £3,000 and lotteries under District Court licences <Col N="2106" /> will be allowed to increase the £500 prize to £10,000.  As a result of section 34 the Minister of Justice will have power to increase those figures and to announce new limits.</P>
      <P>A third point in the Government's response to the case made by charitable organisations is that many of the voluntary bodies would be able to obtain benefit from the national lottery proceeds. The success of the national lottery will help to supplement the work of voluntary and charitable bodies, particularly those mentioned in Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment who deal with the handicapped, the underprivileged and disadvantaged. The provision I have made in section 5 as regards health being a beneficiary of the lottery proceeds will enable to qualify.</P>
      <P>The fourth point I want to state by way of a response to the case made for voluntary bodies is that where such bodies, presently holding periodical lotteries, can demonstrate satisfactorily, if such be the case, that the national lottery has adversely affected their proceeds, the Government are prepared to take steps to make funding available to them from the lottery surplus.  Those are four specific positive responses to the case made by voluntary bodies.  This is the background to the further point now raised by Deputy O'Kennedy.  It must be made clear that it is not intended that the national lottery should supplant in any way the existing fund raising activities of charities or voluntary bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be intended but may do so as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In case it does have that result, there are the four different specific responses which I have mentioned. What I have said so far is by way of background to my specific response.  If there is to be participation in the sale of lottery tickets it will have to be on the same basis as other fixed location sales outlets.  For instance, that rules out door to door sales.  Any such participation (a) would have to be subject to criteria for sound business operation and security to <Col N="2107" /> be established by the lottery company and (b) could only earn the same sales commission as will be paid to business outlets.</P>
      <P>In that situation the retention of a portion of the gross sales proceeds over and above sales commission by any charitable body would be contrary to the structure of the national lottery and the business ethos in which it must operate.  On that basis the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Kennedy must fall.  While the number of agents must have the consent of the Minister, the determination of the agents will be a matter for the lottery company.  They will develop their own criteria.  Apart from their own offices, the indications of what they will be looking for are outlets where there is substantial customer throughput &mdash; for example, food stores, newsagents etc.</P>
      <P>I want to make it very clear that it is not anticipated that there will be a substantial sales commission.  It will be a matter for negotiation and discussion between An Post and the people concerned. The Minister will be indirectly involved from the point of view of setting a ceiling.  Any such commission will not be of the order of 20 per cent.  It will be a fraction of that.  That is an aspect which has to be borne in mind.  There may be a possibility for some voluntary bodies to have discussions with An Post particularly those who have facilities where there is a large throughput of people and who feel that through the level of sales commission they will obtain a return which will bring better benefits to their charity rather than selling lottery tickets of their own.  As I said, that is a matter for discussion between any intending sales body and An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, my heart is with Deputy O'Kennedy's plea on behalf of voluntary bodies.  The four specific areas I have mentioned are a genuine and reasonable response to the concerns voiced by them. I do not believe the approach suggested by Deputy O'Kennedy is the proper response to the concerns expressed by voluntary bodies.  In the circumstances I <Col N="2108" /> am not able to agree to the proposed amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that voluntary bodies can have discussions with An Post.  Will they be able to enter into negotiations and draw up terms of reference of their own which would be more suited to them?  Could the Minister also clarify whether in the case of a voluntary organisation who for one reason or another has to raise once-off funds An Post would have the authority under the Act to agree to fund that type of operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point, I would not like to make too much of the suggestion I made about the possibility of discussions between voluntary bodies and An Post.  I mentioned it merely in passing.  An Post will be establishing a number of sales outlets for the lottery. Conceivably, there might be some voluntary bodies who would have an area where there is a large throughput of people and where it might suit them to have discussions with An Post from the point of view of having an authorised outlet.  In such an eventuality, clearly the basis of the agency arrangements would have to be the same as for everybody else.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have to be negotiated but it cannot go beyond the maximum arrangement available for everybody else.  Therefore, I would not make very much, if anything, of that point.  I see it as a possibility.  My major response is the four specific points I mentioned earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second point, I understand from Deputy O'Keeffe that he is talking about anxiety on the part of some body to apply for some of the lottery surplus for a specific once-off project.  In that situation, such an application will not be to An Post.  An Post will be running the lottery.  The distribution of the surplus will not be a matter for An Post but for the Government.  As pointed out in <Col N="2109" /> section 5, a number of areas, such as art, sport, culture and so on, will benefit from the surplus.  I would not see any problem for a body applying for an allocation for a specific project provided they come under the headings in section 5 (2).  They would not be inhibited from applying, provided they satisfied the criteria.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point I wish to bring to the Minister's attention.  Section 7 (7) (a) states:</P>
      <P>None of the following persons shall be entitled to own a National Lottery ticket that has been purchased for value or awarded as a prize in the National Lottery or any part of such a ticket:</P>
      <P>(i) the Company or a director, agent or employee of the Company,</P>
      <P>(ii) a person who prints National Lottery tickets or an employee of his or, if the person is a company, a director of the company,</P>
      <P>(iii) a person who supplies any computers or other electronic devices of any kind, or part for, or equipment or computer programming or instructions for use in or in conjunction with, any such devices used by the Company or a person who operates, maintains or repairs any such devices used by the Company or an employee of any of the persons aforesaid or, in the case of a person aforesaid that is a company, a director of the company.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (7) (b) states:</P>
      <P>If a person specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection becomes the owner of the whole or part of a National Lottery ticket:</P>
      <P>(i) he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable&mdash;</P>
      <P>(I) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2110" /> (II) On conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £20,000,</P>
    <P>(ii) the National Lottery ticket shall not be entered in the National Lottery and, if it is so entered, the owner or owners thereof shall not be entitled to be awarded any prize in the National Lottery in respect of the ticket, and</P>
    <P>(iii) if a prize is awarded in the National Lottery to the owner or owners of the ticket, the prize shall be returned, not later than one month after its receipt, to the Company and, if it is not so returned, it or an amount equal to its value may be recovered by the Company from the owner or, jointly and severally, from the owners of the ticket as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (7) (c) states:</P>
    <P>It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to show that the National Lottery ticket concerned was purchased for him without his knowledge or consent by another person and (in the case of a person other than the Company) that, as soon as reasonably possible after becoming aware of the purchase, he informed the Company of the purchase and of the fact that he was not entitled to be the owner of the ticket.</P>
    <P>I can see the reason for this provision but it is grounded on the experience of the Sweeps where a person put a hand into a drum and took out a ticket or might have been able to put a hand into the drum with the ticket already stuck to it.  This provision is designed to assure the public that there is no possibility of fiddling.  Let us suppose that the same conditions apply and everything is being dealt with manually. It might be a possibility that somebody could stick in a ticket.  Does not section 7(7) (c) make nonsense of this since it can be put forward as a defence that a ticket was bought without the knowledge of a particular person and that the company were informed of the purchase and of the fact that he was not entitled to be the owner of the ticket?  It is ridiculous.  Somebody might buy a <Col N="2111" /> ticket for a child, but this type of thing could be extended to the purchase of a ticket for an employee of the company.  I understand that this is another precaution by the Minister to ensure against dishonesty but I believe it is silly.  It is stating that people who work in the organisation can tamper with the system.  If that is the case then the system is faulty.  What we should be saying in setting up this lottery is that such a thing cannot happen.  If that is the case, there is no reason why any person should not be able to buy a ticket. There is therefore no reason for this provision, quite apart from the fact that it can be got around.</P>
    <P>Even if it came to pass that someone purchased a ticket for somebody else who actually won money, it is really compounding a minor offence by specifying these penalties.  I am glad imprisonment is not mentioned but rather a fine.  I suggest that the Minister can be well satisfied that there will not be any dishonesty because the lottery will be run with the aid of technology and it is most unlikely that any fraud will take place.  The president of the Ontario lottery won a prize of $50 in his own lottery.  Why bother having this provision since if we cannot control the lottery we should not have one at all?  If we can control it, there is no need for this provision since it is an admission of the possibility that someone on the inside could work the system to his advantage.  The employees and their relatives should not bear the mark of Cain and should be allowed to participate if they wish, in the same way as the employees of companies such as Jacobs and Rowntree Mackintosh can take home biscuits and sweets every weekend at a knockdown price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Skelly's approach but section 7 must be part of the framework of the Bill.  We are providing every possible precaution to ensure absolute public confidence in this lottery.  Various powers have been reserved to the Minister for that purpose.  The confidence of people must be reinforced <Col N="2112" /> by the security arrangements for the actual running of the lottery.  It is necessary, however, to have a provision which will make it an offence for certain things to happen which could in any way reduce that public confidence.  Bearing in mind the difficulty of convicting anybody on such a charge, it is necessary to have this section.  Regarding the provision in section 7(7)(c), I do not think we should create absolute charges.  We must provide for the person who makes an innocent infringement of the regulations and enable him to explain his position legitimately to the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is an increasing use of firearms and violence in committing crimes, particularly robbery, and an increased fear among people that they will be the victims of crime.  The number of armed robberies has increased from 17 in 1970 to 186 in 1976 to an all-time high of 320 for the first five months of 1986.  This represents an increase of 12 per cent as compared with the same period last year.</P>
      <P>What are the Government doing about this?  The Minister for Justice had a meeting with chief superintendents and there followed an immediate clampdown on overtime spending.  I should like to ask the Minister what caused the major overreaction by the Garda authorities after their meeting with him.  Why did they act so hastily, withdraw men from the Border and take gardaí off the streets of LaoisOffaly to man Portlaoise Prison?  The next day the Government, the Minister, or somebody, decided that the decision was wrong and corrected it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister engages in semantics when saying that there are no cut-backs. The fact of the matter is that there are real and significant cut-backs in the policing service on the ground.  I accept that the original provision of £12 million for <Col N="2114" /> overtime in 1986 remains intact, but that is not the point at issue tonight.  What we are concerned with, and what the Minister ought to be considering, is the actual reduction in the police service on the ground.  The Minister does not appear to be aware of the practicalities of his responsibility for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Over £9 million of the annual budget of £12 million was spent in the first six months of 1986.  This means there is less than £500,000 per month for the remainder of the year.  This is half of the original rate at which it was proposed to spend the overtime allocation and amounts to a reduction to one-third of the level of service being provided over the past six months.  What proportion of this £500,000 will be spent on Border security overtime?  Are we faced with a situation where no money will be available for the rest of the country?</P>
    <P>In addition, a further burden is placed on gardaí in having to justify in detail and in advance the need for overtime.  I am not saying, or suggesting, that there should be total freedom given to members on how many hours overtime they should work.  Clearly, that would not be sensible or feasible.  However, we should not go to the other extreme either, where the approval of a small number of hours overtime has to go to Assistant Commissioner level.</P>
    <P>The budget for overtime has decreased from £13.5 million in 1984 to £12.5 million in 1985 and to £12 million in 1986. This reduction comes at a time when additional demands are being made on the Garda Síochána with increased Border security following the Anglo-Irish Agreement and a very significant increase in violent crimes in our society. It also comes at a time when there is no increase in the overall number of gardaí. In fact, there is probably an effective reduction with a reduction in the number of clerical staff, from 651 in 1985 to 635 in 1986, according to the Revised Estimates for the Public Service 1986, and a similar reduction in the number of traffic wardens, from 160 to 135 in 1986.</P>
    <P>There is little point in the Minister referring to the additional temporary <Col N="2115" /> clerical staff who have been assigned to Garda stations.  They are welcome, of course, but their practical contribution to reducing the workload of the members of the force is negligible.  They are, after all, only trainees.  That of itself implies that they should take more time from members in being trained.  The stated objective there is to provide practical and varied training experience.  This of itself emphasises that their contribution to reducing the workload of gardaí must be small.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another aspect of the present problem, namely the management, organisation and control of the Garda Síochána.  Of the 11,400 gardaí, over 920 are engaged full time in Garda Headquarters and the training centre. This includes almost half of the country's chief superintendents, one-fifth of its superintendents, and one-fifth of its inspectors.  There are also over 800 gardaí and sergeants stationed there.  This amounts to 7 per cent of the total strength of the Garda Síochána and does not take into account the many other members of the force who are working full time in Garda offices throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It became clear from the recent &ldquo;Today Tonight Special&rdquo; on the Garda Síochána that no more than 5 per cent of the force is engaged in preventing and detecting crime at any one time.</P>
    <P>It is long past time for a radical reappraisal of the functions that gardaí should be performing.  We want to see the Garda Síochána engaged on the activities for which their members are trained.</P>
    <P>We should have a civilian structure, within the overall responsibility of the Garda Commissioner (which would perform the majority of the civilian tasks that have to be performed within the organisation.  At the same time, the Garda Commissioner should be given full financial control and the necessary management training should be provided for senior officers.</P>
    <P>The gardaí have shown that they can successfully tackle serious crimes if they are given the resources and the freedom to do so.  An integral part of that freedom <Col N="2116" /> is removing the force from the direct dead-hand of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>On a practical level, the Watercourse Road Garda station which is in my own area, has been allocated additional areas, including Cork Prison, Collins Barracks, a major shopping centre, the Glynn Industrial Estate and a major housing estate.  The population of the station's area has been increased from 19,000 to 33,000 with an overall distance from one end of the area to another of six and a half miles.  At the same time, the strength of the station party has been reduced from 25 to 23.  Two members are engaged full-time in the issuing of warrants and do not patrol the area.  The new area has meant that the reduced strength has had to deal with a crime rate which has increased dramatically.</P>

      <P>On Friday the Minister gave statistics about the reduction in crime but where I am living there has not been any reduction.  I am dissatisfied with the approach of the Minister to this serious problem</P>
      <P>On top of all of this, the Minister says that the gardaí at that station cannot have any overtime.  The net outcome of all of this is that there is a considerable reduction in the level of the policing service and a much increased demand on Garda services.  The prison alone takes up considerable additional man hours, dealing with problems there, including complaints by prisoners, all of which have to be investigated.  There is one motor car and one motor cycle at that station.  The car is used by both the uniformed members and the detectives.  However, the car is frequently lying idle, because there are not the men to drive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> That is the reality of the Minister's cut-backs, and irrespective of how he tries to dress up the situation, the fact remains that there is a totally unacceptable reduction in the level of the policing service.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to ask the Minister if he or the Garda authorities have drawn up any guidelines or priorities for the use of overtime.  It is not good enough to simply say that there is a reduction in the money to be spent on overtime and yet not outline his priorities for the spending of that money.</P>
    <P>Because of the cut-backs the morale of the Garda force is at a very low level. While we are saving money now, we shall pay dearly for it in the future.  Last night the Minister criticised this side of the House for putting down this motion and wasting the time of the House.  For the second time this week, we have to tell him he is out of touch with the reality of what is happening on the streets.  He should either act or move aside and let people who are genuinely concerned about the matter do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I think it would be worth while to reiterate some of the points the Minister has already made about the question of Garda resources.  The idea that overtime is a major element in determining the adequacy of the Garda response to the crime situation is all wrong.  We must look at the whole picture, taking account of all the resources available and how they are being utilised to provide an efficient and effective response to the crime situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda response to crime must not be static.  It must be constantly adapted to meet changing needs and circumstances. The success of the Garda Síochána in meeting the police needs of the community and their capacity to respond to particular incidents must not be measured in terms of the financial provision for overtime.  The important thing is to ensure that essential policing needs are adequately met and that the public are given a reassurance that the Government are totally committed to providing the <Col N="2118" /> resources necessary to enable the Garda Síochána to fulfil their paramount role in the maintenance of law and order and the prevention and detection of crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution outlined in some detail the resources which have been and continue to be provided by the Government to enable the Garda to play their part in the prevention and detection of crime.  I think it should be clear to those who are willing to listen and consider the issues objectively that the resources required by the Garda in terms of personnel, equipment, and the necessary legisaltion to tackle the criminal have been provided.</P>
    <P>Very often, I think, we look to what I might refer to as the &ldquo;bigger and better&rdquo; syndrome to solve our problems &mdash; more gardaí, with more and bigger equipment backed by more and more legislation. This, of course, is the quick and easy &ldquo;solution&rdquo;, if I may use that term&mdash;especially for those who do not have to think through the hard questions.  Very often those with this line of thinking forget or overlook that measures aimed at preventing crime are vitally important &mdash; a view held very strongly by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>It is worth emphasising that the Garda Síochána have within their ranks a fulltime Crime Prevention Advisory Service. The total strength of this unit is 24, comprising a detective inspector and four sergeants based on Harcourt Square who serve the Dublin Metropolitan Area. There are two sergeants in the Cork East Division and one sergeant in each of the other 17 Garda divisions as well as the administrative unit at Garda Headquarters with overall responsibility for crime prevention.  In addition, of course, all members of the Garda Síochána have a responsibility in the prevention of crime as part of their normal Garda duties and the Garda authorities are anxious that all members of the force should promote public awareness of crime prevention.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities report that measures designed to alert the public to the threat of crime are being impleprisin <Col N="2119" /> mented on an ongoing basis.  These measures involve the staging of crime prevention exhibitions, the distribution of leaflets giving advice on security measures and visits to private residences and business premises to give advice on security when requested.  The Garda Community Relations Section are currently developing a school lecture programme on the role of the Garda Síochána in society and the nature and purpose of the criminal law, it is expected that this programme will be ready next year.</P>
    <P>This is a worthwhile exercise and is extremely important in informing and educating the community, particularly the young, about the role of the Garda Síochána.  I know that gardaí deal with many criminal issues and on many occasions these merge into the social area, such as family disputes.  The Garda deal in a fair and caring way when they are involved in youth crime and cases of vandalism. The programme to encourage greater understanding and education with regard to the role of the Garda Síochána is worthwhile and it will bear fruit quickly.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of so many neighbourhood watch schemes throughout the country is a measure of the ability of the Garda to ensure that crime prevention plays its full role in tackling and reducing the high level of crime. It is also, of course, a firm indication of the willingness of the general public to contribute in an effective manner to the fight against the criminal elements in our society.  I have attended a number of meetings in my own constituency and elsewhere with regard to the setting up of these schemes and I have been amazed at the good attendances and the positive attitude to co-operate.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word now to those persons who in the course of their business or employment have a responsibility for the safety of cash or valuables.  The first responsibility for the safety of these items lies with them.  The Garda do what they can to prevent and detect crime but the primary responsibility lies with the owners of such property and their <Col N="2120" /> employees.  The beneficial effects which even the most preliminary crime prevention steps have in deterring would-be criminals are easy to underestimate.  It should be borne in mind that crime prevention advice is available to the community at large, and particularly to those whose responsibilities include the security of cash and valuables, entirely free of charge.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the question of the employment of gardaí on clerical duties.  The policy has been to employ civilians in a clerical administrative capacity in Garda offices where possible. The primary objective of this policy is to enable gardaí to concentrate on operational police matters.  At present there are 430 civilian clerical personnel employed throughout the force, enabling a similar number of gardaí to be made available for operational work who would otherwise be engaged on clerical duties.</P>
    <P>Recruiting of temporary clerical trainees to the Garda Síochána started last December and at present a total of 109 are serving in Garda stations throughout the country.  The majority of these, 67, are assigned to country divisions and the remainder, 42, are assigned to Garda stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and Garda Headquarters.</P>
    <P>At this stage I want to say just a few words about a particular form of criminality. The Opposition mentioned robbery and the use of firearms in the motion put down for debate in this House tonight.  What is particularly heartening is that in recent weeks the Garda apprehended several persons after a number of armed robberies or attempted robberies in the Dublin area.  Now, I am aware that I must be careful of what I say here.  Nothing that is said in this House should come between an accused person and a fair trial.  Accordingly, I will say very little else about these arrests other than to say that the special measures put into effect by the Garda earlier this year in an effort to curb armed robberies would seem to be having a beneficial effect.</P>

      <P>Last evening Deputy O'Dea raised a number of points to which I intend to reply during the course of my speech.  He talked about a cut in Garda overtime. The fact is that £12 million was provided in the Garda Estimate for 1986 for over-time. That is still the position.  The figure has not been reduced nor will it be.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Dea also referred to certain matters in relation to Garda involvement in security arrangements at Portlaoise Prison.  I want to assure the House that the Garda authorities are satisfied that security at Portlaoise Prison has not been adversely affected in any way whatsoever by the recent review of Garda duty there.  For security reasons it would not, of course, be in the public interest to comment in any detail on Garda involvement in security arrangements at the prison.  Security at Portlaoise Prison is, of course, the subject of continuing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hyland suggested that restrictions on Garda overtime are creating an environment in which the vandal can operate without any consideration about being apprehended.  This, of course, is one of the many vague allegations of a <Col N="2122" /> general nature which are bandied about from time to time.  It is, of course, completely without foundation.  Indeed, if anything is conducive to such an environment it is the ill-informed press reports which suggest that the capacity of the Garda to respond to crime has been diminished.</P>
    <P>As regards the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the question of overtime expenditure on Border security, I must emphasise that Border security was always, and still is, provided mainly by members within their normal duty hours.  There is no separate overtime provision for Border duty and, indeed, because of the constantly changing policing needs and demands for Garda services, it would not be feasible to make overtime allocations for particular duties. As a matter of fact, it would be totally unsatisfactory to depend on overtime to meet any particular policing needs.  The amount of overtime required for Border security varies from time to time, having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.  Additional needs in relation to Border security, or security measures generally, are met by a combination of extra manpower, redeployment and overtime.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also attempted to make great play of press reports about the arrangements for the manning of the Garda Technical Bureau over the June bank holiday weekend.  The suggestion was that the capacity of the Garda to respond to emergencies was in some way diminished.  The arrangements for the manning of the Technical Bureau are, of course, a matter for Garda management who determine requirements in manpower and other resources on the basis of need and good, practical management criteria.  The Garda authorities have assured me that there were absolutely no deficiencies in the service available from the Technical Bureau over that weekend. They are satisfied that the arrangements for the manning of the bureau and the call out of additional personnel, if the need arose, were fully adequate.  Again, I think this is another example of Deputy O'Dea's tendency to latch on to the most <Col N="2123" /> ill-founded of reports and to try to make something of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea also referred to the question of overtime working in relation to sporting fixtures.  The provision of manpower for the policing of sporting fixtures is a matter for local Garda officers and it is for divisional officers to ensure that these needs are adequately met and to decide to what extent members on overtime are required in addition to the members rostered for duty.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea referred to allegations about cut-backs in the DMA Crime Task Force.  Again these allegations are without foundation.  The crime task force is a support unit available to assist local gardaí to meet particular crime problems or special policing needs and the essence of their role is flexibility to respond to incidents or events as they arise.  The Garda authorities state that there has been no reduction in the manpower or transport allocated to the task force other than temporary vacancies arising from promotions.  As regards the allegations that there are severe restrictions on late night patrolling in Dublin because of reductions in overtime, the Garda authorities state that the patrolling of the streets of the city has never been dependent on overtime.  As a matter of fact, the normal rostering arrangements provide for a concentration of manpower on patrolling duties at the times such as late night and early morning when the demand for Garda services is greatest.</P>
    <P>The reports that Garda cars are not being replaced are also incorrect.  The number of cars operational at any one time depends on a number of factors and cars have to be taken off the road for repairs and servicing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney's amendment suggests that one method whereby better utilisation of Garda resources would be achieved is by the setting up of a night court in Dublin.  The first thing I ought to say about this is that, as a matter of law, the arrangement of District Court business in the Dublin Metropolitan District is a matter for the President of the District Court.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Harney should be aware, the idea of a night court is not a new one and it has been advanced on a number of occasions in the past.  In 1982, a committee, chaired by the then President of the District Court, considered the proposal to institute night courts in Dublin. The Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice and the DPP's Office were represented on the committee.  The committee, whose brief was to investigate whether the idea of a night court would work and be useful in Dublin, concluded that the setting up of a night court would not be justified.  Against any benefits which would accure to the Garda there needed to be balanced the extra costs of the Judiciary and the court staff which would almost certainly be incurred in servicing a night court.  We are not satisfied that there is sufficient reason to ask the President of the District Court &mdash; who, as I have said has ultimate responsibility for arrangements for District Court business in Dublin &mdash; to re-examine the question at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, of course, conscious of the amount of Garda time that is spent attending court and the Department have implemented measures in recent years to reduce as far as possible the amount of <Col N="2125" /> time so spent.  Such measures include the computer scheduling of court cases so that unrelated prosecutions by an individual garda are listed as far as possible for the same court on the same day.  The result is that the total number of court appearances by that garda has been reduced.  In addition, a committee with representatives of the Department, court officials and the Garda Síochána meet regularly to resolve whatever problems may arise.  A number of worthwhile improvements in the area of practical operations has come about through this committee's work.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat puzzled by the reference in Deputy Harney's amendment to &ldquo;not requiring gardaí to give oral proof of formal, written depositions in the District Court&rdquo;.  It is not clear what precise change in procedure in the matter of proof of depositions the Deputy has in mind or what substantial improvement in efficiency in the use of Garda resources such a change would bring about.  Sworn depositions may in certain circumstances be taken at the preliminary examination in the District Court of a charge of an indictable offence.  They may be used in evidence in the subsequent criminal trial only where it is proved that the deponent is dead or unable to attend or prevented from attending to give evidence at the trial.  Consequently, I understand, depositions are used only quite rarely.</P>
    <P>In any event, under section 21 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, there is now provision whereby proof of depositions may be given by written statement. Indeed, section 21 has a much more general effect.  It enables proof of any matter arising in a criminal trial to be given by written statement, subject to certain conditions. Also section 22 of the 1984 Act provides for proof by formal admission in criminal proceedings.  These two sections are already in force and when they become fully operational in practice they should help to reduce considerably the complexity of proofs in criminal cases and to achieve appreciable savings in Garda time spent on appearances in court.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the level of crime is to be welcomed.  There is, however, no <Col N="2126" /> room for complacency, and the Government are determined to give continued support to the various measures which have already been taken to deal with the situation.  The Garda Síochána, with the full backing of the Government, have played a vital part in the continued reduction in the amount of indictable crime recorded.  The Garda, given the necessary resources and support of the community as a whole, can continue to tackle the crime problem successfully.</P>
    <P>The measures taken to counteract drug abuse in our society are also proving successful, and the view of the Garda is that the incidence of drug trafficking has levelled off.  While the trend in the early eighties was for an increase in the number of people charged with drug offences and the number of drug seizures, 1985 saw the start of a downward trend &mdash; a 7 per cent decrease in the number charged with drug offences and a 4 per cent drop in the number of seizures.  This welcome trend is continuing.  These trends are a fair indication of a reduction in the level of offences as the Garda have not relaxed their vigilance in this area.  More and more gardaí are being trained in the skills necessary to deal with these offences. While there is no room at all for complacency in relation to this most serious problem, it is heartening to note that the measures which the Government have initiated in recent years are beginning to pay off.  I assure the House that any further steps that are seen by the Government to be necessary to combat the drug problem will be taken.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the incidence of joyriding has greatly decreased recently.  The reasons the Garda give for this are interesting. They point not only to the deployment of the special unit to combat joyriding which was set up early last year but also to the deterrent effect of certain legislative changes made in the Road Traffic Act, 1984, and in the Criminal Justice Act. The Road Traffic Act made the unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle a indictable offence with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.  It also made interfering with the mechanism of a vehicle <Col N="2127" /> an offence whether it is committed on private or public property.  The Criminal Justice Act introduced a provision whereby consecutive prison sentences instead of concurrent ones can be imposed in connection with offences committed while on bail.  Let me mention also the changes which have been introduced by arranging for speedy trials for the perpetrators of this type of offence who were being arrested in the morning, coming through the courts in the afternoon, getting bail and then going out and committing the same offences again within a matter of hours.  Of course, arrangements were made also for the necessary accommodation in places of detention to ensure that these people serve their full sentences.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that the evidence certainly is different from the suggestions made in the speeches of the Opposition Deputies.  Once more we put the facts before them.  Once more we give them the real detail.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and to insert:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's failure to make any provision in 1986 for the cost of the extra security arrangements associated with the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which has had a consequent adverse impact on the Garda over-time allocation for 1986, and also urges greater efficiency in the utilisation of Garda resources through: (i) the introduction of a night court in Dublin, (ii) not requiring gardaí to <Col N="2128" /> give oral proof of formal written depositions in the district court, and (iii) the more efficient management of overtime expenditure by the Garda Authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This year's allocation for Garda over-time of £12 million is the same as the outturn for 1985.  Therefore, on the face of it there is no cut, as both the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Dukes, have claimed.  However, this allocation masks some unforeseen developments. Under the Anglo-Irish Agreement security arrangements it was agreed last year by the Government that 120 extra gardaí would be deployed on Border duty.  The cost of this was part of the reason why overtime ran to £12 million last year. Although the Government promised the Garda at the time extra financial resources for 1986 to cover the cost of the increased Border policing, this has not materialised and the full cost of the extra Border policing is falling out of the £12 million allocation.  That is why at this time of the year the overtime allocation is eaten up.  In other words, as our amendment points out, there is no provision for extra Border security cost which this year will run to £8 million or two-thirds of the total allocation for Garda overtime. Indeed, it seems reasonable to forecast that before this year is out the Minister will be back in this House with a Supplementary Estimate to help to cover this new cost.  The abolition of or restrictions on Garda overtime ordered recently by the Minister, therefore, mask the real problem of failing to make allocations for the increased cost of Border security.</P>
    <P>However, our amendment makes clear that we are not happy with the way that the money allocated to the Garda is spent.  One central problem is that there is no adequate management system in the Garda force and the present overtime ban has been applied in an insensitive, across the board manner which has failed totally to draw up any priority listing to ensure that the ban will not have an adverse effect on law and order and security in the State.  There is no priority listing whatsoever.  There is no better way to make my point than to quote from the <Col N="2129" /> May issue of the <i>Garda News</i> the official journal of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors:</P>
    <P>It is hardly conceivable that the Minister could have been so native, or so poorly briefed by his civil servants, that he was unaware that in the Garda Síochána there exists no mechanisms to implement the concept of cost effective policing.  This entails the setting of objectives, priorities and plans, linking these to the availability of resources &mdash; manpower, equipment and money &mdash; deploying those resources to implement the plans, and monitoring the outcome.  It involves a careful examination of each police operation, the elimination of time-wasting and inefficient practices, and the re-deployment of manpower &mdash; all within the overall context of clear and agreed priorities.  Little of this exists in the Garda Síochána, and what little of that does has no bearing on the overall operations of the Force.</P>
    <P>Our amendment also points to the need not only for more efficient allocation and utilistion of financial resources to the Garda but also to tackle some cost areas affecting Garda operations which could mean significant savings especially on the annual overtime bill.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the Minister of State's response to our suggestion for a night court in the Dublin area.  At present most arrests by gardaí are made by gardaí on duty at night, but at present they can only bring the people they have arrested before a court to be charged on the following morning.  This inevitably involves Garda overtime.  Would it not be much more sensible, even if there were additional court costs, to appoint an additional district justice?  Obviously, the additional costs of court staff and so on would have to be considered, but it would be a tiny amount of money in comparison to what could be saved in the amount currently being spent on Garda overtime.</P>
    <P>The Minister wondered what I meant by part (ii) of my amendment, not requiring gardaí to give oral proof of written depositions in the District Court.  She said <Col N="2130" /> that already to some degree this has been provided in the present Criminal Justice Act.  That is so, but defence counsel can dispense with this and can call a garda to come and give oral proof of the written deposition.  We are asking that that be changed, and that is a matter for the Minister and for legislation.  It would save considerable amounts of Garda overtime and resources if it were done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's reply tonight indicates very clearly the vast difference between the garda on the beat and Garda management.  In recent weeks we have had a number of statements in relation to the problems of the Garda, especially those faced by the garda on the beat.  They seem to be living in a different world from the Minister and the various statements of the management. I presume that the Minister has based her reply fully on the information supplied to her by Garda management. This is a very serious situation and one which I hope the Minister will take up because obviously there is a vast difference between the views of the garda on the beat, who after all has to face the problems, and Garda management.  We on this side of the House have regularly during this Dáil session tabled motions on crime and have raised this very serious problem at every possible opportunity. We do not apologise for doing so because it is one of the most serious problems facing the country today.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister failed to respond and the present serious crime rate, particularly crimes of violence, is causing great concern within our communities. On a daily basis our newspapers report countless acts of crime, including assault, major and petty robberies, rape and household break-ins.  Murder in our cities has increased dramatically and the reported brutalities taking place in our cities and towns has created new fears to all households, particularly to older people and those living alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The warning signals have been there for a long time and it was inevitable that something horrific, such as the murder that took place in my constituency in <Col N="2131" /> Dollymount one month ago, would happen from the manner in which crime has been escalating in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>There is a duty and an obligation on the authorities to make sure that every measure and every step is taken and that the Garda are given the resources they need to defeat the crime-doer once and for all.</P>
    <P>Dublin particularly suffers from an increased and appalling level of crime and vandalism and it is a matter of great sadness that it has become a city of shutters, barbed wire, expensive security systems, a city of fear.  I made this point on a number of occasions previously and I make it again because Dublin is such a city.  One very much regrets this because, apart from the security aspect, it destroys Dublin as a capital, which should concern us all.  There are numerous no-go areas, so much so that tourists and visitors are advised not to go out alone at night.  They are advised also of certain areas where they should not visit under any circumstances at any time in the day.</P>
    <P>Business houses are paying huge sums of money for insurance, where it can be obtained, and to the neutral observer it is very obvious that the position has reached a serious and dangerous state.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has on numerous occasions spoken of the decrease in the level of crime and has also furnished statistics and figures to prove this claim.  Very few people will accept that this is true and, indeed on the contrary, it has become very obvious that crime is much more organised today than ever before and that the petty thief of two years ago is now part of the very highly organised and sophisticated gangs who take part in armed raids and get away with huge sums of money, jewellery and other goods.  Criminal gangs have perfected their techniques and when they strike or are cornered nothing stands in their way.  This is one of the serious risks and dangers which gardaí are facing every day.</P>
    <P>I have the highest respect for our Garda force and I sympathise with them <Col N="2132" /> in so far as they are operating at present within very stringent limits and are not getting the support they deserve from the Minister or his Department.</P>
    <P>For some time there have been reports of cutbacks in Garda overtime and, despite denials by the Minister, these allegations have been repeated over and over again by the various Garda representative groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed alarm at the very high level of expenditure on Garda overtime and of the £12 million provided in the Estimates for overtime in 1986, two-thirds of this amount had already been used up to the end of the first quarter.</P>
    <P>If this existing level of overtime is maintained it would be necessary for the Government to provide a further £12 million for this purpose.  Instead of providing the additional funds the Minister has ordered the Garda chiefs to review their operation as they will have to operate within the original Estimate for the remainder of this year.</P>
    <P>In the current situation it is very obvious that severe cutbacks in Garda services are taking place and, as a result, the job is being done in an arbitrary, inefficient and counter productive manner.</P>
    <P>The Government have made it clear that they will make no more money available and that the force must live within their means.  The Minister of State made it quite clear tonight that there would be no increase on the sum of £12 million already provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister accused Fianna Fáil of over-emphasising the ban on overtime that was mooted some time ago and, of course, the consequent denials by the Government.  We have merely been pointing out the realities and the facts that have been made public by the Minister's Department and allocated in this year's Estimate for Garda overtime.  The Government should come clean and tell us if they will ensure that the original level of overtime is available for the rest of the year or if they can in some way manage to provide that level of support in the Garda services by providing only <Col N="2133" /> a small fraction of the amount required. That is something on which the Minister has not come clean, he has simply issued blanket denials and contradictions.  We realise that as a result of the Anglo-Irish Agreement there has been a major redeployment of Garda forces to the Border and that has meant fewer gardaí on the streets in urban areas, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We should also recognise that in 1982, in our last year in Government, we recruited almost 1,000 gardaí but in 1985 only 253 were recruited and this year none has been recruited.</P>
    <P>It is important that we give priority to the crime problem but the performance of this Government does not seem to bear that out in terms of ensuring that we have enough recruits coming into the force and that we try to redress this imbalance that has resulted from the redevelopment of forces to the Border areas.</P>
    <P>We should try to ensure that the sort of policing we have makes for a greater presence of gardaí on the streets and that the level of co-operation that might be there will be used to the maximum to ensure that we reduce the level of crime.</P>
    <P>It is too simplistic, for example, to take some sort of credit &mdash; as the Minister of State did tonight &mdash; in relation to the so-called reduction in the crime rate as published in the Garda annual report on crime.  In many types of crime, detection rates are so low that many people are not now bothering to report crimes of, what they might consider, a minor nature. That is a very serious situation and would seem to indicate that the public have given up all hope of obtaining greater success against the crime-doer and, of course, the consequential result of that thinking would lead to people making the decision to take methods into their own hands which would, unfortunately, lead to a worsening of the situation for everybody.</P>
    <P>I also acknowledge the dedication and level of commitment by members of the Garda.  They have been doing a very good job despite serious financial restrictions under which they must operate but they have constantly repeated over and over <Col N="2134" /> that they themselves are not satisfied with their rate of success in fighting crime and have very positively identified the Minister and his Department as being the main contributory cause, as the required resources and facilities needed by the gardaí are just not being provided.</P>
    <P>No police force can be managed effectively without having sufficient money to do the job.  The Government have not given the Garda sufficient money to fulfil their commitments during this year and until they do the public will continue to receive an inadequate service and the crime-doer will continue to have a field day.</P>
    <P>Serious concern was recently expressed by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda Representative Association on the drastic cut-backs in Garda services ordered last May.</P>
    <P>Having heard reports from all over the country the two committees expressed the view that unless these measures were rescinded the likely outcome would be an escalation of crime and lawlessness.</P>
    <P>The Garda were appalled to hear the Minister state in the Dáil during the previous debate that no cut-backs had been ordered and it is very difficult to understand precisely exactly what the Minister is playing at.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the whole matter should be clarified either by Garda management or by the Minister at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Very recently the Garda Representative Body spelled out to the Minister the very serious effects that the cancellation of many duties hitherto regarded as vital are likely to have on the maintenance of law and order.  The Minister assured the deputation that he did not wish to see any cut-backs on essential services but nevertheless did not undertake to arrange the restoration of any specific one of the vital duties which had already been discontinued or cut back.  For example, over the June bank holiday Garda forces were stretched to the limits arising from the tragic fire that claimed so many lives in the Loreto Convent in St. Stephen's Green.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2135" /> Since then the Garda investigation as to what caused the fire proceeded very slowly due to the lack of manpower and I am informed that on a number of days only one member of the force was assigned to examine, and investigate, the debris.  As a result of the slowness and the length of time that this took the possibility of tracing the cause of this terrible fire became more difficult and more remote.</P>
    <P>Serious crimes in the Dublin area are not being investigated properly because of a shortage of manpower and night patrols have been seriously affected and not sufficient protection is now being extended to the people, to their property, or indeed, to their lives.</P>
    <P>The massive increase in house burglaries is evident by the fact that house insurance premiums have increased by over 100 per cent this year alone and in business many companies cannot get any insurance against burglary and are trading under impossible conditions.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a new and comprehensive programme to reduce crime. The Government have failed to take positive action in the allocation of personnel and resources to do this.  It is accepted that the most valuable method of providing peace and security to homes and business is through an effective Garda Síochána force but the Government have failed to provide sufficient resources in this area.</P>
    <P>How can the gardaí be expected to cope effectively with criminal activity when manpower levels and resources are not sufficient to meet the challenge of the criminal?</P>
    <P>It is estimated that in all there has been a net cut-back of almost 1,000 gardaí as a result of deployment to Border security.</P>
    <P>No amount of juggling of figures or statistics will get away from the fact that fewer gardaí are patrolling our streets and while the Government continue to delude themselves into thinking things are improving the situation on the ground is disastrous.  A fundamental change of policy is needed immediately and the <Col N="2136" /> people are demanding that they be given the protection to which they are rightly entitled.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil motion expresses deep concern about the serious situation that exists in regard to crimes involving firearms, robbery with violence and physical assault and we call on the Government to make the adequate finance available for the necessary levels of over-time in the Garda Síochána needed to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment calling on Dáil Éireann to commend the Government on the level of manpower and other resources made available is a sick joke and even this Minister is asking too much for the House to take him seriously on this issue.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot do the job and cannot persuade his Government to make the necessary resources available to the gardaí for this purpose then he should resign and allow somebody stronger to take over who will exert greater determination to ensure that our gardaí obtain the facilities they so badly need to combat crime and to make our cities and our towns a safer place for all of our citizens and enable people to carry on their business and walk the streets in safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third or fourth time I have had the opportunity to speak about crime in this session.  There have been a number of debates on Garda manning levels and crime in the city of Dublin.  We discussed the high level of crime in the Dublin area after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we go into a fairly long summer recess I want to go again into some of the matters causing major problems in the city.  I have read the speeches of the Minister and Minister of State and have listened to their speeches over the past few months.  In February I had a question on the Adjournment about the large number of robberies in the city, particularly 14 armed robberies in the Phibsboro-Drumcondra area.  Perhaps the problem is not as centralised as it was then but armed robberies continue.  We are arguing as to whether the amount <Col N="2137" /> allocated for overtime is sufficient.  The sum is clear.  There is £12 million available for the year, £9 million of which has gone, and that leaves £3 million for the rest of the year.  A Supplementary Estimate will be rushed through the House at about 10 o'clock on the evening of the Christmas recess for Garda over-time, if the Government are still here.</P>
    <P>This happens in the House year after year and nobody loses face because the Minister, not long out of Finance, feels he has to stand by his old principles on the state of the public finances and is not prepared to admit an obvious error.  The only other explanation is that the £9 million for the first half of the year was a waste of money and was not necessary. The Government should come clean.  If £3 million is sufficient for the remaining six months of the year, why was a similar amount not sufficient for the first six months?  Why was the total figure for the year not set at £6 million?  Let us stop this nonsense, trying to cod ourselves and the public and everybody else.  It is right or it is wrong.  Either £6 million was enough for 1986 or there was some abuse or something wrong with the system that allowed £9 million to be allocated.  There might be some variation because of the strain over Christmas in relation to the Anglo-Irish accord and so on.  But that is only a small figure.  The Government should come clean on this whole thing.</P>
    <P>I want to put it clearly on the record that the public perspective and the perspective of the gardaí on the beat who know about crime is that because of the cut-backs manning levels are affected; there are not as many gardaí on the beat; not so many people in the inner city stalking out the criminals and the people in the drugs scene.  The vast majority of crime in this country takes place, unfortunately, in my constituency.  We saw last week that 35 per cent of the malicious injuries claims for the entire country came from the Dublin 1 area and that is one part of my own constituency.  That proves what I do not like proving &mdash; the situation is becoming worse because of the cut-backs.  The gardaí had very good success earlier on in the year stalking out <Col N="2138" /> some of the drug dealers and that was achieved because they spent night after night, week after week, sitting in gardens or in derelict houses watching and building up records.  It is a long painstaking job and the gardaí are excellent at it.  I have great admiration for the drug squad and continually praise the gardaí who participate in that work.  But they are not doing the job now because they have not got the manpower to do so.  The drugs squad is severely affected and there is no argument about that.  The drug squad succeeded in beating many families at the drug game since 1980.  They only recently charged somebody who is before the courts and if there is any justice in the land one can foresee the verdict in that case.  That job must be done on overtime, but the curtailment of Garda overtime has put an end to these essential Garda activities.  It is annoying to listen to the waffle contained in Government statements.</P>
    <P>There is a huge difference of opinion between Garda management and the gardaí on the beat and the public about what is going on.  The gardaí on the beat who are chasing the criminals, putting themselves at risk continuously trying to stalk out the offenders and bring them to court, are saying that Garda management are telling the Government that enough money is being spent on overtime and they do not need any more, but they do need extra money.  The extra duties performed by the drug squad in areas like the docklands and the quays, the nightclubs, the side streets in the financial areas of the city and in some of the &ldquo;flatlands&rdquo; where there is high crime must continue, but the resources have been massively reduced.  This was seen in a big way in this city last Saturday during a rock concert in Corke Park.  The gardaí present did an excellent job, but there were not enough men available.  There were 50,000 young people, a large proportion of whom, unfortunately, were drunk out of their minds from 11 a.m. They were falling all over the streets and yet the Garda succeeded in keeping some order.  If the lightning storm had not coinlands' <Col N="2139" /> cided with the end of the concert, there would have been some major difficulties in the city.  That brought some of the fans to their senses and the rest home.</P>
    <P>Before that happened there was vandalism &mdash; windows smashed and cars damaged, shop windows broken and all kind of obscene happenings on some of the city streets.  Some of the areas manned by the Garda could be compared exactly with the position last year.  The promoter in this case kept his promise to provide manning levels in particular areas.  He paid his money and the areas he said he would have controlled were controlled.  The main streets of Drumcondra, from Dorset Street back to Ballybough and other areas which had 20 gardaí on patrol last year and 20 gardaí on the barricades were reduced to five gardaí this year.  That is not enough. Everybody &mdash; the sergeants, inspectors, the organisers of the patrols &mdash; said that that number was not sufficient.  That was one instance where one can make a direct comparison.</P>
    <P>One of the areas of the city, with a great volume of business premises, is the area for which the Bridewell Garda station members have responsibility.  That includes Moore Street, Henry Street, North King Street, Bolton Street, North Circular Road and almost out to the Navan Road.  It is a massive, densely populated area and one of the toughest areas in the city and in the country.  It contains important business premises and third level institutions.  One patrol car operates in that area.  The dogs in the street could tell you how that car operates. The people involved in crime know exactly the movements of that patrol car. Once a night in some of the toughest areas one unfortunate garda is asked to walk through some of the flat complexes. If he never sees or hears anything or arrests anybody, he is a wise man, because I do not think he should as it is so dangerous.  Six months ago there were two and three gardaí on that particular dangerous beat.  To send one man in is an absolute disgrace.  The police officers in charge of the Bridewell Garda Station <Col N="2140" /> say that there is only one garda available. The Minister will probably say that from his records there are two or three patrol cars for that area.  If there are, they are on specific duties, placed watching one spot, so they are not available.  A huge proportion of claims under the malicious damages legislation that we have now abolished occurred in this areas.  What will happen now in that respect?</P>
    <P>If Garda overtime is not necessary, the Minister must prove this case.  If the numbers of gardaí in the various stations can be manoeuvred or extra gardaí brought into certain areas and the available number can patrol the city, that is fine.  However, the facts are that there is a massive reduction in the number of gardaí on the beat in the most crucial areas of the city and that the money available is not sufficient.  Since the Minister is now in the House, I shall repeat what I said.  He is trying to claim that the£3 million left out of the£12 million will be sufficient for the rest of the year to cover Garda overtime and maintain proper services.  Was the £9 million wrongly spent?  Was it wasted, and will £3 million allow the Garda to maintain their operations?  The Minister must be fair and straight with the gardaí on the beat, who do an extremely good job and are facing armed criminals breaking into banks and insurance companies day after day with sirens on cars racing through the streets.  The Garda are asked to provide their essential services on a shoestring, but the Minister knows that that is not possible.  The people among the senior Garda ranks advising him are out of touch with what their membership are saying and with what the drug squad and the crime prevention squad are saying.  These men cannot perform their duties as they should.</P>
    <P>I have several times praised the work of the drug squad, who are extremely effective in keeping crime under some kind of order in Dublin's inner city.  They operate on the basis of overtime, on the basis of staking out houses, often for months on end, watching and building up records on certain families.  They have succeeded in breaking the ring.  The <Col N="2141" /> people involved have made it clear that they cannot continue the same type of surveillance, or have the success that they had in the past.  The Minister's arguments are wrong, mischievous and ill-advised. The gardaí who know will probably succeed in convincing the Minister of the true position when the House rises and sometime late in the Christmas session, if they are still in Government, the Coalition will have to seek extra money in a Supplementary Estimate.  How else can the Garda maintain their usual service on a quarter of the money?  It would be very interesting to hear the Minister's explanation.  The gardaí in patrol cars, in the stations, on the beat, in the frontline facing crime, wish to know the answer. Either the Minister is getting wrong advice, or he is wrongly advising this House.  He has an obligation not to allow the House to go into recess for three months, allowing the crime in the city to build up as it has since he took office last February.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>A great responsibility rests on the Members of this House to be extremely careful in the issues they debate here, and the manner in which they debate them, in order not to frighten people or misrepresent the situation.  I fully recognise the role of an Opposition party but there are some issues that it is not only futile to discuss but sometimes it borders on the dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House this evening is about the third Opposition attempt in every recent times to create an element of scaremongering, that the whole Garda force are falling asunder, that there is no crime detection going on, no improvement in the number of gardaí on the beat, that Garda stations are being closed down willynilly with no consideration of the consequences.  That is not the position.  The Opposition do not want to read and take account of the facts in the speech the Minister made in the Estimates debate and in May on a Private Member's motion.  This is not a fairytale. These are facts.  The facts on crime are being given by the Garda Commissioner and by Garda headquarters.  People are <Col N="2142" /> calling them liars when they say they do not believe the Government when they say the measures adopted by them over recent years are undoubtedly beginning to have the effects that we would all desire them to have.  We would all like to have a society totally free of any crime so that we could all walk the streets without fear of mugging or, as I have been subjected to, having my handbag snatched twice.  Society is not like that.  If we think it is then we are looking at it through rose-tinted glasses and we are not being realistic.  Sadly, no society has escaped the increase in crime.</P>
    <P>There are some negative vibrations coming from this debate as has happened in other debates in regard to the Garda, the Judiciary and so on.  It would be much better for this House to try to send positive messages to people and tell them that our streets are becoming safer.  Of course, we will still read of horrific cases in the papers but that should not be used as an excuse for saying everything is still as bad as it was.  Certainly there are improvements.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recognition in recent years by Garda headquarters and by people who make such decisions that it is not enough to provide Garda manpower and stations in the city areas and areas where there is a large percentage of businesses and that there is a need to move to and upgrade stations in suburban areas of Dublin.  I know the town in which I live is dear to the heart of the Opposition Leader.  It is a town that grew very quickly but for many years had only a day time Garda service in the station.  I had to battle with Fianna Fáil in Government for a number of years when I was elected to the county council.  Subsequently when I was elected to the Dáil I battled with the Minister.  I tried to make them recognise that, because there were only residential houses in these new towns without a high percentage of businesses or schools, as Deputy Ahern mentioned, those people needed the protection of having a Garda station that was able to answer their calls for help speedily.  Sadly, there has been a movement <Col N="2143" /> to the suburbs of people involved in petty crime.  There was a need to recognise that and I commend it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern talked briefly about an area that had one patrol car.  I want to put on record my thanks for the fact that in Malahide the detective unit car which was badly rammed a couple of weeks ago was replaced as quickly as possible.  The patrol car was also damaged in an accident and that has been replaced.  There has been no tardiness in replacing those facilities.  The motorcycle is still available.  If we continue to negative everything and complain about everything, a perception will be built up among the people that there is no protection being given to them and that the gardaí are taking their salaries and doing nothing. We all know that is not the case. This House has the responsibility to be positive about what is happening to help to increase the detection of crime and to prevent it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard from the House, and this side of the House in particular, over the last two nights the concerns and fears of Deputies in relation to our motion, that Dáil Eireann is deeply concerned about the serious situation that exists in regard to crimes involving firearms, robbery with violence and physical assault.  We must address ourselves to crimes of violence this year.  We are aware that over the past number of years there has been a massive increase in crime generally.  A feature of the last couple of years in particular has been the increase in crimes of violence of all sorts. That is shown in statistics given by the Minister yesterday and also in the recent past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen pointed to the need for adequate Garda coverage and surveillance in areas such as Malahide, Swords and other areas.  I agree very much with the Deputy that this kind of coverage is essential.  I ask the Deputy to look for a moment at another question which was replied to by the Minister yesterday showing that in Coolock, the number of indictable crimes reported in 1985 was <Col N="2144" /> 2,106.  The number in Malahide was 354 and in Swords the number was 255.  If it is necessary to have adequate cover, adequate provision and an adequate supply of manpower with sufficient flexibility in Malahide and Swords, it must also be necessary to have that in Coolock where there is a massive level of indictable crime.  If we look at the Garda strength we find that there are 20 crimes for every one Garda member in Coolock, ten for every one in Malahide and five for every one in Swords.  I am not suggesting that Swords and Malahide do not need the kind of cover which the Deputy has proposed. I agree with the Deputy that it is necessary.  It is necessary to prevent crime in these residential areas.</P>
    <P>Our argument is that areas like Coolock, the centre city and other areas around the city where there are massive levels of violent crime at present are not adequately manned.  Garda superintendents, inspectors and sergeants in these areas are not able to deal with the problem.  When the headquarters are asked to allocate further resources they say their resources are too strained.  They do their best with what they have but what they have is clearly not adequate for the levels of crime which exist in these areas.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in relation to over-time. I would like the Minister to recognise that problem, despite all his protestations earlier.  He has been claiming for some time that there is no problem, that the money can be found somewhere and that it is the Opposition, the media and the Garda who are complaining. The Garda associations have been pointing to the very serious problems. A number of Deputies, Deputy Brady and Deputy Ahern in particular, pointed out very clearly the nature of these problems, the lack of surveillance and the lack of manpower to carry out surveillance in an adequate and thorough way.  If that surveillance is there the culprits can be apprehended.  If the gardaí have to leave at the end of their normal roster, obviously the criminals will have a free hand thereafter.</P>
    <P>That is what is happening.  The Garda <Col N="2145" /> know how to do the job but they are being restricted by the Government.  This does not apply everywhere in the country, only in areas of high crime.  On many occasions the Minister has attempted to deny that there is a problem at all; last night he criticised the media for drumming up a problem which did not exist. The Minister gave a directive to the Garda, via the Garda chief, which, when gardaí and sergeants on the beat received it, became a black and white directive. The Technical Bureau was limited and technicans had to finish up at 5 p.m., having had a break for lunch.  When the directive came through they understood what it was.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Minister's statement yesterday that £9.1 million has been spent out of the overtime fund and that there is only £3 million left for the rest of the year.  We do not know how much of that the Government will apply to Border duty to meet the requirements of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The Minister will not tell us how much of the balance will be devoted to Border duty.  Will the Government supplement the overtime fund?  Where will they get the money from?  Who will decide where the money will be spent?</P>
    <P>Overtime raises the question of management. Who is managing the Garda who are carrying the can?  The overtime fiasco is only a symptom of a more serious problem.  The Garda must be allowed to set out their priorities in the fight against crime and vandalism: they are the experts and they must be given the resources, within certain restraints, to meet their requirements.  They cannot have the resources withdrawn half way through the year.</P>
    <P>There is no point in giving the Garda resources if they are not allowed to control them.  The present system is far too centralised, much more now than for many years.  The time has come to give the Garda direct control of their finances. This requires a totally new approach.  The Garda are a very responsible body of men and women, and they are professionals.</P>
    <P>The present system of management by remote control, with financial control in <Col N="2146" /> the Department of Justice, is one of the basic problems.  It is time we had an inquiry into the system of management and financial control of the Garda Síochána. The overtime debacle has indicated that there is a serious problem of resource allocation and management.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully &mdash; and we all do on this side &mdash; that overtime should not be allowed to be squandered or made available too readily, but in present circumstances there should be more flexibility. Therefore, as I have said, the Garda must be given the resources and management training to handle the resources. How many financial controllers do the Garda have to assist them in managing their resources?</P>
    <P>At present the crisis about Garda over-time is evident.  Has the Minister plans to move money between heads in the Department or will a supplementary sum be provided at the end of the year?  We want to be assured that the Garda will have the resources to deal with violence, firearms, robbery with violence and physical assault.  Deputy Ahern, with obvious experience, pointed out the need for surveillance and constant vigilance if perpetrators of crime are to be caught.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that because £12 million was allowed last year and this year for Garda overtime there has not been a reduction.  In effect, there is a reduction.  The fact is that the Government have taken from the Garda Síochána the money they need to do the job.</P>

      <P>The Minister is very smug. He seems to be remote from the problems on the ground.  I invited him to come out and have a look and see for himself some of the things I described here.  Indeed, I have been told they are worse than I said they were.  This morning we heard that 62 per cent of the malicious damage in the entire country has been committed in Dublin.  That is what we have been trying to bring home to this remote Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister said there was never any question of a reduction in the <Col N="2147" /> amount of overtime he was answering something that had not been asked, obviously knowing it would be good for a headline in the newspapers.  I am now asking the Minister to appreciate the seriousness of the problem and to forget the global statistics.  If he looks at the figures for non-indictable crime he will see there has been a massive increase in the past five year.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to get away from his generalised statistics and come back to reality.  He should apply himself and the resources to the problems on the ground.  Everybody outside the House knows that there is a serious problem which can be solved by the Garda Síochána if they are given the resources and the back-up to do the job.  We have every confidence in their ability to do so, but not if they are left with their hands handcuffed behind their backs.  They cannot handle the situation because they are not given the resources, in particular the resources of overtime.  I would ask the Minister to review the position urgently and ensure that the Garda Síochána have the resources they need for the rest of the year to tackle the present high levels of crime and vandalism.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6a:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) At least one person representing the interests of voluntary organisations referred to in section 7 (2) shall be appointed by the Minister as director of the Company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to endeavour to ensure that at least one person representing the interests of the voluntary organisations referred to in section 7 and particularly in my own amendment, which unfortunately was defeated, should be appointed by the Minister as a director of the company. <Col N="2150" /> We have had a fair degree of consensus on this legislation.  I regret that the Minister was not able to accept my amendments, though it is true that one of the amendments he introduced was at least in the right spirit but did not give effect literally to the law as we would like to see it passed.  I refer to the purposes for which the lottery fund should be applied.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister would not agree to make a specific provision in respect of the appointment of voluntary organisations as sales agents to ensure that those organisations which will be affected by the promotion of the lottery would be in a position, through commission and with an agreed share of profits, to protect their activities, which we all recognise as commendable and essential for the well-being of the community generally.  These arguments are over and this is the last strand of that argument.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that at least one person representing the interests of the voluntary organisations referred to in my amendment should be appointed by the Minister as a director of the lottery company.  It is not for me to persuade the Minister of what would promote a favourable response towards him from organisations which have over the years developed very considerable expertise and engendered great goodwill throughout the community.  The appointment of at least one such person would be a recognition by the Minister of the work they have done.  I believe more than one of these people should be appointed but I do not want to tie the Minister's hands.  I have also indicated that it would not be his hands but those of somebody sitting on these benches which would be tied.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations are apprehensive about the legislation.  They want to be involved as much as possible in the lottery.  They want to help and be associated in the running of it and want a reasonable guarantee of financial return for their own purposes, as has occurred over the years in their own activities.  So that their voice may be heard, and their interests protected, there should be at <Col N="2151" /> least one voice representing their interests at board level.  I am not saying the other board members will ignore their position, but there should be a representative of the voluntary organisations. There are two major umbrella organisations the Minister can choose from.  It would be a matter for him, following discussions with those organisations, to determine the extent of the representations. He may decide to choose two representatives.</P>
    <P>Were I advising the Minister in terms of his own public relations &mdash; I must say he relies as much on action as on public relations &mdash; I would suggest to him that he should make this provision.  If we were dealing with this from the other side of the House we would be adopting this provision which amounts to a recognition of the role of those organisations in voluntary work.  The fact that some proposals put forward by this side of the House have not been accepted will not allay the fears of those organisations despite the Minister's statement of good intentions. I must press the Minister to make provision for at least one representative from those organisations on the board.  Ideally there should be two representatives but I do not wish to tie the Minister's hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined the measures to give voluntary organisations a chance to compete with the national lottery and said that in the event of their worst fears being realised they will participate in the distribution of the surplus of that lottery.  I hope the measures I have proposed will put the lotteries of the voluntary organisations in a position to maintain their present level of income.  If those running periodic lotteries produce figures which indicate that they are not able to maintain their present level of income they will be able to apply for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that it would be appropriate to appoint a representive from the voluntary organisations to the board but I would not preclude that possibility.  The licensee, in this instance An Post, will nominate four of the seven members, <Col N="2152" /> including the chairman, and three members will be nominated by the Minister. The general intention in the Minister nominating three members is to ensure that there will be members on the board who will act as a watchdog in the public interest.  Their appointment will ensure that there will be external expertise available to the board which will lead to a more effective running of the lottery. I do not preclude the possibility of an appointment along the lines suggested by Deputy O'Kennedy but it is not appropriate to include such a provision in the Bill. In the circumstances I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment in the way it is framed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth considering an alteration to this section because it is the intention to give the company the majority of the directors on the board. Bearing in mind the objectives of the company it is crucial that the Minister should have strong representation on the board.  The number of members to constitute a quorum for board meetings will be decided by the board and, as it is important that the Minister should be represented when major decisions are taken, there should be a condition that the Minister's nominees should be present for all meetings.  If that condition is not included, business may be transacted in the absence of the Minister's nominees.</P>
      <P>There is some merit in Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment.  I do not see why it is not incorporated given the strong representation of such bodies in this area.  If they are downgraded or suffer as a result of a national lottery I do not think any company, including An Post, will object to the appointment of a representative of those organisations to the board.  Nobody questioned the <i>bona fides</i> of amendment No. 4a tabled by Deputy O'Kennedy, including the Minister, the Minister of State and myself.  The representation sought by the Deputy for the voluntary organisations should be sympathetically considered by An Post and recommended by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2153" /> I understand that the reason for establishing the national lottery is so that benefit will accrue to citizens in the form of sporting and cultural facilities or in the form of job creation.  Certainly, it will be in a self-help form.  There will be many opportunities for the company, by way of contract and the purchase of supplies and services, to create employment.  It is because we are dealing in tens of millions of pounds that I suggest the Government should be represented on the board by a representative of our main job creating agency, the IDA.  Such a person is well qualified for membership of the board and if such an appointment is made we can be assured that jobs will be created. Given that the lottery turnover is expected to be between £90 million and £100 million it would be worthwhile having an IDA representative on the board.  That nominee would look after the interests of the public.  There is always the possibility of job creation.  The IDA carry out the job creation policy of the Government on a continuing basis regardless of which party are in office and that should be borne in mind.  The Minister has intimated that if any organisation needs help in the future he will look at the matter sympathetically but if such a body had a representative on the board they could look after their own interests.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for a seven member board, four to be nominated by the company and three by the Minister to ensure that the policy intentions of the Government are observed.  It is essential that the major decisions, as defined in the terms and conditions, be approved by a majority of the board, including at least one ministerial nominee.  For example, a four to three vote with all the company's nominees voting one way would not be sufficient, but if that same kind of vote included a ministerial nominee that would be sufficient.  A quorum should include at least one ministerial nominee. A major decision could be defined as one involving expenditure in excess of, say, £10,000, £20,000 or £30,000 or of a contract of more than one year.  It could <Col N="2154" /> also be defined as a major decision if it resulted in a supplier receiving more than a certain amount over a 12 month period, say, for example, £25,000.  It is obvious that all kinds of complications could arise in this connection and I am merely drawing the attention of the Minister to that point.  If a major decision cannot be resolved within the structure of the voting guidelines of the board, another procedure could be set up.</P>
    <P>The amendment should be considered by the Minister.  Amendment 6a proposes that one person to represent the interests of voluntary organisations be appointed by the Minister.  If that were accepted it would satisfy the organisations referred to by Deputy O'Kennedy and the Minister. At the moment those organisations feel they have lost out because they have not gained the licence for this lottery which is never likely to become available again.  I assume that if An Post make a success of the lottery they will continue to operate it.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of making decisions, the composition of the board should be carefully worded in the regulations. The Government nominees should be involved in major decisions so that the policy of the Government is carried out, particularly with regard to job creation. The IDA are the job creating arm of the Government and they should have a direct involvement because of their expertise and their record.  I am sure any company would want to have the IDA involved because of their enormous responsibilities and the amount of public money they handle.  The IDA seem to be the obvious choice.</P>
    <P>One of the directors should be the chief executive and all of the directors should be employees of the company.  The legislation has been carefully structured to gain the maximum possible confidence and to a great extent that has been achieved. Otherwise, we would be debating each section much more thoroughly and we would have tabled many more amendments. It is a measure of our confidence in what has been presented to this House that we have not done that.  I ask the <Col N="2155" /> Minister to bear in mind the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has repeatedly said he will sympathetically look at very many points.  While I do not question the good intentions of the Minister to do that, I am anxious to ensure that specific provision is made in the Bill to cover the points made.  That is why I ask him to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the acumen and expertise of the people to be appointed.  I want to make it very clear that we would expect the people appointed to have a certain degree of expertise and a capacity to undertake what will be a very important job.  I would remind the Minister that the representatives of the voluntary organisations have a certain amount of expertise and commitment. I cannot visualise anybody more committed to a cause than those working for voluntary organisations. They would bring their expertise to any board on which they would be members. At least one representative from the voluntary organisations should be on the lottery board.  That is the only point I will press.</P>
      <P>We are all arguing towards the same good intentions but I can see the point Deputy Skelly was making about the quorum and ministerial representation.  I have no objection to ministerial representation on the board.  In fact, I would support that principle because there must be answerability and the most suitable people will be appointed by the Minister. The Minister's appointees might come from the public service or from interest groups.  However, I am not very much in agreement with the idea of having an IDA representative on the board because I do not see what role he can play.  In that context the only thing I am asking for is that one of the seven, eight or nine members of the board be a nominee from the voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>I have been reflecting on the points made and there seems to be an element of confused thinking on this issue.  I have made clear my views on <Col N="2156" /> the voluntary bodies and my anxiety that they would not just maintain their position but that they would prosper under the new regime.  However, I will not repeat the measures I have included to put them in that position.  What are we talking about?  We are talking about a subsidiary of An Post which will be set up as an efficient commercial body for a specific purpose, which is essentially to produce as much largesse as possible for distribution in the areas mentioned.  The voluntary bodies who are at present running lotteries will be in competition with the national lottery&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have covered that ground.  With the removal of restrictions on advertising, increases in the prize limits and other measures, I believe they will be able to compete.  Perhaps I am wrong but I believe a very big proportion of the funding for the lotteries of charitable bodies is not subscribed on the basis of somebody expecting to win a prize; people subscribe because they want to support a worthy cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to return to the confused thinking about this issue.  If the national lottery produces substantial funding, is the interest of the voluntary bodies principally not to have an opportunity to participate in the distribution of the surplus?  The board will have nothing to do with that; that will be decided by Government.  If the argument in favour of having a representative of the voluntary bodies on the board is based on giving them a better chance to participate in the distribution of the surplus, it falls flat because the <Col N="2157" /> board will have nothing to do with the distribution of the surplus.</P>
    <P>I understand the basic motivation of Deputy O'Kennedy's approach, but I cannot accept a proposal that this be written into the legislation.  As I said earlier, when final decisions about board appointments are made, I would not preclude the possibility of this happening.  It may be considered that such an appointment would be in the public interest or it may be that the considerable expertise of such a representative would be considered very useful.  As I said, I would not necessarily preclude the possibility of appointing one of their representatives but I would not be able to accept the amendment to write it into the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly mentioned a number of points which were related to the amendment and to some degree to the section, and perhaps I might comment on both to save time.  The board will be responsible for the placing of contracts but they will have to be done according to public sector tendering procedures.  While it would principally be a board decision, we will have nominees on the board.  In the final arrangements made with An Post reference will have to be made to the observance of those procedures.  I am interested in the point raised about the quorum and I will have that looked at in the context of the discussions of the articles of association of the subsidiary company.</P>
    <P>As regards the representative from the IDA, I see the possibilities of not just direct job creation as a result of the establishment of this subsidiary but possibly indirect job creation as well.  I do not want to go into that area in any detail now, but I would not be wholly honest if I did not say that in my view having somebody from the IDA on the board with a view to looking at job creation is an idea I find attractive and worth looking at.  No decision has been made yet&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The thinking <Col N="2158" /> would be more in the area of exploitation of possible job creation opportunities through the creation of the lottery.  I am thinking of lotteries in most European countries where there is a substantial market for what I might loosely call lottery technology, in printing, computers and so on.  There may be the possibility of job creation in spin-off areas from the establishment of a lottery which should be looked at but, as I said, I would not preclude the possibility of having a representative from the IDA on the board.</P>

      <P>Seldom one rises to oppose the deletion of a section which was introduced specifically by the Minister to have ministerial control on the level of wages, remuneration or salary and conditions of employment.  What has happened since the Bill was introduced? After all, the thought and foresight that one presumes are given to include by deliberate decision section 15, we find that the Government had a specific reason for putting it in in the first instance and now have some specific reason for taking it out again.  It is important that we look at the section, which provides that:</P>
      <P>(1)  The determination by the Company of the remuneration (including superannuation and any allowances for expenses) and other terms and conditions of service of the staff of the Company shall be subject to the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service. In other words, all pay, allowances and remuneration to be paid to or on behalf of anyone employed by the company was originally to be stipulated by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something has happened in the meantime, because that was not put in by accident.  I know there were reactions from the trade unions and from some elements of Government, but I would like the Minister to tell us why that was necessary and, if I remember from Second Stage, justified and argued strongly as being necessary then, and why it is unnecessary now.  The Minister is just taking the lot out, and it is not good enough for him to say that we are going to leave that aside until we get to another White Paper.  If ever there has been a Government of papers, white, green, blue, all kind of discussions documents, papers and analyses, this is the Government. The Minister now tells us that he can leave out this statutory regulation because we are going to deal with it in a White Paper.  It is not good enough.  He must give us a better explanation than <Col N="2160" /> that and then we will at least begin to understand why he has changed his mind.</P>

      <P>I am astonished at Deputy O'Kennedy's comments.  In this House yesterday at the closing stages of this debate I listened to impassioned appeals from both sides of this House to take this step.  His colleague, Deputy Leyden, who is Opposition spokesman in the Communications area, made a strong plea on Committee Stage to have this section deleted.  Similarly on my side of the House I recall at the closing stages at least one Deputy making the same plea.</P>

      <P>In my opening remarks I indicated that I had studied very carefully the many constructive points made on both sides of the House by various speakers.  I think Deputy O'Kennedy will accept that I have made an honest and constructive effort to respond to those points in the amendment I have put down.  In that spirit I indicated in my closing speech yesterday that I felt I could respond to the pleas in relation to section 15 coming from both sides of the House.  By way of reply to Deputy O'Kennedy's question let me make it clear that we are not talking about substituting something in a White Paper for this section.

        <i>The Way Forward</i> is a winding road.  Following the publication of that White Paper we have been engaged in the preparation of a Public Service Development Bill, and a White Paper proposed that there would be an overall provision for residual control measures which would be included in that Bill on the basis that it would not be necessary to have that point argued and debated in relation to every semi-State or subsidiary of a semi-State that came before the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned a reservation about VTUs and my reading of the definition under section 1 of the Bill is that they are precluded from coming on the market.  For the benefit of the House, VTUs are video terminal units.  They can be operated and they can pay out in the same manner as slot machines.  I was concerned that we would not enable the national lottery or any of the companies operating under it to get into an area ancilliary to or corresponding with gaming and slot machines whose operators have updated their machinery into videos.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take both points raised by Deputy Skelly.  His fears in this regard are groundless.  Remember that in relation to each lottery game it will be necessary for the company to submit to the Minister a scheme setting out the rules of the game before any such game can be initiated.  Therefore, there would be major control apart from control in the following section, 30.  The initial proposals by An Post offer the establishment of two types of games.  One is a game something equivalent to what one gets in the petrol stations at the moment but obviously far bigger prize money is attached. The second is lotto.  Neither of these would relate to the problem raised.</P>

      <P>To refer to Deputy O'Kennedy's concern, I was suggesting that the Minister or someone on his behalf should be involved because we are dealing with huge amounts of money.  It may be possible in the area of supply or supplied services to buy Irish where possible and to use Irish manufactured goods where <Col N="2167" /> possible.  Perhaps someone from a different field of high technology, science or computers would be interested in this role.  It would have to be someone interested in a job creating programme.  As far as this section is concerned, it is important that the lottery should have a national name and that the benefits should accrue to the Government and not a company which, by spending millions of pounds over a number of years, can promote a certain name which would become valuable over the years.  I wish to satisfy myself on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I can reassure the Deputy on that point because the section provides that the goodwill attaching to the names &ldquo;Irish National Lottery&rdquo; and &ldquo;National Lottery&rdquo; and their equivalents in the Irish language and to the name of any lottery game held by the Minister or under a licence shall vest in the Minister. I hope the Deputy is reassured on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provision in section 34 that section 22 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, shall not apply to a lottery held pursuant to section 27 or 28 of that Act and that the Minister may by regulations amend section 27 and 28 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, by altering the amounts specified in subsections (2)(b) and (4) of the said sections.  The Minister indicated this afternoon that the purpose of this section and those provisions is to increase the amounts under which the authorised lotteries either by way of District Court licences or other authorised issue will be available.  I welcome that because it is one element which will enable the voluntary organisations to <Col N="2168" /> increase the attraction of their fund raising campaigns.  However, this is not enough.  The Minister mentioned figures earlier this evening and I think he intended to increase them in one instance to £2,000 and in another instance up to £10,000 or perhaps it was up to £5,000? This is a matter for the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State could encourage him to increase those figures to the maximum possible under the supervision and licensing of the court or the chief superintendent, as the case may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is included specifically as part of the response to the concerns expressed by voluntary agencies.  One of the points raised by their representatives was that they would be put in a very unfair position because of the present provisions in the Gaming and Lotteries Act which preclude advertising and publicity as set out in section 22.  The first subsection is to lift the restriction on advertising or publicity in relation to any lottery run on the Garda permit or by licence from the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that the lifting of restrictions will not apply to private members' draws.  The effect of subsection (1) will be to respond positively to that request.  There was another major request from the voluntary bodies in relation to the existing limits under the 1956 Act with regard to prize money.  The permitted lotteries run under Garda permit are governed by section 27 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  At present the maximum amount which can be provided by the prize money for a Garda permitted section 27 lottery is £300.  The new figure in mind for a section 27 Garda permitted lottery is £3,000.  The second aspect of that case was in relation to section 28 District <Col N="2169" /> Court licensed lotteries.  Here the maximum figure under the 1956 Act for prize money is £500 and the new figure we have in mind is £10,000.  These are the explanations required.  Effectively part of the response to the case made by the voluntary bodies is to enable them to maintain their position and to compete effectively in the future.</P>

I have to say that and it has been said before.  It should not come up from time to time.  I know that certain legislation is dealt with by regulation and there is a great temptation on the part of <Col N="2170" /> the Executive and Ministers thereof to arrogate unto themselves greater and greater powers and thereby detract to a greater and greater extent from the essential original basic power which is vested in this House and in the Oireachtas generally.</P>
      <P>Let me say that this creeping trend of arrogating increasing powers to themselves has been a phenomenon of succeeding Governments and not just of this Government.  It is something the House should comment on and try to resist.  I know that fixing the prize money and so on may not be all that important a matter. Some people would regard that as important.  But I would think that a more satisfactory way of doing this &mdash; and I ask the Minister to consider this &mdash; would be to set down maximum parameters for these prize money figures in the Act and allow the Minister, perhaps by regulation, to vary these within certain parameters. But here the thing is given on an open ended basis.  Here is a case where a Minister will make a regulation under his own hand and amend an Act of the Oireachtas.  It is wrong in theory; it is wrong in principle; it goes against the principles of the Constitution in my opinion.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will refer me to section 35.  Admittedly he has to place the regulation before the House and the House can, of course, within 21 days bring in a resolution, if that was ever thought of, or was possible, or anybody would regard it as in any way practicable, which it is not, to annul the regulation. We all know there is no practicality in that type of provision.  Backbenchers who try to watch these things as best they can, with great difficulty for the most part, do not know of the multitude of regulations and if they did know about them the mechanisms of this House are not such that they could with any degree of reason be enabled to table, much less have carried, a motion of this House annulling such a regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a wrong principle sneaking in here and we should watch it.  It behoves any backbencher on any side of the House to draw attention to something <Col N="2171" /> like that, highlight it, ask the Minister to reconsider it and have a better format in our Acts of the Oireachtas.  That would avoid this kind of provision, with a Minister of the Executive taking a power of that nature unto himself.  That should not be.</P>

      <P>I would like to comment on this section.  An important change is being made here with reference to advertising and marketing.  The Minister is lifting a restriction so that he can, in effect, go public.  I have done so on Second Stage and earlier on this Stage, but must again draw the attention of the House to the course on which the Legislature are embarking.  The Government will set out on a massive advertising and marketing campaign.  This will encourage people to buy lottery tickets at every opportunity because if you are not in, you cannot win. They will use every device and marketing trick ever conceived to influence, through television, radio and the newspapers, every man, woman and child to become involved in this great new national pastime of lotteries.  We are going to gather money up, as Deputy O'Rourke said earlier, not by way of taxes but at the cost of employment and by taxing the disadvantaged.  That money will amount to tens of millions of pounds and with it we will encourage the population to spend more money on lottery tickets and get involved in a game at which they cannot win.</P>

It appears that what the Deputy is saying would be relevant somewhere else, but it is not relevant to this section. It is not for me to rule on this, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but it does not appear to be relevant here.  There are some of us who, to be blunt, are anxious to get out of here as quickly as we can because we have been here a long time.

He said that by virtue of section 22 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, he was lifting the restriction on marketing and advertising, so that the Government could advertise on the market for the lottery.  I know it is late in the evening, but this is one of my convictions.  I have been fighting this proposal for nearly two years and see it about to take off on the slipway to be launched.  I want to say a last farewell to what is left of an Ireland that I will once have known.  We are now embarking on a course of encouraging gambling.  This is directly relevant.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  I must say what I have to say.  Virtually 99 per cent of the Members have no objections to this Bill.  I am probably the only Member in the House who is totally opposed to lotteries.  This is partly because of what will happen as a result of the removal of the restriction under this section.  I must <Col N="2173" /> put on the record my reasons for opposing that.  Otherwise I shall appear to be just a head banger, objecting and being out of step, and with everybody else right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Name of God, I am talking on the section now.  When one is on Second Stage one is talking about the principles of the Bill.  I am pointing out the effects of this section.  If the Minister wants to do so, he can decide between now and Report Stage to delete this section.  Therefore, I must bring up this matter on Committee Stage.  The whole success of lotteries is based on the facility granted by such a section as this in that a nation can get into the business of marketing and advertising its products.  The product in this instance is the lottery.  The money which comes in by way of revenue from the sale of tickets will be used to advertise and encourage people to buy ever more tickets.  They will become gamblers and, as experience in other countries has shown we will have a great growth in the number of gamblers and in the membership of Gamblers Anonymous. This will have a very deleterious effect on the fabric of our society, perhaps even more damaging than if the people had let in the legislation that we were trying to bring in last week.  This coupled with a penchant for over-drinking, will harm society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister, even at this stage, to consider whether he should remove the section.  A reduced lottery would be the lesser of two evils.  This is something that he will not be able to control unless the lottery falls flat on its face in a few years' time.  When we consider the damage which will be done to society, the game is not worth the candle.  That is all I wanted to say and I would have said it much more quickly if I had been let.  I did not intend to speak longer.  In spite <Col N="2174" /> of the fact that Deputy O'Kennedy is tired &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill has been in the pipeline since 1979 and yet we have to rush it through the House in two short sittings before the summer recess.  I want to point out these matters and put them on the record.  I shall not repeat what Deputy Taylor has said.  He has said it before and I have said it also.  This is a tendency to get away from democracy and undermine the legislative power of this House, putting clauses such as this into this section and we are supposed to just put a rubber stamp on this to enable the lottery to get going.  I do not know who runs the country, but it is certainly not being run from here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Skelly's view on this.  We had originally very extensive discussions with many voluntary organisations.  They expressed their concern in relation to the Bill.  One of their major anxieties was their perceived inability to compete with the national lottery because of the present restriction under the 1956 Act.  This was in relation, first, to advertising and, secondly, to the limits of prizes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following that, a decision was made to respond positively by including this section.  As a believer in parliamentary democracy, I find it a little more difficult to give a total answer to the point raised by Deputy Taylor.  The theory of parliamentary democracy applies to discussion in this House on virtually all acts of a <Col N="2175" /> legislative or regulatory nature proposed by the Executive.  The problem is that real life is a little bit different.  Deputy Taylor understands the kind of pressures we have on parliamentary time and the difficulties and delays in bringing forward legislation.  The part of me which believes in the theory of parliamentary democracy would be inclined to agree with Deputy Taylor that this is a kind of short cut.  At the same time, there is a specific provision in the Bill for bringing any such regulation before the House.  This is provided for in section 35(4) under which any regulation made under section 34 or section 35 has to be brought before the House.</P>

      <P>The whole way in which we deal with regulations is an area that many of us should look at more closely.  In theory, perhaps, there is a point in what Deputy Taylor says.  Over the years and certainly in recent years, a general provision of this kind has been framed in the manner in which it is now before the House.  I fully understand the point raised by Deputy Taylor.  As one who is very cognisant of the need to maintain the balance generally between the Executive and the Legislature, I have a degree of sympathy for the point raised. Perhaps in a general sense it is one that all of us as parliamentarians, not just in relation to this Bill but in general, should look at in a more deliberative fashion to see what the best approach for the development of our parliamentary democracy should be.  I would not like to <Col N="2176" /> overstate the point.  In theory a strong case was made by Deputy Taylor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (2), to delete lines 44 to 46.</P>
      <P>My apologies to Deputy Skelly in the sense that it is not a question of waiting for one's own contribution.  I wonder whether Deputy Skelly, for all his conviction, was relevant on the section.  He managed to relate his contribution to the section.  On section 34 Deputy Taylor anticipated a little but not all of what I want to say in relation to this amendment. The Minister has had notice since Second Stage of our total rejection of the provision in this section which enables the Minister, by regulation, to change any part of the Act and not just, as referred to by Deputy Taylor initially, specific sections of the Gaming and Lotteries Act for specific purposes &mdash; two sections.  I have researched this and I have never seen a provision in legislation which enables the Minister, by regulation, to change any part of the Act we have spent our time discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Skelly was right when he said on section 34 that whatever we are about, we are not about recognising the authority of this House.  We are being used and abused not even as rubber stamps but as sponges that can be cast aside.  We soak in what we get and are then cast aside.  Nobody can justify this kind of provision which says, if in any respect any difficulty arises in bringing this Act into operation, the Minister may by regulations do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for bringing this Act into operation.  I can go this far. If he runs into trouble we will give the Minister such power as he thinks he needs to bring the Act into effect.  But the Minister is saying he needs powers to give <Col N="2177" /> effect to the Act passed by this Parliament, albeit in a rather rushed fashion and rather late at night.</P>
    <P>The next two lines are absolutely unprecedented.  It goes on to say, and this is what I propose to delete, &ldquo;and any such regulation may modify the provisions of this Act so far as may appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient for carrying the regulations into effect&rdquo;. Putting it bluntly the Minister can introduce a regulation to modify the provisions of the Act.  Modifying the provisions of the Act means that by regulation he can change anything that we have been arguing about and discussing from section 1 to section 35.  That makes a nonsense of law and Parliament and Parliament's role in discussing the law.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say that perhaps we should look at these things and get the balance a bit more correct. He seems to be sympathetic to the case made by Deputy Taylor in relation to amendments to specific sections of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  Deputy Taylor's point was well made and well taken.  If the Minister's response holds good in respect of this over-riding power for two sections, surely the case is all the more cogent when the Minister can, by regulation, neutralise, change or modify all that we have been discussing in those 35 sections.  I do not know of any power such as this that has been given to a Minister.  It is just as well it is not the Minister for Justice who is here.  If we start to introduce this kind of provision the Minister for Justice will come in some day and say we introduced that in the National Lottery Bill and power was given to a Minister to change, by regulation, sections of the Act.  You would never guess what we would get into then, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>This precedent is totally unacceptable and is not necessary.  I propose that those last two lines be deleted and that we give the Minister any powers he wants by regulation to give effect to what is in this Act.  We can give him all those powers and say we trust him.  I do not think we can be asked to give the Minister power, <Col N="2178" /> when he has gone home, or any time afterwards, by regulation to modify the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister <i>qua</i> Minister or his colleagues <i>qua</i> Government colleagues deliberately decided to put this in.  I do not think they did.  I do not think they had the intention, the time, or the application to do so.  I do not want to blame the officials.  They probably got the draftsman to do it for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a case to answer.  I could not possibly accept this kind of provision, which is as wrong as bedamned. The Minister spoke of keeping the balance right between the Executive and the Legislature.  The balance here is so bad that it has become unbalanced.  A matter like this must be openly discussed in a Parliament for the people.  In my 20 years here I cannot recall any legislation that gives such overriding powers.  I am asking the Minister to withdraw these two lines.  That is all I seek.  We should not be asked to give all these powers to the Minister if he needs them &ldquo;to modify&rdquo;&mdash; that is a handy word.</P>

Words fail me.  I cannot imagine how this could have got through the hands of any draftsman, how it could have got through the Attorney General's Office, the Minister's Office or the Cabinet.  I think Deputy O'Kennedy was rather mild about this.  I may have reservations about his amendment because one can imagine why we bothered with the Bill at all when we could have brought in an amendment to allow the Minister to do whatever he likes.</P>

      <P>I am advised there is considerable precedent for a measure of this kind, going back many years.  I understand it goes back to a Social Welfare Act in the fifties.  There is such a provision in section 25 of the Farm Tax Act of 1985 and I am surprised that the points being raised now were not raised then.  When I opened on the Committee Stage this morning I indicated that I was prepared to listen to what Deputies would say, and listening to the views of Deputy O'Kennedy, reinforced strongly by Deputy Taylor's contribution, I believe more strongly in parliamentary democracy.</P>
      <P>Listening to the discussion on this section I have been considering whether it would be possible to accept Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment.  The original justification for including this provision was that we believed it was prudent to include it in the legislation because the Bill innovates something of technical complexity and it would be necessary, in case any technical problem arose during the operation of the Act which could be cured by regulation.  This section could not be used substantively to change the provisions of the Act.  Subsection (4) of this section, moreover, requires the laying of any such regulation before both Houses.  This, to me is compelling.  We want to get this lottery into operation, and on that basis I am prepared to accept the amendment and to delete the two lines, as proposed</P>

      <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the law as to contempt of court, where the District Court has made an order under section 7 or section 11 of the Act of 1964 containing a direction regarding&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the custody of an infant, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the right of access to an infant,</P>
      <P>any person having the actual custody of the infant who, having been given or shown a copy of the order and&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  having been required, by or on behalf of a person to whom the custody of the infant is committed <Col N="2182" /> by the direction, to give up the infant to that person, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  having been required, by or on behalf of a person entitled to access to the infant in accordance with the direction, to allow that person to have such access,</P>
    <P>fails or refuses to comply with the requirement shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £200 or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section a person shall be deemed to have been given or shown a copy of an order made under section 7 or section 11 of the Act of 1964 if that person was present at the sitting of the Court at which such order was made.</P>
    <P>(4)  The references in subsections (1) and (7) of section 8 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940, to an order shall be construed as including references to a maintenance order made under section 7 (6) or section 11 (2) (b) of the Act of 1964 and to a variation order made under section 12 of the Act of 1964.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Courts Act, 1981, gives to the District Court a considerable measure of jurisdiction under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  The purpose of the new section 5 which was inserted into the Bill in the course of its passage through the Seanad is to provide enforcement provisions parallel to that new jurisdiction. That is to say it will enable the District Court to enforce any order made by it concerning the custody of an infant or concerning access by one parent to an infant who is in the custody of another parent or a guardian by providing penalties for failure or refusal to comply with such a custody order or access order. Additionally, the new section provides in subsection (4) for the enforcement of maintenance payments which are ordered in guardianship proceedings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2183" /> Specifically, the new section of the Bill covers the enforcement of the following orders made by the District Court under the 1964 Act.  First, an order under section 7 or section 11 concerning a direction regarding the custody of an infant or the right of access to an infant.  Second, an order for maintenance under section 7 (6) or section 11 (2) (b) and any variation order under section 12 in relation to such maintenance order.  The House may wish to note that the penalties provided for in the new section for breach of custody or access orders made under section 7 or section 11 of the 1964 Act reflect the penalty provisions in section 20 (2) of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, and also in section 6 of the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981.  Subsection (4) of the new section is on the lines of section 29 of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  It provides for the enforcement of any periodic payments which are ordered under the Act of 1964 by applying to any such periodic payment order or maintenance order the enforcement provisions of Part II of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940.  This is an amendment which arose from the discussions I had in the Seanad and which the House will agree completes the provision which was set out in the Act of 1981 which up to now has been something which could, with some impunity, be ignored.  This is a very sensible and necessary measure which I have pleasure in proposing to the House.</P>

      <P>This is a measure which has come back to us fairly hurriedly from the Seanad.  We have it at short notice.  I accept the general principle as outlined by the Minister.  I would like to ask him in relation to the enforcement of maintenance orders what the position is at present?  It is possible to make an attachment order for maintenance to a salary. What are the current penalties for failure to comply with such an attachment order?</P>

      <P>The specific difficulties which this amendment aims to deal with are not ones which arise specifically in relation to attachment orders but in relation to the other provisions which I mentioned where the District Court had no power to order a penalty in the event of non-compliance.  As I have said, orders of the court could be ignored in some cases without there being a penalty for doing so.  It is in order to give the court the power to apply a penalty, and therefore enforce its orders, that this amendment has been brought forward.</P>

Attachment orders on earnings may be made on the basis of the 1976 Family Law Act on foot of a maintenance order made under section 11 of the 1964 Act.  There is no other District Court enforcement power in the 1964 Act.  We are providing one here.  As I have said, the penalties are parallel to the penalties provided for in the 1976 and 1981 Acts.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 42 and 43, the following section inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;Section 25 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the insertion in subsection (1) before &lsquo;whenever&rsquo; of &lsquo;Subject to the provisions of subsection (1A)  of this section&rsquo;, and</P>
      <P>(b)  by the insertion after subsection</P>
      <P>(1)  of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1A) In the case of a conviction for any offence relating to prohibited hours, the provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall apply only if the Court in its discretion so thinks proper&rsquo;.,</P>
      <P>and the said subsection (1), as so amended, is set out in the Table to this section.</P>
      <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of subsection (1A) of this section, whenever the holder of any licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor by retail is convicted of an offence to which this Part of this Act applies the conviction shall, <Col N="2186" /> if the person so convicted is the holder of one such licence only, be recorded on such licence or, if such person is the holder of two or more such licences in respect of the same premises, be recorded on all such licences or if such person is the holder of two or more such licences which do not all relate to the same premises, be recorded on such one or more or those licences as relate to the premises in respect of which the offence was committed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are concerned with the question of endorsement of liquor licences on conviction of certain offences under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  Under the law as it stands, if a licence holder is convicted of such an offence at a time when he already has two live endorsements on his licence, the licence is automatically forfeited.  This is a very severe penalty in that forfeiture of the licence removes the right of the licensee ever to hold a licence again and takes away any possibility that the premises may ever be licensed again.</P>
    <P>This matter was raised during the course of debate on Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad and Senators on both sides of the House were concerned at the severity of the provision in so far as it applies to offences relating to prohibited hours.  It was pointed out that licence holder may not be able to clear the premises before the end of the permitted hours.  The penalty provided is very severe.  Forfeiture of the licence in those circumstances can mean the loss of livelihood for the licensee and a very drastic devaluation of the licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter at some length both in the Seanad and in more relaxed circumstances outside it I decided to accept in principle a proposal put forward there on Committee Stage that the District Court should have discretion whether or not to endorse a licence on conviction of an endorsable offence.  I took the view that this discretion should <Col N="2187" /> be confined to offences relating to prohibited hours.  The proposal before the House is therefore confined to endorsable offences relating to prohibited hours and does not extend to any of the other endorsable offences.  It will still be open to the District Court to endorse a licence leading to forfeiture on conviction of an endorsable offence where there are already two live endorsements on the licence.</P>
    <P>In that respect I am not making any change in the provision.  I would recommend this provision to the House as being an appropriate one in that the District Court would be best placed to decide whether endorsement was warranted in the particular circumstances of each case. Amendment No. 2 proposes to amend the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, so that on conviction of an offence relating to prohibited hours the District Court will have discretion whether or not to endorse the conviction on the licence.</P>
    <P>There is already provision in section 27 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1927 under which an appeal lies to the Circuit Court against conviction of an endorsable offence.  It would be appropriate to give the Circuit Court discretion as to the endorsement of the licence similar to that which it is proposed to give to the District Court, this discretion to be exercised when the conviction of the offence comes before the Circuit Court on appeal. Amendment No. 3 provides for the grant of this discretion to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 4 to 11 propose changes to section 10 of the Bill which are consequential on the changes introduced by amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are prepared to go along with the Minister in making this amendment in this way, although we would have preferred a more substantive comprehensive Bill to cover these measures as well as others promised by the Government.  The Minister will be aware that we have been expecting an Intoxicating Liquor Bill for some time.  On 22 <Col N="2188" /> April the Minister said in reply to a question that such a Bill was being drafted and that he expected it would come before the House fairly soon.  Consequently the media and Members of the House generally have been anticipating such a Bill. That Bill has not come before us and instead one of the aspects which we felt should be dealt with in that context has now come before us in the form of an amendment from the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Minister is quite correct in saying that Members on all sides of the House have requested that something be done about this measure.  It has been found to be particularly severe in its application and there are instances where a publican could lose his licence for one offence on being charged under three different headings relating to the same occasion. This kind of development brought to the attention of Members of this House the problems associated with the relevant section of the original 1927 Act.  The existing measure has been described as draconian and particularly severe.  It certainly needs amendment but, by doing it in this way we are not really getting the opportunity to discuss and debate it fully and come up with other suggestions and possibilities.  Presumably the Minister plans to bring forward a more comprehensive Bill at some time in the autumn but I would prefer if, associated with this matter, we had a measure to deal with under-age drinking, for instance.  This is a matter on which Members on all sides feel very strongly. I appeal to the Minister to give urgent attention to that question.</P>
      <P>The Minister has chosen to put this measure before us and it will provide an alleviation for some people who have been particularly hard hit by the severity of the existing law.  The problem is that the judge has no discretion once he convicts a publican for, say, trading 20 minutes after hours and he must endorse the licence.  Once the licence is lost, neither the publican nor the premises can be licensed again.  That is the case that was made to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the original Act with me for reference purposes.  Section 25 of that <Col N="2189" /> Act is amended by the insertion in subsection (1)  of the words &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of subsection (1A)  of this section&rdquo;.  The rest of subsection (1)  stays as it is.  It is followed by subsection (1A) which states:</P>
    <P>In the case of a conviction for any offence relating to prohibited hours, the provisions of subsection (1)  of this section shall apply only if the Court in its discretion so thinks proper.</P>
    <P>It is placing the onus on the court, on the district justice, to use his or her discretion. That changes the provision in the 1927 Act.  Had we more time to consider this measure or had the Minister included it in the more substantive legislation that was promised before the summer recess we might have thought it desirable to give a district justice discretion to close a licensed premises for a short period as a form of penalty, for two or three weeks. I accept that the present provision is draconian but we must recognise the importance of this area and the need to keep control in it.  The vast majority of publicans run good houses but I would like to see a reasonable amount of control exercised.  I hope the Minister will bear those views in mind.  I will not press the measure now because of the limitations on time.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister consider giving discretion to district justices to impose higher fines?  I have no doubt that had we had time to consider this matter we would have been able to put suggestions to the Minister in regard to these measures.  Is the Minister in a position to give details of the fines applicable to such offences? Subsection (2)  of amendment No. 3 which seeks to replace section 27 of the 1927 Act states:</P>
    <P>On the hearing of an appeal under subsection (1)  of this section from a conviction for an offence relating to prohibited hours, the Judge of the Circuit Court may, although affirming the conviction, make, if in his discretion he so thinks proper, an order declaring that such conviction shall not be recorded on such licence and, whenever <Col N="2190" /> such an order is so made, such conviction shall not be so recorded and shall for all purposes be deemed never to have been so recorded and, accordingly, any forfeiture occasioned by the recording of such conviction shall be deemed to be cancelled.</P>
    <P>Presumably that means that on appeal the recording of a conviction may be cancelled. I am aware of cases where that measure is necessary to deal with severe treatment meted out to publicans.</P>
    <P>I recognise the point made by Senators in that regard and what the Minister is trying to do in his amendment.  However, I anticipated that this measure would be considered in the context of the Bill the Government had promised to introduce before the summer recess.  That Bill has been put back to the next session.  It is unfortunate that we will not have an opportunity to discuss this measure in detail over a number of weeks but we support the Minister in the amendment. I hope he considers the points I have made in regard to other discretions which should be made available to the district justices instead of the draconian measure the Minister is removing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commend the Minister for accepting the learned suggestion made by Senators on this point.  I have spoken in the House on what I have described as the severe penalty imposed on publicans found in breach of the licensing laws.  District justices did not have any discretion in regard to endorsements.  The amendment before us illustrates the real value of the Seanad.  Those who supported the amendment respect the law and put forward this suggestion to fulfil the ambition of every good publican, to run a good house.  The Minister has accepted the good will of the licensed vintners and in doing so has acknowledged their right to a livelihood.  I can understand Deputy Woods's frustration at the delay in bringing in the promised legislation but I am aware of publicans in my constituency, who are not members of my party, who run a risk of losing their livelihood if <Col N="2191" /> the legislation is not changed.  The old penalty was too severe and draconian.</P>
      <P>Competition between licensed premises is great and the trade has changed dramatically in recent years.  Many district justices have complained that they did not have the liberty to save the licences of publicans.  I commend Senator Howard for championing this measure through the Seanad.  As a representative of the licensed vintners he has done an excellent job for the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Carey in making the very general remark that the three main amendments before us this evening in their genesis seem to me to vindicate the bicameral nature of our Oireachtas.  I do not intend to go any further than that but those amendments illustrate how, after quite a searching debate in this House, further consideration can be given to matters that perhaps, are not fully dealt with in this House.  In saying that I do not mean to be disrespectful to the House but they may not be dealt with here because our concerns on a particular occasion may lie elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I am glad the measure has been received in the House in the way it has been taken and I should like to thank Deputy Woods for his agreement to take the matter in the way it has been discussed. It was an extremely constructive response to a debate that has been going on for quite some time.  I am sure the Deputy will be happy if I remind the House of something his colleague, Deputy Hyland, said, during the debate on Report Stage on 12 March.  I will quote from column 1744 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>A District Justice should at least be given flexibility under the new legislation to endorse a licence,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my reflection on the measure that was put to me in the Seanad I examined a suggestion which has also been mentioned by Deputy Woods, namely, the possibility of giving the District Court discretion to suspend a licence for a short period.  I have to say <Col N="2192" /> that would be a very awkward measure to define and, on reflection, I think Deputy Woods will agree with me.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made with regard to the monetary penalties.  At the moment the penalties are £20 on first conviction and £40 on the second and each subsequent conviction.  I think the House will agree that those penalties need to be updated and in the further legislation I shall bring forward in the autumn session I will provide for a substantial review of all the penalties in relation to the Intoxicating Liquor Acts in order to bring them more up-to-date.  I can assure Deputy Woods that in that area I shall meet his concern.  I can also assure the House it will have no cause for complaint as to the lightness of the legislation I shall bring forward in the autumn.  Quite a number of areas need to be covered, as has emerged during the course of our debate here on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods has pointed out that amendment No. 3 replaces section 27 of the 1927 Act.  I repeat the point that, having given a discretion to the District Court, it seems to me consistent and desirable that we should follow up in the case of the appeal to a Circuit Court by making a provision along the lines of that proposed.  It maintains the logic of the system.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat two points.  First, the measures I am proposing concern only endorsable offences relating to prohibited hours, not any of the other endorsable offences of which there are many.  Secondly, it does not in any way disturb the situation under which a licence on which there are three live endorsements is forfeited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I was aware of the fact that Deputy Hyland had raised the specific point referred to by the Minister.  Many points were raised in the context of the Bill but they were seen at that time to be matters for the Bill dealing with liquor licences and, therefore, were not properly in the context of the Bill.  We are conscious of the concern which has been represented to Members on both sides of the House in relation to this matter and <Col N="2193" /> we support the Minister in this connection. However, I have to say that I think we could do the task a little better if we had more time, but that is the only point I shall make about that now.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister if there is available at this stage some mechanism whereby we can amend the fines of £20 and £40.  The Minister could find that others would be highly critical of taking away control without providing for an increased fine that was more realistic.  I do not think the licensed trade would object to it because I presume they would like to see adequate fines being imposed. It would have been preferable if the Minister could have put forward a brief amendment adjusting the fines upwards to make them more realistic.  Will he consider increasing them by some amount even at this stage or has he any suggestions to make on that point? Obviously £20 is an entirely unrealistic figure and should be increased.  Will he consider multiplying that figure by ten or increasing the fine to £500 in order to make the measure more realistic?</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, I have in mind a general updating of the fines provided for in the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  Without being any more specific, the kind of proposal the Deputy has in mind is not a million miles away from what I have in mind.  In a Bill I shall bring forward in the autumn session I shall deal completely with the question of fines.  I do not think we will be doing any disservice to the public or violence to public order by having a hiatus of a few months between this measure and the updating of the fines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for Agriculture the reasons that advanced sheep premium payments for 1986 have not been paid for the month of June as promised and if he will, as a matter of urgency, direct that immediate payment be made.</P>
      <P>I sincerely thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter for my constituents and for the people of the west.  Like myself, the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, is suffering from influenza and I want to thank him for taking this debate.  I propose to share my time with my constituency colleague, Deputy Kitt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation pertaining to the balance of the advanced sheep premium payments is very serious in the west.  Over the past year we have experienced the most inclement weather ever.  As I said on numerous occasions in this House, two out of three farmers in the west, particularly in County Galway, are in serious financial difficulties.  Because of the inclement weather there has been a shortage of grass, herbage and fodder <Col N="2197" /> production, silage making has been much slower than normal and, due to the bad summer, autumn and winter of 1985, the quality of stock and fodder could not compare with that of other years.  As a result we have had bad quality stock, bad quality fodder and the market is very depressed.  Over the last few weeks we have seen the livestock processing industry under threat, particularly the meat industry.  A group of sheep factories in the south have gone into liquidation. That is very serious and shows how severely the farmers are being hit and the serious financial pressure they are under.</P>
    <P>Added to that is the fact that the financial institutions have been putting pressure on the farmers.  There must be something seriously wrong when the semi-State company, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, are considering closing two or three branch offices and letting go about 100 staff.  As far as I am concerned, they are not playing their part in alleviating the pressure on farmers.  They have a particular role to play in restructuring the financial position farmers find themselves in.  They know better than any other financial institution the serious position farmers find themselves in and the assets and collateral farmers have. They should be in a position to take over farmers' borrowings.  The problem is that the finances of many farmers have been badly managed.  All they need is restructuring over a long term, with one borrowing operation, because they have the assets to meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>The reason I raised this question is that last Saturday at my many advice centres throughout my constituency farmers came to me complaining that they had been promised that the balance of the ewe premiums would be paid, but they have not been paid as yet.  In May, the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, in a Dáil debate on agriculture in Connemara said he was currently reviewing the ewe premium and hoped that sheep inspections for the ewe premiums would be ahead of schedule as they were being carried out at a very brisk pace.  He went on to say that he hoped to bring the premium payments forward by at least <Col N="2198" /> four to six weeks and that would mean that many farmers would get their payments at the end of the following month. Obviously, he meant the end of June; but we have given him four weeks on the maximum period and we are now moving into the ninth week.  The information available to me is that no arrangements have been made yet to make these payments.</P>
    <P>Farmers are under severe pressure. They do not have any cash flow because of the inclement weather and the depressed markets and they need this extra cash to tide them over their present difficulties. As we all know, the past year has been a disaster for the agricultural industry, particularly for our farmers in the disadvantaged areas of the west and it is imperative that this money be made available to carry them over the summer. Hopefully, with a good grass growth and an improvement in the weather, stocks will improve, the market conditions will improve and the farmers will be in a solid financial position and will be able to recover from the financial difficulties which have been imposed on them over the past year.</P>
    <P>There have been many debates on agricultural matters in this House over the past six months.  On 11 June, as a result of a parliamentary question I put to the Minister for Agriculture, I was informed that £2,923,000 was owed in arrears to the Land Commission by 33,739 farmers. This clearly illustrates the serious financial pressure on farmers.  That is the largest sum of money to be owed to the Land Commission by farmers in the history of this State.  This money is due on arrears, annuities and repayments on land which farmers bought over the years, particularly over the last ten years when they paid sometimes in excess of £3,000 an acre.  Farmers took the risk and bought that land in good faith, but due to the depressed market and the economic position they are not able to meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>I know farmers with assets of £180,000 and liabilities of £60,000, who owe the Land Commission £12,000 and £13,000 but who are not getting the assistance, <Col N="2199" /> direction or instruction they need from the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Land Commission, Deputy Connaughton, the Land Commission or the Department.  I do not know why it is not possible to restructure these arrears and to take the farmers out of this financial straitjacket. I appeal to the Minister not alone to release the sheep premium payments immediately, but to give a firm commitment tonight in regard to when the balance of the sheep premiums will be paid and the total amount that will be paid to sheep farmers under this scheme.</P>
    <P>We all know the difficulties which bad weather has caused for farmers in the west, particularly in the Shannon Valley area.  In County Galway, the Minister's own constituency which is affected by the Shannon, only £59,000 has been paid out in comparison with County Roscommon where almost £207,000 was paid out.  As much land on the west bank of the Shannon in County Galway is affected by flooding as there is in County Roscommon or any other country on the eastern bank.</P>
    <P>County Galway is the second largest county and I cannot see why there should be this discrimination <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Shannon flood scheme.  We all regret the recent appalling weather but we have no control over that.  Farmers with 80 acres, 60 acres or 40 acres find themselves in serious difficulties because they have only 12 acres or 13 acres on which to put their stock.  Land which was intended for silage and meadow cannot be used for that purpose because farmers have no option but to put their stock on those meadows since the stock cannot go on other land which is completely under water.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to tell us tonight when these payments will be released, the exact date and the arrangements that will be made.  I share the frustration felt by farmers because every scheme seems to have particular anomalies which affect the west.  The Minister recently announced farm improvement grants and installation grants.  We commend him for any announcement he <Col N="2200" /> makes that will help the farmers in the west.  These recently announced grants are not to the advantage of the farmers in the west.  There is difficulty with the standard man days and we see a total anomaly where a farmer milking 20 cows with a milking machine will not qualify for those grants and another farmer milking 20 cows by hand will qualify for them. This is illogical and ludicrous and needs immediate rectification.  We must ensure that whatever assistance is made available in every area will be to the advantage of the people in the areas for which it is intended.  I appeal to the Minister to look at that and to recognise that farmers are in serious difficulty.  I know there may be pressure on the Exchequer, and maybe this money coming in from Europe is being used to cushion the pressure on the Exchequer.  That should not happen.  Farmers are in serious difficulty as individuals, as heads of households and of families.  They must sustain their families on the land.  They have no other option.  I appeal to the Minister tonight to ensure that this position is clarified and the green light is given for the payments of these moneys.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification <i>vis-á-vis</i> an advance payment which has already been made to a farmer who has, say, 100 sheep &mdash; in round figures to make it easy for the Minister.  Due to the inclement weather and the serious financial position in which the farmer finds himself he has no option but to dispose of ten or 20 ewes in order to meet his financial commitments, sustain his family, or purchase fodder for the rest of his stock.  Will this man be allowed for those ten or 20 ewes, or whatever he had to dispose of?  Will it impinge or infringe on the total money being paid to him or will the total payment or the balance that should be made to him be paid?  Will it not be paid at all?  I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify this.</P>
    <P>Again, a Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for giving me and my colleague this opportunity to raise this urgent matter on behalf of our constituency and county and the farmers of the west.  I appeal to the Minister to clarify the position, to <Col N="2201" /> give a firm commitment on the date on which these payments will be made, tell us the number of farmers who will benefit from it, and the total amount of money being made available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Treacy in asking the Minister to arrange for the payment of the balance as quickly as possible.  As Deputy Treacy said, we know the situation.  Our farmers over the last year and in the first half of this year have suffered losses and their situation is serious.  One could itemise the problems under the headings of acute fodder shortage, severe flooding, particularly in the Shannon Valley area, loss of livestock, loss of crops and low milk yields.</P>
      <P>Regarding the financial situation, the Minister is aware that farmers have serious problems in repayments to financial institutions.  Some farmers are bankrupt. For that reason we want to get these payments out as quickly as possible.  With all these schemes, ewe premium, cattle headage, or whatever, are we getting the full benefit which is available from the EC?  In Northern Ireland and in other countries in the EC the payments have increased.  The Minister should clarify that.  The position was very well outlined in a document produced by the IFA and launched last November.  It related totally to the western counties and talked about the low farm incomes there.  The stark reality is stated in the first sentence which tells that two thirds of the farmers in the west live in relative poverty.  The recent findings by the Agricultural Institute in their book <i>Marginalisation in Irish Agriculture</i> reveal that the number of farmers living in poverty is increasing alarmingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After last year's atrocious weather conditions which continued into the first half of this year, it is important that all help possible be given to them particularly through the type of schemes we are talking about here.  I compliment the Minister and his staff on the early inspections which were carried out, but obviously <Col N="2202" /> what is needed urgently is the payment of the premiums.</P>
    <P>I referred in the House previously to the way in which farmers in the west depend on assistance, probably more so this year after the losses of 1985.  Yet I have been informed in replies to questions I put to the Minister for Social Welfare that a total of 7,475 smallholders have either had their payments reduced or have lost them completely.  The loss of social welfare payments has affected farmers' incomes.  In Galway, Mayo and Roscommon 1,400 farmers have suffered as a result of the loss of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The points made in various agricultural debates in the House and by the IFA concerning the Shannon Valley demonstrated the need to increase headage payments by 30 per cent and to pay them immediately.  There should also be interest free loans, an extension of the feed voucher scheme and fertiliser subsidies, which are important in trying to help farmers in very difficult circumstances. The ewe premium should be paid as quickly as possible and I hope the Minister has good news about it.</P>
    <P>The chief economist in the IFA indicated recently that farmers will suffer an 8 per cent drop in their incomes even if the weather improves.  Every assistance should be given to them through the schemes available.  I hope that the Minister will indicate that we are getting the full permissible payments, not only in regard to the ewe premium but all the other available payments also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>To date, 10,500 flock owners have been paid £8.3 million. There are about 33,000 flock owners and I hope that over the next 14 to 15 days the remainder will be paid.  This is worth about £40 million, the biggest single payment ever made under this heading. I made a number of changes in the scheme last year and this year.  One was in relation to earlier inspection and I wish to congratulate my officials for achieving this, especially when one considers the total number of individual payments which have to be made by the Department through a plethora of schemes.  We wisely decided that because of bad weather last January we would make an advance payment of £4,90 per ewe.  As Deputies are aware, there are always a number of problem cases and when one realises that there have been 33,000 individual payments, with all the paper work that involves, it is obvious that there will be problems in regard to a very small number.  However, we will do our best to solve these problems and 99 per cent will get their money within the next fortnight.</P>
      <P>The ewe premium scheme has nothing to do with headage payments as it is a deficiency payment to compensate for the price of lamb on the Paris market.  It has increased quite dramatically over the last couple of years &mdash; from 92p in 1981 to £16.74 at present.  It is one of the factors in making sheep farming profitable and has a number of great advantages.  It applies all over the country and there are no off-farm income limits imposed on it. The sheep trade admit that if this payment was not available profitability would be in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies and farming organisations ask me regularly why we cannot make payments more quickly.  The problem is that there is a 100 day retention period laid down by the EC and in our case that period runs from 15 March to 24 June.  During that period all the inspections must be carried out and you <Col N="2204" /> cannot make any payments before 24 June.  We started payments on 25 June&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not worry as they will be paid very soon. As I said, we started to make payments on 25 June and this is the first time that they have been made so quickly.  I fully appreciate the problems, but it should be noted that the big bureaucratic system in Agriculture House can react quickly to them.  I sincerely hope that the injection of £40 million into the agricultural community will be of great benefit and that the problems facing farmers will be offset to some degree by this payment.  I hope that the rest of the summer will bring better weather, although there is a fair degree of growth at present and most of the crops look quite good.  I am sure that the quality of winter fodder will be much better than last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that if ewes were killed by dogs he would be compensated but if he had to destroy them himself obviously the Department would have to look into the matter.  This is an EC scheme and we have very little discretion in regard to payments.  However, if people are affected in that way, I want to hear about it.  I meet hundreds of people every week and no one has ever made that complaint to me, but if it comes up I will deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the serious crisis facing Irish industry because of the over-valuation of the IR£; if, measured by inflation levels, the IR£ over the past five years has lost over 20 per cent in purchasing power within the EMS and relative to sterling it has lost about 10 per cent and farming and agricultural processing and all exporting industries are now finding it difficult to export to the UK which is our main market and other markets and if the present position will lead to job losses and valuable markets being lost; the reason an EMS realignment was not sought that would have been favourable to the aforementioned sectors; the action he now proposes to take to alleviate the serious financial crisis and loss making within the sectors, especially agriculture and industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the IR£ is over-valued or that the stance adopted by the Government in the recent EMS realignment was inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the Government's exchange rate policy is to keep stable the value of the IR£ consistent with our EMS obligations, and with a view to securing a degree of price stability comparable with that of our trading partners.  The benefits which might be derived from a departure from this policy would be only of a short term nature.  Based on past experience, exchange rate depreciation, in our circumstances, would be reflected, within a relatively short period, in a corresponding increase in domestic prices and costs.  Hence, any initial gains to Irish industry or agriculture from a devaluation would be quickly eroded by the increase in costs.  Moreover, the level of inflation would be raised and interest rates, which are a significant cost to <Col N="2027" /> industry, would be likely to be higher than they would otherwise be.</P>
    <P>The position regarding exporters has been dealt with by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in reply to a question on 13 March last (Official Report, columns 1969-72).  At this stage all I would add is that Córas Tráchtála, the body responsible for the promotion of Irish exports, believes that the longer term benefits to the Irish economy in terms of lower inflation rates, lower interest rates and lower input costs, will outweigh the shorter term competitive disadvantage from the weakening of sterling.  The Government, for its part, will do everything in its power to ensure that these benefits are transmitted throughout the economy as rapidly as possible.  Industry must, however, take the primary responsibility for reducing its own costs, including in particular wage costs which have tended to be excessive.</P>
    <P>At a meeting which the Taoiseach and I had with the CII recently, it was agreed that a working group representative of relevant Departments and the CII should analyse the various factors now affecting industrial costs with a view to determining what scope exists for reducing input costs.  This work is now in progress.</P>
    <P>In looking at the competitive position of producers and exporters, consumer prices, as used by the Deputy, are not an appropriate measure. The most widely accepted indicators of movements in international competitiveness, and those which are relevant to employment, are changes in relative earnings and unit wage costs.  The broad picture which emerges from these indicators is that there was some improvement in the competitive position over the period 1980-85.  In terms of relative hourly earnings, Ireland's position was broadly maintained between 1980 and 1985 compared with the weighted average of our main trading partners.  In terms of relative unit labour costs Ireland's position has improved substantially since 1980 compared with our major trading partners, mainly because of the much faster rise in output per head in Irish <Col N="2028" /> manufacturing industry.  If there are no further changes in exchange rates, the recent depreciation of sterling and the dollar will result in some deterioration in Ireland's competitive position in 1986. The extent and duration of this deterioration will depend on how quickly the effects of the exchange rate changes feed through into reduced domestic costs here and higher costs in the UK and US.  Ultimately, we can only secure our competitive position by keeping growth in pay and other costs at or below the rate prevailing in our trading partners.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the decision of the Central Bank in imposing a 1 per cent reserve asset cost on the £135 million Euro currency package which is claimed will cost an additional £1 million in interest charges as the Euro currency package will be of very little value because of all the restrictions being imposed and it now looks that the real rate that it will be issued at will be 10 per cent even though it has been borrowed at Euro rates of as low as 4½ per cent; if the Central Bank will withdraw the charge or levy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank has informed me that it has not imposed any special costs on the two Euro currency loans schemes for farmers.  Banks are required to hold reserves for monetary policy reasons and in accordance with prudent banking practice. Any costs that arise as a result are normally included in the associated banks' overall margins and do not appear as a separate item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank has emphasised to me that it does not accept that the alleged reserve asset cost in respect of these loan schemes is as high as one percentage point.  A representative figure at this junction would be about 0.25 per cent. The effect of reserve asset requirements, therefore, on the cost of loans under these schemes is insignificant.  I understand the associated banks have been <Col N="2029" /> made aware of the Central Bank's viewpoint.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the schemes will be of little value to farmers or that undue restrictions or costs are being imposed.  I should like to take this opportunity to clear some misconceptions that have arisen about these schemes.  They are not EC schemes, as some seem to believe. The £135 million involved is being borrowed by the banks and the ACC, at the Government's request, in an EMS currency, at the lowest commercial rate of interest pertaining to those currencies in the European money markets, about 4.5 per cent.  That is the wholesale rate which is not normally available to the ultimate borrowers, as the lending agencies add a margin to cover their expenses, provision for bad debts and profit.</P>
    <P>A further margin was agreed by the farmers' organisations as the borrowers' contribution towards possible foreign currency exchange losses.  This is 2 per cent in the case of the £100 million scheme.  It is somewhat higher &mdash; 2.5 per cent &mdash; in the case of the £35 million scheme because of the longer period for which funds will be lent under that scheme.</P>
    <P>Apart from this agreed margin for foreign currency exchange risk, no charge has been imposed by the Government on these schemes, which will be of substantial financial benefit to Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the schemes of export sales relief and Shannon relief, both of which confer complete exemption from tax on export earnings, are being terminated in 1990 following objections to these schemes by the EC on the grounds that they represent a distortion of competition contrary to the Treaty of Rome.  It is likely that the EC would also object to any new scheme such as the Deputy has suggested which would grant a similar exemption from tax and I could not contemplate introducing such a scheme in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>The schemes of export sales relief and Shannon relief are being replaced by a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  Under section 45 of the Finance Act, 1984, this rate is applicable to data processing and software development service industries grant aided under the IDA's international services programme.  Because these particular categories of service industry are recognised as the areas of opportunity for Ireland in the services sector generally, this provision represents a major incentive for developing a strong international services sector in Galway and elsewhere in Ireland.  For a variety of policy reasons, I would not favour extending the 10 per cent rate to other service activities.</P>
      <P>As regards private sector investment in construction work in Galway, the Deputy will appreciate that I have already given a massive boost to such investment by including part of Galway city in the designated areas for which special tax incentives to encourage urban renewal are provided in chapter V of the Finance Act, 1986.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the construction work on the Tallaght Hospital will begin in 1989.  The development is to take place on a phased basis.  The first phase which will have about 450 beds is expected to be completed in 1992-93 and will have full diagnostic facilities including radiology, pathology, out-patients department, accident and emergency department, etc.</P>
      <P>The hospital will provide the full range of acute general hospital services and ultimately will have approximately 770 beds.</P>
      <P>The staff complement of the hospital is yet to be decided.  However it could be expected that the hospital would employ in the order of 1,000 staff on completion of the first phase of the development.</P>

      <P>The emphasis in health policy is for health or to protect peoples there from the oping community services for the elderly rather than providing subventions in respect of maintenance of patients in private <Col N="2033" /> nursing homes.  However, a substantial number of patients are receiving subventions from health boards towards the cost of their maintanance in private nursing homes.  Private nursing homes which are not approved for subvention purposes may still operate provided they comply with the terms of the Homes for Incapacitated Persons Regulations, 1985.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the cost of raising from 16 to 18 years of age limit for the domiciliary care allowance, payable by the health boards, in respect of handicapped children being at home; the cost of raising to 18 years the qualifying age for disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The domicilary care allowance (£70 per month) is payable in respect of handicapped children between the ages of two and 16 who need constant care and attention substantially greater than that required by a child of the same age.  In the case of children who remain in full time education, health boards may continue to pay the allowance up to the age of 18.</P>
      <P>The disabled person's maintenance allowance (£41.55 per week &mdash; £180 per month) is payable to handicapped persons over the age of 16 years of age, subject to a medical and means test.  Any change in the age limit for the disabled person's maintenance allowance would require an amendment to Health Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>While, therefore, there would be an increased cost in raising the age limit to 18 for the domiciliary care allowance, it is likely that there would be a correspondingly greater saving by raising the age limit for the disabled person's maintenance allowance to 18.  It is not possible, however, without a detailed analysis of the situation, to provide an estimate of the saving involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 to 106, inclusive, together.  My Department has no record of applications, under the capital grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities, for financial assistance towards the construction of recreational facilities in the areas in question. It is not, therefore, open to my Department to consider the provision of grant assistance in these cases.  In order to obviate any misunderstandings concerning the parameters of this scheme, it should be noted that it is exclusively concerned with assisting towards the cost of contract building work in the provision of youth, community and recreational facilities.  It is not within the terms of the scheme to support either the purchase of land or the development of playing pitches.</P>

      <P>The payment of extra-statutory redundancy to former employees of Irish Meat Producers Limited (Leixlip) has been the subject of an investigation by the Labour Court, which issued a recommendation in the matter on 8 June 1986.  This recommendation is not, however, binding on either party.  Its implementation is a matter for the parties.  I understand that the union involved has accepted the recommendation and has so informed the company.  There is no action open to me as Minister for Labour to ensure that recommendations of the court are accepted and implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the statutory redundancy <Col N="2054" /> entitlements of workers in this company, the position is that the company notified my Department that it was intended to make 267 workers redundant on different dates in March 1986.  Since then, according to claims for rebate submitted to my Department, the company paid redundancy lump sums to 41 employees whose employment was terminated in March 1986.  A further nine employees made redundant at the same time have made application for payment of their redundancy lump sums from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund on the grounds that the company was unable to pay them.  My Department is in correspondence with the company about its failure to pay these nine workers' entitlements. If the company satisfies my Department of its inability to pay, the Department will arrange for payment of the redundancy entitlements of the nine workers concerned.  I hope that payments will be made either by the company or from the Fund within about two weeks.</P>
    <P>No application has been made to my Department in relation to the 217 other workers concerned.  My Department understands that the claims for statutory redundancy lump sums have not been pursued pending clarification of the claims for extra-statutory payments.  The Deputy can be assured that any further claims for statutory lump sums not paid by the employer will be dealt with by my Department as quickly as possible.</P>
