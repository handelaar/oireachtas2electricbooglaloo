    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the plans he has for making the Executive more open to parliamentary scrutiny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have initiated many changes in this direction in recent years, taking into account that the primary responsibility of Parliament under the Constitution is legislative and that of the Government is executive. Such changes have included the new expanded Oireachtas committee system, the new Questions procedures and a new format for debating Estimates.  Other reforming measures such as new procedures for debating reports, for Private Members' Bills and for improvement of explanatory memoranda to accompany Government Bills are under consideration or will be introduced shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the annual Estimates, significant changes have been made in the manner of their presentation to the Dáil. A more detailed programme presentation of public expenditure has been <Col N="1136" /> produced on an experimental basis in each of the past three years.  In addition, the presentation of the public capital programme booklet has been radically improved to provide more detailed information and a better statement of Government capital investment priorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the changes made so far.  In view of the proposed second stage of changes, is the Taoiseach aware that since 1979 the Committee of Public Accounts have not had a Department of Finance minute in their report, as this minute was not published, and is it part of the proposal to reform the role of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General and other people involved in the audit function along the lines of the Canadian Parliament or the British Parliament which introduced a national audit after 1983?  Does the Taoiseach see room for improvement in the role of the Committee of Public Accounts in holding the Executive open to further and more beneficial parliamentary scrutiny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that delays may have occurred in the publication of those reports.  As a former member of the committee I am conscious of the desirability of the committee reviewing expenditure within their terms of reference as soon as possible after the period to which the expenditure relates.  With regard to the other part of the Deputy's question, I will consider specific proposals he may wish to make.  I cannot consider the matter at present but I will when I hear from the Deputy.  One important distinction to be made is that that committee are concerned with the administration of public finances and not with policy issues. Within that parameter there may well be improvements that may be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General and, therefore, the Committee of Public Accounts are affected by legislation enacted in 1866?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the committee, <Col N="1137" /> being what might be considered a senior committee of the House in view of the fact that every Parliament has had a Committee of Public Accounts, have not the necessary staff compared with the staffing arrangements of other committees?  Does the Taoiseach consider these arrangements satisfactory given the fact that the Committee of Public Accounts are charged with an audit function in relation to the past spending of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what the Deputy has in mind with regard to staff. As a member of the committee, I found no difficulty in carrying out my functions by examining the material put before me and then putting questions to the accounting officers relating to their responsibilities in the disbursement of moneys.  It did not strike me at the time that I needed staff to help me to do this, and I am still not entirely clear why I would want staff to help me to perform that function.  As the Deputy is aware the committee will have other functions than those they have traditionally had and carried out since 1866.  This is a matter for further discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Government's publication on the outline of financial procedures says, and it is established practice, that the Department of Finance issue a minute on the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts annually?  Is the Taoiseach also aware that no such minute has issued since 1979 because the reports of the Committee of Public Accounts, though up-to-date, have not been published since 1979?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is regrettable and the Deputy is right to draw it to the attention of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>An bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Taoiseach laghdú ar na coistí a chur faoi bhráid an Oireachtais?  The Taoiseach <Col N="1138" /> said in his reply that he had expanded the committees but recently it was reported to the newspapers that it was intended to reduce the committees from ten to four. Is it the Taoiseach's intention to consult the Oireachtas on these proposals and why is he taking such a secretive approach in regard to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Sin ceist eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is directly related to the original question.  The Taoiseach said he had expanded the committees, but there was a statement by the Chief Whip to the effect that the Government intend to reduce the committees from ten to four. Surely this is a relevant supplementary question to the Taoiseach's reply that the committees have been expanded and that he has done a wonderful job in doing so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to clarify the position.  The Government have not yet considered proposals in this regard but proposals have been prepared and circulated for comment which will come to Government in due course.  If the Government take the view that these proposals contain ideas worthy of consideration by the House, they will then be brought to the attention of other parties because any changes in procedure involving the committee system are matters for the House, not just for the Government.  When the Government consider this matter it is not certain they will take the view that there is merit in putting forward such proposals but, if there is, other parties in the House will immediately be consulted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government will consider the introduction of a national honour or honours system to acknowledge the exceptional in human achievement so as to <Col N="1139" /> encourage and mark service to the community, society and to mankind; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not under consideration at present.  However, if any significant body of opinion in the Oireachtas is favourable to the idea, I would be willing to explore it further with Opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that people like Bob Geldof, Eamon Coughlan and Seán McBride who have been honoured internationally should also be honoured by their own community and by the Government? Does the Taoiseach consider it appropriate that some form of national honours should be introduced to commend these people for the service they have rendered to society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind on the subject.  I studied the file &mdash; which goes back to 1929 &mdash; when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I notice in a previous reply which I gave in this regard that I said the file went back to 1939, which is incorrect.  As I said, it goes back to 1929 and the matter was considered on about three occasions by different Governments who did not pursue the matter.  It is certainly very unusual for a State not to have an honours system of any kind; offhand I cannot recall a State in that position except ourselves.  On the other hand, one of the reasons for the Government not pursuing the matter &mdash; although I am not certain of this &mdash; may be concern lest in introducing any such system it might be difficult to control it in such a way that honours would be genuinely confined to people of distinction and that the system might be abused.  I suspect fears of that kind may have been inhibiting factors.  However, as I said, I have an open mind on this subject and perhaps it could be considered by the parties.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider it would be helpful if an all party committee of the House considered the matter in view of the fact that many of our citizens are honoured abroad and that we do not have a similar procedure at home?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force is determined from time to time in the light of military requirements and does not differentiate between male and female members.</P>
      <P>Because of the non-combatant role of female personnel, the enlistment of recruits for general service has had to be confined to male personnel in recent times.  The question of recruiting additional female personnel is reviewed periodically in the light of current strengths and commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it that women cadets continue to be accepted into the Army while women recruits are not?  Is the Minister not concerned that there may be an element of discrimination both on the grounds of sex and class in that women cadets continue to be accepted but women recruits are not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is an element of discrimination involved. This year, for example, four female cadets have been appointed out of a total of 44 cadets.  In the event of a decision <Col N="1143" /> being taken in the future to recruit a large number of females, one would have to have an officer corps to receive numbers of other ranks.  That is why we recruit females to the officer corps from time to time.  Their role is non-combatant but they participate in all other activities.  The fact that we appoint female cadets does not mean that they are idle or do not participate in activities.  They fully participate in the activities pursued by male cadets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer is no but, having said that, let me qualify it by saying that this matter is under constant review.  There may be circumstances where recruitment would be envisaged, justified and undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us any reason why there have been no women recruits into the Defence Forces? The Minister spoke of their non-combatant role but many posts within the Army are suitable for both men and women.  The Government have not pursued the Act whereby women were introduced into the Defence Forces.  There has been a complete stoppage of that work.  It is clear discrimination.  Can the Minister tell us how many women were recruited to the Defence Forces within the past four years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, for example, cadets have been appointed for the first time in a number of years.  The fact is that because of the work undertaken by the Army, because of the Army's involvement in aid of the civil power and because of Ireland's involvement in international peacekeeping, the Army <Col N="1144" /> are stretched to meet their full commitments, both at home and abroad.

      <P>My Department purchased an embroidery machine to manufacture cloth badges and insignia for the Defence Forces in December 1985.  Prior to that, these items were bought following the invitation of competitive tenders. <Col N="1148" /> However, because of late deliveries by contractors which caused shortages, the difficulty in obtaining quotations for certain items and military concern for security it was decided to purchase this machine.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the making of cloth badges and insignia for the Defence Forces by military personnel will not seriously affect the employment prospects of any firm.  The volume of work involved is, relatively, not significant.  In the most recent competition for the supply of these badges and insignia tenders were invited from eight known suppliers but only three submitted quotations.  In any event, under the tender system no firm can assume that it will receive a contract even if it was successful in winning contracts in the past.</P>
      <P>My Department will of course, as the central purchasing agency, continue to purchase cloth badges and insignia for other Government Departments on the basis of competitive tendering.</P>

      <P>The question of the remuneration of members of the Government and Ministers of State, as well as the allowances of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, has been referred to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  In their previous reports the review body have taken the level of all benefits available, and the conditions under which <Col N="1151" /> they are paid, into account in assessing remuneration.

      <P>Scéim taithí oibre is ea é, is é sin le rá, a work experience programme.  As to what they are specifically doing, I could indicate without giving exact details that they are getting work experience.  I investigated the training aspect and asked, when I was announcing the scheme for the further 1,000 school leavers, that my officials would brief me on the kind of training these 1,000 school leavers will be getting. I was advised that after intake there would be a short period of induction training at the start, then there would be on-the-job training in which the disciplines of clerical work will be inculcated, including accuracy, punctuality and higher output. Later in the year there will be some formal off-the-job training, but this will not be extensive.  The important thing is to have the trainees learn to do a job by doing it.  Some criticisms were made in the past that they had not a wide enough work experience.  That was a legitimate criticism.  I am anxious we ensure that the future trainees will be given experience of more than one kind of work.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement is that there is, in fact, no job training whatsoever, that they are brought in to a job and told to do the best job that they can and they do the work. I am asking if the Minister is satisfied with the work they are doing.  They are doing a nine to five job for which they are being paid £60 a week.  They are not just trainees.  Is it not true that they are actually doing a job of work and if they are doing a job of work, are they not doing somebody else out of that job?  It <Col N="1156" /> is obvious this is a cheap labour scheme. They are doing a full job of work, learning the experience by doing that work but, nevertheless, only getting £60 a week for it.  Is that not cheap labour?</P>

      <P>I do not accept that assertion at all.  Not one civil servant has been, or will be, displaced by trainees. On the question of what the trainees are doing, I must repeat this is a work experience programme.  I mentioned earlier that there are different formal aspects of training but, as in my former days as a solicitor's apprentice, the best training to be got was on the job.</P>

      <P>In relation to the TCTs, we propose to hold a special competition for those who are left on the first intake.  Already there are 150 who have gone off into full employment, probably helped on considerably by the training they got under this scheme.  We propose to hold a special competition for about 100 of the existing TCTs to enable that number to be brought in on a permanent basis into the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>My question concerns <Col N="1157" /> the number of embargoed posts in the lower grades of the public service.  Has the Minister that figure?  I am interested in the number of posts in the CA and CO grades which are frozen by the present embargo.  This is relevant.  I continue to make the same point Deputy Mac Giolla has made in this House &mdash; that there has been a standstill in the past three years under the embargo on posts in the lower grades of the Civil Service, particularly the clerical assistants' grade. These thousand TCTs are brought in and after a year of the scheme it still appears, from the best information I have received from within the public service and the Civil Service, that there is a substitution of these people in that work to a large degree.  They are not being trained in any respect but are supplementing permanent staff.  Instead of appointing clerical assistants, the Department cutely have obtained cheap labour and now they are firing these people.  Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must refute that. No Civil Service post has been frozen by way of the embargo.  The posts frozen relate to people who have left the service. The suggestion that the Department, or the Civil Service generally, is bringing in cheap labour is most unfair to those 1,000 school leavers who last year applied for participation in this work experience programme.  They knew full well at the time they would obtain a contract for one year and to suggest that they are all being fired is not just unfair to the Government but unfair to the people who are finishing their year's contract in the normal way. There is no question that they are being fired.</P>

      <P>Last year my colleague, Deputy Boland, produced a White Paper setting out Government policy, setting out what he hoped to achieve. It was indicated in the White Paper that this could be a slow operation.  The then Minister also made it clear that any major rationalisation of the grade structure could result in higher costs but that the objective was to reduce costs. Another aspect to be taken into consideration is the fact that in any such discussions staff interests have to be taken into account.  There will have to <Col N="1159" /> be full discussions with the staff.  The Deputy will know enough about the situation to accept that such discussions can be quite long and tedious but there is no question of rushing like a bull at a gate.</P>

There are also various structures, professional and technical structures and the general service departmental structures under review to determine what might be possible.  There are also a number of discussions going on with staff interests. It is not appropriate that I go into those in detail.  We have set down the policy and we are talking about over 700 grades.</P>

We have school leavers now coming on stream who want to apply to be part of this year's intake. As I mentioned, there is no question of throwing them on the dole queue.  A sufficient number of them have already got permanent employment.  Around 100 of them will get jobs in the special competition we are holding for them.

      <P>On previous occasions I have indicated to this House that I believe it is my responsibility as Minister for Labour to ensure that the institutions for industrial relations and the mediation and conciliation process built into those institutions are utilised to the full.  I must point out to the House that in this instance the Cork dispute cannot be seen in isolation from the rest of the country.  Any consequential solution or resolution to the dispute, which is confined locally to the city of Cork, has a national dimension.  I am aware of the current up to date position in Cork.  I assure the Deputy that I share his concern and the concern of all the Deputies from Cork city who have been in touch with me, including the Lord Mayor in a very recent telephone call. My desire is that the talks should resume and that a solution be found.  I believe a solution can be found within the context of the framework that will be acceptable to both sides.</P>

I ask the Minister, in view of the likelihood of an escalation of the dispute, to personally see to it that the action required by him to ensure that that escalation does not occur is taken.  That is the most important aspect of this dispute at this time, taking into account messages the Minister has received from other members of his own party and the fact that the Labour Party Conference could not go ahead.  I am not so concerned about those matters.  I am concerned about the effects of the current strike and its escalation on Cork.  I am asking the Minister personally to ensure that talks are resumed and this dispute is settled.</P>

      <P>I understand and share the Deputy's concern.  During my time as Minister for Labour I sought to ensure that this House did not become embroiled in the conduct of individual industrial disputes.  I appreciate the positive constructive co-operation which I have <Col N="1167" /> received not only from the official spokesman for Fianna Fáil on this matter but from individual Deputies.  The Deputy will, therefore, realise that while I take note of his concern, any indication I might give as to what action I might take could be seen either as weakening or strengthening the hand of one or other of the bodies involved.  If the Deputy will be prepared to accept my bona fides, that I am aware of his personal concern and that he has raised this matter successfully in this House, he can be assured that the resources of the Department of Labour and the institutions under my responsibility will be fully available to both sides to find a satisfactory solution to this problem which is causing a lot of hardship to the citizens of Cork.</P>

    <Title>Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have, for the last two weeks, been asking the Taoiseach when discussion on the Second Stage of this Bill could be resumed.  It was first spoken about in the Seanad, was then referred to in the Dáil in legislation in 1984 and it eventually had a Second Stage debate in 1985.  We are now into November 1986.  As spokesman on environmental matters I have had discussions with interested and concerned groups throughout the summer, particularly those concerned about the plight of the homeless in our cities and towns.  They are very anxious that we pass this legislation without delay so that the plight of the homeless will be recognised in legislation and serious action taken to deal with it.  Consequently I take this opportunity to say that we on this side of the House are prepared to agree to Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very concerned about many sections in this Bill.  However, we on this side of the House will be submitting a series of amendments which will improve this Bill but the key element of this legislation is that it should be passed, that the plight of the homeless receive priority and that the proposals in this Bill, as amended &mdash; I hope the Minister will accept our amendments &mdash; will improve the lot of the homeless in our society. <Col N="1251" /> With that in mind the Fianna Fáil Party will not be submitting any further speakers on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>We will be submitting a series of detailed amendments on Committee Stage which I hope will be taken next week so that this very important legislation will be passed before Christmas. In a Christian community, it is a disgrace that we have so many homeless in our society and we want that situation rectified. In view of the attitude we as a party are taking in this Second Stage debate, I hope the Minister will take an enlightened approach to our amendments because there are hundreds of people in our capital city without homes.  We hope this legislation will help improve that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Opposition spokesman on his comments on the plight of the homeless.  I am sure every Member of this House feels the same way and that we will get the same response from everyone on this side of the House.  This augurs well for what can be done for our homeless.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which has been described, and rightly so, as the new framework which outlines the service the local authorities should give to the following categories: the homeless, the travellers and the aged.  We must give additional powers to our local authorities so that they can house our homeless.  I am very happy to speak today about the homeless and how we should house them. Not very long ago people with three children did not qualify for a local authority house because of the scarcity of houses, but I am delighted that today we are making houses available for married couples with no children.  That makes me very happy.  This is a tribute to the Government for the amount of money they have put into local authority housing over the past four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 refers to the homeless person.  I welcome the statutory provision which encourages local authorities to make provision for the aged, the travellers and the homeless.  Most Members <Col N="1252" /> of this House are also members of local authorities and we must ask ourselves what we have done in our own local councils. In my county we housed 60 itinerant families in 1985 and provided a halting site with provision for 12 caravans. Another halting site is almost completed and it will accommodate 14 caravans. That is an achievement.  It might not be as much as we would like, but it is a start in the right direction.</P>
    <P>We will have to deal with homeless people immediately.  Six years ago there were 300,000 homeless people in America; now there are six million homeless people in the States.  That is a big jump. The law of averages tells us that we too will see an increase in the number of homeless and we must be ready to cater for them.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Senator Ryan who raised this point recently in the Seanad.  He had obviously done his homework.  He had got his knowledge from the report of a long survey.</P>
    <P>While the power of the local authorities to provide housing is broad, in practice the capacity and ability of individual authorities are somewhat hampered because of finance.  Financial constraints will not make it possible for the homeless to obtain the kind of accommodation the local authority would like to provide.  In our desire to accommodate these people, we must not forget the family unit. Article 41 of the Constitution tells us what the family unit means.  In our desire to be generous to the homeless, we must never neglect families with three or four children.</P>
    <P>So far, 1986 has been a good year for house building.  I would like to give some figures for the amount spent on housing in 1986: new house grants £22 million; house improvement grants £24 million; the £5,000 surrender grants £11,750,000; task force for the elderly £2.5 million; local authority construction programme £178,750,000; house purchase and improvement loans £83 million; Housing Finance Agency loans £86 million; local authority housing subsidies £179 million; mortgage subsidy scheme £24 million; and other housing expenditure <Col N="1253" /> £2,831,000.  That is a colossal amount of money at a time when it is difficult to get money.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Department of the Environment on the recent house improvement scheme which has meant a lot to many people who would never have been able to get the money for house repairs.  Prior to this scheme reconstruction grants were not available.  The scheme will cost a lot but it is welcomed by both contractors and tenants.  I hope these grants will continue and that the amount of money at present available for house construction will be increased.</P>
    <P>I have often noted that irrespective of the amount of house building in a county little local employment is given.  I raised this on occasion with Limerick County Council and stressed the advantage local employment would be to many people anxious to work.  It must be frustrating for a worker to have to come every Tuesday to a Garda barracks to sign on for the dole while looking at a scheme of perhaps 40 or 50 houses being built within 300 yards of the station.  Many people will say that direct labour is expensive but they should consider unemployment benefit, PRSI, the amount of money derived from tax and the things that are important to somebody who is willing to work.  Many people are anxious to work and resent having to sign on for the dole. There should be a change in emphasis so that local people will be employed locally on building works.  The same thing applies to the Office of Public Works. They are building a school near me and only one local man is employed on that very big school.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate all concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the Bill is reflected <Col N="1254" /> in the number of interest groups which have over a long period lobbied every Member of this House for its introduction and processing as quickly as practicable.  I welcome the fact that it has been brought back into the House today.  I hope that Committee Stage will be soon and that there will not be the same time restriction on Committee Stage as has been indicated in relation to Second Stage today. I recognise that the 7 o'clock finishing time is probably dictated by the fact that Fianna Fáil have decided not to offer any more speakers on this Stage.  It would be unfortunate if that were to preclude any other Members of the House anxious to speak from getting in.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome in that it attempts to deal with the question of accommodation which has been a serious question for very many people in this State. Various speakers have pointed out that the problem is not a major one when compared with the problem in Great Britain and in the US.  That may be true but the thousands of people without accommodation are not interested very much in statistical comparisons between ourselves and the UK.  I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes but there are aspects with which I am not at all happy.</P>
    <P>Neither am I happy with what I perceive to be a continuing drive by this Government towards effective privatisation of local authority housing.  Virtually all the schemes introduced by this Government in relation to local authority housing have been with the specific aim of transferring house ownership out of the control of the local authority into the control of the occupiers.  I am well aware that those of the private enterprise wing of politics regard the very high home ownership in Ireland as a matter of pride, and that many Tories in Britain are envious that something like 60 to 70 per cent of our housing stock is privately owned. I have no objection to anyone owning his own home.  I own my house in so far as I pay a mortgage on it.  The vast majority of people who say they own their own home mean they have a mortgage and have hocked their lives for 20 to 30 years to a building society, bank, insurance <Col N="1255" /> company or the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
    <P>Home ownership is fine in theory but when the building societies decide to raise their rates one begins to wonder what the benefits are to ordinary people in relation to home ownership.  Clearly the Government benefit as their costs in relation to housing are reduced.  Recent changes in the allocation of funding to local authorities, the introduction of the £5,000 grant and various other measures resulted in the Minister for Finance when he was Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism being able to announce he had been given money from the housing fund to spend on tourism.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs as this Bill will put greater responsibilities on local authorities in relation to certain categories of people for whom, heretofore, they were not directly responsible.</P>
    <P>Any savings made through efficiency or the reallocation of resources and the moving out of tenants from local authority houses to the private market should be ploughed back into the housing stock and the provision of adequate housing for the categories of people with whom we are dealing today.  A major review is being undertaken in Dublin Corporation at present in relation to housing policy. There is a declared intention to wind down the building of local authority accommodation by Dublin Corporation. They will confine the building of houses and flats to within the city boundaries which will have the immediate effect of having the housing output of Dublin Corporation over the next 12 months. I do not want to be unfair to Dublin Corporation because I know they are also bringing other schemes outside the city boundary to tender stage.  If they find there is a sudden upsurge in demand they will be in a position to start building right away in other areas outside the city boundary.</P>
    <P>A policy which urges a cutback in local authority accommodation on the basis of a temporary drop in demand for local authority accommodation while the <Col N="1256" /> House is debating a Bill which will place greater responsibilities on local authorities in relation to the provision of housing is a mistaken one.  Local authorities in particular should move very slowly in cutting back on the provision of accommodation over the next year to 18 months.  I have no doubt the economic situation has played its part in the drop in demand for local authority accommodation in certain parts of the city.</P>
    <P>Emigration has hit certain areas very hard and many young people have left Dublin.  The grant of £5,000 has also had an effect but, as other Deputies made clear, that grant, while it has given many people the opportunity of buying new houses away from the local authority area in which they were living, has also had serious social side effects because it has created social welfare ghettoes.  From statistics provided by Dublin Corporation, it is clear that the people who have availed of the £5,000 grant have been replaced by others, 75 per cent of whom are in receipt of social welfare. That cannot be good for areas such as Tallaght, Darndale, Ballymun, Finglas South and other areas struggling to establish themselves and where unemployment is exceptionally high.  Indeed in these cases the grant of £5,000 is exacerbating the situation and huge proportions of different areas are on the dole.  I welcome the Bill in the sense that it is attempting to deal with homeless single people but I have reservations in regard to the direction the Government are moving in terms of housing policy in general and the way in which funds for housing are used.</P>
    <P>Obviously the new proposals in the Bill provide that local authorities will be responsible for homeless people. However, at least one category of homeless person is not dealt with and for which there is no definition, the battered wife or mother who has to leave her home and in many cases her locality because of violence.  Another point which concerns me is that while most local authorities attempt reasonably well to provide accommodation in so far as they can, there is a wide disparity between priorities <Col N="1257" /> which local authorities establish.  If all local authorities are obliged to deal with homeless single people, there is a need to rationalise the priority schemes which each local authority may have, obviously making allowances for the differences which may exist between urban and rural areas.  There should be a national scheme of priorities which would be applied broadly, allowing for local variations.  I am thinking particularly of the differences which exist in relation to residence qualifications.  In many cases one must be resident in an area for three years before a local authority will accept one on the housing list.  This must be dealt with on a national basis so that there is no question of one local authority restricting their implementation of the spirit of the Bill simply because they have a particular priority or access to housing lists.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to make refers to the question of resources.  While the responsibility of local authorities is being broadened in relation to the categories they must house, there is no indication in the Bill that the local authorities will be compensated in any way for the additional administrative costs which will be involved or for extra staff they will need to deal with the extra workload. That workload may be greater in some areas than others and clearly a Bill like this cannot fix a formula.  There should at least be a commitment from the Minister that local authorities will not have to starve other areas of responsibility in order to fulfil their obligations under this Bill.</P>
    <P>My experience in this area is confined to Dublin but I am sure the same applies to other local authority areas.  Housing officers are obliged, or because of circumstances are obliged, to act as arbiters in cases of marriage breakdown.  Where a marriage has broken down and where either the husband or wife has had to leave the home with or without the children the local authority are faced with the problems of deciding whether it is a genuine breakdown, whether there is the possibility the couple may get back together again and whether new accommodation should be offered to the person <Col N="1258" /> who has had to leave the family home. Dublin Corporation have dealt with any such cases I have brought to their attention in a very humane way.  To some extent their capacity to do so has been facilitated by the fact that a large number of local authority houses in the Dublin city area have become vacant as a result of the £5,000 grant.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen in a year or 18 months time when the slack has been taken up and when the local authority building programme has been wound down, as is the intention and as I am sure is the intention in other urban areas? How are the local authorities to decide on the housing of these unfortunate people whose marriages have broken down?  The same question applies to single homeless persons.  The only reason the corporation have been able to provide accommodation for single homeless persons, both men and women, and for unmarried mothers, with one child in certain circumstances, is because of the availability which is there at present.  However, I would stress that that availability is not going to last forever.  The Minister and the various county and city managers must apply themselves to that question.</P>
    <P>While local authorities may provide halting sites for travellers this Bill does not make it mandatory on them to do so. Every elected representative faces the problems of housing or rehousing travellers and of the provision of adequately serviced halting sites for travellers.  A number of local authorities have done an excellent job in that regard.  I would like to compliment Dublin Corporation for the work they have done in that regard over the years.  Without any mandatory obligation on them to do so they have played their part in settling many hundreds of travellers.</P>
    <P>I would like also to compliment the people of the Finglas area.  Finglas was one of the first areas in Dublin to have a halting site and the people there have assisted in every way possible the settling of travellers in that area.  Because Dublin Corporation and a few other local authorities have taken their responsibilities to heart and made available sites, <Col N="1259" /> chalets and half way houses to travellers many other local authorities have shirked their responsibilities.  Because a neighbouring local authority were dealing with the problem they were happy to let the matter reside there and not provide accommodation which would take the pressure off areas like Dublin and Cork Corporations.  There should be a mandatory obligation on local authorities to provide halting sites and accommodation for travellers under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 20 of the Bill a local authority will be permitted to sell a house that is in poor structural condition.  That strikes me as odd.  Apart from the fact that this will mean a reduction in staff in local authorities it will mean also that people will be buying houses which are not up to standard.  It is odd that local authorities which are duty bound to ensure that accommodation is maintained at a certain standard under this Bill will be allowed to sell accommodation which is of less than a good standard. There is no guarantee that these houses will be brought up to standard subsequently. If the purchaser does not apply for any of the grants which are available he can let the house out in flats, depending on the accommodation they are buying, and so create many more fire traps of the kind which already exist in areas such as Dublin, Cork, Donegal and Galway where private landlords rip off unfortunate tenants who are not able to get on the local authority housing list for one reason or another.  The Minister should tell us why local authorities should be permitted to sell accommodation which is not up to standard, accommodation which they themselves would not accommodate people in.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to take responsibility for housing the homeless in most cases from the health boards but what is to happen when a person moves from one local authority area to another?  At present, a three-year rule is applied by many local authorities.  Will this rule continue to be applied?  Is it intended to introduce a national scheme of priorities which will eliminate those anomalies? <Col N="1260" /> Section 4 gives a legal basis to the £5,000 grant scheme.  This is a grant which is available to a local authority tenant who wishes to buy a house on the private market, not always a new house, but the grant is not payable unless the house is in a habitable condition.  The grant was intended to encourage people to move from the local authority schemes into private ones.</P>
    <P>A number of questions arise from that. In order to reduce the prospect of the ghettoisation I spoke of earlier, will the Minister consider allocating the £5,000 grant to tenants who want to buy the house in which they are living?  When the Minister recently re-introduced the tenant-purchase scheme I wonder why he did not consider it possible to give the £5,000 grant to tenants anxious to purchase under that scheme.  Such a move would have ensured a certain stability in local authority areas, something that is important for a number of districts.  The £5,000 grant has resulted in the hundreds of people who had jobs and had been involved in local community activity moving to other areas.  The Minister should use the grant scheme as a means of overcoming ghettoisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a responsibility to ensure that a local authority, faced with additional expenditure on dwellings left vacant as a result of the operation of the £5,000 grant scheme, particularly in what Dublin Corporation term as low demand areas, are given money to refurbish vacant dwellings.  I understand that 240 flats in the Ballymun area are vacant and cannot be let because of the damage caused by vandals.  Once the flats are vacated vandals get into them and strip them.  The corporation have tenants for those flats but they cannot let them because they do not have the staff or the resources to refurbish them quickly enough.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a matter of concern to the organisations who cater for homeless people, the idea that people are homeless intentionally or that they did not take sufficient steps to provide accommodation for themselves.  People have expressed concern to me about that <Col N="1261" /> aspect of the Bill and it is my intention to table amendments to those provisions. It is not satisfactory to allow local authorities to decide on their definition of homelessness.  It will depend on the number of vacancies they have and is likely to change from time to time, as occurs at present.  If accommodation is available local authorities are more lenient in their definition of homelessness, but if it is not available officials tell applicants they are not responsible for them because they made themselves homeless intentionally by not paying rent or by being evicted for causing a disturbance.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the Bill.  I am very unhappy with the thrust of the Government's housing policy in that I see it is a major move towards privatisation of local authority housing stock.  I welcome the provision in the Bill to deal with the question of single homeless men and women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

      <P>The Bill before the House has a dual purpose.  First, it gives statutory backing to a number of schemes of grant subsidies introduced in recent years.  Secondly, it provides for the establishment of a new statutory framework for the local authority housing programme in order to ensure that it caters adequately for the housing needs of certain people such as the homeless, travellers, the aged, the handicapped and so on.  The £5,000 grant scheme announced by the Government in their programme, <i>Building on Reality</i>, has proved very successful. Many people with more than three years tenancy with a local authority, with the assistance of the Housing Finance Agency, and a grant of £5,000 from the Government can go into the open market and purchase a house of their own.  It is one thing to surrender a local authority house and buy a private house, but the people who benefit most are those who live in local authority flats. That accommodation is very suitable for young married couples but when children arrive more accommodation is needed. Such families may not have the points to qualify for a local authority house and. under the £5,000 grant scheme they can. <Col N="1262" /> with the assistance of the Housing Finance Agency, buy a house of their own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good if it applies to those who are working.  The scheme has reduced for the first time in many years the waiting lists and demand for local authority houses and flats.  Deputy De Rossa gave the impression that accommodation was available now because of an increase in emigration and so on but I suggest that in the Dublin area it is due to the success of the housing programmes of Dublin Corporation in recent years, supported by successive Governments. The corporation have built a substantial number of houses and their programme has meant that accommodation is available for couples who do not have children and for single parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 provides for an annual assessment by a local authority of the housing needs of the area.  Up to now that assessment involved those on the housing waiting list but now local authorities will have to contact voluntary organisations in their areas who are providing accommodation or shelter in order to ascertain the number who are seeking local authority accommodation.  This will bring into their calculations people who are in need of accommodation but have not applied to be housed.  The section also broadens the categories of persons entitled to local authority housing, the homeless, travelling people, persons living in unfit or overcrowded accommodation, the elderly, the disabled or persons in need of housing on medical or compassionate grounds.  Persons who are living in accommodation that is not adequate will also qualify as will those who cannot meet the cost of their accommodation.  I am pleased to note that the Minister has included the latter category, those who are unable to pay.  It is possible to find young couples paying the best part of their weekly income for their accommodation and under the Bill such persons will have to be considered by local authorities. <Col N="1263" /> With the categories expanded under the Bill I am sure there will be greater demand for local authority housing, not the present type of accommodation, but smaller units.  This will allow them also to distribute the annual capital allocation to local authorities with due regard to the different categories of need and the housing demands of a particular area.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the new provisions in the scheme of letting priorities. A housing authority may have reason to believe that an applicant has deliberately depressed his housing conditions in order to improve his prospects of obtaining a local authority house.  In such a case the authority may disregard the present housing conditions for the purpose of determining priority.  For too long there has been abuse in this area.  Applicants on the housing list have left good accommodation to live with relatives in overcrowded conditions so as to enhance their chances of being accommodated on the housing list.  From time to time people also reside in accommodation that would be considered unfit so as to enhance their chance of priority housing at the expense of honest people who take their turn on the waiting list.  In this way I have often seen members of the same family rehoused from the same accommodation using the same method.  The provision in the scheme of letting priorities is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Under section 12 provision is made for the granting of assistance to local authorities for the reconstruction of low-cost and other local authority dwellings which have suffered serious deterioration due to design or construction defects or because of their age.  At this point I must say that low-cost local authority housing was the greatest mistake ever made.  It had only short-term advantages.  In the long term these were some of the most expensive types of houses ever built.  The cost of local authority housing at present is often considered excessive but at the end of the day it will prove to be good value.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of allowing local authorities such as Dublin Corporation to use part of their housing construction allocation for the refurbishing of flats within their housing authority area.  We are approaching the end of our housing programme outside the inner city.  Money could be well spent on refurbishing the existing housing stock, especially flat complexes within the inner city for which there is very high demand.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the section dealing with homelessness.  This Bill is the first Government attempt in the history of the State to define a homeless person.  The Bill places the responsibility for the homeless fairly and squarely with the local authority.  This will end years of avoidance of responsibility and the referral of people from one place to another. The day is over when a local authority could turn their back on the homeless and send them somewhere else.  This represents social progress.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a local authority which has addressed itself to the question of the homeless.  Some years ago we met a deputation from the Simon Community and Dublin Corporation decided to allocate a certain proportion of their housing stock to the homeless.  Unfortunately this has not been the practice with other local authorities.  The Simon Community and other groups have shown tremendous dedication in helping the homeless. Society owes a great debt to the volunteers in the Simon Community and other organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul who have addressed themselves to this problem.  They have made a number of representations to us about their anxieties concerning certain sections of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that the definition of a homeless person is too narrow; a person living in a hostel or a caravan beside the road should be included.  This is a reasonable proposal and I ask the Minister to consider amending section 2.  Secondly, that part of section 2 (2) dealing with intentional homelessness has given rise to a certain degree of anxiety.  I understand that a similar clause in the <Col N="1265" /> 1977 Homeless Persons Act in Britain has had disastrous effects.  Local authorities who are unwilling to house homeless people have simply deemed a large number of people to be intentionally homeless &mdash; up to 50 per cent of applicants in some cases.  Courts have found a wide range of categories of persons to be intentionally homeless, such as women with no children in private rented flats who become pregnant and are then evicted.  They are told they contributed to their homelessness by becoming pregnant. If that is happening in England, it is very sad but it is unlikely to be interpreted in that way in this country.</P>
    <P>I looked at some of the representations made in the court cases in England and Scotland brought under that section of the Act.  In one case a Scottish local authority found in 1979 a pregnant woman intentionally homeless after she had been evicted.  She was told that she was in the situation intentionally due to the fact that she was pregnant and unmarried and had not arranged suitable accommodation in which to live.  I cannot accept that would happen here.  In another case the court of appeal held that a family had left accommodation under threat of eviction but before the eviction took place and due to that fact the family was intentionally homeless.  I think we must expect that people under threat of eviction must be served with a notice of eviction and in some cases the eviction has to take place before they would be regarded as homeless. There have been certain abuses in this area.  The local authorities were kind enough in the past to rehouse people who were under threat of private eviction but unfortunately a lot of these cases were false.  Now local authorities insist that at least notice be served by the sheriff.  All such people are re-housed.  In some cases people have accommodation which is tied to their job.  If such people lose their job, and thus their accommodation, there is an obligation on a local authority to house them.</P>
    <P>Section 10, paragraph 1, also gave rise to a number of representations.  It puts the duty on the local authority to provide accommodation for a homeless person. <Col N="1266" /> This is a person who is regarded by the local authority as homeless and capable of independent living.  There is a fear that the Bill proposes the housing authority should be the judge of whether a homeless person is capable of independent living.  Many feel that this is an extraordinary power of judgment to confer on one person, namely, a housing officer.  It has been stated that some local authority officials are actually hostile to the homeless. I have never come across that.  I have always found housing officers to be very sympathetic to the housing needs of the homeless.  Nevertheless, if there is a doubt in peoples' minds it should be reduced as much as possible.  I fully accept the principle that there should be some kind of assessment of a person's ability to live independently.  This should be a professional assessment carried out by the housing welfare officer who would probably be the best qualified person.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for special accommodation for the handicapped and I welcome this proposal.  Dublin Corporation have always provided a limited number of units for the handicapped in each housing development.  I am glad to see that this is progressing.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as a step in the right direction towards housing the homeless. Deputy De Rossa spoke about the priority scheme, saying that it should be nationalised in some way so that the same scheme would apply to all local authorities. When this Bill becomes law I would like to see the definitions being interpreted in the same way by all local authorities.  A number of amendments will have to be made on Committee Stage.  I look forward to it and I intend to table some amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the urgency of getting this Bill through the House and the many other pieces of major legislation which are waiting in the queue, I shall not take up the time of the House unnecessarily.  Many of the points to which I shall be alluding briefly have already been made in greater depth and at greater length in this and the other House.  As Deputy De Rossa, Deputy <Col N="1267" /> Doyle and I am sure many other Members have said, the important stage of this Bill will be Committee Stage when the House will examine it section by section, dealing with interpretations and wording which may need defining more clearly, or perhaps amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the principle and the underlying objectives of the Bill, like everybody else in this House I welcome the Bill. It is overdue.  I should like to place on record my thanks to and appreciation of the organisations outside this House who have shown tremendous commitment, energy and perseverence in sending in much documentation with regard to the amendments they would like to see, coming from their expertise and experience in this area.  I also appreciate the efforts of the people I have met.  These people are working with a group who, it is very often forgotten, are part of our society.  Part of the problem is that we isolate the homeless.  We certainly marginalise them.  Added to their defeatism and their sheer fears is society's custom of not seeing them as the norm or as part of society.  The homeless are only homeless through accidents and circumstances which could happen to any of us.  There must be an acceptance that homeless people are not abnormal, that they are not outside the boundaries of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent difficulties in our economy and in our society have increased the number of people rendered homeless through no fault of their own.  In general, one of the points made by Sister Stanislaus, who is well known inside and outside this House, regarding the homeless people with whom she and her staff work daily is that we are insensitive to the fact that nobody in our society wishes to be known as or accepted as homeless.  Everybody has come from a home and everybody dearly wishes to be part of a home.  It is one of the most fundamental, emotional securities.  Everybody should be assured of a home.  It is even questionable to use the term &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;.  We thereby put people without housing into a special <Col N="1268" /> category or class.  Then we can ignore them, or blame them for the circumstances in which they find themselves. One of the great lessons I have learned from Sister Stanislaus is that these people do not wish to be marginalised and put into their own category. They wish to be part of the normal interflow of relationships within society.  That people should find themselves without a roof over their heads is bad enough, but that we should add to this and exaggerate it by treating them as less worthy and not part of our society must hurt and isolate them to an extent that we must take very seriously.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that the philosophy underlying this Bill will bring about that awareness in Members of the House and in society as well.  Until we start focusing on this area it will not be apparent how these situations can come about.  Experience shows that homelessness can happen through lack of health, through very young people being forced out of the home, certainly through unemployment and not having the necessary financial income to enable people to make the same choices we all wish to make.  We pride ourselves on having the highest house ownership of any country in Europe, but we do so at a price by regarding people who have not this much prized house ownership as lesser people, not worthy of the same privileges that the rest of us have.  There are many categories of people who fall into this area.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is absolutely fundamental. We must tease out the problems within this forum and ensure that nobody is excluded from being designated as in need of housing because of the narrow interpretation that could be put on section 2.  This has been raised previously but I want to put it on record.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2), a person shall be regarded by a housing authority as being homeless for the purposes of this Act if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) there is no accommodation available which, in the opinion of the authority, he, together with any <Col N="1269" /> other person who normally resides with him or who might reasonably be expected to reside with him, can reasonably occupy or remain in occupation of; or</P>
    <P>We come to a subjective, or even selective, way of deciding who shall be deemed as needing housing and who shall not. This is dangerous and is expecting too much from individuals in authority who have to make that type of decision without clear guidelines and without a full definition of whose opinion, what guidelines, whose standards?</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding subsection (1), a person shall not be regarded as being homeless for the purposes of this Act if the housing authority are of the opinion that he has deliberately or without good and sufficient reason done or failed to do anything (other than an action or omission in good faith) in consequence of which accommodation is not available to him which it would have been, or would be, reasonable for him to occupy.</P>
    <P>This is invidious, certainly for the person who would be seeking to make a case but also for the person who would be expected to make the decision.  The only way to reach a consensus as to the needs of people who are to be housed would be to define that subsection much more clearly.  As of now, section 2 does not include any appeals mechanism and we all know how important such mechanisms are with regard to arbitrary decisions, particularly in the case of those who might be less articulate and less assertive. It is absolutely essential to have an appeals mechanism so that these people can not only make their case but be supported in making it, if necessary.</P>
    <P>There is another definition which needs to be spelled out much more clearly, that is, the application of section 2.  Several speakers have referred to categories of vulnerable persons in our society.  I will put them on the record again.  In the case of single pregnant women, it has been alleged in other jurisdictions that a <Col N="1270" /> woman would deliberately become pregnant in order to make herself available for housing.  That is a very high price to pay in order to get a roof over one's head. The thought of the long term responsibility of bringing a child into the world being used by a single woman to enable her to get housing is a reflection on our society and on the kind of support that we give single pregnant women.  There is an awareness in our society, a greater sense of justice and a less prejudiced attitude to single pregnant women.  It has been brought to my notice that in some housing authorities single women have not alone been treated with scant courtesy with regard to their rights for housing for themselves and their children but where a single woman becomes pregnant a second time it has been suggested by certain local authority officials that one mistake is allowed but a second mistake is not a mistake.  It puts the woman in a category which leaves her less eligible and less justified for housing.  That is appalling.  If we get anything from this Bill it must be the raising of our consciousness and awareness that people should not be punished or social stigmas attached to them because they are in circumstances where they desperately need housing.  They are not considered to be as moral or as good as the rest of the people who apply for housing.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the number of separations in marriages is rising.  Deputy De Rossa was right to point out that not alone do we have separated wives but we also have separated husbands.  With the break-up of the family home there is a crucial and urgent need for rehousing of one or other of the partners.  There is an increasing and more public acknowledgement of the difficult and dire circumstances in which women find themselves as a result of violence.  What housing arrangements are being made for women to enable them to move out from refuges where they have fled from violence? What support is being given and what special conditions are being made for those women who have come through an unbelievably traumatic and damaging time with their children?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> Another category which are very often forgotten about or excluded is older single women.  I am particularly aware of this because of the numbers that I have met down the years.  We are all familiar with the demands made on the single unmarried daughter to stay at home and look after the ageing parents.  We demand that sacrifice from the woman while giving her very little in social welfare contributions and without valuing her work in the home.  We then compound the injury by not allowing her to ensure that she has some independent housing of her own.  The case arises again and again where a woman in her forties or fifties gives up her independent means, her means of social welfare and the possibility of renting or buying a house.  On the death of the parents the family home suddenly becomes the home for all the children.  I have known cases, and I am sure a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that you have known them as well, where the married children who have contributed very little in those later years to the ageing parents of the family home come back and demand that the house be sold.  If there are four children of the family the woman who has given up her life and her chance of having her own house and her own security is left with one-fourth of the price of her home.  There are very little employment prospects for her so she is denied any kind of decent accommodation. If that woman had an opportunity of working, the very low wages she would get would probably not enable her to buy her own house or even get a mortgage.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that in this Bill, as in social welfare Bills, the case of those women who have given so much and do not get the acknowledgement much less the financial security of the housing accommodation that they deserve can be brought forward again.  On section 2 we are discussing the various groups of people who need the kind of housing security that they deserve.  These women should be high on the priority list.</P>
    <P>There are also difficulties with regard <Col N="1272" /> to young persons who are driven from home by conflict or tension within the home.  They get no recognition or understanding as to why they should not return home.  One young woman who applied to the housing authorities and other outlets that might help her when she was homeless and roaming the streets of Dublin was told that her place, at 17 years of age, should be under the family roof. That young woman, sensitive and traumatised already, did not wish to tell officials that she had been forced out of that home through incest.  There are so many reasons why people do not come under the categories that we are talking about.  We should have the sensitivity, the compassion and the understanding to realise that people do not render themselves homeless for the luxury of it or in order to get some kind of second rate accommodation.  Section 2 must be applied with a sense of justice and compassion to the categories and groups that I have spoken about and those which I have not spoken about.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome, as everybody will, the fact that in section 6 of the Bill there is taken into consideration the need for and the engagement of the services of social workers in connection with the accommodation of travellers.  If travellers are to be integrated into the settled community they need all the support, understanding and advice of social workers.  I ask, as would certain groups who are working with other homeless persons in our society, that the support of social workers would be extended to cover other categories such as the elderly, disabled, or persons who are unemployed or just out of prison, who are not yet equipped to deal with the realities that the rest of us have been conditioned to deal with.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that where this type of support is needed we do not confine it just to travellers.  It is to be welcomed for that category but other categories need it desperately too, and if they get that support at the time they need it then probably they can be integrated into society much more easily and independently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> The whole thrust of this Bill and of all the legislation we will be bringing into this House is to enable people to live as independently, fully and in as developed a sense as possible.  Where conditions obtain to harm or damage that kind of independence we should seek by all means possible to give people the support needed and give them the sense of retaining that independence so that they can live the full, non-dependent life that all of us would wish.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill provides that:</P>
    <P>(2)  A scheme under this section shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) provide that the housing authority may determine from time to time, as they see fit, to set aside for persons or such class or classes as the authority may decide, a particular number or proportion of the dwellings...</P>
    <P>This is a matter of wording.  Our language is loaded with all kinds of symbolism and emotionalism, particularly such as this. We should stress that in no way will we be using words, no matter how inadvertently, that might categorise or place again into classes people whom we wish to bring back into society rather than marginalise them.  I am sure the Minister will take cognisance of the fact that it has been suggested a less emotional, less stigmatised phrase such as &ldquo;category of persons&rdquo; might be used instead.  I hope that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will not think I am obsessed with class. However, a great number of our decisions and attitudes are based on certain conditioning we have with regard to the standards people have in this life.  We all realise this is terribly important with regard to our housing.  Some local authority housing has been successful.  Some local authorities are to be congratulated on their vigilance when, in preparing schemes for letting priorities or tenancy allocations they always ensure that people who are without houses or cannot afford to think of independence with regard to housing, as more privileged people can, are not put into any kind of ghetto, segregated or given a lesser <Col N="1274" /> quality with regard to the house itself and also with regard to the environment around it.  Therefore, our housing provision must be about making sure we have mixed housing and that we do not create ghettoes.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa has spoken with regard to section 4 of the Bill and grants. Grants have had a tremendous positive effect and have given opportunities to people to buy their own houses, and such opportunity should be afforded to people who wish for it.  At the same time, we do not wish to segregate into certain areas people who cannot afford to take advantage of that and who will be left in a certain kind of area, causing a deterioration of their well-being and a loss of their sense of pride.  We should not allow that to be perpetuated.</P>
    <P>We have allowed tax relief against mortgage repayments and those of us who are paying mortgages welcome that but if we want a real sense of mixed housing, if we do not want to decide people's status on whether they own a home independently or rent one, surely we should be thinking of some way whereby people who rent accommodation should also be allowed some tax relief.  This is the only equitable way. Otherwise, we will remove from them what would seem to be the privilege of people who can afford tax relief on a mortgage.  In discussing this Housing Bill, we all, from the Minister down are endeavouring to ensure that nobody who needs to be housed will not be.  We must make sure we open up as many housing choices as possible and that in no way should people who are in rented accommodation or in non-ownership be made to feel less privileged or less secure as a result.  People try desperately to pay over a large portion of their lives for the security of feeling that &ldquo;this is my house and nobody can evict me or get rid of me&rdquo; as long as they keep up the repayments of course.  A tremendous motivation for people to sacrifice a great part of their income towards paying for house ownership is not motivated by a great sense of property but by the fact that occupancy of rented accommodation and its maintenance <Col N="1275" /> are not as secure as when the house is one's own.  I know the Minister for the Environment who has brought about so many reforms will look at this.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should look again at the whole area of the security of tenants within their homes, of the landlord not having so much power that people believe they cannot live securely in rented accommodation or in flats.  We all have our horror stories about that.  Certainly I spent many years of my single life moving from flat to flat and meeting many different kinds of behaviour and insecurity while I did so.  A great number of houses seem to come on-stream in different local authority areas and are desperately needed to house people for whom this Bill is intended.</P>
    <P>However, because of the back-up of maintenance work to be done in such houses and perhaps lack of maintenance staff to meet the demand of maintaining and refurbishing those houses, might it be accepted that where tenants or people who wish to be tenants of such houses would not be held up for months on a housing list if through their own efforts they could give an assurance that they would maintain, refurbish or redecorate the houses themselves, perhaps with some grant funding from the local authority? Perhaps we could legislate for this? It would mean that such people could move into the houses much sooner and would give them a sense of working in their own house and of value for that work.  It would also ensure that the backlog of houses in certain local authority areas waiting to be maintained would come on stream much more quickly than at present.  I know people who are desperate for housing, people with energy, youth and expertise on their side, who just want enough grant funding to get them the decorating materials to do the work themselves.  That might be one way of easing the housing queue.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to sections that have been taken up again and again.  We will be coming back to these on Committee Stage.  I refer to the settlement of travellers by way of group housing schemes <Col N="1276" /> or halting sites.  In talking about halting sites we are talking about halting sites with all the facilities of lighting, heating and sanitary conditions so as to ensure that these would be seen as housing in the real sense for travellers who do not wish to live in houses.  The halting sites would be such as to give them that sense of hygiene and wellbeing that we who live in houses feel we are entitled to and are privileged to have.</P>
    <P>I conclude on that note.  We will be coming back to these points on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill and I welcome the fact that the Minister is here to respond at this stage.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware this Bill was introduced by my predecessor, Deputy Kavanagh, Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry.  My reply to the Second Stage debate also affords me my first opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  I should like to thank Deputies who earlier contributed to the debate and to express my appreciation of the welcome the Bill has received from all sides of the House.  A number of helpful and constructive comments and suggestions have been made and I look forward to taking up some of these on Committee Stage so that the Bill can be improved and strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many statements recently regarding the homelessness provisions of the Bill and allegations made to the effect that in the absence of this Bill homeless persons cannot gain access to local authority housing.  I would like to clarify the present position regarding the provision of accommodation by local authorities.  The supply of local authority accommodation relative to demand has never been as favourable thanks to initiatives taken by the Government. Single persons in need of accommodation are now regularly and routinely housed by local authorities.  In many of the recent statements on this issue that fact has not been acknowledged.  That is regrettable. I would like, therefore, to point out to Deputies that in 1985, some 14 per cent <Col N="1277" /> of all allocations made by Dublin Corporation other than those to elderly persons were to single persons without dependents.  This means that over 450 persons were housed by Dublin Corporation last year and already this year over 600 single persons have been provided with accommodation by the corporation. Other major housing authorities are also housing single people in significant numbers, a thing unheard of some years ago.  This has obviously brought about a considerable easing of the problem of adult homelessness and shows that the authorities are very much aware of and responding to the problem of homeless persons.</P>
    <P>When the Government approved the introduction of this Bill the major objective was to secure access of single homeless persons to local authority housing because for many years their needs had tended to be overtaken by the needs of families living in unfit or overcrowded conditions.  Now, in a situation where such a high proportion of allocations by the largest housing authority in the country are to single persons and in the light of the views expressed by Deputies and others I will look carefully at sections 2 and 10 in advance of Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A good deal of recent media comment has concentrated on the problem of homeless children and there appears to be some confusion as to the responsibilities of local authorities and the provisions of the Bill in this area.  This Bill does not deal with homeless children who are and should remain the responsibility of the health boards.  The Bill deals with the responsibility of the housing authorities. The allocation of local authority housing would not be a solution to the problem of homeless children and it would not be appropriate nor is it proposed to provide in the Bill that housing authorities become responsible for the accommodation of homeless children.</P>
    <P>In this connection I welcome the initiative announced yesterday by the Minister for Health to establish a task force to provide an alternative service for homeless boys to replace the HOPE hostel.  The task force which includes a <Col N="1278" /> representative of the Eastern Health Board has been charged with arranging the establishment of an alternative service within one month.  The Minister for Health has also indicated that whatever funding is required for the new service will be made available.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the term, &ldquo;capable of independent living&rdquo;, particularly in the context of section 10 dealing with the statutory obligation on housing authorities to ensure accommodation is made available for homeless persons.  However, I would point out that the <i>ad hoc</i> group on homelessness which reported to the Minister for Health concluded that there were among homeless persons some who for medical and other reasons were not capable of living independently in a dwelling and that such persons should be the responsibility of the health board rather than of the housing authority.  If the requirement that a homeless person be capable of living independently was removed from the Bill local authorities would be statutorily obliged to house all persons who happened to be homeless.  This would include those whose acute needs required in the first instance medical or psychiatric attention and not housing accommodation and who the working group concluded should be the responsibility of the health boards. Deputies will, I believe, recognise that the imposition of a statutory obligation on local authorities to house individuals must be limited to those whose needs is for housing and not primarily for specialist care and attention.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the requirement of being capable of living independently in a dwelling does not apply exclusively to homeless persons as has frequently been asserted.  If this was the case I accept it would be invidious; the requirement, however, also applies under section 9 in relation to all applicants for local authority housing.  This matter was referred to particularly this afternoon by Deputies Doyle and Barnes, and I intend to give consideration to the wording of both sections 2 and 10. In relation to the remarks the Deputies addressed to the question of allowing the <Col N="1279" /> decision as to the definition of &ldquo;capable of independent living&rdquo; to be left to local housing officers, it is my intention that the guidelines to be issued under the Act would require housing officers to consult with the relevant medical and social personnel on the difficult decision regarding the capacity or otherwise for independent living.  The framework for that procedure has already been drafted by a working party representative of my Department, the Department of Health, the health boards and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa suggested that the definition of the homeless person in section 2 should not include battered wives.  However, I would like to point out that where a person cannot occupy their accommodation due to violence, they would be covered by the definition in so far as they &ldquo;cannot reasonably occupy or remain in occupation of&rdquo; their accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa also queried the procedure being provided in section 20 which would allow local authorities to sell houses without, in certain cases, carrying out what would be regarded as the normal pre-sale structural repairs.  That was in contrast with the point being made by Deputy Barnes that in certain circumstances local authority accommodation should be let to people on the local authority waiting list in advance of necessary repairs being carried out, to allow them to do the repairs themselves and to have an interest in their tenancy.</P>
    <P>What is intended in section 20 is that, in cases such as those I have outlined, the sale would be carried out only with the consent of the tenant purchaser and the sale price of the house would be adjusted to take account of the fact that structural or other repairs were needed.  This would mean that potential tenant purchasers who had the capacity to carry out a certain amount of the repair work themselves would benefit through having the home offered at a reduced price.  It is intended that that provision will be carried out on a trial basis.  It is thought this may have particular reference, for <Col N="1280" /> example, in the sale of isolated rural cottages.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide a new framework for the provision, management and letting of local authority dwellings and I note the welcome given by Deputies to the provisions relating to schemes of letting priorities.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill will require local authorities to undertake an annual assessment of the need for the provision of accommodation for various categories and section 11 will require local authorities to adopt schemes of letting priorities in accordance with the needs identified at the assessment under section 9.  The assessment must have regard to the needs of the homeless and of travellers. It is my intention that within the revised framework created by the Bill all local authorities will have a systematic and formal approach to approving applicants for housing and that this will be updated on a regular basis.  In this way local authorities will be aware of the level of categories of needs within their areas and will be required to provide and let dwellings accordingly.</P>
    <P>The 5,000 surrender grant for local authority tenants and tenant purchasers has proved highly successful since its introduction in October 1984.  In 1985, 5,373 applications were received under the scheme; 1,950 payments were made at a total cost of £9.75 million.  This year I expect that some 3,800 applications will be received and about 3,600 payments made.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the scheme be extended to cover members of the Garda Síochána and to elderly owner-occupiers of private houses who might wish to surrender their houses in exchange for being allowed to rent a senior citizen local authority dwelling. Regrettably, I cannot accept these suggestions.</P>
    <P>The £5,000 grant was extended to lower ranking members of the Permanent Defence Forces primarily because substantial numbers of these personnel require housing by the local authorities. An important consideration is that the pay and conditions of the Permanent <Col N="1281" /> Defence Forces personnel eligible for the grant are generally less favourable than those of the gardaí.  While I appreciate the motive behind the suggestion that this grant be extended to elderly owner-occupiers, this does raise serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>The available stock of specialised local authority housing for the elderly is limited and it has been my Department's policy to conserve the stock by, for example, excluding such dwellings from sale schemes.  However, further consideration will, I believe, need to be given to the problem of elderly owner-occupiers who are unable to maintain their existing private houses and it is possible that local authorities may need to develop a role in this area.  I must point out that already it is open to local authorities to purchase private dwellings and, indeed, I have been encouraging them to do so, with very limited success so far.  Local authorities may, therefore, where they consider it appropriate, acquire a private house from an elderly person.</P>
    <P>The type of housing needs is changing and this is an area where we will have to review our housing policy and local authorities will have to carry out some fundamental re-assessments of their medium and long term housing needs. I know one major local authority has already identified that area.  Due to trends forecast by some of the relevant agencies, it now appears that there will be a fundamental change in the composition of local authority housing lists in the medium and long term, and that an increasing number as a proportion of the entire housing list will consist of elderly or old people.  That will require a major revision on the part of local authorities and central Government in deciding on the mix and type of dwelling to be provided in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no gainsay of the fact that in recent years tremendous strides have been made in the provision of local authority housing generally.  As I mentioned some time ago, at one time it was said regularly that we had a housing crisis but we now have adequate housing for those in need.  This is an ongoing matter which <Col N="1282" /> is dealt with by the local authorities.  In no way can the present position be described by any reasonable person as a crisis.  In fact, in most local authorities housing does not represent a problem with a capital P.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to reflect that at the end of 1985 the figure on the housing list for the Twenty-six Counties was 22,000 applicants which compares very favourably with the figure for one inner London borough of 26,000 applicants.  That has been achieved through a combination of factors &mdash; the continuing high output of high quality local authority houses by the Government over a number of years, the introduction of the £5,000 grant scheme, the introduction of the Housing Finance Agency loan &mdash; and lately the restructuring of the Housing Finance Agency loan &mdash; the increase in the income limit for SDA loans, the increase in the amount which can be borrowed under the SDA system and the introduction of a third type of loan.  This means that many of those purchasers who might otherwise be on local authority waiting lists or purchasers who are vacating local authority houses now have the opportunity to opt for one of three different types of loan &mdash; the traditional annuity type loan under the SDA scheme, increased to a limit of £25,000 in loan size and an income limit of £10,000; loans under the Housing Finance Agency of either £21,000 or £27,000; or, under the Housing Finance Agency system, a loan which is income related in the first five years and which is convertible to annuity after the first five years of operation.  The combination of these incentives has meant that the target of making 9,000 dwellings annually available for letting, which was assessed in the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> as being a target which should be striven for in order adequately to meet housing needs, has been exceeded comfortably in the last few years.  Through a combination of the high output of new local authority dwellings completed and the impact of the £5,000 scheme, last year there were 11,500 dwellings made available for letting <Col N="1283" /> by the local authority which was considerably in excess of the target.  The indications are that for this year we will again comfortably exceed the target set out in the national plan.</P>
    <P>It has been a very commendable record of achievement for the Government that local authority housing has been virtually revolutionised.  Figures were reported in the national newspapers recently which suggested that the total waiting list for Dublin Corporation housing was 3,500. The corporation has in one form or another in the Dublin area 2,900 vacant dwelling units.  Of those on the corporation waiting list some 40 per cent have turned down accommodation at least once and in some cases two or three times because they were waiting for the construction of a Dublin Corporation estate in an area with which the applicant had connections or in an area near their work.  That is an extraordinary turnabout in the housing situation.  When I first became involved in politics almost 20 years ago the provision of adequate housing was the question in the minds of most public representatives, certainly at local level.  None of us could have foreseen circumstances in which the housing lists would be diminished and the demand would have been successfully met as it has been in the last two or three years.</P>
    <P>This afternoon Deputy De Rossa suggested that the £5,000 grant should be paid to tenant purchasers to enable them to buy their existing homes.  That suggestion shows a lack of appreciation of the basis upon which that scheme was introduced. If a local authority tenant purchases a private home and in turn gets the benefit of the £5,000 grant and if purchasing a new house also gets the benefit of a new house grant, the unit he vacates becomes available to the local authority for reletting.  If the grant were paid to the tenant to assist him in purchasing the local authority dwelling then the unit would not be freed for reletting. The remissions and grants available under the tenant purchase scheme should be borne in mind.  In many instances a person opting to purchase a new home <Col N="1284" /> would get the equivalent of the grant of £5,000 off the value of the house.  The tenant is entitled to a 3 per cent reduction in price for each year of tenancy up to 10 years so that in certain cases where a tenant has occupied the house for 10 years he can enjoy a maximum reduction of 30 per cent.  In addition, there is a discount of £2,000 off the purchase price of the house, that being the equivalent of the new house grant.  There is a discount also in relation to any rates which might have been paid on the house had it been occupied prior to 1977.  In the new scheme which I introduced some months ago I allowed tenants the option to have the gross price of the house before discounts assessed at either the market value of the house or the original all-in cost of the house updated, with the option for the tenant to accept the price most favourable to him.  A tenant purchaser now opting to purchase his home under the new tenant purchase scheme has the assistance of the Government in a reduction of many thousands of pounds. In the majority of cases tenant purchasers get discounts and grants amounting to more than £5,000.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with the mortgage subsidy scheme which will be phased out over the next five years with the replacement of the scheme by the new £2,250 new house grant.  It has been suggested that recent trends in interest rates undermine the case for the phasing out of the mortgage subsidy scheme.  I do not accept that.  Trends in interest rates are temporary.  Events of the last day or two have served to validate that contention. At any rate, even the most pessimistic commentator does not suggest that mortgage interest rates are likely ever to approach the unsustainably high level of 16¼ per cent which they reached in 1981 when the mortgage subsidy scheme was introduced.  Recent increases resulting from unsustainably high interest rates, given that inflation is now at 3 per cent, are of a temporary nature and will not hold over any reasonable period.  The problem of borrowers who are experiencing difficulty with their loan repayments under the SDA scheme is one to <Col N="1285" /> which local authorities generally should adopt a sympathetic approach.  Normally a mutually satisfactory arrangement can be devised to resolve problems.  County managers are expected to use considerable discretion in dealing with cases of arrears.  It would be wrong of the Department to suggest that there is one right way to deal with all of these cases. This difficulty is a good example of a situation where local knowledge and judgment exercised by the housing authorities are most likely to obtain a satisfactory result.</P>
    <P>Deputies, including Deputy Barnes in the last 15 minutes, referred to poor planning and design of local authority housing schemes and to the need for improvements in existing local authority housing stock.  In 1982, my Department issued a very comprehensive memorandum to housing authorities setting out standards of planning and design for local authority housing schemes.  In recent years there has been improvement generally in the standard of layout and design of local authority housing estates.  We have moved away from the rather stark military lines of houses without a focal point, or adequate provision for community recreational or other facilities.</P>
    <P>The requirements of the Department expect local authorities to have schools, churches, health services and other facilities within a reasonable distance of new housing schemes.  Where playgrounds or open spaces are not already available in reasonable proximity, provision must be made for them in the scheme.  In the national plan to which I referred a section was included which introduced a major new scheme to enable local authorities to come to grips with the problem of some of their older local authority houses and what were known as low cost housing schemes.  Under the new scheme councils can obtain a subsidy of up to 80 per cent for necessary works to those houses.  So far, 30 schemes suggested by local authorities have been approved by my Department for remedial work.  I want to assure Deputies it is my intention to <Col N="1286" /> increase investment in this type of work over the coming years.</P>
    <P>In relation to my remarks earlier regarding the satisfactory meeting of the needs of those on national housing waiting lists, we must look carefully at the question of the older stock of local authority dwelling units, houses or flats.  In that regard, I have been anxious for some time that Dublin Corporation, who have a very high number of flats as part of their housing stock, should look more actively at the question of refurbishing and redesigning quite a number of those flat blocks.  I am not sure if it was advisable for the corporation &mdash; I am not saying this in a critical way &mdash; to continue to build at the rate they did, with the agreement of the Department, new housing in green fields on the outskirts of the city up to very recently while, at the same time, they have quite a number of flats in inner city locations which fail to live up to what I and most people regard as an adequate standard in relation to sanitary and other facilities.  There is a need to look at a major redirection as to whether it is better to consider concentrating a large part of the resources of housing capital towards lifting the standard of older local authority dwellings which were provided initially without basic facilities or which, because of their construction, have become fairly run down and require major works of a remedial nature.</P>
    <P>We have sanctioned 30 remedial works schemes around the country and a further 18 schemes are before us at present.  The carrying out of those major remedial works in estates will increasingly occupy the housing section of my Department in the coming years.  Because of the success of meeting the housing demand by many local authorities, they should now look at their existing stock especially in relation to the major authorities in urban areas, many of whom have an older stock of flats.  They should pay particular attention to seeing what can be done in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes also spoke about the need to have a proper mix of houses to ensure that the provision of new local authority housing does not merely result <Col N="1287" /> in the creation of different types of ghettoes. The Deputy was also very concerned regarding the use of words or titles which she suggested might stigmatise certain areas.  We all know to what the Deputy is referring and perhaps in the past, in the enthusiasm of trying to meet genuine housing needs, sufficient attention was not always given to the need to blend different types of housing and to ensure it was done in conjunction with the provision of all the facilities which are needed to create proper new communities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes mentioned two other areas which are not the responsibility of my Department, one in relation to the question of security of tenants in their relationships with the owner of the dwelling. That area is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and the question of tenancies arise in regard to my Department only in relation to tenancies of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>Comments were also made regarding the housing needs of the elderly.  While the provision of dwellings for the elderly has been fundamental to the local authority housing programme for a number of years &mdash; one and two bedroomed dwellings have become an increasing feature of new housing estates to the extent that over 10,000 have been provided since 1972 &mdash; it is relevant to realise that because of demographic changes it will be necessary to consider the needs of the elderly to an increasing degree in the years ahead.  In addition to the new dwelling units provided for the elderly, assistance is also provided through the essential repairs grant scheme and the special task force on housing for the elderly.  The essential repairs grant helps to prolong the useful life of dwellings in rural areas and the task force gives grant aid for necessary work to houses owned by elderly people throughout the country.  The essential repairs grant scheme lets many elderly people in rural areas to remain in their homes instead of having to move to new local authority houses, perhaps quite a distance away.  The task force on housing <Col N="1288" /> aid for the elderly, which is funded by my Department, is operated by the regional health boards and ensures that those who have day-to-day contact with the elderly, especially the public health and welfare staff, can see that necessary repairs are carried out to houses occupied by elderly people.  That arrangement has proved to be very satisfactory and the scheme has been tremendously successful in improving the living accommodation of many elderly people in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Local authorities also provide housing for the disabled as an integral part of their housing programme.  They have been encouraged to provide special dwelling units to meet the needs of the disabled.  The guidelines of the National Rehabilitation Board published in 1981 set out particular standards of design of housing for the disabled and were circulated by my Department to county councils requesting them to have regard to the recommendations of the board.</P>
    <P>As part of the house improvements grant package announced a year ago, I am pleased that the recoupment by my Department in respect of grants for disabled persons was increased to £2,500 which means that local authorities can make grants of up to £5,000 available to build on an extra room or to undertake necessary work to make a house more suitable for a disabled person.</P>
    <P>A number of very important points were made by Deputies and many comments and submissions have been made by various interested groups since this Bill was published.  The Bill sets out to meet a number of particular, not necessarily conflicting or competing, objectives. It is the first major housing Bill introduced since the Housing Act, 1966.  As such, it behoves the Government to examine the various aspects of responsibility and to charter a course for the future with regard to the responsibilities of housing authorities.  To some extent, some of the comments that have been made with regard to the provisions of the Bill have been made by groups who have a particular concern for a particular <Col N="1289" /> sector who are in need of housing accommodation. We must ensure that the statutory conditions lay down the ground rules in such a way that housing authorities can, in equity and in practice, provide adequately for the housing needs of those who are not in a position to house themselves. Deputies expressed a degree of over-apprehension about the safeguard provisions which have been included in the Bill.  If a Bill were being introduced to provide specifically and exclusively for the housing needs of particular sectors or groups it might not be identical to some of the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to up-date the 1966 legislation and to provide a charter for housing authorities.  In doing so, it has to recognise the problems which have to be tackled and solved.  It also has to recognise the pragmatics of the situation facing individual housing authorities.  For example, problems which may be more relevant and more likely to occur in urban areas must be provided for within the statute but in such a way as not to put unnecessary demands upon essentially rural housing authorities.  What caused a degree of concern in certain areas, unnecessarily I hope, is that the Bill set out to ensure that a statutory obligation be put upon housing authorities to provide adequate housing accommodation for those who cannot house themselves. At the same time, it was recognised that irrespective of whatever scheme is introduced there will always be a certain number of people who will identify clearly the composition of the scheme and its restrictions and who will then set out as carefully as they can &mdash; often with a surprising degree of ingenuity &mdash; to devise ways to get around the restrictions and take themselves to the top of the list for that particular sevice.</P>
    <P>The statute and the operation of the provisions have to be designed in such a way to ensure that not only is there an attempt made to provide for equity but that safeguards are introduced so that individuals cannot set out successfully to upset the intention of the statute in a way which benefits themselves, and in a way which was not intended, perhaps to the <Col N="1290" /> detriment of other more deserving cases. Endeavouring to meet those competing objectives is a difficulty which always faces those who prepare complex, far-reaching and important legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the submissions which have been made by the various groups, mainly voluntary bodies, in connection with this Bill and the points made by Deputies.  I have experienced a slight difficulty in that I did not introduce the Bill.  Therefore, this is a Bill which I have not lived with from its inception.  This debate is particularly useful to me in that I can evaluate the points made by Deputies and I can reflect upon the perspicacity or otherwise of those who decided to reserve their comments so that they may fall upon us like rays of enlightenment at a later stage. This debate also gives me the opportunity to examine the submissions which have been made by the various groups in the light of the discussion which has taken place in the House today and earlier and to see in what way on Committee Stage either we can improve or strengthen the provisions of the Bill or merely in certain cases clarify for people some of the provisions about which they are unnecessarily apprehensive.</P>
    <P>The Bill is primarily one which will usefully be teased out on Committee Stage.  I look forward to the debate and to an indication of this new school of thought on housing which is apparently being prepared by the Opposition.  From time to time one comes across Bills where a political party will say that the debate can be more usefully expanded upon on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is rather unusual to discover the Opposition indicating that they are so anxious to have a Bill debated that they are not going to participate in the debate at this stage so as to allow the debate to expand at a later stage.  That is intriguing my mind and I wait with eager anticipation to see how the Opposition will endeavour to help us improve and enact the Bill.</P>

As I explained earlier, we are very anxious that we should proceed as soon as possible to Committee Stage and get down to debating the nitty-gritty of the Bill.  The Minister appears to have some difficulty in understanding that strategy but we are responding to a request from those who are deeply involved in this area, particularly those representing the homeless, in adopting this approach.  The Bill was introduced in 1985 and we want to move to the Committee Stage debate as soon as possible.  That might have happened today had the Minister not gone on for almost 45 minutes.</P>

      <P>Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Aire agus é á rá go mba mhaith leis cúnamh a fháil ón taobh seo den Teach. Níos luaithe rinne sé tagairt don ghá a bhí le hairgead a chaitheamh ar thithe a choimeád in ord seachas tithe nua a thógáil agus tagaim go hiomlán leis sa mhéid sin agus cuirim i gcuimhne dó, ag Bardas Átha Cliath le déanaí, gur ritheadh rún a mhol mé féin go gcuirfimis in iúl don Aire go mbeadh roinnt mhaith airgid ag teastáil uainn díreach chun an gnó sin a dhéanamh.  Agus tá súil agam, nuair a thiocfaidh an t-eolas sin os comhair na Roinne go mbeidh an tAire in ann a rá leis na Státseirbhísigh ansin go dtagann sé go hiomlán agus go ndúirt sé sa Teach go raibh gá mór leis an bpolasaí seo a chur i ngníomh, an t-airgead atá de dhíth ar Bhardas Atha Cliath a chur chucu <Col N="1294" /> ionas gur féidir leo cabhrú leis san obair atá idir lámha aige.</P>
      <P>Níos luaithe rinne sé tagairt don phointe atá sroichte againn sa chathair anois, go bhfuil tithe ann agus nach bhfuil daoine againn le cur iontu.  Tarlaíonn sé sin, mar a tharla sé i 1957 cheana féin &mdash; na daoine a mba cheart dóibh a bheith ag dul isteach sna tithe sin tá siad imithe thar sáile, daoine óga go mba cheart dóibh a bheith ag dul ag pósadh, go mba cheart dóibh a bheith ag iarraidh tithe sa chathair, níl siad anseo.  Agus mar a dúirt mé, mar a tharla i 1957 nuair a bhí Rialtas den chineál céanna is atá againn anois i gcumhacht, tá tithe sa chathair seo anois nach bhfuil daoine ann lena gcur iontu.  Tuigim go raibh an tAire, agus é a rá go raibh cúrsaí tithíochta go maith, go raibh sé ag tabhairt moladh do Bhardas Átha Cliath. Dá bhrí sin, ní féidir liomsa a dhéanamh amach ó thalamh an domhain cén fáth gur chuir sé an Bille nua seo os ár gcomhair, is é sin an Bille go ndearna mé tagairt dó an lá faoi dheireadh &mdash; Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  Tarlaíonn sé go raibh plean socraithe cheana féin ag an mbardas chun an obair seo a dhéanamh. Tharla sé go raibh tosnaithe againn féin ar an obair agus gur theastaigh uaínn bualadh ar aghaidh leis ach amháin nach raibh an t-airgead le fáil againn.  Tuigfidh an tAire gur ghearr sé siar airgead na bliana seo orainn.  Tarlaíonn sé anois go bhfuil an tAire ag caitheamh drochmheasa ar Bhardas Bhaile Átha Cliath mar nach bhfuil sé ag tabhairt cead dóibh na dualgais atá orthu a chomhlíonadh agus bualadh ar aghaidh leis an bplean a bhí socraithe acu chun feabhas a chur ar na sráideanna seo.</P>
    </Speaker>

Dúirt mé anseo agus dúirt mé i chuile aird na cathrach go bhfuil sé ag tabhairt mhasla freisin do mhuintir na cathrach mar is iad muintir na cathrach a thogh na daoine seo chun an obair seo a dhéanamh.  Agus tá an tAire tar éis a shocrú go gcuirfear <Col N="1295" /> daoine isteach, daoine nach bhfuil ceapaithe ag muintir na cathrach agus, ní fheadair mé féin an bhfuil siad chomh cáilithe le comhairleoirí na cathrach chun an obair seo a dhéanamh.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé dhéanamh sa lá anois chun iarraidh air, ach measaim féin tar éis dó machnamh a dhéanamh air seo go dtuigfidh sé féin nach raibh gá leis an mBille seo, go bhfuil sé ag cur am an Tí seo amú a bheith ag plé leis, mar thuigfinn, dá mba rud é go raibh comhairleoirí na cathrach ag déanamh faillí ina gcuid oibre, go mbeadh iachall ar Aire ar bith obair a cheap sé a bheith riachtanach a dhéanamh.  Ach ní shin mar atá, mar a dúradh agus muid ar scoil agus buachaill amháin ag &ldquo;cogáil&rdquo; ó fhear eile.  Is &ldquo;cog&rdquo; díreach é seo ón bplean a bhí socraithe cheana féin ag Bardas Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>That would force me to direct a question to the Minister in respect of this great plan he would have people accept at his presentation to the city of Dublin, arising from what, understandably, he would regard as the failure of the members of the corporation to do this work, which it would be incumbent on them to do.  It appears that he is making available £10 million.  Section 12 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2) of this section, the Minister may, in each financial year, after consultation with the Commission in relation to its programme of expenditure for the year, make grants of such amounts as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas towards the expenditure of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (2) states that the total amounts of grants paid to the commission under this section shall not exceed £10 million.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation shall, in lieu of expenses that would otherwise have been incurred by them in the Metropolitan Central Area, contribute annually to the Commission such sums of money as shall be agreed with the <Col N="1296" /> Commission or, in the event of disagreement, as shall be determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister expects that he should get compliments and kudos from the people of Dublin for making £10 million available for improvements which were already regarded as necessary by Dublin Corporation.  They sought the money from him but he did not make it available. Now he proposes to establish a commission which will carry out this work and he will then send the bill to Dublin Corporation.  That is my interpretation and any person who has any facility for interpretating anything will have to agree.</P>
    <P>I am obliged to ask again what it is all in aid of.  What justification is there for the Minister for local government &mdash; I use that former title because of the affront that has been offered to local government by the Minister &mdash; to establish a commission to carry out a plan already prepared by the corporation and then to charge the corporation for doing it?  We must visualise the disruption which will occur, even in respect of personnel. One of the backbenchers said last week that the personnel of Dublin Corporation would be on loan to this agency but would be paid by the corporation. The Minister has said in his not untypically dictatorial way that if there is disagreement between the commission and the corporation the matter will be determined by him.  If Dublin Corporation do not pay up, he will insist on their doing so.</P>
    <P>When I was endeavouring to teach students in school I told them all the time to feel free to ask in respect of any proposition I put to them, &ldquo;what is it in aid of, Mr. Tunney?&rdquo; I would put that same question to the Minister.  We find ourselves in a new situation in Dublin Corporation since it can be regarded as a Fianna Fáil corporation.  The plan was already there but the Minister in his inimitable style is making it appear that whatever fruits come to the city arising from the plan come through him or his Minister of State, rather than the people who <Col N="1297" /> through concern and interest had already prepared the plan.  There would be some justification for it if he were to play Santa Claus and give a separate £10 million.  He is not doing so.  He is protecting himself in respect of every penny that will be spent by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have limited resources at present, bearing in mind that the Minister last year made them endure a cutback of £6 million.  How are we in Dublin Corporation to manage our estimates if we know that in respect of certain operations in the city the Minister of the day can demand a certain payment?  This is the worst attempt I have encountered at putting another stratum of bureaucracy on top of the existing layers.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the lack of faith as expressed by Professor John Kelly last week, followed and ably assisted by Professor Shatter, that other great exponent of local democracy.  They castigated Dublin Corporation because of the sins of the corporation in respect of certain developments in the city.  I should like to remind Deputy Kelly that during the period when he was Minister and Attorney General, Dublin Corporation resisted a proposition that led to the construction of the most ugly and inappropriate building in this city in the heart of Deputy Kelly's area in Donnybrook, close to where he lives.  Dublin Corporation resisted it every inch of the way but the Minister of the day, James Tully overrode the corporation and gave his permission for the construction of that building.  It has remained there ever since, a monster. The monument to Ozymandias is nothing compared with the monstrous building opposed and resisted by the elected members of Dublin Corporation and which was imposed on the city by the Government of which Deputy Professor John Kelly is a member &mdash; the man who, in the words of his own student, is &ldquo;always good for a laugh&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, the Deputy will have an opportunity to expand on that. That great upholder of everything that is professional and right, Deputy Shatter, castigated Dublin Corporation for the civic offices.  I am not saying that those buildings satisfy what I regard as appropriate in the matter of architecture and of suitability for that site, but I would remind Deputy Shatter that if he wants to attack Dublin Corporation, the majority position in the corporation at the time of that approval was with the Coalition groups.  If he is disposed to attack the building, he can direct his attention in the first place to them.  He can also direct it against professional people who sat in judgment on the plans and decided that, in their opinion, these were the buildings that were most worthy of the prize which was offered at the time.  A small point that I make is that if he is going to castigate Dublin Corporation he should bear in mind that he is castigating his own party and his colleagues in the Labour Party who controlled the corporation at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, he is castigating not just the elected people but rather the professional people to whom we are inclined far too often to bow in the matter of legal and architectural matters.  At any time, in respect of what is suitable, I would match the considered view of any layman and <Col N="1299" /> accept his opinion of what is suitable, what is in harmony, what helps and is easy on the eye.  I would always be prepared to listen to him.  However, people in professions, whether legal or architectural, seem to think that they have a monopoly and are not always anxious to listen to the person whom they would describe as the ordinary person or the layman.</P>
    <P>I must not allow either of the two Deputies in question to divert me from the main thrust of what I would wish to say, which is the direct and indirect insult which is contained here in respect of elected representatives.  Even if there were only one Fianna Fáil member on the corporation it would make no difference to me.  They are the people elected by the citizens of Dublin in accordance with existing legislation which requires of those elected persons to carry out certain functions.  It annoys me very much and it is an affront to that system that any Minister from whatever Government would come in here and endeavour to impose upon us this fraud. That is what it is.  I must be careful about superlatives, but this is one of the greatest con jobs that I have seen coming before this House.  I shall be listening carefully to the Minister's reply for one reason for his thinking it was necessary for him to establish this commission following the election of so many members of the Fianna Fáil Party to Dublin Corporation. If he was so conscious of the needs of our city in this regard, why did he not do that prior to the election of 1985?</P>
    <P>In respect of the key section which refers to money which has not been made available to Dublin Corporation in the fashion which has prevailed for some years past, where the corporation are being cut back in practically everything for which they require money, I would ask the Minister to pay special attention to my question in respect of section 12 and to indicate whether I am astray in assuming that he will spend Dublin Corporation's money and expect credit for so doing. Otherwise, how can he justify the protection he is giving himself in that section?  This is even to the extent where <Col N="1300" /> he is not prepared to have faith in his commission.  They would get money to which they would feel they were entitled, but according to subsection (iii) &ldquo;in the event of disagreement, as shall be determined by the Minister&rdquo;.  That is the Government that promised us that they would be the Government of consultation and communication, that promised that when they took over they would be conscious all the time of <i>vox populi,</i> that they would keep close to the people and whatever the people wanted the people would have.  Surely, in defence to that expression of concern for the community and local government, they must have respect for the elected representatives? Whether the people, in their wisdom or otherwise, have returned 25 or 24 Fianna Fáil members should not make any difference.</P>
    <P>Dublin city is in urgent need of all the attention that we can give it.  I do not want to repeat what I said on the last occasion, but we know its position in respect of the country, the position of the capital of any country.  Springing from it is everything of importance.  Those in rural areas, although they would have the same approach towards the metropolis as people in rural parts of every country &mdash; I know from speaking to them &mdash; realise that Dublin as the capital city is of great importance to them.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need of expenditure of maximum amounts so that we can bring our pavements and streets up to standards which are in accordance with the wishes of the people, so that we can influence people who under the Planning Act as it operates have been guilty of great sins of omission and great sins of execution in respect of what they have provided for us in our main streets.  When I was Lord Mayor, Dublin Corporation approached the good people of Henry Street and Mary Street and the traders there and with the help of professional people we encouraged and succeeded in getting them to change some of the appalling frontages on their premises, so that they would be more in character with this great city.</P>
    <P>We had the capacity and had plans for <Col N="1301" /> doing the same with regard to O'Connell Street and every other street, because we must remember that it is not just the main streets that are important.  The main sinews may have an importance which is superior to that of a lesser street but I am as much concerned about retaining the character of Foster Place or any of the other smaller streets.  However, naturally we are concerned with the main streets. Elected members of Dublin Corporation, together with the manager, had the capacity and interest to do this and now we are being thwarted by the Minister who has introduced this Bill which almost guarantees a delay of three years. Moneys which normally should be available to the corporation will now be directed by this commission.</P>

      <P>When speaking in the House last week about another matter that was put forward by the same Minister in relation to the building societies I said that there are talkers and doers. This Minister seems to fall very definitely into the latter category.  This is another small example of doing something in order to get things moving in the city, something simple and cheap.  It is very easy to do nothing, which is mostly what is done.  It is also safest to do nothing.  If Ministers do nothing they are not likely to make a mistake and to be blamed. They are not likely to fulfil their mandate but are likely to last for the duration of their term in office and qualify for a pension.  If a Minister adopts that attitude the people and everything around him will suffer depending on the portfolio held by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> This Bill has a very simple and desirable objective.  Yet we found cause to complain about it and to deny it coming into the House before the summer recess. I do not know who can find fault with it. I do not think the objective of it is to hit anybody over the head with a stick, not even the members of Dublin Corporation who try to make improvements not always to the approval of everybody in the city and not always fast enough.  They often do things against the wishes of the people and to the detriment of the city. PR men frequently try to paper over the cracks and the damages.  It is without doubt and it is unquestionable that the city centre is in a dreadful state.  I know that many people will say &mdash; and it is true &mdash; that there are many good things about the city.  Generally speaking city centre streets are in a bad state.  This Bill is a simple answer.  It is a temporary one and it depends not on the goodwill of people but on nudging people into doing something that must be done.  There is appalling taste and little care for the environment, the surroundings or even the pollution of the city or for the quality of life we expect to find around the centre of the city.  O'Connell Street has been almost a no-go area for a number of years.  This simple attempt is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There was an attempt made to set up designated areas in the city, to encourage investment and also to set up the Custom House Docks Development Authority, which was established on 17 November 1985, to develop that site along the north quays.  There is no reason why this Bill should not go through the House with the approbation of everyone in it.  It will certainly not do any damage.  I would draw the attention of Members to the fact that we can pull £10 million out of the air when we want to do something like this.  This money comes out of the kitty and no-one gives it a second thought.  When we try to do something much more beneficial which would cost less money per annum there is a cry about it.  What is more important in the city, and other cities throughout the country, than job creation?  If we tried to do something <Col N="1303" /> in that area which would cost between £500,000 and £3 million, people would give all sorts of reasons why it could not be done.  That money could be recouped by rates on new buildings.</P>
    <P>It is becoming plain to me as a Member of this House that the object of many people much of the time is to do nothing and to get away with it.  The reasons for that should be examined.  We may find out something about ourselves, our psychic and why we are in the mess that we are in.  I know that there are problems with some of the plans that are coming forward.  I like to see them coming forward so that we can at least make progress. There is another simple matter relative to this on which the same Minister made a decision last week.  He made the first special amenity area order that was ever made for the Liffey valley. There is not a great interest in the environment. The environmentalists and An Taisce were shouting about that piece of good work which will help protect the valley for future generations from Chapelizod to Lucan.</P>
    <P>That order was brought in after the county council failed to act just as the corporation has failed to act in this case even though they were given the opportunity, studies were carried out and they were urged to do so.  If the Minister in this case does not take his responsibility seriously and risk the criticism of the Opposition and the public in trying to do what everybody realises needs to be done then we will never get anywhere.  We should not spend a lot of time on this but we should agree to it and take the benefits from it.  The amount of money allocated to it would encourage me to ask if similar amounts of money cannot be found for job creation attached to the city centre project for the building of a transportation centre.  It does not augur well for Dublin's future in the next ten to 15 years unless we tackle the transportation problem in the city.  We can have walk-through streets from Grafton Street to Henry Street but if you have not the <Col N="1304" /> means of getting to the city easily and cheaply I am afraid they will not be used or be successful.  Many cities on the Continent have already embarked on this sort of programme and you see very pleasant centres such as in Bonn in Germany and Basle in Switzerland where it is a pleasure to go into the centre and walk around the square to shop or even to sit there.  This Bill was brought in with that intention, and it was sour grapes on the part of the Opposition.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Weapons (Controls) Bill, 1986: Leave to Introduce.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an act to prohibit the entry into the State of vessels or aircraft carrying nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.</P>
      <P>We find ourselves discussing this Bill tonight because of the extraordinary decision of the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Haughey, to oppose the motion I moved on the Order of Business on Wednesday last seeking permission to introduce this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the motion had been unopposed on the Order of Business that day, and the Government at that time indicated they had no opposition to it, it would simply have meant that the Bill would have been printed and officially circulated.  It is, I believe, unprecedented for an opposition party to oppose a motion from another party in opposition seeking leave to introduce a Private Members' Bill.  Fianna Fáil already enjoy a virtual monopoly on the allocation of Private Members' time.  I think it would be most undesirable that any party should be allowed to effectively operate a veto over whether members of the Dáil should be allowed to have a Private Members' Bill circulated and printed.  It is also high time that facilities <Col N="1305" /> were provided by the Government for the discussion of such Bills as this one and for the research and production of them.  It would enhance the role of backbenchers, not only in The Workers' Party but on the Fianna Fáil and Government sides.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before us seeks to prohibit the entry into the State of any vessel or aircraft carrying nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.  Under the Bill any foreign naval vessel seeking permission to enter Irish waters, or a military aircraft seeking permission to fly over or land in this country, would first have to furnish a written statement to the effect that it was not carrying prohibited weapons.</P>
    <P>The visit to Dublin last month of the United States vessel, the USS <i>Nitro</i>, a ship specifically designed to carry nuclear weapons, focused attention once again on the total absence of controls over, or procedures for inspecting naval vessels visiting Irish ports.  The US Government have persistently refused to say whether US vessels visiting this country are carrying nuclear weapons.  Other nuclear powers adopt a similar position.  The policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs which, in effect, is simply to rely on the goodwill of other countries not to send vessels carrying nuclear weapons is incredibly naive.</P>
    <P>Figures given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs show that permission was given for overflights by 1,462 military aircraft last year and that a further 271 were given permission to land.  The fact is that we do not know, and the Department of Foreign Affairs did not know if any of these aircraft were carrying nuclear or similar weapons.  What is of even more concern is that there were an estimated 3,000 over-flights last year for which no permission was given.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the unsuccessful talks in Iceland between the Soviet Union and the US it is more important than ever that neutral, non-nuclear countries such as Ireland be seen to be taking a strong stand against these weapons of mass destruction.  By passing this legislation we could deliver a strong message to all nuclear powers that we want no hand, act <Col N="1306" /> or part in nuclear weapons, and that we will do nothing to facilitate the passage around the world of these weapons by either ship or aircraft.  New Zealand has already adopted a policy of not allowing in vessels unless an assurance has been given that they are not carrying nuclear weapons, and there is no reason why Ireland should not do likewise.</P>
    <P>To conclude, it is important that the Irish Government be seen to be consistent in relation, for instance, to their strong representations about radioactive pollution in the Irish sea from Sellafield. It is not consistent to have that position and at the same time to turn a blind eye to ships and aircraft coming into Irish waters and Irish airspace carrying weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>Clearly, this legislation would not save this country in the event of a nuclear war, but it would reduce the dangers of Irish people being the victims of nuclear accidents. Just as important, it would enable us to deliver a strong public statement of our disapproval of the senseless arms race.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Haughey, I consider this to be an important matter.  It would be well worth devoting six hours of Private Members' time to it.  Obviously, I hope for the support of the House in this, and I urge Deputy Haughey, leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, to allow time for debate on this Bill particularly in the absence of any move from the Government to allow for the debate of Private Members' Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose this Bill purely on the basis that this session will be rather short &mdash; seven weeks &mdash; and Private Members' Business will take place for only six weeks in that period.  It <Col N="1307" /> would be ludicrous to suggest that the Private Members' Bill sponsored by The Workers' Party should take two weeks out of six which would be one third of the total time.</P>
      <P>We are aware also that the Government intend to have legislation prepared to introduce Friday sittings for Private Members' Bills.  This will provide an excellent opportunity for Members to introduce Bills such as the one in question. So far as the Bill itself is concerned, I have no doubt that it is very important legislation.  We do not dispute with Deputy De Rossa the fact that his Bill may be very important, urgent or whatever but we also have very urgent matters, very urgent business to introduce in Private Members' time during this session. On that basis we oppose the Bill but certainly not its content.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and the Government to rescind their directive giving city and county managers the power to fix local authority rents and to restore to local authority tenants representatives, the National Association of Tenants Organisations their right to negotiate a national uniform rents scheme on behalf of tenants.</P>
      <P>The key element in the household budget of local authority tenants nationwide is the rent for their home.  The amount paid is calculated in relation to their income in a system known as the differential rents varying as it does from individual circumstance to individual circumstance. Because of its importance in the overall context of the house hold budget it is vital that each tenant feels that he is paying a fair rent and not more than his neighbour in equivalent circumstances but who happens to be in a different local authority area.  This is even more important because major changes are taking place in the whole social welfare scheme on 17 November next and these changes were torpedoed by the Progressive Democrats when we were trying to get them through this House.</P>
      <P>The key to this fairness for the last 13 years has been a nationally negotiated and determined local authority rents scheme where all tenants nationally were treated equally and all could feel that the system was fair.  This Minister for the Environment and this Government at the stroke of a pen on 14 August this year cast this vital element of fairness to one side all because of political cowardice. Quite simply this Government were not prepared to negotiate a fair rent review and handed over the task of increasing rents to the city and county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> I cannot over emphasise that the decision of the Minister and the Government which they are attempting to portray &mdash; and I have no doubt we will hear so again in this debate &mdash; is not a devolution of powers to local authorities but is a transfer of powers from the Government to city and county managers.  The local authority members have absolutely no say in deciding on the rents to be charged to tenants.  This Government have decided that it should be exclusively a matter for city and county managers and we in Fianna Fáil are calling for this decision to be rescinded and are asking for the support of all Members of the House.  Power to make this decision is being handed over to city and county managers.  No local authority member has any say, one way or the other, as to when or where or how and by how much this rent will be increased.  It is a matter handed over by the Government to the city and county managers and we are asking that this be changed.  I appeal in particular to the Labour Members, and even to the Progressive Democrat Members, who continually protest their concern for the tenants of local authority houses, to join with us in this motion and return to the national uniform rents scheme which was first introduced by the Labour Minister, the former Deputy Jimmy Tully, in 1973 when he was Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Even prior to 1973, the Minister of the day, Kevin Boland, gave recognition to the Central Council of Corporation Tenants. That council was the forerunner of the National Association of Tenants Organisations.  Prior to 1967, the member of the Progressive Democrats who is at present in the House, Deputy Molloy, agreed with this decision.  He too gave a form of recognition to the Central Council of Corporation Tenants.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1973 local authority rent schemes were prepared by individual local authorities and were then submitted for approval to the then Minister for Local Government.  This system proved to be so unfair and unjust, mainly due to its lack of uniformity, that tenants nationwide undertook a national rent <Col N="1313" /> strike throughout 1972.  The National Coalition Government in 1973 &mdash; I think the Ceann Comhairle was a member of that Government &mdash; gave an undertaking that the National Association of Tenants' Organisations would be recognised as the negotiating body for local authority tenants and that there would be a nationally uniform rent scheme devised for local authority tenants.  This scheme was negotiated and implemented.</P>
    <P>In this area of local authority rents peace reigned throughout the 1973-77 National Coalition period and on Fianna Fáil's election to Government in 1977, we continued to operate the system of a national uniform rents scheme.  Again and again in the Dáil and in correspondence with the National Association of Tenants' Organisations we, as a Government, confirmed the position of that body and of the need for a national uniform rents scheme.  This was confirmed in discussion of Private Members' Motions by the then Minister of State, Deputy John O'Leary and prior to 1977 by Deputy Faulkner who was our spokesman on the environment.</P>
    <P>Interestingly enough, even the present Minister for the Environment, Deputy John Boland, in June 1981 when he was spokesman on the environment for the Fine Gael Party and prior to the 1981 general election, confirmed that Fine Gael in Government would continue to recognise the negotiating position of the National Association of Tenants' Organisations. This particular commitment, like so many others &mdash; water buses down the Liffey, £9.60 for the housewives each Monday morning by post &mdash; has now been casually and cynically reneged upon.</P>
    <P>The recent history in this area is that the last national scheme of local authority rents expired in 1984 and since that time there has been no revised rents scheme. It is important to emphasise that this, of course, did not mean that tenants were not paying higher rents during that period or that there had been a rent freeze. The tenants were paying higher rents and there was no rent freeze as the existing differential rents scheme was operating <Col N="1314" /> and tenants were paying according to their means.</P>
    <P>Around July/August 1984 the Government, admittedly with a different Minister for the Environment, made a decision to revise the rents scheme which would include overtime, shift allowances and bonuses which up to that time were not included for rent assessment purposes. This drastic change which was intended to increase the income from local authority rents by approximately 20 per cent became public knowledge.  I raised the matter in the Dáil on a number of occasions and the Government never actually confirmed or denied that such a decision had been made.  However, around December 1984 the Government changed their position slightly.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, entered into negotiations with the National Association of Tenants' Organisations in January 1985 and put forward the revised Government proposals.  The representatives of the National Association of Tenants' Organisations rejected the Government's proposals &mdash; accept this or else &mdash; and contact was broken. Of course, with local elections coming in June 1985 the Government took no further action with regard to the local authority rent review and no further action was taken on the matter until the summer of 1986.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that at that time we had a Labour Minister for the Environment.  He backed off from making any decision with regard to a rent review.  Traditionally, the review of the local authority rents went hand in hand with the review of the tenant purchase scheme for local authority houses and as there had been no rent review for the period from 1984 neither was there a tenant purchase scheme in operation, which was causing major difficulties for tenants around the country.  For example, tenants in the Tallaght area took advantage of the £5,000 grant scheme and were moving out of houses they would otherwise have bought.  As a result of that decision there is chaos in West Tallaght where up to 75 per cent of the people are unemployed.  These are <Col N="1315" /> not my words, they are the words of the clergy operating in the area.</P>
    <P>Local authorities around the country were calling for a revised purchase scheme and eventually in July this year the Minister made the decision to introduce a scheme.  This of course meant that we now had an anomalous situation of a revised purchase scheme but no revised rent scheme and the Government took the cowardly and dishonest approach of handing what should have been their decision to the city and county managers to act as their &ldquo;hatchet men&rdquo;.  I say cowardly because the Government were feeling bruised from their many electoral and other defeats &mdash; local elections, by-elections and referenda &mdash; in both the economic and social areas and were unwilling to face up to their duty of negotiating and introducing a fair and equitable rent review.  I emphasise the dishonesty of the decision because it was attempted to portray it as &mdash; and the press release announcing it actually read &mdash;&ldquo;devolution of powers to local authorities.&rdquo; It was no such thing as devolution of powers; it was merely handing to city and county managers, paid officers, the task of doing the elected Government's job for them.  The Government are doing nothing less than hiding behind the city and county managers.  So much for the vaunted honesty and integrity of this Government.  The meanness of the decision, of course, is seen by the fact that there was no question of the Minister or the Government bringing in the National Association of Tenants' Organisations and explaining to them their proposals. It was done by Government press release which seems to be a preferred format of this Administration.</P>
    <P>This new rents situation has already created and will further create major anomalies with some tenants paying higher rents than others in similar circumstances in different areas.  For example, in Cork the manager is increasing the rents by a 20 per cent margin while in Dublin the figure is 18 per cent and it varies from county to county and city to city across this land, no two tenants <Col N="1316" /> in two local authorities paying the same. This is exactly the type of situation that prevailed prior to 1973 and that resulted in the rent strike at that time and it has already brought forward a rent strike which is at present under way in 1986. Rent strikes by their very nature are to be abhorred.  One tragic outcome of all rent strikes is that when the strike is over tenants find themselves with back rent to pay and in most cases without having made the necessary provisions by saving the money on a week-by-week basis. Inevitably, people going on the rent strike start with the best of intentions of putting the rent money aside every week. However, as time passes and domestic pressures of illness or school books or some other family need arise the rent money is raided, leading to the inevitable situation when the strike is over of no money being available to pay the arrears. This situation happens despite the best intentions of the organisers of the dispute or of the tenants themselves involved.  It is just a sad reality.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to the Members of the House in particular the PDs and Labour Members to support this notice of motion so that at this early stage in the rent withholding strike that has started and is spreading nationally, the Government can pull back from the brink.  I call on the Government to rescind their decision of 14 August and restore to local authority tenants representatives, the National Association of Tenants' Organisations, their right to negotiate a national uniform rents scheme on behalf of all the tenants of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion which will have far-reaching consequences. The Government are handing the powers in relation to the rents on houses back to the county managers.  The managers will decide on the level of rents having regard to the income that will come into a house, apparently including children's allowances.  The Minister is vague in saying that managers may act according to how they view the position and can make special cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> In parts of the midlands there is a rent strike and this could escalate to other parts of the country, creating serious problems for local authorities with regard to revenue.  Pressure will also be put on the tenants when arrangements are worked out.  It is obvious the Government were unable to reach agreement with the organisations negotiating on behalf of tenants.  It is alleged the Government wished to increase rents by 18 per cent and to take into account all bonuses, overtime and allowances coming into a house.  In many houses members of the family are on unemployment assistance which goes from £13 a week to £33 depending on the income of the house in question.  Those on unemployment assistance are a burden to their parents.  If that income is taken into account in deciding the rent it will have a further serious effect on the householder. The Government put the onus for rent increases on the local authorities to disguise their intentions just because Fianna Fáil won control of most local authorities in the June local elections.  The Government wanted to put the blame on the elected councils, many of them Fianna Fáil councils.  The Government will not get away with it.</P>
    <P>The previous scheme negotiated by the Minister of the day was uniform throughout the country.  The present decision may mean that rents will differ from county to county.  How will that work?  If the Minister and Government continue with the scheme they will meet with confrontation throughout the country.  We should have a uniform scheme agreed by all the organisations, NATO, ACRA and others involved.  The previous scheme seemed to have worked fairly well but this scheme will not work.  It is clear to many that the Labour Party particularly were not prepared to wear the increases the Minister is proposing.</P>
    <P>The transfer of powers to the manager means that he will bring proposals to the council although he is not under an obligation to do so.  Many managers are now sending out rent review forms for completion which means that when they are returned they can assess the rent <Col N="1318" /> whatever way they like.  Although councillors represent the people they will have no say in the matter.  We were told before the local elections last year that local authorities would have more powers.  Has that happened?  We merely get the dirty work and, as I warned earlier, so many county councils are controlled by Fianna Fáil that those members of the council will be blamed for increasing rents.  The Minister is giving the managers statutory authority to set rents.  Councils may oppose these rent increases &mdash; I presume many will &mdash; but the statutory powers are vested in the manager and he can overrule the councillors.</P>
    <P>How many meetings did the Minister or the officials of his Department have with NATO or ACRA over the last two years?  What proposals did they put forward? Did NATO or ACRA put forward any proposals?  If rents are withheld throughout the country where will the revenue of the councils and corporations come from?  Will their finances become depleted?  I have no doubt that they will, which will put extra pressure on local authorities.</P>
    <P>I do not advocate it but we are in for a winter of unrest in regard to rents of local authority houses.  If the movement gathers momentum it will spread throughout the country and matters will become very serious as far as the finances of the authorities are concerned.  In the end an agreement will have to be worked out between interested organisations. Guidelines differ from county to county which will also create a problem.  There will also be a problem in regard to income.  Everybody realises that those in local authority houses are put to the pin of their collar to make a living.  However, if children's allowances and disability benefits are taken into account it will have a very serious effect because it is usually the parents who pay the rent and in some cases get very little money from children and relatives living with them.  I realise that there is a hardship allowance but that was also the case under a former scheme and it did not work out successfully.</P>
    <P>A rent dispute went on for months in <Col N="1319" /> my county and it took a long time to resolve.  I should not like to see that happening again, not just in that county but in any other county because it would have very serious effects on the finances of councils.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend to the Minister that he reconsider the position in regard to this matter and agree to our motion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. a.1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the terms of the recent circular to local authorities devolving responsibility for rents of local authority houses and, in particular, the requirements that:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households;</P>
      <P>&mdash;allowance should be made for dependent children;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners in the household; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Local authority tenants are badly served by the negative and misleading terms of the Opposition's motion which they have tabled here and which they or their representatives have tabled at local authority meetings throughout the country in recent weeks.  It represents political opportunism and dishonesty which can only be put down to an attempt to curry favour with those who are intent on stalling rent reviews for as long as possible and, from their point of view, indefinitely, and all costs will be borne by the taxpayers, ratepayers and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> It ill behoves an Opposition who purport to be ready and able to take on the mantle of government to encourage those who, for whatever motivation are endeavouring to minimise the income to local authorities, to disrupt the local authority system and the finances of the State. It seems they are extraordinary strange bedfellows for the Opposition to decide to lie with in this matter.</P>
    <P>If the attitude of the Opposition is successful it can only have the effect of fomenting discontent in local authority housing estates, discontent between local authority tenants and tenant purchasers and their local authorities and, unfortunately, on the other side promoting hostile attitudes among the general public towards those who are local authority tenants.  The effect of this type of campaign once again is to seek to promote social division, with people who are local authority tenants wondering why there should be a strike organised by tenants at particular rent levels and in this way. Consequently, those decent people living in local authority estates will have, if the Opposition's devious campaign is successful, turned upon them a certain amount of hostility from the rest of the community.  That is regrettable.  I would like to hope it is an effect which has not been thought of or thought out by the Opposition when they decided to embark on this irresponsible course.  I counsel the Opposition to consider the sort of things they have been saying both at national and local level which can only have the effect of causing animosity and antipathy between the general public and local authority tenants.</P>
    <P>If this motion, allied to the other remarks made, is to have the effect of fostering or strengthening local authority tenants who are withholding their rents it will in turn lead to hardship for many local authority tenants and their families. Those of us who have been in politics for a long time know that on other occasions when local authority rent strikes were organised, ultimately they resulted in enormous hardship on the tenants who participated in them, hardship which often extended over a number of years <Col N="1321" /> while they endeavoured to pay their arrears.  The Opposition spokesman admitted that when pressures come upon people they are likely to spend the money they set aside to pay for the arrears of rent.  Tenants are being encouraged into that position by irresponsible statements made by members of the Opposition throughout the country in recent months.</P>

      <P>Níl ráiteas scríobhtha agam.  Níl ach nótaíagam.  There is a duty and obligation upon local authorities to ensure that proper maintenance of their housing stock is carried out and that, to some extent at least, adequate resources are provided and generated in order to meet that need.  It is up to each local authority to decide on the level of rents having regard to their local circumstances. In this respect it is fair to point out that the last general rent increase took place in October 1983. Surely, it is unreasonable to expect that there should be no revision of rents despite the fact there have been considerable increases in the incomes of tenants, both of those in employment and those in receipt of welfare payments? Yet, all local authority rents, except where the circumstances of the family change dramatically, are based on incomes of 1983 and in relation to welfare tenants, on incomes of 1982.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of local authority tenants and tenant purchasers are realistic and responsible people who realise that providing and maintaining council houses is a costly business.  They have more sense than those irresponsible people who have been exhorting them not to pay reasonable rent repayments towards the maintenance of their homes. I cannot envisage that any local authority would ever arrive at a rent scheme that would result in repayments that would burden tenants to a state where they were <Col N="1323" /> unable to afford their weekly rent repayments or to devise a rent scheme which was unreasonable in relation to the incomes of the tenants and their family circumstances.  It was for that reason that when I sent the circular to the local authorities devolving to them the responsibility for rent schemes I pointed out four matters, which are provided for in the wording of the Government amendment. I pointed out to them that rents payable should be related to income and that a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households. That is not the position that obtains at present.  I pointed out that an allowance should be made for dependent children and that provision should be made for accepting a lower rent than might be required under the scheme in exceptional cases which were identified by the local authority, where paying even the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>
      <P>Despite the campaign of misinformation and misrepresentation, for reasons of political expediency, advanced by the Opposition I must point out that as far as the Government are concerned there has not been any change in the status of NATO as the national representative body for local authority tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions were held with that organisation regarding review of the existing rents scheme and the tenant purchase scheme.  At a series of meetings with the Minister of State at my Department in 1985 NATO put forward certain views which were taken into account in the Government's decision to devolve responsibility for rents to the local councils.  Those views are reflected in the tenor of the circular I sent to local authorities.  The new sales scheme which I introduced gives to tenants the option of choosing the purchase price for their home either at market value or at the construction cost updated by a price <Col N="1324" /> index, whichever is the most favourable to the tenant, a provision which had been sought by NATO.  That choice was included in the scheme I announced last July.  The organisation made it clear that their major concern in regard to the sales scheme was that the upgrading of the cost price of the house by a factor often resulted in a house being offered to prospective tenant purchasers at a sum in excess of market value.  The scheme I introduced met that point in full.</P>
      <P>As far as rents are concerned NATO's proposals recognised that the graded scale of rents should take cognisance of the rate of inflation being adjusted accordingly.  They also reaffirmed their commitment to rent being assessed on income, proposed minor adjustments in certain rent provisions and sought the retention of certain features of the existing scheme.  Those views were taken into account in the guidelines for drawing up rent schemes which were issued to local authorities last August and of which, I suspect, many members of the House have had sight.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties that has arisen in recent years in relation to the operation of local authority rent schemes is that they were becoming increasingly regressive. The simple fact of the matter is that provisions in relation to maximum rents have benefited the higher paid tenants and placed a relatively greater burden on those dependent on social welfare and in low paid employment.  I invite the House to look again at the wording of our amendment which is based on the circular issued to local authorities.  I asked local authorities in that circular to redress that imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to reflect on some of the figures.  At the end of last year there were about 114,000 local authority tenants and the cost to local authorities of managing and maintaining their housing stock was £64 million.  The contribution from rental income was £41.5 million or 64 per cent of the total.  The balance, one-third of the cost of management and maintenance of council rented stock, has to come from the other resources of the local authorities.  The average rent paid <Col N="1325" /> by council tenants in 1985 was just under £7 per week.  Fixed rents on about 6,300 houses averaged £3.50 per week.  The average weekly rent for a new house let for the first time in 1985 was £7.40 per week compared with a weekly cost of about £60 to the State for financing the provision of that new house in 1985.  I must point out that when I refer to the &ldquo;State&rdquo; I am referring to taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that many tenants are wholly or mainly dependent on social welfare payments of one sort or another and I think it is right that their contribution should then be proportionately lower.  It should be borne in mind that 100 per cent of the income of people on social welfare payments was taken into account under the old scheme for rent assessment purposes while those employed were able to exclude overtime payments, shift payments and what are called non-regular bonuses from their income before their rent was assessed.  I regard that as an inequity.  While the person on welfare had 100 per cent of his or her income assessed for the determination of rent, the person in employment quite often had sizeable amounts of income excluded before rent was assessed.</P>
    <P>Recently my Department carried out a sample survey which showed that the average rent paid by tenants with incomes of between £150 and £200 per week was about £13.90.  On the other hand, the average rent paid by tenants with incomes of between £200 to £250 per week was about £15.40, £1.50 more, although in certain cases their gross income could be £60 or £100 more.  I should like to look at the level of rents a number of people pay.  Up to 38 per cent of all tenants pay rents of under £3 per week; 20 per cent more pay rents of between £3 and £7 per week.  That means that 58 per cent of all tenants have been paying rents of less than £7 per week. Tenants who pay rent of more than £30 per week number 129 out of the 114,000 tenants or .12 per cent of the total number of tenants in local authority rented housing.  I could quote other figures <Col N="1326" /> but if Deputies wish to obtain them they are freely available.  The vast bulk of local authority rented stock is rented to tenants at an extremely reasonable rent.  The safeguards I set out in the circular issued to local authorities will ensure that in the future those who are in genuine hardship will be better treated than under the previous scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to refute categorically the idea put forward by the Opposition spokesman, and some tenant representatives, that in general rent levels have increased over the past three years in line with the income of tenants in that period.  That is not so.  The last general revision of the differential rents scheme was in October 1983 and rent levels were set then based on income levels at 6 June 1983 for employed tenants and on the social welfare rate that obtained in April 1982 for unemployed people.  In fact, increases in income as a result of general increases in social welfare payments and wages in the interim have not been taken into account except for new tenants.</P>
    <P>The only occasion when rents were revised in those cases was when there was a change in family circumstances such as, for example, a tenant becoming unemployed. The vast majority of tenants are still paying weekly rents which were set on income levels over three, and in some cases four, years ago.  It has also been suggested, unfairly, by Opposition spokesmen that my Department were seeking increases of the order of 25 per cent.  In fact, no direction or suggestion of any sort was made by me or my Department officials to local authorities regarding the type of income they ought to obtain from their rental schemes.</P>
    <P>In deciding on revised rent levels I expect that housing authorities would have regard to their own maintenance and management expenses and to relevant local factors.  We cannot continue to expect rent levels to remain static at a time when incomes of tenants are rising and, in turn, maintenance costs are rising.  I am sure that the revised rents schemes being drawn up by the councils will be acceptable to the vast majority of tenants and I am certain that any reasonable <Col N="1327" /> council &mdash; I do not know of any that would be so irresponsible as to behave unreasonably in this regard &mdash; will seek to ensure that no question of hardship will arise for their tenants from the new rent levels.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy go back and look after his tomatoes?  The question of devolution to local authorities <Col N="1328" /> has been raised and this is a fundamental devolution.  There should be no misrepresentation of the fact.  Devolution does not necessarily always mean the transferral of functions carried out by central Government to be reserved functions of the local authorities.  Devolution involves identifying certain functions, services and schemes which might better be administered locally and transferring them from central Government to the administration of local authorities.  We know that the vast bulk of decisions at local authority level are executive rather than reserved decisions.  Any reasonable county manager will discuss with his local authority the terms of any revised rent scheme before implementing it.</P>
      <P>If the Opposition say there are unreasonable managers, let them name them here.  Let them blame the county where the Opposition say the manager will act irresponsibly and unreasonably in devising and introducing a new rent scheme.  We will wait with interest to hear that during the rest of today and tomorrow.  When we introduced the £5,000 grant scheme we left the administration of it to the local authorities as an administrative function, not a reserved function.  I do not understand why the Opposition have worked themselves into such a tizzy.  They have pointed out that most local authorities are now controlled by members of the Opposition party. Good luck to them and long may they stay so busy that they do not pay sufficient attention to matters in this House.  If the Opposition care to go back to the local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the members of the Opposition care to go back to the local authorities on which many of them serve and consult those of the managers whom they are not accusing of being unreasonable, they will discover that the question of transferring responsibility for rent schemes from central Government to the local authorities was suggested by the City and County Managers' Associations. They suggested that the administration of the schemes should be transferred back to the local authorities as an executive function.</P>
      <P>I read in this morning's newspaper that in a certain instance the Commissioner of Valuation in the exercise of his statutory functions and the manager of the local authority involved, in the exercise of his statutory functions, sought to collect rates from certain ratepayers.  As reported in this morning's newspapers, the elected members of the local authority involved passed motions calling on the manager not to collect those rates, although he pointed out to them that the motions were meaningless and that he was obliged to carry out his statutory functions.  One can only wonder what the attitude of that local authority would have been had I transferred to the elected members the right to prepare rent schemes.  Maybe they would have decided it was too difficult and too burdensome to collect rents at all, that it would be simpler to allow tenants to operate on a totally free basis within their houses.  Instead, what I have done on behalf of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy is suggesting that income could be saved by having these officials unpaid.  What other sorts of officials are there in the local authority?  This is a deliberate and concerted attempt by the Opposition to diminish the discretionary income of the local authorities, income which we believe they should generate in order to set against the cost of the maintenance and management of their housing stock.  This cost is met at present only to the extent of two-thirds from rental income.</P>
      <P>It is now a matter for the local authorities to introduce reasonable rent schemes which take account of the increase in income for both those in receipt of welfare payments since April 1982 and those in receipt of income from employment since 1983.  I think the respective figures are in the order of 35 per cent for those in receipt of social welfare payments and an average of 24 per cent or 25 per cent for those in receipt of income payments.  For those groups there has been no commensurate rent increase but in the same period the cost of maintaining and managing the local authority housing stock has increased by many millions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I must bring the Minister back to reality.  He is talking about the Opposition but his own performance tonight had to be seen to be believed. Fianna Fáil have no objection to rent increases; they never said they had.  The Minister cannot prove at any time that we said that.  We are concerned about his and his predecessors opting out of their responsibility for the last three years.  It is they who have created the problem for local authorities.  Devolution is being used by the Minister as an excuse for the situation, but we know otherwise.  This motion is before the House tonight to <Col N="1332" /> prevent a rent strike.  Obviously, the Minister is not listening to NATO and other organisations representing tenants.  They have said that there will be a national rent strike.  Has the Minister not heard that?  Throughout the country, local authority tenants are paying different rents. Is that equitable or fair?  The Minister is talking to members of the Opposition, not to the people outside whom his Government and himself have been fooling for the past three years with their policies, statements and public relations exercises.  That will not work here tonight.  I shall read again the motion, for the benefit of the Minister.  It states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and the Government to rescind their directive giving City and County Managers the power to fix local authority rents and to restore to local authority tenants representatives, the National Association of Tenants Organisations, their right to negotiate a national uniform rents scheme on behalf of tenants.</P>
      <P>That was a system which worked well up to 1983, until the Coalition Government failed in their duty to have rent increases on a yearly basis.  I should also like to turn to the circular of 14 August 1983 to all local authorities from the Principal Officer of the Department of the Environment on behalf of the Minister stating:</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for the Environment to state that, as a further stage in the implementation of the Government's programme for devolution of a wider range of functions to local authorities, it has been decided that housing authorities shall henceforth be given the responsibility for making and amending rent schemes in respect of local authority dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with that decision, it is now the responsibility of individual housing authorities to revise the terms of the rent scheme set out in circular letter HRT 8/83 of 30 September, 1983 which continues in operation pending such revision.  In revising a rent scheme for dwellings let otherwise than on a fixed rent, housing authorities should <Col N="1333" /> ensure that the new scheme follows the broad principles underlying the 1983 scheme in the following matters:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households;</P>
    <P>&mdash; allowances should be made for dependent children;</P>
    <P>&mdash; a contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners in the household; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>
    <P>We are quite happy about that.</P>
    <P>The circular letter continues further down:</P>
    <P>New schemes should be drawn up so as to ensure that the overall rental income reflects adequately, insofar as it is practicable to do so, the management and maintenance costs of the estate of houses under your control. Such schemes may then be regarded as approved under article 64 (b) of the Housing Regulations, 1980.</P>
    <P>Repairs to houses et cetera lost out over the last three years because of the failure of the Coalition Ministers.  It is very clear that a major confrontation is ahead unless the Minister does something about it in the very near future.  Local authority rents have been increased in certain areas and are about to be increased in other areas.  There will certainly be a heated debate in this respect in the near future. The problems of local authorities will be very great indeed and the Minister must accept full responsibility here.  Whether he likes it or not, the managers are now implementing a policy of endeavouring to get in one fell swoop rent increases which they should have been getting over the last three years.</P>
    <P>We must also underline the reasons for problems with rent and why increases on the way will create difficulties for tenants <Col N="1334" /> of local authorities.  Any problems which arise can be related to the lack of action by the Ministers and the Department over the past three years.  At one time rents were determined locally by local authorities.  This function was transferred to central Government and worked well. There were no serious problems involved.  The authorities were prepared to act responsibly and things went well up to 1983.  The National Tenants' Association and other bodies co-operated with the Department in coming to agreement.  The normal procedure was to have the annual review of rents related to movements in income.  Following discussions with the organisations representing tenants, a reasonable increase was agreed between the parties which was mutual and satisfactory and local authorities had no problem in implementation because there was consultation. The representatives of the tenants had been consulted and because of this there was wide acceptance of what was agreed. What has happened to this arrangement which was working so well?  The Minister has not given an answer.</P>

I have no power in this as a local representative. The managers decide and, irrespective of what I say, it is the management who have the final say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to people advocating rent strikes.  I speak for Cork and we appealed to all concerned not to have a national rent strike.  Members of my party never advocated a rent strike in any part of the country.  The Minister should <Col N="1335" /> withdraw that remark unless he can substantiate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no rent review since 1983.  We know, as does the Minister, that local authority managers have been seeking rent increases but because of the failure of the Minister's Department there were no rent increases.  The revenue of local authorities would be less depleted if there had been a rent increase over the last three years.  This would certainly have <Col N="1336" /> cushioned the effects of the financial position of local authorities and this must come back again to the Minister's door. He is responsible and has failed the local authorities and the people.  My colleague mentioned a figure of 20 per cent.  Managers have already implemented rent increases in Cork of 200, 300 and 400 per cent.  People may say that if a rent goes from £3 to £6 or £7 that is not so bad, but for anyone on social assistance that is a huge increase and that is happening.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of that. That is the unacceptable situation in Cork.  The Minister must accept responsibility for that.</P>

      <P>A package of proposals relating to the 25th Round and other related matters emerged last January and these proposals were subsequently offered to unions in all areas of the public service.</P>
      <P>The package consisted of two main elements</P>
      <P>&mdash;proposals for the 25th Round increases and a frame work for dealing with special pay increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard terms for the 25th Round were as follows: <Col N="1171" /> An 18 month agreement beginning on 1 January 1986 and ending on 30 June 1987:</P>
    <P>a four month pay pause</P>
    <P>an increase of 3 per cent from 1 May 1986</P>
    <P>an increase of 2 per cent from 1 January 1987</P>
    <P>an increase of 2 per cent from 1 May 1987.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the framework for dealing with special pay increases consisted of the following:</P>
    <P>Clause 3.2: Claims in respect of which adjudication hearings had taken place prior to 1 January 1986 may be implemented as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  One-third of the relevant increase may be paid from 1 December 1986</P>
    <P>(b) a further one-third of the relevant increase may be paid from 1 December 1987</P>
    <P>(c) the remaining balance outstanding may be paid from 1 July 1988.</P>
    <P>Clause 3.3: Claims other than those in Clause 3.2 above may be processed and may be implemented as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) One-third of the relevant increase may be paid from a date not earlier than 1 December 1987</P>
    <P>(b) a further one-third of the relevant increase may be paid from a date not earlier than 1 December 1988</P>
    <P>(c) the remaining balance outstanding may be paid from a date not earlier than 1 July 1989.</P>
    <P>With a small number of exceptions, these terms have now been accepted by the public service unions.  I might add that the standard terms were varied in the case of manual workers in local authorities, health boards and certain other areas of the public service, the major change being increases of £5 per week from 1 May 1986 and £6 per week from 16 February <Col N="1172" /> 1987, instead of the 3 percentage increases I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>In all cases, however, the duration of the agreement is 18 months and the agreement is to expire on 30 June 1987.</P>
    <P>The Government statement of 18 September 1986 sets out their approach to pay &mdash; both in the private and public sectors &mdash; over the period subsequent to the expiry of current agreements.  In essence, the Government's view is that subsequent increases should be below the annual rate of inflation and, where appropriate, agreements should include a pay pause.</P>

      <P>I believe that pay moderation is absolutely necessary to the protection and expansion of employment.  However, I do not have information available which would allow me to comment on the number of jobs which have been lost in the economy as a whole between 1970 and 1986 as a result of pay increases greater than the rate of inflation which occurred in both the public and private sectors.</P>

      <P>I am happy to be able to inform the House that, with a small number of exceptions, 25th Pay Round terms have now been agreed for all public service groups.  Some public service groups, such as the teachers, the gardaí and the greater part of the Civil Service, accepted the terms some time ago and have already been paid the 3 per cent increase due <Col N="1173" /> from 1 May last.  Other groups have not yet been paid the increase because of delays in processing their claims but are expected to be paid this 3 per cent increase in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The main exception arises in the case of craftsmen employed in the public service. The current position with regard to this group is that the public service package has been offered to the unions representing craftsmen employed in the local authorities and health services.  It is understood that the unions are conducting a ballot of their members on the offer.  Craftsmen in Government Departments, educational institutions and noncommercial State-sponsored bodies who are on the same national rate will be offered a similar agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he is satisfied that the existence of the Office of the Ombudsman is not itself generating a large percentage of the increased number of complaints submitted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of the Ombudsman was established to provide, for the first time, an independent forum which people could pursue certain types of grievances.  Given the purpose of the Office I would be surprised &mdash; indeed I would be disappointed &mdash; if its existence did not result in people pursuing grievances which they might otherwise not have pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What contribution this factor has made to the overall increase in complaints submitted to the Ombudsman's Office is not possible to say.  Between 1984 and 1985 the number of complaints received increased from 2,300 to 5,000 but this would have been mainly due to the extension of the Ombudsman's remit to include the health boards, local authorities, Telecom Éireann and An Post.  During this period also the Office adopted a high <Col N="1174" /> profile and this too contributed to the increase.  I would regard both of these moves as entirely laudable.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to refer to my predecessor's answer on 12 December 1985 to a similar question tabled by the Deputy.  At that stage, the position was that the staff welfare service was under discussion with the staff side in the context of the Government's commitment to the expansion of the service as outlined in paragraph 7.11 of the White Paper &ldquo;Serving the Country Better&rdquo;. Since then the Government has decided to provide a comprehensive welfare service for the Civil Service and has committed additional staff resources for this purpose.  Discussions are taking place at present with the staff associations.  I expect to be in a position to make a statement in the near future giving full details of the scope and extent of the new service when negotiations with staff side have been concluded.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service the reason a person (details supplied) in County Dublin who was a successful applicant for Civil Service appointment as a clerical assistant in 1983 was removed from the list of those to whom such a position should be offered after he advised the Civil Service Commission in October of 1985 that prior to taking up a position as clerical assistant he wished to complete third-level studies he had commenced in the autumn of 1983 and which would be completed in June of 1986 and that accordingly he could not take up the position of clerical assistant in October of 1985; and if it is the policy of the Civil Service Commission to require that all of those who succeed in their application for Civil Service employment remain unemployed and take no part in third-level education until the commission offers a job to them.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances in which the candidature of the person concerned was closed are as follows:</P>
      <P>As a result of a written examination held by the Civil Service Commissioners in 1983, the person concerned was placed on a panel for further possible consideration for appointment as clerical assistant.  In 1985 sufficient vacancies had arisen to enable him, by reference to his place on the panel, to be considered further.  He was therefore interviewed and as a result offered appointment.  His response, in writing, to the Civil Service Commission was that after careful consideration he had decided to continue studying for the future and would therefore not be taking up the position of clerical assistant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, it is a matter for each candidate to decide what to do while waiting for the results of competitions or, having qualified, while waiting to see whether he/she will be offered appointment. As far as the Civil Service Commissioners are concerned, their main function is to provide Departments as <Col N="1180" /> quickly as possible with qualified candidates to fill vacancies.  Any general policy to hold over vacancies for candidates who say they wish to defer taking up appointment for educational or other reasons would cause delays in meeting the staffing needs of Departments and be unfair to other qualified candidates, many of whom would be unemployed school leavers, who wished to enter the Civil Service immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of my reply to Question No. 20, I have answered the first part of <Col N="1181" /> this question about the payment arrangements for the 25th Round and for special increases.</P>
      <P>Many of the claims for special increases under the 25th Round have yet to be fully processed &mdash; indeed, some claims may not yet have been lodged by the staff interests involved.  For this reason it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of &ldquo;conciliation awards&rdquo; or &ldquo;arbitration awards&rdquo; as requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As regards the financing of awards &ldquo;which are not budgeted for in 1986&rdquo;, a provision was made in this year's budget for an additional £70 million in Vote 51, the Vote for increases in remuneration and pensions.  This provision was to cover the cost in 1986 of the 25th Round Pay Package, costing £68 million and two pension concessions, costing £2 million. This figure of £68 million was my Department's best estimate at the time of the total cost in 1986 of the various elements in the package, and, while some of the component figures have been subject to some revision in the intervening period, the total of £68 million is still seen as sufficient to meet the full cost in 1986 of the increases in the package.</P>
      <P>Since January's budget, there have been a number of cases &mdash; the most significant being the teachers' settlement &mdash; where the Government has agreed to make <i>ex gratia</i> payments as part of an agreement to defer the implementation of certain awards.  No money was provided in the budget to meet the additional cost in 1986.  The total cost of these payments in 1986 will be of the order of £17 million, of which the teachers' payments come to £15 million.  It is not possible to say at this stage how much of this additional cost can be met from savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to 1987 and later years, it is very difficult to quantify what additional costs will arise from the implementation of pay increases under the 25th Round package.  As I said earlier, some of the claims may not have been lodged yet.  At this stage all I can say is that the additional cost in 1987 to the Exchequer pay and pensions bill of increases under <Col N="1182" /> the 25th Round itself will be of the order of £115 million, while the additional cost in 1987 of special pay increases will be of the order of £40 million.</P>
    <P>I should point out, however, that the overall position is complicated by a number of technical factors and that the figures given above cannot be taken in isolation in making any estimate of the 1987 Exchequer pay and pensions bill.</P>

    <P>With regard to the delay in appointing an executive solicitor occurring between June 1983 and October 1984 I understand that the county council sent the statutory request to the Local Appointments Commission in July 1983 and received a recommendation from the commission on 18 August 1984.  The job was offered <Col N="1190" /> to the recommended candidate the following day and that candidate took up the post on 1 October 1984.  I also understand that Kerry County Council engaged the services of a private legal practice during the serious illness of the law agent and pending the appointment of an executive solicitor and again when the executive solicitor was on maternity leave.</P>

      <P>The delay in replying to the Deputy's representations, which is <Col N="1193" /> regretted, was due to a large build-up of work in the section concerned.  Steps have been taken to avoid a repetition.  A certificate of competency ceases to be valid unless it is submitted to a licensing authority with an application for a driving licence within 18 months from the date of issue of the certificate.  This is a statutory requirement which I have no power to waive.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was issued with a certificate of competency on completion of his driving test on 30 May 1984. The period of validity of that certificate would have expired on 30 November 1985 unless he had applied for a driving licence by that date.  I understand that the licensing authority has no record of the receipt of an application from him for a driving licence within that period.  Consequently, he has no option but to obtain a new certificate of competency by successfully undergoing a further driving test.</P>

    <P>Notes</P>
    <P>1.  In calculating the figures in column (a) the estimated net receipt from farm taxation in each calendar year has been divided by the number of farmers assessed to tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends e.g. the 1981 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1981-82.  This is because revenue receipts are, in general, prepared on a calendar (financial) year basis.</P>
    <P>2.  Full time farmers and farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession have been included in the calculations.</P>
    <P>3.  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be separately distinguished. Accordingly the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</P>
    <P>4.  The figures contained in column (b) are obtained by dividing the net receipt of income tax from other self-employed persons in each calendar year by the estimated number of those persons assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note 1. above.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> 5.  Cases involving income assessable to tax under Schedule D which are not strictly self-employed have been identified and excluded as far as possible.  The figures are, therefore, not strictly comparable with the figures for averages given previously in relation to this category.</P>
    <P>6.  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one tax unit.</P>

      <P>The relevant statistics available are in respect of the income tax year 1985-86. From figures contained in table 14 of the results of the 1985 Labour Force Survey (published in September 1986) it is estimated that 127,000 farmers were chargeable to income tax in respect of that income tax year.  This comprises some 119,000 full time farmers together with a further 8,000 farmers who or whose spouses carry on another trade or profession. The figure for full-time farmers includes some 83,000 persons who were brought within the charge to tax in respect of farming profits for the first time in 1983-84 but it will be some time before all these cases are fully processed and the extent of liability to tax established.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some 84,000 self-employed persons other than farmers were chargeable to income tax in 1985-86.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> The numbers of self-employed persons including farmers who are ultimately expected to make tax payments in respect of 1985-86 is provisionally estimated at 111,000.  Statistical records of tax payments by vocational category are not maintained but by use of sampling techniques the Revenue Commissioners estimate that the number of farmers who paid income tax up to 14 April, 1986 in respect of 1983-84 is of the order of 20,000.  The corresponding estimate for 1984-85 at 14 April, 1986 is of the order of 17,500.  Both of these numbers are likely to increase over time as final liability is settled in cases still under appeal.</P>

    <P>* These figures are provisional.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" />
      <Col N="1210" /> General Note</P>
    <P>The figures in columns (a) to (h) inclusive relate to the tax year specified except in the case of column (g) in relation to which, for the years subsequent to 1973-74, the figures are based on the PAYE net receipt in the financial year indicated in brackets.</P>
    <P>Notes on table</P>
    <P>Columns (a) and (b):</P>
    <P>(i) Personal Allowances:</P>
    <P>From 1955-56 to 1973-74, inclusive, the allowances assumed for the married man were the married allowance, child allowance for two children not over 11 years of age and earned income relief.  For the same period the allowances assumed for the single person were the single allowance plus earned income relief.  Earned income relief was abolished with effect from 6 April 1974.</P>
    <P>From 1979-80 onwards the single, married and child allowances have been augmented by the additional of the special employment deduction (PAYE allowance).</P>
    <P>From 1982-83 onwards account has been taken of the PRSI allowance.</P>
    <P>As regards column (a), for each of the years 1955-56 to 1967-68, the effective exemption limits (married and child allowances together with related earned income relief) exceeded the average industrial earnings for male workers.  This is reflected in the figures for those years in that column.</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp; Average male industrial earnings:</P>
    <P>Up to and including 1968-69 average industrial earnings relate to males of 18 years of age or over employed in transportable goods industries and are based on the amounts earned in a week in October of each year.  Owing to a change in the method of collection and classification of the amounts of such earnings, the earnings from 1969-70 onwards relate to a male of 21 years of age or over and are based on quarterly figures which have been averaged for each tax year shown in the table.</P>
    <P>Up to and including 1973-74 the earnings figures are derived from the annual censuses of industrial production.  For subsequent years, the earnings are based on the new NACE system of industrial classification (general classification of economic activities within the European Communities).</P>
    <P>Column (d)/(e):</P>
    <P>The 38.5% standard rate of income tax which is shown for 1975-76 and 1976-77 is comprised of the standard rate of 35% plus the temporary 10% surcharge which applied to all income tax rates for those years except the first rate.</P>
    <P>There is no apparent difference between the questions at (d) and (e).  Consequently, the relevant information is given under one heading, (d)/(e), in the table.</P>
    <P>Column (f):</P>
    <P>Effective rate of income tax:</P>
    <P>This is the average effective rate of tax levied on each pound of Actual Income as defined in the Revenue Commissioners' Annual Reports.</P>
    <P>The latest available published information is that contained in table 90 of the report for year ended 31 December 1984 copies of which are in the Library.</P>
    <P>Column (g):</P>
    <P>(i) PAYE was introduced with effect from October 1960.  It applied at that time to all employees except those for whom a statutory tax deduction scheme was already in operation (public servants, officials of Bank of Ireland, etc.).  PAYE was extended to all employees as from the year 1976-77.  For years prior to 1976-77 tax payments in respect of all persons (including public servants) taxed under Schedule E have been taken into account.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of the net receipt of income tax attributable to Schedule E is not available for years up to and including 1962-63.  For these years the estimated net produce of that tax has been used.  Net produce of tax is the estimated ultimate yield from the tax assessed in the year, whether actually collected in that year or later, after deducting all discharges and remissions and setting off all repayments.  For years between 1963-64 and 1976 it is possible to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the net receipt of Schedule E tax using actual figures of tax payments under PAYE.  The net receipt figures for PAYE for years subsequent to 1976 are separately distinguished from other tax receipts in the collection process.</P>
    <P>The amounts shown in the column are obtained by dividing the net receipt or net produce, as the case may be, by the number of persons shown for the corresponding tax year in column (h).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" />
      <Col N="1212" /> (ii)&nbsp; The reduction in income tax paid in 1960-61 is attributable to the abatement estimated at over £4 million given under section 14 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959.</P>
    <P>Column (h):</P>
    <P>The numbers shown in this column are the numbers of taxpaying units estimated to be effectively liable to tax under Schedule E up to and including the year 1975-76 and those liable under PAYE in subsequent tax years.  A married couple who have elected or have been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband are counted as one taxpaying unit.</P>

      <P>The full year cost, estimated by reference to income tax year 1985-86, of the reduction in the top rate of income tax from 65 per cent to 60 per cent is estimated at £21 million.  The corresponding full year cost, estimated by reference to income tax year 1986-87, of that reduction together with the further reduction of the 60 per cent rate to 58 per cent is estimated at £41 million.</P>

      <P>My Department have been in constant contact with St. Vincent's Hospital throughout the year to monitor its financial position.  I am, therefore, well aware of the efforts being made by the hospital management aimed at allowing the hospital to live within available funds, while maintaining an excellent level of care to patients.  The situation in St. Vincent's will continue to be kept under close review and I am confident that the quality of service in the hospital will be sustained.</P>

      <P>Following investigation, the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means of £80.75 weekly, derived from the profit from his holding, exceeded the maximum rate of unernployment assistance payable in his case. He appealed against the decision and, on 30 September 1986, an appeals officer also assessed his means at £80.75 weekly.</P>
      <P>Regulations provide that, if the appeals officer is of the opinion that a case is of such a nature that it can be decided without an oral hearing, he may dispense with the hearing and decide the case summarily. The appeals officer was of the opinion that this case was of such a nature that it could properly be determined without an oral hearing and, therefore, he decided it summarily.  The decision of the appeals officer is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.  However, if the person feels that there were facts or evidence which were not available to the appeals officer, he should send them to the Department and they will be submitted to the appeals officer to enable him to re-examine the case.</P>

In addition, the EC Commission has agreed to propose an extra £15 million to enable headage payments in disadvantaged areas here to be increased on a once-off basis this year.  This proposal will shortly be put to the Council of Ministers.  I hope with this aid to increase basic headage payments this year in the more severely handicapped areas, including west Cavan, on all cattle other than beef cows, the rate for which has already been increased to £70 per head.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that particular attention has been and continues to be paid to enforcement of the street trading legislation in the Meath Street area.  Where the gardaí find a person in apparent breach of the legislation and he has not previously come <Col N="1237" /> under notice they may give him the benefit of a warning but, apart from that situation, it is their practice to bring legal proceedings where breaches of the legislation appear to have been committed.</P>
      <P>They have, however, found on a number of occasions that complaints made against particular traders from competing business interests were not confirmed by their own investigations and that, at times, trading that was the subject of complaint was not in fact in breach of the law.  A number of charges in respect of trading in this area are at present awaiting hearing.</P>

      <P>The projected number of post primary pupils who will avail themselves of school transport under the Department's transport scheme from Ashbourne to Dublin over the next three years is not expected to change substantially from the existing level.</P>
