      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach, in view of the still very dangerous and fluid state of affairs pertaining in the Mediterranean, the situation in Libya and the danger of an escalation of that, whether the Government have in mind or can give us any indication of any action which might be taken either in the UN or in the Council of Foreign Ministers of the EC to make some contribution to ameliorating this very dangerous and threatening situation.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1986: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress last evening I had referred to the need for lower energy costs to be reflected in the prices charged by manufacturers and those providing services to the consumer.  The Government's attempt to set the proper framework for any economic upturn that might come by adopting the necessary measures to help to reduce inflation and laying a proper <Col N="883" /> foundation for recovery will be undone should it happen that the reduction in energy costs is not passed on to the consumer.  It will be very harsh if that does not happen.  If that were not to happen it would undo the hard work undertaken by the Government and people generally over the last few years.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, therefore, it can be accepted that the correct foundations have now been laid for economic recovery but, unless lower energy costs are passed on to the consumer, all of our efforts and sacrifices will have been in vain.  That remark stems from a reference last evening to petrol price increases which, ironically, were introduced in the budget.  It is worth mentioning also that in some quarters the price increases introduced by the Government in relation to petrol, diesel and so on &mdash; in a peculiar way &mdash; may well benefit the consumer in the sense that it would have put psychological pressure on suppliers to take cognisance of reduced world oil prices when that becomes obvious.  Therefore, there would have been psychological pressure on them to respond to those reduced world oil prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy explain that a little better; I do not follow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be worth elaborating somewhat more.  My argument is that had that price increase not been effected by the Government at that time, it is probable that the 8p per gallon would not have been passed on to the consumer, would have been absorbed and, in some peculiar way, the consumer might have reaped the benefit in, say, six months time.  My reason for advancing that argument is that there are a number of other agencies operating in the State at present who have indicated that they might in the future reduce the level of their charges for services on the basis of lower energy costs.  That is rather peculiar because those lower costs have arisen in the last six months.  I do not want to labour the <Col N="884" /> point; I know it is not entirely relevant but it is worth mentioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I still do not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to note that there is a greater concentration of Members on that side of the House this morning than there was last evening.  I am grateful for the audience.</P>
      <P>The other point I wanted to make had to do with Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks when he painted a great deal of gloom, doom and misery.  He forgot to mention the improved child benefit scheme incorporated in the budget and the Finance Bill.  We should not allow such improvements to go unmentioned.  I do not expect the Opposition to do so, but it behoves us on this side of the House to bring to public attention improvements of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; I do not want to interrupt the Deputy's flow of oratory &mdash; but it is traditional that a member of the Government at least occupy the front bench during the debate on the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like doing it but I want to give notice that, unless a member of the Government appears very shortly, I am going to call for a quorum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think somebody is about to arrive to fulfil the necessary obligations.  Deputy O'Kennedy compared our economic situation here with that in Europe generally.  In fairness I do not think we have been in a position for a very long time to compare favourably with any of our trading or European partners.  That is not to say that we should not strive to achieve a reasonable standard of competition.  Reference was made to the fact that our sales force, the various agencies employed in selling Ireland, its goods and services abroad, should be prepared <Col N="885" /> now to carry out an onslaught on world markets.  There is no sense in doing so unless our goods and services are competitive.  If they are not, then we shall not get the kind of response required.  If we are now in a position to capitalise on changing economic trends &mdash; which I believe we are &mdash; then we will be afforded an opportunity to carry out the type of onslaught called for last evening by Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy again but I am suggesting that it is total contempt for this House that we have no member of the Government to listen to the debate on the Finance Bill.  I have no alternative but to call for a quorum.</P>
      <P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Finance Bill will get an airing on all sides of the House so that it will be seen to be a constructive, if not over-ambitious Bill, the type of legislation at present required, recognising what we are all being told &mdash; that times are about to get better, that the economic situation is about to improve.  If we are to take advantage of that changing economic situation, there are two ways in which we can go about it.  First, as was done in the past, we could spend money regardless and, second, we could be more conservative, conserving our energies in order to take advantage of the external forces to improve our internal position. Having learned from previous unfortunate experiences, the latter would appear to be the better course.  When history comes to be written it will be recognised that good management and government are always in the interest of the country and the economy in the long term.  It is easy to accede to various requests which might have the effect of resolving short term problems, but that is not the answer to long term and longer lasting problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start on the note on which Deputy Durkan finished &mdash;<Col N="886" /> good government and good management will always find a special place in the history books when they come to be written.  I would not like to contemplate the record of this Government that will be written into the history books.  Rather than learning anything in three and a half years as Deputy Durkan said, the sacrifices of the last three years have been made, but as far as the ordinary people in the streets and towns and villages are concerned, the sacrifices were all in vain.</P>
      <P>When they leave office this Government will carry with them many political historical records.  Listening to Deputy Durkan and other Government speakers one would think they did not borrow any money at all while in Government, though the official record shows that the national debt has gone from £11.2 billion to more than £20.3 billion in the period of this Government.  The unfortunate thing is that there is very little to show for it.  Foreign borrowing, a major issue with the Government when they came to office, has been totally disregarded and has increased by between 50 per cent and 60 per cent.  They carry the record for a Government who borrowed the most money in the history of the State and have done the least with it.  They carry the record for presiding over the greatest increase in unemployment in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to deny the official records of the Government I do not mind, but if he wants to live in fantasy land and deal with fairy tales and not facts I cannot help him.  I think the Minister for Health will end up with more inmates for some of the places he was trying to close down in Carlow-Kilkenny if he is not careful.  I am speaking of official records produced by the Deputy's Government.  This is the Government who will have borrowed the most money in the history of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will <Col N="887" /> Deputies allow Deputy Reynolds to proceed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies want to deal in fancy figures I will deal with those fancy figures.  The Minister for Finance, speaks about optimism, the previous one more than the present one.  I welcome the new man back even though he may be a Lazarus who was resurrected from the dead but with a better grasp of what is happening out there in the world than the man who sat there and brought in four budgets.  Before the last budget I forecast that Deputy Dukes would not last very long, and he did not, because he does not know what the real world is all about.  If Deputies over there want to deal with percentages I will deal with them, but please let them not talk in highfalutin percentages to the people: talk in language that they can understand.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the previous Minister for Finance spend most of their time dealing with fancy statistics, tossing figures around like snuff at a wake. Deputy Dowling and Deputy Carey in Clare would understand that.  Reality was totally ignored.  If Deputies over there want to live in a fantasy land of their own, I assure them they will wake up when the general election comes.  They should examine the opinion polls, and I suggest they are doing far worse than the recent opinion polls have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy did not believe in opinion polls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies over there are sensible people and I am surprised they do not get the message through to some of the Ministers about how far they are along the wrong road.  I recognise the opinion polls as indicating trends, but I do not have to go to opinion polls.  If Deputies over there would go to their local pubs at night, or attend GAA matches, or go to bingo sessions, anywhere people are congregated, and listen to what the ordinary people are saying, they would not have to come in here to be told about the realities.  I heard Deputy <Col N="888" /> Bruton misusing the word &ldquo;optimism&rdquo; yesterday, followed by Deputy Durkan. They got the wrong word.  Of course, words have lost their meaning for this Government.  They say optimism abounds in the country.  I ask any sensible sane person to point out to us on this side the sector of the economy that shows optimism.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take them one by one.  Again and again in the past three and a half years we have found the forecasts totally misplaced.  Particularly in the last two and a half years we have had the Taoiseach and the previous Minister for Finance and Deputy Barry telling us that the economy was ready to take off.  We are still waiting.  We heard about the light at the end of the tunnel, but the light has not appeared yet.  They have not produced the goods after three and a half years and there is no sign of the goods being produced.  Deputy Durkan said that optimism should be taken up as a theme.  I would be the first to agree with him if there was optimism in the real world outside.  I would love to see it.  How could there be optimism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the various sectors of the economy and try to find this new optimism we have been hearing about. We will take the major sector of the economy, agriculture.  Would anybody in the House or the country deny that farmers are in a real crisis?  They are facing the greatest crisis ever experienced by them.  Would anybody deny it, whether he looks at cereals, beef or milk?  Last week I attended a meeting of a group of farmers in the midlands, attended by a Minister.  It was sad to hear the farmers say they never thought they would have to sit across a table and say to a Minister representing their constituency that their real fear is that the Government did not realise the extent of the crisis in agriculture.  The Government have shown no signs of doing anything about it because the Government have ignored totally the potential for agriculture to make a real contribution to the economy.  Apparently <Col N="889" /> the Government have written agriculture off.</P>
    <P>We now appreciate the poor bargaining that has gone on in the EC, the weakkneed approach not alone of the Minister for Agriculture but of the Government, in stark contrast to what the French Minister for Agriculture does for his agricultural sector because he knows on which side his bread is buttered.  We apparently are prepared to stand back and allow our farmers to pay a very dear price.  Recently in the monetary realignment talks the French looked for an 8 per cent devaluation.  Everybody laughed them out of court and they ended up not with a 3 per cent devaluation but 6 per cent which, I presume, was what they set out to get.  Why did they do it?  They did it for two reasons: one, to restore stability and competitiveness in their industrial sector; and, two, to look after the mainstay of their economy, agriculture.</P>
    <P>Our Government decided to stand still. However, when the German Mark was revalued by 3 per cent the Irish punt appreciated on the following Monday by 1¼ per cent and on Tuesday by almost 1 per cent.  Our agricultural exports going into Germany now carry a tax of 1½ per cent. I hope the Minister for Finance is as proud today as he tried to be on his return from the realignment talks saying that he had done a marvellous job for Ireland. He should ask the farming community about that.  He should ask our industrial exporters who, on the British market, are now faced with new competition from the French who enjoy a far more competitive position there than they do.  Our exporters to France operate at a total disadvantage.  That is the reality on the export market.</P>
    <P>What happened in relation to sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish punt?  For the last four to five years the average value of our punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling has been 82-82½ &mdash; the figure given by the Central Bank towards the end of the year.  Our exporters are now expected to operate at 88.95, which means that they are taking 5 per cent less for their products on the export market and the situation was far worse a month <Col N="890" /> ago.  They are taking a fall in prices and having to meet new competition.  Where is the optimism in the agricultural sector? It is not there.  Why are so many cattle being brought to the North of Ireland for killing instead of being killed down here? It is because we have priced ourselves out of the market with levy after levy. Conditions across the Border are much more advantageous.</P>
    <P>Disease eradication programmes have cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds and are not yet completed.  I am not being political about this, but when the £4 million cutback was imposed by the Government it totally undermined the confidence of the farming community in their efforts to get rid of TB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true and the Deputy knows that it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can check with Deputy Cooney, Minister for Education, as to the facts put before him last week in Mullingar regarding the crisis in agriculture.  Nobody can contradict the statements made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I got information from the IFA last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, they speak with divers tongues.  I am saying what was said to me in the presence of one of the Deputy's Ministers.  The Deputy can ask the Minister to write and tell the farming community that they do not know what they are talking about.  I am saying what is happening in my county, not in Kilkenny. Let other Deputies say what is happening in their own counties.  Disease is now on the upward trend.  Vets in agriculture will confirm that there will barely be enough money for one test this year in a county which has suffered so badly from disease. The farmers of Longford know how they are being treated by this Government. Three years ago, in reply to a parliamentary question by me the Minister said he was making arrangements for the setting up of a veterinary office in Longford. That has not yet come about.  A strong case is being made by the farmers and <Col N="891" /> the veterinary section from Roscommon who look after their interests that had there been facilities on the spot, without the disadvantage of 20 to 40 miles travelling every time there was an outbreak, it was believed that much more progress could have been made.</P>
      <P>There is no optimism in the agricultural sector and no signs of it.  How can one expect that sector to improve when they are asked to pay a penal interest rate, as is everybody else, whether in industry or agriculture?  This puts them out of line competitively with their counterparts in Europe.  That is one of the weaknesses of the Government's approach.  Some of the existing grants could be done away with. The best remedy would be cheap money over a period so that these farmers and industrialists know where they are going.</P>

      <P>There is a saying in my part of the country that if you do not know where you are going any road will get you there.  Any road will not get the results needed so badly.  The Government members can smile as much as they like, but they will find out when they come to the doors whether they will be greeted with smiles or have the doors slammed in their faces.  There is real hardship out there, whether the Government believe it or not.</P>

It was also on the table when Deputy Lenihan was Minister for Agriculture but it was not brought in on any <Col N="892" /> of those occasions.  The Deputy may draw his own conclusions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacSharry brought more benefits back from the EC in the short time that he was there than the Government would ever do if they were there for ten years.  Deputy Lenihan never accepted a super-levy.  The Deputy knows that as well as I do.  The blame cannot be laid on Ireland for the surpluses of milk.  That is well known.  Any Minister for Agriculture battling our cause can logically and sensibly say that those who create the surpluses should look after the problem.  We have never caused it.  Our contribution is a drop in the ocean with regard to surpluses of beef, butter or any dairy products.  These have been caused by factory farming among other EC members.</P>
      <P>We are told that we are helping the Third World in letting in their exports. On investigation, I found that it was not helping the Third World.  The cheap tapioca and other cereals coming from Thailand were the result of investment by Dutch and German industrialists who were using that country as a Third World base and using slave labour.  They shipped the cereals back for factory farming in the EC, producing vast quantities of milk, beef, cereals and other products. Ireland has relied and will always have to rely to a large extent on a thriving agricultural industry and it is expected to pay these penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC are now going down a different road.  They want to introduce a milk cessation scheme which will take farmers out of milk production, take the present quota out of the national kitty and dispense with it or place it somewhere else.  I warn the Government to be on their guard.  We cannot at present increase our production in milk.  The quotas are poor enough and we will not put them back into the EC kitty.  Let <Col N="893" /> those who cause the major problems do that.  That is our stand and I hope it is the stand of the Government.  If so, we would be united at least on one thing as we fight our nation's cause in Brussels.  The agricultural crisis exists and nothing is being done about it.  The farmers badly need cheap finance.  One can see that with the high cost of money which the beef producers have to pay they cannot make a profit.  Beef production is a very capital-intensive area which costs much in borrowing.  In many farm enterprises there will be no replacement of stock after this year.  Cereal growers are in a similar situation.  The artificially high interest rate on borrowing over the last couple of years has had a greater effect on dampening economic activity than many of the things we will spend days talking about here.  I ask the Government at least to recognise that there is a crisis in agriculture.  Investment in agriculture has decreased by 50 per cent during the term of this Government, but any investment there gives a better return in national economic terms than any other items I know of.</P>
    <P>I wish the new Minister every success in his new appointment.  He is a man with whom I share many views.  He certainly put his stamp on some parts of the budget, a few Bruton touches which I welcome.  Unfortunately, he has not gone far enough; but at least he has given an indication that he recognises some of the real problems in relation to industrial development.  He is setting out to do something about those problems and has taken the first steps in some areas.  I welcome those steps and I will deal in greater detail with the technical aspects and how they might be improved when discussing the Bill on Committee Stage.  I welcome the attempts to get equity capital into Irish industry.  This is an area of great weakness.  The high interest rates and the high cost of borrowing, not only to industry but to every other sector, have taken their toll on many factories and many have been unable to stand the financial charges and have gone out of business.</P>
    <P>What is happening outside, away from <Col N="894" /> the budget which was presented here some time ago, will have a much greater impact on our economy than anything done in the budget.  We have a budget of approximately £9 billion.  We spent a whole day introducing the budget and we will spend three or four days on Second Stage of this Bill, followed by further debate on Committee Stage.  We are just tinkering with the problem, talking about the movement of approximately £250 million around a circle &mdash; money is taken out of one sector and put into another, spreading a bit here and a bit there.  That will not make any fundamental change in the economic direction of the country, no matter how long we talk about it or argue about which way it should be done.  Basically we are talking about the movement of 2.5 per cent of the total budget and we are ignoring the 97½ per cent, about which it seems to be accepted year after year that nothing can be done.  If we accept the logic we will never do anything about the serious structural, fundamental financial problems in the economy.  We must not fool ourselves into believing that we will solve any problems by arguing about the movement of 2.5 per cent of the budget.  We must be prepared to look at the other 97.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is no point in making glossy speeches.  Members of the Government parties feel they have to re-echo optimism which does not actually exist outside.  They try to argue that there are great reliefs for the PAYE sector in this budget.  They should not try to be illusionists like the former Minister for Finance who tried to convince people last year that his budget contained great benefits and that everybody would be better off. Halfway through the year people knew they were not better off.  The same thing will happen this year and that is why this budget died a death after 24 hours in the public arena.  This time people were prepared; they did their calculations and realised that they would not be better off.  Relief for the PAYE sector is nonexistent because according to the figures in the budget a further 6.5 per cent will be taken in tax from that sector this year. <Col N="895" /> The Minister cannot deny it or try to walk away from it.</P>
    <P>Basically this budget hangs on an expansion of the tax base.  This expansion was presented here as a tax on financial institutions but that is not the reality. Perhaps the Labour Party bought that line originally and believed there would be a shift from the PAYE sector to the financial institutions.  If that is the line they were sold and the line they bought, I can understand their going along with it.  However, when one takes away all the niceties, one realises that it is the depositors in the financial institutions who will have to pay, while in the insurance area it is the people who have invested their savings in index-linked bonds who will be paying.  Such people are preparing an income to enjoy at the end of their working life.  I have examined the figures very closely and looked at the figures on deposit in the banks.  I will go along with the deposit interest retention tax in regard to people who can afford to pay but I will not accept that old age pensioners should be penalised or that there will be no more changes, as the Minister said yesterday.  One of the basic fundamental parts of any taxation system is to ensure that equity is carried through in so far as it is possible.</P>

      <P>It is utter nonsense for any Minister or bureaucrat to suggest to such people that they can get a refund of the tax paid.  We know these people are not in a position to fill up these forms.  It <Col N="896" /> is totally inequitable to impose that stress and strain upon them.  I will not accept that the Minister cannot change his figures and give them total exemption. That is the area of the tax to which I object totally.  I will not object in respect of people with large deposits or perhaps ten different accounts in the banking institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw a clear distinction between those who can afford to pay and the elder sections of our society. Anybody who goes along with the proposal in the Bill cannot pretend to have any care or compassion for these people. Only 12 months ago Government Ministers were advising people throughout the midlands and the west to put their money in the banks where it would be safe.  No sooner was the money in the banks than they put in the greedy hand to take 35 per cent of the income from it.  People were told to avoid the risk of being battered and mugged while their houses were ransacked for money, especially elderly people living alone or with a sister.  That sector of the community thought that 35 per cent of their total income was about to be taken.  I am sure Deputy Carey heard that too.  It is indicative of the fear which has been struck among these people.  It is a total nonsense to say that they cannot be given an exemption.  We are told time and again by successive Ministers for Finance that certain things cannot be done, but if there is a will there is a way.  If the Minister calls the tune he can make sure it is done. He is treading on very dangerous ground if he believes that this matter cannot be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the logic of applying that tax to many of the organisations that I am aware of.  There are exemptions <Col N="897" /> in respect of those which can be determined as charities within the law but that is a very arbitrary situation because at the end of the day only the Revenue Commissioners will decide which groups are charities.  A better definition is needed in this respect.  It is unlikely that anyone here would agree with a Government who would introduce a tax on deposits in respect of group water schemes.  It cannot be said that the people involved in these schemes are involved from the point of view of making profit.  There are many other examples also.  Many charitable organisations are under the impression that they will be exempted from the tax but, like the PAYE sector, they will find out during the coming year that that is not the position.  There is no justification for imposing a tax on First Communion money, Confirmation money or on money saved by old people to ensure that they do not leave debts behind them and that they are given decent burials.  The greedy hand of the Government is being spread across the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan has told us of the benefits that will flow from the child benefit scheme but that, too, is a con job. In Sunday papers recently the Government must have spent up to £25,000 in an effort to con the people into believing that some wonderful benefits would accrue from this scheme but as in other instances, the people were told only half the story.  In simple terms, this scheme will mean that for a person with three children, the increase at £36 per year in respect of each child, will amount to £108.  However, what the people have not been told by way of these advertisements is that if the income earner in the family is paying tax at the rate of 35 per cent the child benefit scheme will mean an increase of £3 per year for a family of three children or £1 per year for each child.  That is calculated on the basis of £35 multiplied by three and taking into account the abolition of the £100 child allowance.  In other words, the increase will amount to 2 pence per week per child while thousands of pounds have been spent on the advertisements informing the public of the scheme.  This is the level <Col N="898" /> of increase being offered at a time when the prices for such items as milk, butter and bread and also electricity and telephone charges have been increased. Again, this is a con job on the part of the Government.  When will they ever learn the dear lesson that such efforts are not successful?  Last year half way through the period covered by the budget they were forced to tell the people the truth.  The Government cannot be convinced that the PAYE sector will be better off as a result of this year's budgetary measures.</P>
    <P>I turn now to an even more important subject.  Reference has been made to the two major problems of our country. These are taxation and jobs.  I heard the Minister yesterday trying to put a face on the Government's proposals, to indicate that the budgetary measures would result in the creation of jobs and he talked about the building and construction industry.  He told us that that industry was given a major boost by the programme introduced in October last.  However, the final nail in the coffin of the building and construction industry was hammered in last year when the then Minister for Finance increased VAT on the industry from 5 to 10 per cent.  I do not thing the Government realised the serious implications of that decision.  During a discussion on television on the evening the announcement had been made and in which the present Minister for Finance took part, I became aware from his reaction that he had not realised the implications of the measure.  Despite that and despite all the evidence available to the Government to indicate the mistake they made, they have not rectified the matter this year either.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister tried to convince us that there will be a great improvement in the building and construction industry but he is only fooling himself as anyone involved in that industry knows well.  Even a perusal of the recent returns for cement sales indicate that.  This industry has been devastated in the past three and a half years. During that time one out of every two people who up to then were employed in the industry is no longer employed.  One <Col N="899" /> fails to understand the economic logic being pursued by the Government when they say that it is not good policy to borrow money for investing in the building and construction industry.  The opposite is the case.  Money invested in this industry circulates within the economy because it is an industry in which 93 per cent of the materials used are Irish produced and in which the total labour force is Irish.  Can anyone deny that there is not an amount of building and construction work to be carried out?  The EC Commission in recent reports on the Irish economy point clearly to the defects in our infrastructure and indicate that the way to remedy these defects is by capital investment.  The Government choose to ignore that advice.  They seem to be convinced that all builders are supporters of Fianna Fáil.  As the Minister of State who has just arrived knows, that is not the case.</P>

      <P>What about the £200 million extra in respect of house improvement grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister of State was attending to the problems of his constituents he might not interject so quickly.  After the announcement of the new house improvement grants there was a rush of applications to the Department but when we saw the Estimates we realised that the amount being devoted to the house improvement grants would not pay the grants in respect of half the applications that had been received at that stage, not to mention the many other applications that were expected to arrive during the year.  We waited for some revelation from the Minister as to how he would cope with that problem and the answer is becoming clear.  In the first place, there was not a sufficient inspectorate to deal with the applications.  Then there was the announcement that anyone who had applied before a certain date in February would be notified by a certain date in March to the effect that the work could be undertaken without inspection. <Col N="900" /> The letters that followed must be read carefully.  For instance, they include the statement that the Minister would apply standard building costs in respect of his estimate for the work.  Then followed what might be regarded as a contradiction of the term, &ldquo;house improvement grant", because that paragraph stipulates that softwood windows and doors can be replaced only, so far as the grant is concerned, with other softwood windows and doors.  In other words, if one wishes to improve his house by installing hardwood or aluminium windows or doors, he will not be eligible for the grant in that respect.  A person should wait for the inspector to come to inspect the windows and the doors.  He will then decide if they were in bad enough shape to be removed. If he decides that they were not then one will not get a grant but the job has been already done.</P>
      <P>Recently I have seen a situation where an inspector called on a client where two contractors had tendered for a job for £1,478 and £1,410.  The inspector estimated the job at £620.  The person would therefore be paid a grant <i>pro rata</i> at £620 for the job.  It is now quite clear where the gap in the figures will be made up. Either half the applications that have been received will not be paid or they will all be paid at half the rate which the people intended to get.  That is the reality of the house improvement grant scheme. No longer can a person know before he starts a job how much he will get.  One is also deprived of the opportunity of going into a bank with a grant approval to get a bridging loan in order to carry out the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>If I was a Minister it would not happen in my constituency <Col N="901" /> either.  That is the reality of politics. Although we have a Minister in the other half of my constituency he does not seem to look after the half in which I live.  The inspectors do not come out for five or six months.  I am all for house improvement grants but the Irish people should not be conned.  I hate to think about who will have to pay the bills and who will solve all the arguments at the end of the day. The inspector will be left in a no-win situation.  He is under orders when he visits people not to approve the amount of money because it is not there to be paid.  He will be either told not to pass the job because it was not bad enough to be done in the first place or, if he does, it will be by the standard costs in the Department.  At this stage the person will have already spent the money anyway. Those standards are long out of date.  I had to advise an old man who was going to borrow £3,000, along with £2,000 which he had saved, to carry out repairs to his house, not to proceed.  I have had limited experience in that regard.  I know he would not have got the money and I did not want to see him die of heart failure when he owed the bank £3,000. He thought he would get a grant to pay for it which we all know from our experience that he would not get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the great package in October was the tax reform package.  Has that disappeared?  The Taoiseach came in here in a flurry and spoke about a tax reform package.  When we draw back the curtain we find that there was no tax reform.  It was getting at the collection of tax.  We have heard about the appointment of sheriffs.  They were not appointed yet.  I asked time and time again in this House when those sheriffs would be appointed and if we would need legislation to appoint them but it drew no response.  In more recent inquiries I found that there are moves being made to appoint what are called revenue sheriffs. Let me point out, before we travel that road, the sort of potholes we will fall into. They are also getting more numerous every day.  Some people in my constituency think that it is not potholes they are looking at any more but swimming pools <Col N="902" /> which have been provided by the Government at no cost.</P>
    <P>When the revenue sheriffs are appointed they will be solicitors who will operate in particular areas.  They will also carry on their own practice.  There will be a clear conflict of interest.  There are sheriffs in Dublin and Cork; we are not talking about those.  If anybody goes to a provincial town in Ireland and appoints a solicitor as a revenue sheriff would he suggest to me that that solicitor will carry out his duties in that area and lose either existing customers or potential new customers?  No, he will not.  It is nonsense and we should forget about it.  The Minister should forget that he ever made the announcement and go back to the county registrar system.  He should change the law to give them the powers which would make it possible for them to collect the money which the new sheriffs would collect.</P>
    <P>One of the areas which should be looked at is the laws of attachment.  There are too many buccaneers going around playing ducks and drakes with the whole taxation system.  The way to strengthen the law is to give those people the powers of attachment to put an attachment on a grant or payment from a Government Department, or to put an attachment on weekly salaries.  We should not be running away with fancy new layers of bureaucracy called revenue sheriffs who at the end of the day will not do the job because they are going to look after themselves in the first instance.  That is common sense.  They will not take action against their own customers, potential customers, relations of customers or relations of potential customers.  We are all sensible people who live in rural Ireland and we know what would happen.  We would end up with the worst of both worlds again.</P>
    <P>It is time that the taxation system was grappled by the neck and torn apart.  How long more will fine reports from the Commission on Taxation have to lie on shelves?  We all recognise that the taxation system has choked itself to death. We are tinkering around at the edges, talking about a sum of £250 million when <Col N="903" /> we should be looking at what way we can improve the taxation system.  Obviously this Government have set their face against what I call real tax reform.  If that is the case so be it.  In the short time that they will remain in office I would ask them to try to remove some of the backlog in the tax collection system.  They should start by recognising that the whole system has caught up on itself.</P>
    <P>They will now present the Revenue Commissioners and the taxation authorities with another Finance Bill of 110 sections.  I spoke to Revenue Commissioners not long ago who said, the sooner sanity comes into Dáil Éireann the better and the sooner they decide to make no changes in the financial provisions of the Finance Bill the better, until we are up to date with last year's Finance Bill.  How much more arrears will be piled up this year?  We will stand up here and say, why are they not collecting their money?  If we go behind the scenes we will find out what the real clogs in the business are. That is a major contributory factor to it. The other one was applying the Civil Service embargo to the Revenue Commissioners when they could have been earning their own money.  That is a blunt instrument which should never have been applied across the board.  It applied in some areas which cannot produce anything but it is economic lunacy to employ an embargo in a area such as the Revenue Commissioners.  It means that we end up with a very poor tax collection system. The people involved should not be blamed.</P>
    <P>Would this Government, even at this late stage, consider that it is well worth their while saying to the people that we will have self-assessment, even for one or two years, instead of trying to look at penalties and close loopholes.  The penalties could be increased ten times over if that is what it takes so that people would make a reasonable assessment.  Chartered accountants who operate on behalf of companies, businesses and private individuals should also be informed of the self-assessment system.  When they work out the amount that is due and <Col N="904" /> are sending in their tax returns to the Revenue Commissioners they should also send in the cheque for the figure which they have calculated.  In this way we will get in money and at the same time take pressure off the system and give a breathing space to the people who are trying to sort it out.  We will contribute even further to that by passing a Finance Bill with 110 sections in God knows how many minutes.  We are only fooling ourselves, going around in circles.  We should look at the real problems and then set about producing some of the solutions to them.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of taxation reform which I thought might have been forthcoming last October but alas my forlorn hopes have been dashed so often with announcement after announcement from this Government.  We talk of 3,000 jobs being produced out of the grant improvement scheme.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, is well known for his confident projections and the optimism he expresses.  We have only to look back over the last number of years to see that this confidence has been totally misplaced in many areas.  The Minister was totally confident.  I am only repeating his own words, when he presented in this House a marvellous package for investment in Dublin Gas which should have made a lot of money for this project and earned a lot of profit for the taxpayer. He said he had all the best people in Ireland checking the figures.  It took a very short time for that pack of cards to collapse.  I have not all the facts as to why, so I am not going to point the finger of culpability.  I am saying this as an example of the confidence and optimism expressed by the present Minister for Finance which so often in the past have been totally misplaced and unfounded.  They are not going to give us the sort of situation that the Minister would like the people of the country to believe.</P>
    <P>Unemployment, by any analysis, is continuing to rise.  From last month's figures it was very worrying to see that the underlying trend is one of an increase despite the fact that we finally have projections from the CSO who accept that there will be an emigration figure of <Col N="905" /> 15,000 a year and who have agreed that up to April 1985 we had an emigration figure of 14,000.  Despite that fact, which has taken the pressure off unemployment benefits and kept the unemployment figure artificially down, the underlying trend is upwards.  That is not a very satisfying picture for those of us who are rearing families.  A few changes have been made in taxation, particularly in relation to capital gains tax through the new across the counter scheme which is being introduced by the Stock Exchange. This is a very welcome scheme.  The Minister has recognised that you cannot trade in those shares and has reduced capital gains tax to 30 per cent.  Thirty per cent may look a good reduction and I welcome it from the Minister as a realisation of the reality of the business world today but it is still the highest rate of capital gains tax in Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the scheme will succeed in trading any great amount of shares at 30 per cent.  At least, it will have to come to about 20 per cent before it will show benefits.  Remember, we are not asking for money from the Exchequer and I am not making a proposal that is going to cost any more money.  If shares are not traded, nothing happens.  If we do not sell shares, there is no capital gain. What I am saying is, set it at a realistic pitch which will encourage the trading of small shares on the Stock Exchange and help get Irish companies away from over dependence on the huge borrowing requirements which they have had to endure for the last number of years.  Let shares be sold and forget about the miserly approach of bureaucrats who say that you have to pin everything down. This is one of the major mistakes the Government made with their very good business expansion scheme which I talked about in 1983, 1984 and 1985.  The straitjacket of bureaucratic thinking is still running through it time and again. The Minister made some changes but he has not accepted the reality which is to let it loose and operate first and then tighten the screws later.  That is what they have done in the UK where it has been very successful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> It is nonsense for the Minister to suggest that that scheme has been a raving success when it has raised £5 million from Irish industry for equity participation out of an annual availability of about £500 million to £600 million.  Less than 1 per cent of the availability of funds has come into Irish industry under the business expansion scheme when most of its equity requirements should come from that area and will not come from that area until the restrictions are removed.  I have pointed these out in budget debate after budget debate and in many other areas as well.  If you screw everything up before it starts, it will not start.  If you let it start and get it up and running, at the end of the day you will collect much more revenue.  You have a more buoyant economy and you have created a better climate for enterprise while letting investment do what the Government would like to see it doing.</P>
    <P>Whatever we say or do in this House in relation to the Finance Bill it will have little impact on what happens because what is happening out in the real world today is what will impact on this economy.  The American attack on the Libyans could spark off a situation such as the Suez Canal crisis.  We know how that could turn the world upside down.  One thing is certain, the Minister has used the wrong word when he mentioned optimism.  The word the Minister should be using is &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; because an opportunity is now presenting itself which was unrecognisable six, nine or 12 months ago through the collapse in world oil prices. This has brought with it falling inflation. It is no good for the Government to clap themselves on their backs saying they have brought inflation down because the real test is what is the inflation rate in countries into which we are going to export.  If you examine those, we have a long way to go to beat their inflation rates.  That is the true test.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants me to talk about the British economy and how Ireland is going to fare, will he tell me how Irish exporters are supposed to take a 5 per cent to 6 per cent drop in sales price for goods because of the sterling-punt currency arrangements? We would want to be at minus 2 per cent to be able to sell our goods to the UK at present.  That is reality.  We need to look at the inflation rates in West Germany, Belgium and France and see how we are faring there and look at how much they are being charged in interest rates in whatever sector they operate and compare those with the figures here.  Those are the areas that will decide how our economy will fare.  If we are to accept the opportunity and the challenge that has been presented to us by falling oil prices and the lowering of inflation the Government have to decide that there is a fundamental adjustment to be made.  The benefits accruing from that falling inflation, and the falling oil prices, and the devaluation of the dollar and of sterling will have to be made to flow right through this economy or it will not lift itself out of the depression in which it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are pluses and minuses in this situation.  Let the Minister take this opportunity to tell the House, in the light of the pluses and minuses of the new situation, how much money the Exchequer is saving on servicing the national debt.  There is a 25 to 30 per cent devaluation in the dollar where, I understand, about 42 per cent of our borrowings are. What saving is there?  Let us not talk about Mickey Mouse figures of £7 million here and £10 million there.  We are talking about hundreds of millions in this new situation.  Tell me how much we are saving in relation to borrowings in sterling because of the appreciation of the púnt <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling?  I know there will be a minus in whatever money we <Col N="908" /> have borrowed in the German mark.  Tell us what that figure is too and that will be a minus one, perhaps not particularly strong.  That is the situation in relation to servicing the national debt and that is the gospel that has been preached around on that side of the House for the last three years about servicing the national debt. This is the new situation.  Give me the pluses and the minuses and then we will know how to set this economy on the right road.</P>
    <P>Let us take the next stage from that. The Government have to make up their minds once and for all that we live now in a new situation and that falling energy prices means that, whether the Government like it or not, they are going to have to do with less revenues from natural gas. One cannot live in the world of unreality, thinking that one can keep the price of gas up, making sure the revenues for the Exchequer are up and at the same time hope to sell it.  It just will not happen. The realities of life have to be faced. Natural gas is going to have to be sold at a competitive price <i>vis-à-vis</i> oil, because when the energy policy was formulated by this Government they said they were going to sell natural gas at a price relative to oil prices.  Oil prices are as low today as they were before the oil crisis of 1973-74.  We know what prices we were paying for electricity then, for petrol, for diesel and for everything else.  How do we get back to that readjusted situation?  The Government have not even started to think about it; or, if they have, they have not shown any indication in the general public arena or in this House that they have started to think about it.  Indeed, it is that non-realisation of the reality of reducing gas prices that had to be a major contributory factor in the appointment of a receiver to Dublin Gas last week, because they were entitled to a reduction in the price of gas.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of who sells our natural gas, whether it is the private sector or the public sector, the reality is that they are going to have to take less profit.  The Government must face up to the reality that all Governments since 1973 have used the excuse of very expensive <Col N="909" /> increases in costs of oil and everything else to add on tax as a sort of a stick to make sure energy was conserved.  I am sure our Minister for Finance was as culpable as anybody else.  The reality is that that excuse no longer exists.  It does not exist for this Government and it will not exist for the next Government either.  We have to think in terms of removing all the lovely taxes that were supposed to be in the best interests of keeping our balance of payments down and making sure that we did not use as much oil as we were using.  The reality now is that there is an abundance of oil out there.  There is an abundance of energy at different costs. The Government cannot justify keeping a tax on the ESB.  They cannot justify all the heavy part of the taxation on petrol, diesel and everything else.  The reason these taxes were put on no longer exists. That is another bitter pill for Governments to have to swallow.  But until they and all the agencies under their control start on that process of readjustment this economy cannot begin to recover.  There are spurts here and there but I am talking about the general recovery which we need so badly to provide more jobs for our young people and to stop this ravage of emigration.  The Government have to start there.</P>
    <P>There are also many areas under their control.  It is an insult to the domestic consumers to ask them to wait until next September for a reduction in ESB prices when they paid every two months when oil was on the way up and the dollar was on the way up.  All sorts of excuses were used to put up the ESB bill.  Now, when costs have come down again this Government are trying to tell domestic consumers to wait until September to get the benefit.  It is also an insult to industrial, commercial and business activity to think that they can only get a reduction of 4 to 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister for Energy took the whole matter in hand in relation to reduction in energy costs realising that we have to be competitive.  The private sector and those people out there who are trying to export goods for us to keep this country alive need to be competitive <Col N="910" /> in the world in which they have to operate.  They are operating at a disadvantage in relation to currency realignments. They are operating at a disadvantage in relation to inflation and there is very little more they can do in relation to their own situation of competitiveness.  But the sheltered sector of this economy, the ESB, Telecom Éireann, An Post, who have recently put up their prices, should be made bring them back down again because there is no justification for putting up those prices.</P>
    <P>The postal service has one of the largest transport fleets.  Would anybody seriously suggest that the reduction in energy costs does not impact on their costs?  I would like to see their recent price increases justified just as I would like to see Telecom Éireann's recent price increases justified.  Perhaps there is a different reason in the case of Telecom Éireann.  But let nobody try to tell me that falling energy costs has not a major impact on their cost structure.  Why is the benefit not being passed on?  The same goes for the ESB.</P>
    <P>One of the fundamental mistakes being made by the Government is that they projected an inflation rate of 4½ per cent at the start of this year.  All the budget estimates were put together on the basis of that 4½ per cent inflation this year.  So, by their own actions, the Government have institutionalised a 4½ per cent inflation rate for this year.  The Minister knows and I know that it is going to be much less than that, possibly about 3 per cent and perhaps even 2 per cent.  The lower the better.  The Government should go back and take out the Book of Estimates and recast in all the areas where the impact of falling oil prices and all the various changes that have occurred since they were produced.  If the fat is left there it will be spent and that is not the way to get down inflation to the levels to which we have to get it down and it is not the way to make a contribution to the competitiveness of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>The Government have to do their homework just as industry has to do its homework.  The Government should start now.  They have not even come to <Col N="911" /> recognise it.  It is nonsense to suggest that there are no savings possible in a Book of Estimates that was produced on the basis of 4½ per cent inflation when the Minister comes in and talks about 2 to 3 per cent.  I hope he is right and I hope it is lower than that.  But it is nonsense to suggest that no savings could be made and if they are there they must be taken out of the system.  If they are not they will be used, as my short experience in Government taught me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey had the experience of seeing Clare County Council offered money in October or November and they had it spent before December knowing that in the worst weather conditions they would get the worst value for money. The same maxim applies in Government Departments.  If the fat is left there it will be spent and the taxpayer will not get value for it.  So for somebody to try to suggest that there are no savings in a Book of Estimates and a budget that was prepared on the basis of 4½ per cent inflation when it is going to come down to somewhere between 2 and 3 per cent, is nonsense.  It will be a good exercise in discipline for the Government Departments and all the State agencies to go back and look at the situation again.  If they are not prepared to take these fundamental decisions to pass on the benefits of the new challenges that exist in the world economy, the economy will not recover.  There are changes.  There will also be a minus because the balance of trade will shift now from where it was in the past number of years, in the Middle East.  When the oil crises of 1973 and 1979 occurred the wealth of the western economies was transferred to the Middle East.  They had all the money.  The situation is now changed with the drop in oil prices.  But in the meantime we have developed much trade out there whether we want to talk about Libya, Kuwait, Saudia Arabia and so on.  We have done a lot of business and developed many markets out there.  World trade is going to change and the new increases in markets in the world are now back to the industrialised nations.  We should beam <Col N="912" /> our marketing operations into the areas where the new opportunities exist and where the new demand will be.  We have to discount the trade we will lose in the Middle East because of the wealth transfer, but yesterday's events could change even that.</P>
    <P>That is my interpretation of the present situation.  We now have an opportunity which, if taken, will help us to take the first step out of the economic mess in which we find ourselves.  It is no joy for us as politicians to say that after three and a half years we have not yet decided the direction we are to travel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill puts into effect the proposals in the budget.  It is difficult to follow a colourful speech from Deputy Reynolds.  He is very outspoken. When he dons his businessman's hat he makes a very substantial contribution on industry, commerce and finance but when he discusses the political side, using emotive clichés, he goes overboard.  His presentation is too theatrical.  Admittedly, each year in his contribution he comes around to one idea, that is, whether the way we debate this Bill is the correct way to do it, and the fact that we are allowing three days to debate a Bill which deals with the way the economy is treated by Parliament.  I admire the way he works.  He criticises the way things are done and that is good for the House, but as far as confidence in the institutions of the State and the business side is concerned, I do not know if the budget is having the desired effect or if the Finance Bill is either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Reynolds I believe Dáil reform should take another look at how we treat this important aspect of life. This institution of State is most important because the Minister for Finance and the public sector control more than half the income of this economy.  As Deputy Reynolds pointed out, we have one Finance Bill after another bringing in amendments and changes.  This Finance Bill is very long and complex.  I wonder if one Minister for Finance will consolidate all finance legislation.  I believe Deputy <Col N="913" /> Bruton is the man who could undertake a complete reorganisation of the financial situation, and he would do this successfully in the interests of the economy and employment.</P>
    <P>I contrast this with the efforts of Fianna Fáil.  Each year they suggest different methods.  Last year Deputy Haughey and Deputy O'Connell said there would be a second budget before very long, but one of the successes of this Government has been that they insisted on Departments meeting their targets.  If buoyancy is created by falling inflation, the Minister for Finance will be only too glad to undertake a redistribution of available finance to improve the economic outlook.  I admit that in previous years when we had high inflation, decisions were made, a great deal of money was misspent, and there were rumours of Departments having large sums of money left over at the end of the year and making a mad rush to spend that money before the year concluded.  That is not good for the economy and I hope it will not happen again.  The Minister should take note of this and remedy the situation before the Government face the next election.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister spoke about optimism.  I would not quibble with Deputy Reynold's interpretation that there is a great opportunity opening to us because all the current indicators show that there will be an expected growth in the economy in the coming year.  This fact was highlighted very sharply in recent times because of the dramatic fall in oil prices.  It has been said that we should take this opportunity to build a manufacturing base which will be sustained for many years.  The forecast made in the quarterly economic bulletin of the EIU indicated that there would be a bright outlook for various sectors in the economy.  They spoke about inflation continuing to fall.  They said the 1986 budget had returned to indirect taxes, that increases were expected to add nearly 1 per cent, and that falling energy prices would help to compensate for that. The expected inflation rate of 2 per cent is heartening when one looks at earlier figures which were as high as 22 per cent. <Col N="914" /> Whether this is the result of outside forces or of action taken by the Government, it encourages people to invest.</P>
    <P>In considering the financial situation, the Government have been right to make adjustments in income tax, especially for the PAYE sector.  Irrespective of what the Opposition say, the Minister is setting aside £120 million in relief for the PAYE taxpayers.  That is a significant gesture, although it has been criticised because, it was said, it was not enough.  Rebates will be paid on taxation paid on investments. I think the reason why tax is being paid on certain deposit accounts arose because the number of deposit accounts is abnormally high &mdash; seven million.  There is also a new phenomenon &mdash; tax evasion in the non-resident account sector.  I understand the money in non-resident accounts amounts to approximately £3,000 million.  I believe much of this money is part of the fund the rumour brigade people were talking about in this House last year.  They were talking about money running out of the country.  Certain Irish people have taken to evading their responsibility of opening non-resident accounts and the amount of money involved in this is very substantial.  An onus lies on the Minister to clear up this area.  Part of our problem has been that very little equity has been taken up, as was admitted by the previous speaker, Deputy Reynolds.  As a result of taxing these deposit takers, more emphasis will result in the financial institutions on proper investment because it will force them away from deposit taking to equity.</P>
    <P>In this area we have heard emotive cries on behalf of the old folk, and rightly so.  Old folk have had the habit of hoarding money.  Last year the Government asked people to invest their funds in banks and thus reduce the rash of attacks that had taken place in remote areas. However, in bringing forward this taxation the Government are trying to resolve a major problem area; certainly they are not after old folks' small accounts.  In the current situation the Minister's gesture at least has recognised <Col N="915" /> the problem.  The Minister also recognises the problems of charities.  Institutions such as credit unions and certain Post Office accounts avoid taxation on interest.  Savings certificates which are tax free can be purchased and they carry an attractive rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds mentioned local voluntary bodies such as water groups.  Such bodies should utilise the local credit unions and keep their money in their locality.  A better group water scheme will result if the people participating in it can be indentified locally, and they will have credit in their locality.  This reform in the taxation system will highlight the advantage of credit unions and will highlight for local people the advantage of the Post Office facilities.  People criticise the non-use of the Post Office, but in this new climate greater encouragement will be given to old folk to deposit their money in these very convenient offices. The Post Office will be found in each parish.  Most of the people employed in the institutions I have mentioned are very friendly and helpful.  If people have an option that is the one they should choose.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the Finance Bill is improving various areas relating to profit sharing.  In section 8 he has reduced from seven years to five years the period in which profit sharing must be retained. The benefit of this is really in industrial relations.  I commend the Minister for this change.  In the mid-west region because of the nature of the employment the income earned by ordinary workers in companies was much higher than that earned in native industry because the employees took advantage of the profit sharing scheme.</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to a company in my parish, Syntex Ireland Ltd., a large number of whose employees took advantage of the profit sharing scheme.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Bruton, very much for promoting this scheme when he was Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  As Minister for Finance he is improving further on it. An aspect about the effective date of this change is whether it should apply from when the <Col N="916" /> law originated or, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, from 1986-87.  I ask the Minister to have another look at this section and, as a gesture to the people who took their courage in both hands and invested in the profit sharing scheme, to consider changing this to when the law regarding profit sharing was first enacted.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Reynolds talking once again about the revenue collection system and particularly the way in which he has been promoting self assessment.  At local meetings, especially in the west, the farming community are demanding that the new tax regime for farmers be on a self assessment basis. While the current examination is being carried out by agricultural officers to revalue land to establish the new taxation regime, I ask the Minister in the interest of equity and of giving farming people in the west a reasonable opportunity, to consider applying a self assessment system in particular to small farmers who will not be reached over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>An area which creates a great deal of difficulty on the social side is VAT applied to hurley sticks.  I have spoken in the Dáil on this matter on a number of occasions in the debate on the Finance Bill.  I should like the Minister to give a more detailed analysis of the moneys collected in value-added tax on sporting equipment as there is an impression in GAA circles that the Department of Finance are taking a lot of money annually because of the high rate of VAT on hurleys.  There should be a zero rate on hurleys as a gesture to the national game but the Minister and, indeed, previous Ministers have been reluctant to give this relief.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for extending the period of exemption for young farmers in relation to stamp duty.  This scheme has been beneficial in rural areas and a fillip to young farmers in regard to transfers and getting access to holdings at an early age.  However, I appreciate that the scheme should not continue indefinitely.  I wish the Minister well in <Col N="917" /> his new portfolio and, with the co-operation of the Government side and that of the Opposition, he will do a very good job for the economy and the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill and I congratulate Deputy John Bruton on his appointment as Minister for Finance.  I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the Government did not face up to the serious issues, especially unemployment and emigration.  It was hoped that the long awaited Finance Bill would indicate a change of course by the Government which would encourage and create a climate for investment lending to job creation, with particular reference to the building industry and tourism.  I said in my contribution on the budget debate that the budget could be clearly identified as the direct outcome of a political situation and that the budget proposals were known in advance in great detail.  I had hoped that the Finance Bill would set out a clear policy in regard to curtailing closures and business failures and their impact on employment.  It was also an opportunity for the Government to formulate a definite policy and programme of action.  I also said that there should be a mechanism set up which would investigate the potential in regard to various factories and which would give a signal in regard to problems which would enable employment to be saved.  However, there is no indication of this in the Bill, although when Fianna Fáil were in Government they had set up such a mechanism to investigate problems in factories, which proved very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Construction Industry Federation are very disappointed that the Government have not introduced incentives to boost construction as they had submitted proposals to them following the budget. They had hoped, in view of their worthwhile submissions, that a commitment would be given to them in view of the fact that they could guarantee employment. They hoped for some type of incentive by way of a capital injection or commitment which would enable the building industry <Col N="918" /> to be set in motion.  They also said that it would enable them to create anything from 15,000 jobs upwards in the first year.  They also pointed out in their submission that the building of new houses in 1985 dropped by 15 per cent.  If VAT had been reduced to 5 per cent it would have provided a major boost to construction activity.  Fianna Fáil on return to Government &mdash; which I hope will be in a very short time &mdash; will give a commitment to the construction industry of an injection of £200 million and the federation have responded by saying they will create worthwhile employment at the outset. Following the budget, the CIF pointed out that the construction industry were facing further serious cutbacks especially in levels of activity and they made various points in relation to VAT.  They stressed that unless concessions are given they see no hope for the future.</P>
    <P>A 35 per cent retention tax was introduced in the budget which applies to all interest paid on deposits in banks and other financial institutions.  This is not a new tax on banks or financial institutions. It is a direct tax at source on the general public, all of whom have already paid tax on their investment.  The Minister for Finance indicated that income tax reductions are needed immediately and that different measures like this new tax must be contemplated to achieve the overriding priority of reducing income tax. One cannot accept that income tax reductions can be achieved only through the imposition of a 35 per cent retention tax, especially where income is not liable to tax.  I cannot accept this imposition on the weaker section of the community, especially on old age pensioners and widows.  The Minister for Finance indicated that he is increasing the exemption limits while at the same time imposing tax at source on the incomes of those exempted.  Those under 65, whether widows, married or single, who are totally dependent on interest from their deposits, will under the Minister's proposal have tax deducted at source from that income.  Young people who do not have a taxable income will be subject <Col N="919" /> to the same treatment.  That tax offends against every principle of justice.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister did not introduce any special incentives for the weaker sections of the community.  The concessions in the Bill for those over 65 will only allow them to claim a refund of tax already deducted if they are not liable to income tax.  Repayments will be made to them by the Revenue Commissioners on receipt of applications at the end of each year, but what is the position of the many people who exist on the interest earned from their investments?  Will they have to wait months for a refund?  Most old people have not had any experience of completing tax forms and many of them are afraid to make a claim for a refund.  The new retention tax is a cause of serious concern to them in their advanced years.  The Minister has not indicated that he will refund the tax stopped at source on interest paid on deposits.  I hope he will change his mind in regard to that.</P>
    <P>The concession to legal charities is limited to those bodies or organisations whose activities are on a legal footing. Many voluntary organisations such as sporting and community groups will have their limited funds liable to the 35 per cent tax.  That is most unfair.  The charities that qualify for the concession will find for the first time that they are being brought into the tax net.  We are all aware of the many organisations that do worthwhile work in the community and have funds set aside for development projects. They will be liable for tax.  The Minister should take into account the community groups who are doing excellent work in the provision of community halls and so on.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that tourism would get a special mention in the Bill in view of its present plight.  I must repeat that tourism is the only industry that is being penalised in every conceivable way.  Special concessions are given to export manufacturers in income tax rates, and exports are exempt from VAT, but tourism is subject to high levels of VAT.  That industry must also pay higher labour costs.  There is <Col N="920" /> not any incentive to those involved to expand.  Tourism has the greatest potential for job creation of all industries and deserves major capital investment.  I should like to endorse the appeal of Deputy Carey in regard to the payment of VAT on hurleys.  I hope the Minister will see his way to exempt hurleys from that tax.  The GAA are doing tremendous work throughout the country, but many young people are unable to purchase hurleys because VAT forms a major part of the cost of them.  The Minister should give serious consideration to this matter and bear in mind that the elimination of VAT on hurleys would have the support of all parties.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the child tax allowance will impose a great penalty on income tax payers whose children are above the age for children's allowance and are pursuing third level education courses.  All families are aware that maintanance and education costs have risen out of all proportion to incomes.  The Government have overlooked this and added to the problems of such families by abolishing the limited allowance.  In many respects the Bill maintains the Government's anti-family prejudice.  The abolition of the allowance scheme is matched by the refusal of the Government to provide adequate tax allowances annually.  The Government are forcing many young people to look to the State and State institutions to care for their parents or grandparents in their old age.  Many social groups and enlightened social policy documents demand that old people be cared for, where possible, in the comfort and security of their own homes; but the Government have not given any incentive to young people to do this.  In fact, all options have been closed off.  In view of the cutbacks in the health services the Government should have encouraged the setting up of special homes for old people.  As in so many other areas where urgent action is needed, the Government and the Minister for Finance failed to come up with incentives to encourage investment. Areas of great potential, such as the building industry and tourism, have been <Col N="921" /> neglected.  It appears that the Government are unaware of that potential.  I hope the Minister in due course will take into account the tremendous potential for job creation.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other speakers in welcoming Deputy John Bruton to the Department of Finance.  He is taking over at a very interesting time, when he will have an opportunity to build on very real achievements by the Government on the public finance and economic fronts.  Few people realise that the Government have brought down the borrowing requirement of the State from 20 per cent in 1982 to about 14 per cent now.  That was a very real achievement by the Government.  Back in 1982 everybody knew that the problem we faced was excessive Government borrowing.  That was confronted head on and in the teeth of the most difficult economic circumstances the country has faced.  A measure of the achievement is that when we took office Government spending was runaway, was growing at 25 per cent nominally or 9 per cent real.  We succeeded in bringing that back down to less than 6 per cent nominally and virtually no growth in real spending year on year.  That is the measure of the turnaround that has been brought about by the Government in the face of extraordinarily difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major feature that made life so difficult in the last four years has been the turnaround in the cost of borrowing. Anybody who, like myself, is on a mortgage will know that in the last four years mortgage repayments have not budged one inch whereas heretofore people could rely on inflation eroding their mortgage payments and the value of their home going up.  The same thing has bitten hard into the Government.  Interest accounts for virtually all of the growth in real Government spending over the last four years.  In other words, the Government have succeeded in running the State system on a much smaller overhead. They have succeeded in cutting back on the number of people required to run the <Col N="922" /> system.  They have succeeded in operating the system more efficiently.  In the teeth of this massive drain through interest payments that has confronted them, that is an extraordinary achievement. There is one way to illustrate that, that is to say that if we were facing in 1986 the same real interest rates as we faced when we came into power in 1982 we would now have no current budget deficit whatsoever.  That is the measure of the Government's performance.  The sole reason we still have a public deficit is that because of turnaround in interest rates it is now extraordinarily difficult to be a borrower and extraordinarily advantageous to be a lender.</P>
    <P>The Government must be complimented on their achievements.  I have often heard complaints from the Opposition benches that to a large degree the Government have achieved that by cutting back on the Public Capital Programme.  We hear Fianna Fáil say that this is undermining our capacity to recover.  That is completely beside the point.  A little exploration of the figures will reveal that.  This Government have doubled the level of spending on roads. It is twice what it was back in the early seventies.  The housing programme has been increased by one-third from what it was in the late seventies.  The only areas where there has been a trail-off are energy, transport and communications. Anyone who has taken the trouble to investigate those areas knows well that we have, if anything, excess capacity in those areas.  We have overinvested in energy.  We have too much capacity to produce more electricity.  We have come to the end of an investment programme in communications and in transport.  It is quite natural that a Government should wind back the Public Capital Programme when the major areas of infrastructural investment have been met and, in some cases, exceeded.  Those who have a simplistic view and look at global figures should have the commonsense to investigate the whole scene more throughly.</P>
    <P>The real question facing this Government and any other person considering the economic plight of this country is <Col N="923" /> what area of the Public Capital Programme is giving the taxpayer value for money.  I am glad to say that this Government have been the first to face up to the issue of implementing a sensible vetting system to ensure that the capital projects that come through the State system are those that will provide real returns to the taxpayer.  If nothing else was achieved in the term of office of this Government, to have put in place a system that will ensure that we will have no more Howth Harbours with massive overruns, no more misspent projects or investment in excess capacity, then they will have performed a worthwhile task.</P>
    <P>Our achievements are much greater than that.  This budget shows ingenuity on the part of the Government.  With very little room for manoeuvre they have succeeded in taking some bold strokes to tackle what I regard are the key issues. On the employment front, through VAT concessions to labour-intensive industries, they have given that very important sector of the service industry a breathing space to provide more employment.  We have diluted some of the biases in our tax code that have encouraged people to put money into machinery or safe havens of investment and savings where there is virtually no employment generated.  We have cut back on those and at the same time put in place selective reliefs for those who have shown themselves capable of creating employment opportunities.  We have done so through schemes like the business employment scheme.  Therefore, this budget is very constructive on the issue of employment.</P>
    <P>The other major issue we face is equity. This budget has made bold strokes in the area of equity.  It is well known that by bringing in the withholding tax we have succeeded in getting revenue from areas that heretofore people were not returning for tax purposes.  We have extended the PAYE system to deposit interest. Anyone who is bearing the brunt of PAYE cannot but recognise that applying the PAYE system to a broader area of tax revenue is definitely equitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> Besides that move we have also introduced in this Finance Bill what I believe to be a very important anti-evasion package.  As the House will be aware, we have introduced surcharges for late payment, tougher penalties for people who fail to return and have set about improving the enforcement system through the appointment of sheriffs.  We have made a number of moves in the area of improving tax enforcement &mdash; as I hope to develop later &mdash; which is the key area so far as equity is concerned.  The belief that over recent years enforcement of taxation has been lacking has been the cause of discontent about equity in our tax code.  It is not that the tax code is all that radically wrong &mdash; although obviously there are areas warranting improvement &mdash; rather is it the conviction among PAYE taxpayers in particular that not everyone is bearing the same burden.  That is the real source of inequity, the real source of complaint among the PAYE sector.  I commend the Government on the steps they have taken, and in the course of my remarks I hope to suggest areas where there is scope for further improvement.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill is facing up to some very important issues, and its thrust is very sensible.  We all know about the income tax concessions that have been achieved.  It is also heartening to see that the Government are tackling the biases that have drawn our scarce saving and investment funds away from employment creation, and have put them into areas where people are willing to take real risks, willing to stick out their necks in order to create employment opportunities for others.  The Government are right in doing so.</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell for a short time on the issue of tax enforcement.  This is the key question to tax equity at present. The nicest ideas about reforming the tax code will fail if people do not have the confidence that whatever code is in place will be enforced uniformly against all those who are obliged to pay.  The situation with which we have been faced in recent years, which the enforcement system has been incapable of confronting and where non-compliance has <Col N="925" /> extended progressively, has led to the faith of those people who are honest taxpayers, trying to comply to the best of their ability with the tax burdens imposed on them, being undermined if they feel that somebody beside them is not pulling his weight, is dragging his feet and getting away with it.  If this question of tax enforcement is not made the key priority we will damage not only the moral resolve of people to pay their just taxes but also damage the revenue that can be generated.</P>
    <P>Few people are aware of the extent to which non-compliance has grown.  For example, in 1983-84 there were 100,000 cases in which the Revenue were forced to go to enforcement to collect tax from people.  That was over double the figure it had been a couple of years previously and greater again than the figure it had been a few years before that.  It is now endemic.  I examined the figures.  For example, if one takes the VAT returns one discovers that, for every two and a half people making VAT returns, one enforcement certificate is being issued; that one in every three employers making PAYE and PRSI returns generates enforcement certificates.  In the areas of the self-employed one discovers that in one in every five cases the Revenue have to resort to enforcement to collect tax and, in the case of corporations, in one in every seven the Revenue have to resort to enforcement.  Those are shocking figures and, even at that level, represent less than the extent to which the Collector-General would like to be able to go for enforcement.  He is constrained by the capacity of the various agencies from going to enforcement.  For instance, now one in every five self-employed persons must be brought through a legal procedure to exact payment.  That is a bad figure.  We must make enforcement a top priority.  I welcome the significant measures the Government have taken in the past few months, because the switch to sheriff is a very sensible procedure. There is ample evidence that the use of county registrars to collect tax has failed dismally and that the sheriff system is a better one.  It could be made a much <Col N="926" /> better one if we set about giving sheriffs a proper contract whereby they would become accountable.  We should give them effective powers to assume their duties and the flexibility to vary their levels of activity and to take on people, if needed, for short periods to get over their levels of activity and to take on people, if needed, for short periods to get over the serious problem in regard to enforcement.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces a welcome change by bringing in a 10 per cent surcharge for people who make late returns.  The surcharge comes in after 12 months from the date on which tax should have been paid.  What is particularly good about this move is that, unlike some of the penalties there already, it is not divorced from tax liability.  In other words, the pursuit of this surcharge will not generate a whole new pursuit and a whole new appeals system which would still leave tax liability untouched.  The surcharge will be rolled into the tax liability so that the Revenue Commissioners effectively will not be deflected from pursuit of a penalty because they will be able to pursue surcharge and tax liability together.</P>
    <P>In the past, penalties were an ineffective way of bringing in revenue because penalties were under a separate system and the Revenue Commissioners had to deflect themselves from pursuit of the tax in order to pursue the penalties.  That was a wrong approach and I am glad to see it is being changed.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for interest on late payments.  It is very important that interest be used as the real way to prevent people from making late tax returns.  The only effective disincentive to people is if, progressively, they see that the longer they drag their feet the more they will have to pay.  The Government are right when they envisage charging interest at rates higher than obtain commercially for people who delay on payment of tax. That is right because the Revenue Commissioners are not in the business of financing companies or providing loan finance through late payment of tax. People who delay payment of tax are far from AA borrowers, or whatever the <Col N="927" /> banks call them.  Therefore, it is right that the Government should charge riskloaded interest rates on delayed payments.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the suggestion in the Bill that the Revenue Commissioners should pay less to people who have overpaid tax.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and the Revenue Commissioners, if they are the ones who have been delaying repayments and depriving companies of cash flows that they need, should be subjected to the same regime in regard to interest as is the taxpayer.  I question the advisability of having a different rate of interest applying to people who have overpaid and those who have underpaid.  The Government should consider stepping up the rate of interest that would apply after a certain period.  In the case of the surcharge, they have decided that after 12 months, if things are going radically wrong and if somebody did not have a return in, he should be subjected to the surcharge.</P>
    <P>In the same way, I suggest that if somebody is late in paying an agreed liability and has let it drag on for more than a year, the rate of interest applying should be increased.  I cannot understand why the so-called penal interest rate applies only in outright evasion cases and so forth. We are talking about penal interest rates. If we are serious about expecting people to comply with their tax responsibilities we should consider bringing in a rate of interest at a higher level after 12 months from the date on which the payment was agreed and due.  The increase in interest will be an effective deterrent, however, only if people are confident that it can and will be enforced. Swift enforcement is the key.</P>
    <P>From discussions with the Revenue Commissioners before the Committee on Public Expenditure I know that the system is not up to scratch in regard to enforcement.  The percentage of the amount due and collected has been falling progressively from 15 per cent to 5 per cent.  We need to seize the opportunity the Government have presented in the <Col N="928" /> Bill to have a new sheriff system so that much clearer accountability on certificates that go for enforcement will be possible.  Heretofore, the Revenue Commissioners have been unable to tell the Committee on Public Expenditure what has been happening to the enforcement certificates.  They could only tell us that 5 per cent was paid but they could not give us in any detail the outcome of the other 95 per cent because there is no clear accountability from the various enforcement agencies in regard to what has happened.  The Minister should set about establishing clear accountability from the sheriff in regard to the enforcement certificates.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners also need stronger powers as outlined by the Commission on Taxation in their fifth report, which Deputy Connolly will know Fianna Fáil support in full.  In that report the serious deficiencies in the enforcement powers of the various agencies have been pointed out.  The report draws attention to the need to give sheriffs power to take possession of goods and, <i>in extremis,</i> to have a sort of receivership power so that accounts could be freezed. Such powers have been sadly lacking.  It is well known that sheriffs and county registrars going out to try to enforce tax certificates find that perhaps the property is leased and cannot be seized or the property is livestock and the sheriff does not have a place in which to corral them. There are various problems and the enforcement agencies cannot touch accounts.  Changes must be made to make the enforcement system one that will stick.</P>
    <P>Some of these changes are unpalatable and people do not like to see the Revenue Commissioners getting tough.  However, the key issue of equity is that, if you do not enforce the system that is there, you will undermine people's confidence in it and you will not have a fair tax system.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned at the extent of the use of liquidation of companies as a tax avoidance device.  I do not know the true extent of it, but hearsay evidence suggests it is occurring on a significant if <Col N="929" /> not widespread scale.  From 600 liquidations per year, the Revenue Commissioners are being caught for a vast bulk of revenue, averaging about £125,000 per case.  It is serious enough to have liquidations occurring and Revenue losing out, but if many of these are bogus liquidations where a company are closing down in one location and re-opening in another, walking away from their tax liabilities, then this is serious.  It raises many points about limited liability that will be tackled in the Companies Bill.  The Minister for Finance, in his responsibility for the collection of tax, should look at this aspect in the context of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Is there a possibility of having some sort of clearance certificate system which a person who closes down in one location owing significant tax must have before re-opening in another?  There are many genuine bankruptcies and legitimate closures where after a period the company should be allowed to start up again.  I am not suggesting that we should deny clearance certificates to everyone who has faced bankruptcy and not cleared his tax liability.  In the cases of blatant abuse the Revenue Commissioners should have some clearance certificate system under which they could deny maverick companies the right to re-establish unless they show that it was a bona fide liquidation of the original company.  I do not know the legal ins and outs, but the Minister should give this matter his attention.</P>
    <P>I have made one point every year when speaking on the Finance Bill and I feel somewhat like the Roman Senator who got up every year to say that Carthage must be destroyed.  Eventually the Romans did destroy Carthage, so perhaps by my persistence we will eventually see the introduction of self-assessment. This is bound to bring benefits to our collection system.  They will not come overnight, but they are definite and tangible benefits.  They take the Revenue Commissioners out of the hair of the vast majority of those making honest tax returns, free them from pursuing every single tax case, leaving them free to go <Col N="930" /> after the real defaulters.  It also has the resounding advantage that revenue comes in on time from those subject to self-assessment.  For far too long we have seen persistent delays because of appeal and counter-appeal, with Revenue all the time out of pocket.  Self-assessment over time can nip that problem in the bud.  I once again appeal that the introduction of self-assessment for all the direct assessment taxes &mdash; namely, income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax &mdash; should be considered urgently.</P>
    <P>I turn now to another area where the Finance Bill has made a very important advance, and that is in regard to the whole area of the use of savings and investment available to the community. The thrust of the Bill is entirely correct in moving to favour the risky and the employment creating investment rather than the safe havens which have heretofore been the main beneficiary of private savings.  This has been done in a number of ways, one being the new tax introduced for life assurance which was obviously more attractive than productive investment outlets.  Many of those attractions of life assurance have been based on special constructs designed to exploit concessions which were in no way intended for this use.  This Finance Bill has also restricted relief on capital depreciation to the net amount of investment. In other words, depreciation relief is no longer being given to moneys that companies had recouped through the IDA and grants.</P>
    <P>Restrictions have been imposed on section 24 and the business expansion scheme has been extended, with its attraction for savings going into generating new enterprises.  New incentives have been given to those holding shares in productive 10 per cent companies, which are the power base for producing goods. I welcome these changes.  However, I would make a couple of comments.  I am worried about the new scheme being introduced to provide a tax break of up to £25,000 for people who are putting money into research and development. There is no doubt that this country needs <Col N="931" /> research and development, but I am concerned that the result of this concession will be solely in companies hiving off their research and development activities into a separate area in order to exploit this tax concession and that there will be no net new research and development done under this concession.</P>
    <P>Under the existing business expansion scheme which is beginning to take off, one of the qualifying expenditures was research and development.  The new tax relief system might not generate any new research and development.  We must be very concerned not to introduce any tax concession which will not result in new investment activity.  The Minister, if introducing this concession, must set targets against which its success or failure will be judged.  If it goes ahead we must know the criteria which would indicate if the scheme has failed and should be abolished.  Anyone who has examined our tax code will know that far too often concessions have been introduced, with the best will in the world, but have outlived their usefulness and are not being removed.  With any new concessions we must make sure that they have criteria against which they will be judged and that we have the courage, if in five years' time the schemes are not producing the goods for the taxpayer, to axe them.  I ask the Minister to try to institute such a test of success for that scheme as well as for the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>The time has come for a fundamental rethink of how the tax code is influencing savings and investment.  I am nervous about year by year tinkering with various provisions in the code.  If we believe, for instance, that section 84 relief should not be there, we should get rid of it and not impose a tax on it.  If we believe that some of the life assurance concessions are being abused, we should close off those loopholes and not tax them.  We must look at the question of how scarce savings are used in an overall fashion, rather than by piecemeal responses year by year.</P>
    <P>The balance in incentives is wrong at the moment.  The capital depreciation <Col N="932" /> allowances included in our corporation tax are far too generous, considering that the same corporations are asked to pay very heavy PRSI on employment.  We have tipped the balance too far in the direction of encouraging companies to reequip, to expand machinery and plant and we have imposed on them too heavy a burden if they take on employees.  The Government are correct in trying to provide selective reliefs on the employment front.  The time is rapidly coming when we will have to set out a programme in which, systematically, we put in place a series of incentives to encourage scarce savings into the areas which will generate employment.  We must give companies the right signals that tax relief will be available for people who increase employment rather than for those who increase the amount of machinery.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the deposit interest retention tax is a very sensible move.  It is applying the PAYE principle to deposit interest.  The proposal to extend withholding taxes is warmly espoused by the Commission on Taxation, whose recommendations are regarded as a bible on matters of taxation.  It is a very sensible move that more revenue, wherever possible, should succumb to the PAYE system.  Essentially that is what the withholding taxes are all about.  Two very important aspects of the system are that it reduces the cost of collection and reduces evasion.  It is well known that the allowances on bank deposits were being widely exploited for the purpose of tax evasion and many people were not returning to the Revenue details of deposits held. Also the building societies had preferential treatment which resulted in their paying lower tax on deposit interest than applied elsewhere.  The Government are quite right to introduce equality of treatment between all deposit-taking institutions.  That is the only way to have a fair system.</P>
    <P>An obvious matter of concern is in the area of people with small incomes, be they over or under the age of 65 years. The Government concessions to those over 65 years and to the handicapped are welcome.  There is no doubt that these <Col N="933" /> are the most serious cases.  However, I feel that the possibility of a general small income exemption, regardless of age, should be looked at again.  I have seen figures quoted by the Department of Finance which indicate that if that concession were given, 60 per cent of the DIRT revenue would be foregone in 1987.  I question that.  If this tax is to raise £100 million and 60 per cent is to be sacrificed if concessions are given to small income people, it seems to suggest that the banks are controlled or dominated by the unemployed and by small, relatively poor people.  That runs completely counter to everything I feel to be the case about deposits in banks.  Those figures should be carefully looked at again to see if the extension of small income exemption throughout the code would cost very much.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of persons on a contributory old age pension.  The contributory old age pension entirely absorbs the small income exemption and those people would normally be liable to pay 35 per cent on their deposits.  Many of those in the small income group would probably have enough outside income to bring them in £2,650 a year, or £50 a week.  People who have an outside income of £50 per week are rightly liable for the 35 per cent deduction from interest.  There is something very wrong in the Department of Finance figures which suggest that 60 per cent of the revenue would be lost if we said that persons with an income of under £50 a week should not be allowed a refund of their money. This is an important issue and the figure should be considered again.  The issue mars what is otherwise an excellent tax.</P>
    <P>I am discouraged by the Fianna Fáil attitude to taxation during the past few months.  They have repeatedly rejected in their statements what they call the high taxation policies of Government, but they have not either called for an assault on Government spending or talked about reducing Government borrowing.  They have done the opposite, talking about introducing selective new spending and what they call self-financing tax cuts. Would that the world were like that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> Would that we could introduce tax cuts which were self-financing.  That means that if a person is given a tax concession of £10 the Revenue will get that £10 back at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>Could anything be any more ludicrous than the thought that the £10 would end up in the pocket of the Revenue Commissioners?  It is completely false and one does not need statistics to realise that. For those who want statistics, the ESRI estimate in respect of a £10 concession that the Revenue Commissioners will end up with £2.40, while the other £7.60 will go elsewhere, much of it on imports.  This idea of selective new spending and self-financing tax cuts is nothing but the old formula of more spending and less taxation, dressed up in new words with nice little adjectives attached.  It is the same old message.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have ignored the commission's single stern warning that the commission's recommendations should not be used by people who are willing to take the attractive proposals and reject the unpalatable.  That is the very thing Fianna Fáil have done in successive statements. They have advocated lower income tax rates but have rejected out of hand any move to touch any existing reliefs and exemptions.  They have called them manifestly unfair, in the Fianna Fáil Leader's own words.  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot take the attractive proposals and reject the unpalatable.  Tax reform is a matter of making changes in one area to finance changes in another.</P>
    <P>The only area where Fianna Fáil have supported the Commission on Taxation is in relation to the fifth report.  To be honest, that is like supporting motherhood.  That report is essentially about management and how to manage resources better in the Revenue Commission. To say that one supports better management is not making anything like a sensible contribution to a debate on taxation. Fianna Fáil must get down to addressing the basic issues such as how to broaden our tax base to bring down tax rates and how to improve collection.  These are the real issues in taxation and I hope that Fianna Fáil in the course of this debate <Col N="935" /> will face up to those real issues and not go carping on about old formulas and old resolutions to problems which have manifestly failed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill, to which a number of alterations have been made since the time of its introduction by the former Minister for Finance.  It would seem that the new Minister has altered it and during my long period as a member of this House I have never seen a Finance Bill with so many alterations.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's remarks about our programme in regard to self-financing cuts in excise duty.  On spirits alone we were proved right.  The former Minister for Finance had to agree subsequently in reply to a Dáil Question. Each year at this time many amendments are made to the various Finance Acts but the Revenue Commissioners do not have ample opportunity to implement many of the changes that should be implemented. Let us consider, for instance, the methods of assessment and of collection in respect of the various sectors within the tax net.  In the case of people who retire from their employment, immediately on retirement they are furnished with a mass of forms relating to the previous eight or nine years.  Many of those who receive these forms approach us as public representatives to ask what the whole exercise is all about.  Checks I have made have revealed that these forms are furnished regardless of whether the people concerned have made returns during the years to which the forms apply. This is happening particularly to those who retire from Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company and the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the information sought on the forms there are requests for P60s going back to the previous eight or nine years.  The tax offices seem to become bogged down in all the documentation.  After the forms have been completed and returned, the people concerned often receive letters from the Revenue Commissioners referring to trivial matters or asking where those people had <Col N="936" /> put their few pounds, money they had worked so hard for on the bogs or elsewhere.  They are asked: &ldquo;Where is the money? What bank or post office is it in?&rdquo; The likelihood is that in most cases savings would be invested with building societies so that tax would have been paid already on interest.  By way of endeavouring to speed up the collection process the tax offices should discontinue such trivia which have no relevance to the collection process.</P>
    <P>Many of the people concerned fear, when they receive these forms, that what the Revenue Commissioners are really after are the lump sums that were paid on retirement and after up to 40 years work.  In my constituency that work would have been carried out in drains and bogs.  Asking people to make returns for a number of years for which they had already made returns can only be a waste of time.  The Revenue Commissioners would be better engaged in pursuing those who do not pay their tax.</P>
    <P>We had reached a position where the farming community were coming round to the idea of having to pay their fair share of tax.  There had been an increase in the number of returns from that sector and in the consequent revenue.  The self-assessment procedure for the agricultural sector would have speeded up the collection of revenue and resulted in a greater level of revenue from the farmers.  I am not blaming the Revenue Commissioners for the delays in the collection of tax from farmers.  On any occasion on which I have had cause to deal with the commissioners on behalf of some constituent, or to accompany a constituent to the commissioners' offices, I found them very helpful but the criteria by which they operate leave a lot to be desired.  They are outdated and much in need of reform.  The fifth report of the Commission on Taxation pointed to this area.  They recommended that where there is a genuine effort to pay tax and to make returns, the returns should be accepted and the assessments sent to the people concerned.  This would mean that the agreement of the client and his accountants <Col N="937" /> had been already obtained thereby allowing for the speedy collection of the money involved instead of long delays being caused by the pursuit of trivial matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, being from a Dublin area, may not be aware that the farmers had been willing to keep accounts and to make tax returns.  Sometimes people who have no association with rural Ireland &mdash; I am not saying the Minister of State is guilty in this regard &mdash; are of the opinion that farmers do not want to pay anything.  I submit that in many cases farmers are branded wrongfully.  In saying that I am not holding any brief for them.  I am only being fair to them. Arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners worked satisfactorily down through the years but matters were handled badly.  There should have been more co-operation in that respect.</P>
    <P>Admittedly in the initial stages of farmer taxation, farmers failed to cooperate but, as I have indicated, there had been a change of attitude for the better on their part up to recently.  Young farmers particularly were willing to keep accounts and make returns.  Those who had been on ACOT or other such courses realised that they would have to pay a fair share of tax.  This brings me to the question of the land tax that is supposed to be introduced either at the end of this year or early next year.  I do not consider that type of tax to be the answer to the matter of the taxing of the farming community.</P>

      <P>The commission were established in 1983 and were to report in two years, that is, by September 1985.  In June 1985 the chairman of the commission indicated that the report could not be completed and he sought an extension to March 1986.  That was reluctantly agreed to by the then Minister.  It is now understood that the commission are to meet on Wednesday, 23 April, to discuss certain redrafts of the report.  The indication from the chairman is that the report will be finalised at that meeting and he proposes to give the commission a further opportunity to read the report as a whole before signing it. Realistically, this means that it is unlikely the report will be available until some time in May.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give any indication why additional time was sought?  It was expected that two years would be sufficient to produce the report and an extention was given until March; now we are told it will be May before the report is available.  We were talking originally about two years but an additional year has been given to produce this report.  Is the reason for this extension that the members are having difficulty in coming to conclusions, or is the Minister not satisfied with the kind of conclusions they are coming up with?  Is the Minister seeking these redrafts or the members?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that the Minister is not seeking any redrafting.  It is a matter purely within the commission.  The House must be aware of the extent and nature of the social welfare code.  The commission were made up of very excellent people who were given a very formidable task.  It may have been over-ambitious to expect them to produce a report within two years.  In my view it is not unreasonable, having regard to all the circumstances, that it has taken somewhat longer than <Col N="946" /> that.  It is probably a good thing that it has taken them longer than expected to produce this report because it means, first, that the commission have done an extensive job on the social welfare code and, second, that they are giving very deep thought to what will be in their report.  I am satisfied that the reason for the delay can be justified and that nothing but good can come from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the average time taken to hear an appeal for the investigation of claims for (1) unemployment claims, (2) disability benefit, (3) deserted wife's claims and (4) old age pension claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics are not maintained to enable a calculation to be made of the average time taken to investigate and process an appeal hearing.  Every appeal application is determined in the light of its own particular merit.  An appellant is required to state the grounds on which the appeal is based and where the contentions are at variance with the information already available a further investigation has to be made.  In many <Col N="947" /> cases this may result in prolonged inquiries by a social welfare officer before the case can be submitted to an appeals officer.</P>
      <P>Where a further investigation of an appeal application is not deemed to be necessary, it is estimated that the time taken to process an oral hearing from the date of submission to the appeals officer to the date of hearing is six to eight weeks in Dublin and somewhat longer in provincial areas.  However, cases which are dealt with summarily by appeals officers are normally determined within four to six weeks from date of submission to date of decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has conceded that delays, particularly down the country, may extend to months. I ask him, respectfully, to concede that in many cases delay can extend up to four months.  Is not the reason for this that so few appeals officers are employed by the Department?  There are 14 in all, consisting of a chief appeals officer, a deputy chief appeals officer, nine permanent and three temporary appeals officers, and this is not sufficient to deal with the various appeals that arise in relation to unemployment, disability, deserted wife's claims and old age pension claims.  It is impossible for 14 appeals officers nationally to deal with all the appeals that come before them.  In view of the long delays which cause considerable hardship and disquiet, will the Minister of State not concede that it would be in the national interest and the interest of those who would benefit, that more appeals officers should be appointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said many times, the number of appeals officers is a factor in the length of time, certainly, but it is not the only factor.  There are many other factors, not the least of which is that the number of cases referred to appeals officers each year is in excess of 17,000. As I said in my original reply, cases differ and some cases take much longer to investigate and follow than others.  If the Department had more appeals officers <Col N="948" /> there would be some lessening of the time span.  Three temporary appeals officers were assigned to the appeals branch in May 1985 and that helped in some way. Every effort will be made to keep the number of appeals officers at their current level.</P>

On the other hand we have questions like Deputy De Rossa's question which tend to give the opposite impression.  It is a question of balance between ensuring that people get what they are entitled to and ensuring that they comply with the conditions that govern each scheme.  No matter which way the regulations lean we will get criticism of one kind or another from those who think the regulations should be much stricter and that people should not get benefits as easily as they do, and the other view that people should get them more easily.</P>

The measures necessary to deal with any shortcomings in the administration of schemes highlighted by these examinations which could give rise to fraud are being taken.  Detailed information on these measures has been given to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The matter of social welfare fraud has received much publicity in the media recently.  Many of the allegations that have been made have been of a speculative nature and have tended to give a distorted view of the extent of the problem and could well be causing undue alarm among members of the public on the matter.  The effect this media publicity may be having on the vast majority of social welfare claimants who are honest and upright and who are receiving no more than their legal entitlements is also a matter of concern.</P>
      <P>That said, however, I would like to assure the House that both the Department and myself are at all times concerned at attempts to defraud the social welfare system and every effort is being made and will continue to be made to control abuses having regard to available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many control measures in operation and these have been developed and enhanced in recent times.  The most significant developments in this regard have been made possible by the computerisation of the administration of much of the social welfare system which has enabled controls to be introduced which were not feasible under the old clerical system.  A computerised system of recording and processing referrals for medical examination will be introduced shortly.  This, together with the allocation of an additional five medical referees will <Col N="951" /> enable the Department to operate more efficiently the referral system which is an essential element in the control of abuse of the disability benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to controls built into the administrative system to prevent fraud, special measures are also in place to detect fraud which is not readily amenable to prevention through the administrative systems.  The most common form of fraud in this regard involves persons working while receiving unemployment payments.  In this connection I can say that my Department have obtained sanction for the recruitment of six additional officers for the special investigation unit which was set up specifically to counter this type of fraud.  These officers are currently being recruited and will considerably strengthen the investigation unit.</P>
    <P>The Government have recently approved the allocation of 64 additional staff to the Department for control work in the disability benefit area, a further indication of their determination to eliminate fraudulent claims and other abuses of the disability benefit schemes.</P>
    <P>The Department, the Minister and myself are open to all advice and suggestions on how to deal more effectively with this problem.  To this end the Minister hopes to have a meeting with representatives of employers and trade unions shortly to discuss the matter generally.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I feel that I should point out once again that thousands of claim are received each week in my Department.  I have no doubt that the majority of these are genuine and that only a relatively small number of claimants attempt to defraud the system.  In addressing the question of combating fraud, a balance has to be struck between, on the one hand, trying to prevent fraud and, on the other, making sure that the procedures are not such that they cause undue delay in making payments to genuine cases. The Department must ensure that proper regard is had to the needs and dignity of claimants generally and not make everyone suffer for the sins of the few.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two types of theft, one involving 742 disability cheques in which the total sum involved was approximately £15,000 and in February 1984 1,002 cheques were stolen involving £61,000.  Is the Minister satisfied that procedures have been introduced to ensure that this will not happen again, as procedures introduced in 1976 seem to have failed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in the reply, additional staff and the new system of computerisation will reduce the incidence of small fraud, although it would be impossible to guarantee elimination of all fraud because of the multiplicity of schemes.  Increased efforts are being made to eliminate fraud and I am satisfied that the measures now being taken will improve the situation.  I wish to emphasise that the vast majority of claimants are honest and that we are dealing only with a very small section of the community.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reply because many wild allegations have been made in regard to social welfare fraud.  The total number of cases involved in clearly intended fraud in 1985 amounted to 4,000 at a cost of £3 million. Therefore, are the Department satisfied that the figure is accurate or could the figure be as high as £150 million? Concern has been expressed because the Department have not confirmed or refuted the allegations made in various newspapers?  A Member of this House, who is not present, stated that the amount could be closer to £150 million. Is this correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of over-pay-ments recorded for recovery in 1983 amounted to £3,522,000 of which £2,198,000 was attributed to fraud or suspected fraud by claimants; 87 individuals were prosecuted for irregularly attempting to obtain benefits and all but one were convicted.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister confirm that during 1985 there were 187 prosecutions taken by his Department for fraud and that 169 convictions were obtained?

      <P>I have a priority question on this topic which the Minister has brushed aside.  I am not blaming the Chair <Col N="954" /> for that, but the Minister has not answered very much.  As a result of the amount of publicity given to allegations of fraud in regard to social welfare benefits, will the Minister confirm or deny the statements contained in an article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on April 9?  That article, written by a very reputable reporter, stated that fraud involved all forms of social welfare.  One allegation in the article was to the effect that an itinerant woman obtained £14,000 in the form of children's allowances.  It was alleged that she was claiming for 83 children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>My priority question asked the Minister for Social Welfare the up-to-date position regarding alleged fraudulent claims for social welfare payments and the special steps which will be taken to eliminate, as far as possible, the practice.  In the course of that article a Member of the House, Deputy McGahon, stated that fraudulent claims amounted to £150 million.  It was stated that an itinerant lady obtained £14,000 for children's allowance claims in respect of 83 children and that that fraud was detected when a garda in Bray found 13 children's allowance books in an itinerant's van.  I am sure the Minister is so interested in the operation of the Department that he read the article.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to express the amount of fraud as a proportion of the total amount paid out under social welfare schemes and the numbers involved in fraud as against the numbers claiming social welfare benefits so that we can get a clearer picture of what is involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The only figures I can give that I can stand over are those that quantify known overpayments, overpayments that have been uncovered by my Department.  The figure for over-payments in 1984 was £3.8 million of which £2.4 million was attributable to fraud or attempted fraud by claimants.  I do not deny that outside this some recipients may be defrauding the system and that there are elements of fraud of which we are not aware.  However, in attempting to quantify the unknown abuses one is entering into the realm of speculation. One can pluck figures from the air that can have little or no basis in fact just to suit any purpose.  I cannot see what is to be gained from such speculation beyond, perhaps, unduly alarming members of the public about the real extent of the problem which I consider some of the wilder speculation in this regard in recent times may have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Abuses of the social welfare system have been and always will be a matter of serious concern to my Department and the eradication of such abuses is and will continue to be a major priority.  I should like to assure Deputies that everything possible is being done within existing resources to eradicate the abuses having regard to the need to ensure that the measures taken are cost-effective and do not cause undue delay in making payments to genuine cases.  Accordingly, whatever the real extent of the problem, something nobody can reliably quantify, I am satisfied that the matter is being <Col N="956" /> tackled by my Department as effectively as possible within existing resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the highlighting of certain cases has caused a lot of worry and disquiet and there has been an upsurge of hysteria about what is alleged to have taken place. Will the Minister agree that it is the duty of the Department to deny the reports made in regard to the specific case referred to in the article in last Wednesday's <i>Evening Herald</i> and the figures that were thrown around, £150 million in fraudulent claims in one year?  That article also stated that cheques from the Eastern Health Board were paid to a person who was not eligible.  Will the Minister agree that his Department should deny those allegations rather than have the public worrying about them?  He must remember that many genuine social welfare recipients feel the finger is being pointed at them in this regard.</P>

If not, will the Minister agree to scale down the intensive investigation by the special investigators, particularly in the Donegal region where unemployment is highest in the country and where these investigations are currently amounting to a degree of harassment of social welfare recipients, with officers of the Minister's Department exceeding their authority in relation to the carrying out of these special tigations.

      <P>Deputy Conaghan has in fact replied to the last part of Deputy McCarthy's supplementary question when he asked for additional staff to monitor the whole social welfare system. As I have said many times before, it is a question of maintaining a balance.  Here we have two Deputies on the opposite side of the House, one calling for more surveillance, stricter controls, more people recruited and the other requesting that the investigators be called off.  That illustrates the type of two-way approach we encounter, with different views on the matter.  I am not critical of that, I am merely pointing out the difficulties.  We have recruited additional staff in this area but there is a limit to what they can do. If there are any instances of what Deputy Conaghan regards as unjust or unfair treatment of any individual, if he will bring them to our attention, we will have them investigated.</P>

      <Col N="958" /> It is very difficult for them to do their job under that kind of pressure.  When Deputies make allegations against social welfare officials I should like them to be specific so that we could have such cases examined and dealt with.</P>

Would he not concede that there is a huge discrepancy between that figure and the 35,000 families his Government forecast would benefit from the scheme when it was first introduced in 1984?  Indeed, I should remind the House that it was introduced to compensate for the fact that the Government halved the food subsidies, saving £45 million last year.  Would the Minister concede that there must be something seriously wrong either with the benefits accruing to applicants under the scheme &mdash; because its provisions have not been taken up &mdash; or the criteria for eligibility are too stringent?

However, only 6,941 applicants qualified under the provisions of the scheme.  Of those rejected many were not employees as defined for the purposes of the scheme, that is that they had to be working for an employer for at least 30 hours per week and the remainder were disallowed earnings in excess of the prescribed amounts.

In the light of events across the water did the Government here give any special consideration to rendering this scheme more attractive to applicants?  I believe that the average payment made to each family was £7 per week, which would constitute poor compensation for the loss of 50 per cent of the food subsidies.

      <P>The future of the PRSI status of public servants is being considered in drawing up the framework for a national pension plan referred to in the Government's document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i> One option which has been considered is that all persons entering public service employment for the first time would be fully covered by PRSI. The Department of Finance have always contended that proposals along these lines would ultimately leave the Exchequer in the position of a net loser because of higher employer contributions and the possibility of consequential pay compensation for public servants.  On the cost factor, the inclusion of public servants in full social insurance would raise major administrative, financial and industrial relations problems.  Existing occupational pension and sick pay entitlements would have to be reduced to take account of the new social insurance entitlements &mdash; the much higher employer's contribution which is 12.33 per cent, class A, compared with 2.28 per cent, class D, which would largely fall to be met by the State either directly, as employer, or <Col N="961" /> through participation in the financing of the organisation concerned.  Of course employees would also be required to pay higher contributions &mdash; 7.5 per cent class A, compared with 2.9 per cent class D, from which no additional benefit would be derived.

      <P>The amount provided for unemployment payments in the 1986 Estimate is £688.81 million.  There is provision for a weekly average of 237,000 on the register of unemployed and I am satisfied that the amount provided will be adequate.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister recall that last year we warned the Departments of Social Welfare and Finance that they had not allocated <Col N="962" /> enough money to allow for a potential growth in unemployment during the year?  Is there any likelihood this year that the same problem will arise?  Last year, the Department had to introduce at short notice a Supplementary Estimate for £50 million, £40 million of which was to pay for additional unemployment claims because in January last year the Estimate did not allow for an increase in unemployment?  There was a mistake, therefore, involving £40 million.  Does the Minister believe that unemployment has been arrested and that he has allowed enough money to cover the year?</P>

      <P>The figures are based on a likely figure of 237,000 for the whole year.  On 3 January last the figure was 239,867.  At the end of January it was 240,405 and in February the figure was 238,556.  The weekly average at the end of March was 237,000.  The live register should continue to fall in the coming months and we assume therefore an average of 237,000 in 1986 as a whole.</P>

      <P>On 28 March this year the live register showed 237,000 of whom 131,000 were long term unemployed, representing 66 per cent of the total unemployed.  Does the Minister agree that this Government have made such sharp mistakes in their Estimate figures that it is most likely the unemployment numbers will continue to grow?  On 27 March 1981 there were 126,000 on the unemployment register; on 26 March 1982 we had 148,000; on 25 March 1983 we had 189,000; on 30 March 1984 the figure was 214,000; and on 28 March 1985 we had 230,000.  This year the figure is 237,000.  I think of the projections in the now infamous document <i>Building on Reality</i>&mdash; we should have a public burning of it some day &mdash; in which it was projected that the unemployment figure this year would be 210,000 &mdash; 27,000 wrong.  Is the Minister absolutely happy that enough money has been allocated this year to cater for the unemployed?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 23 together.  The Taoiseach, in his statement on Employment and Tax Reform on 23 October last, stated that the Government were considering proposals for the overhaul of the disability benefit scheme with a view to reducing the costs of absenteeism and he indicated that the National Economic and Social Council would be consulted. The views of the council have now been received and will be put to the Government shortly with a view to involving employer and trade union representatives in drawing up a scheme whereby employers would become responsible for sick pay provision for an initial period of ten weeks and entitlement to disability benefit in respect of that period would cease.</P>
      <P>No statistics are available which would indicate the extent to which absenteeism is a factor in the case of those claiming disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Government follow the Taoiseach's statement of 23 October by putting this problem to the council?  Was it an attempt to reduce absenteeism or, more specifically, an attempt to reduce the cost to the Exchequer of short term disability benefit claims, that is, those under ten weeks' duration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>At present about 77,000 people receive disability benefit in any given week.  Approximately 280,000 claims are received annually.  Expenditure on the scheme for 1985, including pay-related benefit, is estimated at about £230 million.  A significant number of <Col N="965" /> claims to benefit come from employees whose companies have sick pay schemes and complicated arrangements are made by employers to ensure that such employees are not paid on the double. Employers take account of disability benefit within their company sick pay schemes in different ways.  The method chosen can have an influence on the level of take-home pay while a person is sick. As I have stated, these matters are at a very initial discussion stage.  Many views have to be obtained and many organisations, representing employers and trade unions, have to be involved.  It is hard to say at present what will come at the end of all the discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of a total of 77,762 people who claim disability benefit each week, I am led to believe that approximately 21,000 would have claims for a period of less than ten weeks, which is the time in question.  Have the Minister's Department any convincing evidence concerning alterations made in the payment of short term disability benefit in other countries as to whether absenteeism has been reduced as a result?  For example, have they researched the figures for short term claims in the United Kingdom?  I gather that, for the past year, claims for under ten week's duration have been paid by employers.  Secondly, if a decision is taken to change the system of payment of disability benefits involving a duration of ten weeks, will his Department take cognisance of the fact that companies which employ a large number of employees could cope with payments for such claims much more easily than would companies with a small number of employees?</P>

      <P>Many of the points raised by the Deputy would fall within the ambit of the talks which will be carried on over a period of time.  The Government see definite advantages in their proposals for all the parties concerned.  All employees <Col N="966" /> would have a clear-cut and easily understood entitlement to continuation of wages for all but long term illnesses.  At present only about 60 per cent of workers are covered by occupational sick pay schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the taxation position in general.  I wanted to conclude on one item, which was farmers' taxation.  I have no doubt that the farming community in general were producing accounts and making returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  The recommendation in the fifth report of the Commission on Taxation regarding self-assessment should come into operation.  If this were so, money would be collected much more quickly from the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land tax is coupled with farm tax.  It will be interesting to see how the adjusted acreage principle will work.  To adjust acreage in the west and to do so in the midlands are different matters.  The land is different in every respect.  The only fair taxation system is that based on income. If you earn the money, you pay the tax. If you do not, you cannot pay.  The question of land tax will create problems for those advanced in years who are not able to work their farms as younger people could.  Also, if they are incapacitated that must be taken into consideration.  My firm view and that of my party was that the system of tax returns on income was beginning to work well and the returns will show that the yield was increasing.  If a commitment had been given that this <Col N="995" /> system would remain in operation, it would not have been long before the farming community would have been paying up to £100 million a year.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of stamp duty relief on the transfer of holdings. Young farmers can qualify provided they complete ACOT courses and meet other criteria laid down.  I am disappointed that the age limit is being reduced from 35 to 30 years.  Until recent times owners of land, parents of sons and daughters, were holding on to their property as long as they possibly could.  There seems now to be a move towards earlier transfer but it is not happening on a wide enough scale. For very many reasons parents are reluctant to hand over their holdings.  The leasing of land to the Land Commission was a total failure because these people were debarred from many other essentials such as medical cards, old age pensions and other assistance.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the Minister for Finance should amend this regulation on Committee Stage and leave the age limit at 35 years.  As the Bill stands, a person over the age of 30 will not qualify for relief of stamp duty.  I am anxious that this matter should be re-examined, especially in relation to transfers to spouses.  I do not think anyone objects to the extension of the ACOT course from 100 to 150 hours.  That will benefit the farming community in the long run by giving young farmers very good experience.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with personal tax allowances.  Much has been made of the new child benefit scheme but many people who are employed, lucky enough to have a job, will not benefit at all from this scheme.  The increase of 25 per cent in children's allowance from £12.05 to £15.05 per child per month amounts to an increase of £36 per child per annum. This move, however, is coupled with the elimination of the child dependant tax allowance and a freezing of child dependant social welfare rates.  The elimination of the child dependant tax allowance of £100 means a loss of £48 per child per year in the case of those paying tax at 48 <Col N="996" /> per cent.  Since the increase in the child benefit scheme amounts to only £36 per child, there is a net loss of £12 per child. The lower paid worker paying tax at 35p in the pound loses £35 per child per annum and gains only £1 &mdash; virtually nothing.</P>
    <P>What of the other claim by the Minister that lower income families on social welfare will benefit from this new scheme?  The significance of the 25 per cent increase in children's allowance is outweighed by the 4 per cent increase in flat rate unemployment benefit and short rate unemployment assistance, combined with the freeze on child dependant rates, which means that the family income of such social welfare recipients will be frozen, at best, in real terms.  To sum up, this is a gimmick.  The father is robbed to pay the mother.  In 99 per cent of cases, the mother draws the allowance but the money is being deducted from the father, the wage earner.  It is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Do not let anybody try to say that this is a lift for the mothers of families.  In the light of what I have described, how could it be so regarded? Many of the increases to social welfare recipients will not come into effect until July.</P>

      <P>To give an example of what the Government's policies mean in reality, I shall refer to the Midland Health Board which would come within the financial package.  In respect of that health board there was a shortfall of £2 million.  The chief executive officer did not mince his words.  He said, &ldquo;The pruning is over.  There must now be real cuts.&rdquo; Those cuts involved reducing the income of the handicapped by £9.50 per week. Would any wage earner be pleased that his income be reduced by that amount? Any such reduction would result in people taking to the streets but that did not happen in the case of the handicapped, the defenceless who are not in strong enough a position to make a case for themselves.  If that reduction of £9.50 per week was for the purpose of reducing <Col N="998" /> my tax rate from 60p to 58p, the Government can have the 2p back because I do not like to see the handicapped being treated in that way.  It is shameful.  The cuts that were effective resulted, too, in people being unable to attend hospital clinics.  There were many other effects, too.  Therefore, the sufferers were the weak, the under-privileged and the handicapped, those who are least able to speak for themselves, who are not able to parade on the streets or, in other words, to disrupt.  They were the soft touch but I will continue to defend those people as I defended them at a meeting of our health board when I said they were entitled to better treatment.  A good deal of lip service has been paid to improving conditions for the retarded and handicapped but that meant little when ways were being found of making cutbacks. Members of the health board were told that if cuts to the extent of £2 million were not made, section 31 would be invoked. That would mean that the board would be disbanded and the health services in the area taken over by a faceless bureaucrat.  Our members had to behave in a responsible manner in regard to the Estimate and try to do the best possible in the circumstances.</P>

I am mentioning this aspect in the context of the references in the Bill to interest earned on money on deposit with financial institutions.  In the case of group water schemes such interest would be of help in financing the work but now that interest is to be taxed.  Interest on moneys invested in bona fide group water schemes should be exempt from this type of tax.</P>
    <P>Likewise, old age pensioners, some of whom may be incapacitated but who have small amounts of money on deposit in the bank, will be subject to deduction of tax on whatever little interest they earn on that money.  It is fine to say that the money can be reclaimed at the end of the tax year but in that case we are talking of leaving those people without the interest for that period.  Another factor is that if we are to have regard to the way the tax offices are clogged up now, old age pensioners or others would not want to be in a bad way in terms of having the tax repaid because they could be waiting a considerable time for their money.  The Government are only adding to the piles of papers that have built up in the tax offices.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage I shall be endeavouring to have some points clarified in regard to this tax.  I do not agree with some of the financial institutions who say that if the first £5,000 was exempt it would cost a lot of money.  The deposits in banks and other institutions would be substantially higher than that.  It would relieve the position somewhat to have the first £5,000 in a deposit account exempt from the deposit retention tax.  At the moment pensioners, particularly noncontributory old age pensioners, are penalised if they have over a certain amount of money in a financial institution to the extent that, for example, a single person with over £1,500, gets a reduced pension. That is a great bone of contention.  The position in regard to charitable organisations seems to be very grey.  What will <Col N="1000" /> be defined as a charitable organisation? I would like to see that spelled out in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In regard to industry here, particularly home industries, I have been informed by many people who have started up that it is not long before they receive a letter asking where they got the few pounds to start, what post office or bank had they had it in.  Reams of paper are going out to them on that.  That will not encourage many to start up in business.  If the Minister had £100,000 in the morning would he put it into labour intensive industry here with the climate that we have?  With the tax system operating as it is many persons anxious to form companies here are pessimistic about the outlook.  One would need a secretary in the smallest operation to keep account of all these taxes.  Any group of individuals starting a company here to give employment should get a break.  Above all, they should not get letters asking where they got the £5,000 or £10,000 to put into it. Is it not better than having them down at the labour exchange where the taxpayer is being bled to the last drop?  At the end of last year we had to bring in a substantial Supplementary Estimate to give almost £50 million more to the Department of Social Welfare.  That is not encouragement.  Many who were anxious to start up a small industry are having second thoughts about doing so. The day is gone when we will have large employers employing over 1,000 people. From now on we will be depending on small industries throughout the country. So we must make it attractive to make it work.  I do not condone the non-payment of a fair share of taxes by any company. I would not go along with any company that would withhold taxes duly collected from the employees.  But we must create a climate where it will be attractive to start up industries.</P>
    <P>The number of liquidations, receiverships and closures in the first three months of this year has been staggering and the indications are, according to leading industrialists, that this trend will continue.  I hope not, but the first three <Col N="1001" /> months were alarming.  In regard to company law, as far as I know no company will be loaned money by any financial institution here unless a personal guarantee is given by the director.  These companies are operating under difficult trading arrangements, that is, a system of free trade.  All the financial institutions, as well as tying up the company, its assets and so on, are now looking for personal guarantees.  If the directors are married they will tie up the wife's property as well, so that they have the directors, body and soul.  The financial institutions are closing up all the loopholes.  That is the situation.  There was a time when the assets of the company, land and property would be sufficient. But that is no longer the case.  They want the directors, body and soul.  They want their private houses and everything they have.  They are making sure that they are carrying no risk.  No company will be entertained unless it is 100 per cent secured.  If I may be critical of our financial institutions, the risk factor in their case is practically nil.  They are looking for gilt-edged projects.  They are interested in nothing else.</P>
    <P>Earlier a Deputy mentioned that companies were closing down or going into liquidation.  People I know whose businesses closed down lost many personal assets.  My heart goes out to them.  They took risks when times were bad.  It has been said that some people closed one business and started another the next day, but this happened in very few cases because today the financial institutions are secure.  They are not involved in risk taking.  The businessman takes the risk.  If the financial institutions give you money they own you body and soul and if you are not prepared to give a personal guarantee you will not get cash.</P>
    <P>Another Department which came a cropper under this Bill was the Department of the Environment.  Last June before the local elections people were asking candidates about the county road network.  Nobody can deny that our county roads are a disgrace.  All they can do in many counties is to patch up the roads but the holes are back after a <Col N="1002" /> shower of rain.  I was disappointed to note that no extra money is provided to improve the county road network.  I believe a case could be made to the EC for money to improve the county road network, and we could agree to match it pound for pound.  If money was pumped into our county roads it would bring about badly needed employment and create a good infrastructure.  This would improve many industrial areas and the roads leading to our major towns.  I cannot understand why additional money was not made available for this work.</P>
    <P>New arrangements were made in the programme announced last year for house improvement grants.  At that time we said badly needed assistance should be given to the construction industry.  The home improvement grants scheme was welcomed by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am disappointed that very little, if any, of this work got off the ground.  About a month ago a letter was issued by the Department, but it was very vague.  It said that people could start the work, but that they should keep the doors and windows which had been replaced so that the inspector could examine them.  He might say the door did not need to be replaced and that of the three windows which had been replaced, one was all right, and only the standard amount would be allowed for these replacements.</P>
    <P>In other words, if the householder wanted teak and weatherglaze, the Department would not meet the full cost. The problem, as I see it, is that when a house was inspected and before the work started the Department sent grant approvals and, if planning permission was required, the approval was marked &ldquo;subject to planning approval&rdquo;.  When the householder complied with that arrangement he could go to a bank for a bridging loan to start the job, or he might make the necessary financial arrangements.  That is not happening now.</P>
    <P>My information is &mdash; and it is reliable information &mdash; that it would cost between £120 million and £150 million to do all the work for which applications have been received, but the allocation is something over £20 million.  It is clear that what we <Col N="1003" /> are seeing now is a stalling operation. This could be another reason the inspectors are refusing to pass all the windows and doors which have been replaced.  I want to ask a very simple question.  If a person is replacing the windows in the front of the house, generally he will replace all the windows.  How can a person be expected to replace two or three windows?  One would be laughing at the other.  This problem should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I have heard of cases where the householders were to get the grant of £800 but a much smaller amount was paid.  I can only guess that the amount granted was for a smaller job.  As I said, we welcomed the house improvement grant scheme but it is causing many problems at present. The chief of those problems is that the money is not allocated under the financial arrangements to back it up.  We have not got the money for that, so they stall it and the delaying begins.  I am led to believe that when a house improvement job is completed the inspection will take anything up to ten weeks.  That is too much.  I hope that when these houses are inspected there will not be another stalling job with the word going out from the Department, &ldquo;Take it easy lads, cool it down", and when they go out on the job the gutter or a window is not right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, but what is important and interesting about this Bill is that it is a new departure containing measures which address for the first time <Col N="1007" /> in the last decade or two some very serious structural problems that we have in the economy.  Specifically, it proposes a package of incentives to generate a little more buzz in business and industry, and that must be welcomed.  It seems to me that often forgotten is the fact that, whether we like it or not, and some people in the House like it and others do not, we are a capitalist society.  The majority of the Members of this House accept that this is the type of society we want.  If it is the type of society that we want and want to keep, we must recognise that to have growth and movement in that we must have respect for and give encouragement to enterprise whether it be in the private or public sectors.  Enterprise, particularly in the private sector, but also in mixtures between the public and private sectors, is critical and central. This Finance Bill is one of the first for years to begin to address those problems.</P>
      <P>The tax reliefs which are there for companies established to deal with research and development recognise the importance of technological industries today and particularly the importance of research and development in those industries.  Reductions in capital gains tax and longer term capital gain from 40 per cent to 30 per cent will be a great fillip to industry and business.  The tax relief on dividends for manufacturing companies and the profit sharing schemes included in the Finance Bill can generate real movement and additional activity where it matters &mdash; in business.  As the Minister pointed out at the press reception launching the Bill &mdash; I do not know if he said this in the House as, unfortunately, I missed his speech &mdash; he wants to use this to generate a switch in funds from what he described as riskless deposits in banks and elsewhere into enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of investment we need, a point well made by Deputy Connolly a few minutes ago.  Irish business has been starved of equity finance as a result of which it had to rely heavily on borrowings and, because the base and relationship between debt and equity were wrong in business, banks were insisting &mdash; wrongly <Col N="1008" /> in my judgment &mdash; on personal guarantees for individuals.  Obviously where company limitation of liability is abused, we cannot condone it, but where it is used in the proper sense of the word it is damaging to enterprise to insist that the promoters of the company literally, as Deputy Connolly so graphically described, write away their dwellings and family assets.  The approach in the Bill is welcome and should be encouraged and pushed.</P>
    <P>Business ownership of substantial assets carries a certain odium in this country, which is wrong.  I know there is a negative side to entrepreneurialism but we must still recognise the fact that, whatever about the negative side, many people doing a job for themselves, the economy and the country have been suppressed for too long, in some instances necessarily, but in others the general atmosphere created has been unnecessarily restrictive to business and industry.  I welcome the approach in the Bill which will, I hope, change that emphasis.</P>
    <P>One of Deputy Connolly's incredible offerings to us this afternoon was his complaint about the miserly allowance and the ordinary current expenditure allowed for tax relief in regard to company cars. He complained that the Minister had increased it from £3,500 per annum to £4,000 per annum.  He omitted to refer to the fact that this is the first time in ten years that there has been a change in that figure.  It is something that should have been altered over the years because of inflation and in a ten year period of enormous inflation it was wrong for that figure to remain as it was.  I congratulate Deputy Connolly on the gay abandon with which he approached the question.  It has been very unfair to business people and to the motor industry.  If that figure had kept in line with inflation it would amount today to something in the region of £12,500 or £13,000.</P>
    <P>I hope that the concentration evident in the Bill on giving incentives to industry and investment will continue because it will encourage people, whether they are entrepreneurs, employers or owners of business, or people who benefit under <Col N="1009" /> profit sharing schemes such as employees of a business.  I hope they will see in this the opportunities they have to gain a reward for hard work and that those who intend to leave Ireland because of the high levels of taxation will see an attitude evident in Government to encourage them to stay and to play an important part in guiding the economy to prosperity in the future.  This must be applied across the board, not just to industry but also to agriculture which is going through an extremely difficult period at present.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, although there are arguments to be made in our case to get certain advantages in the restrictive policies now necessarily adopted by the European Community in so far as the Common Agricultural Policy is concerned, we must still recognise that there is no point in continuing to produce food that is not wanted.  We need to inculcate into the people involved in agriculture, not just farmers but those involved in food production and marketing generally, the importance of delivering to the consumer what he or she wants.  We have shown that we have the capacity to produce quality goods, particularly in agriculture, and there are opportunities in that field.  The way to identify those opportunities is by offering rewards to people who are enterprising, who engage in agricultural terms in research and development and who sell a product which consumers want.</P>
    <P>In welcoming those thrusts in the Finance Bill, it also has to be admitted that, generally speaking, for non-agricultural business things are looking up.  There has been a substantial and dramatic drop in oil prices and inflation has dropped beneath that of many of our competitors for the first time in years.  This is of enormous importance and has given a great fillip to industry.  It gives us an opportunity which we have not had for years to go forward and to steer the economy on a path of growth.  There are a couple of points of importance to bear in mind in that regard. There will be a temptation as movement begins to generate itself in the economy to draw off some of it and political parties <Col N="1010" /> in an election year might be tempted to do so.</P>
    <P>Demands from sectional interests within the community will be quick to identify that this buoyancy is there and should be taken advantage of to satisfy short term or sectional needs.  That would be a tremendous mistake which has been made many times before and it would be intolerable that it should happen again. We must guard against it, particularly at present.  Because of lower inflation and falling oil prices, the ordinary working man and woman are beneficiaries as well as industry.  For example, the tax reliefs in the budget, small though they may be in the context of the crippling burden of personal taxation, are now about twice as high as inflation and in the context of what was predicted as inflation when the budget was prepared.  That means that people will benefit in real terms from the tax reliefs in the budget.  It is significantly more than indexation.  When that is combined with wage settlements, which by and large this year have been about 7 per cent at a time when inflation has dropped &mdash; over the period of the wage agreement it will be less than half that &mdash; a very real new level of purchasing power has been delivered to the man at work.  Real benefits are there for the average earner. Equally, social welfare increases are running significantly above the rate of inflation.  All the figures we are talking about are low but, low though they may be, the real purchasing power of people is increasing.</P>
    <P>It is important that that benefit goes through the community.  It will inspire additional spending within the community.  It will allow people the opportunity, for the first time in a number of years, to have an increased standard of living. However, it is terribly important that we control the position because, as Deputy Connolly pointed out, our debt is enormous.  If we are now benefiting from dramatically reduced oil prices we must not forget that it was about the time of the dramatic increase in oil prices in the early seventies that we first began in a real way to engage in current deficit budgeting to <Col N="1011" /> solve our problems.  I am as good as anybody at showering blame on one or other side of the House, but the fact is that as a community we have accumulated this debt.  It is of enormous importance that we endeavour to control it and not spoil ourselves by using any increased buoyancy there is at the moment to splurge, whether for electoral purposes, or to satisfy any short term sectional interest.  We owe that to our young generation and, perhaps, to future generations.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a point I have been making for a long time in regard to oil pricing generally.  On many occasions in the past I argued in the House, until the present structure was changed, that the Irish consumer was frequently being ripped off.  A change came about whereby on a very regular basis the ingredients that make up the oil prices are examined and alterations take place.  On a regular basis we have seen the benefit of that being passed on to the Irish consumer.  However, there is a slight danger that in some areas not readily apparent to us, companies, particularly those that enjoy monopolies, may begin to draw off some of the benefits of a drop in oil prices for themselves.  That would be terribly wrong and it is important, particularly in the absence of the National Prices Commission, that this is watched and monitored carefully by the Department of Industry and Commerce and other Departments, particularly the Department of Energy.  The Irish consumer is entitled to have that benefit passed on and nobody, individual, corporation or semi-State body, has the right to enjoy that benefit.</P>

      <P>The only exception to that rule that I am aware is where the State was involved.  I have to say that I think it is legitimate and proper that the State should do it.  They do it in an open way but I am talking about somebody who in a clandestine or surreptitious way draws off the benefit of the drop in oil <Col N="1012" /> prices.  Obviously, oil prices take some time to go through the economy and get to the consumer in certain respects.  In respect of purchasing a gallon of petrol the reduction should be through straight away and with the changes brought about by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, when he was responsible for that area, it is passed on on a regular basis.  Deputy Hyland was about to criticise the Government for engaging in this.  It is good crack to have a go at the Government on a point like this, but it is fair too that the Government should meet their debts.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  If one is to complain about the level of debt we have, then one must recognise that those debts must be paid.  If that calls for a rise in taxation then it is done.</P>

      <P>Some weeks ago another Deputy on this side of the House and myself made a point about the cost of Whitegate.  The cost factor involved in that was denied by a spokesman on behalf of Whitegate.  An operation like Whitegate can only survive by the imposition of an obligation on oil companies operating here to buy one third of their throughput of oil from Whitegate at a price fixed by Whitegate.  Unfortunately, I do not have the resources to determine whether the price fixing by Whitegate is fair.  I cannot figure out the basis on which it is done. On any basis that I have been shown by economists working in the area I have come to the view that Whitegate add a cost of about 10p per gallon on petrol. Whitegate say I am wrong.  I cannot argue with their figures because they have total control of the position but if they say they are as competitive as other people trading in oil, why is there the necessity for this statutory obligation on oil companies here to purchase one-third of their needs from Whitegate?  If it is the position that Whitegate are competitive then they can survive in the market-place.  I say to the INPC who run Whitegate that they were originally charged with responsibility to deliver to the Irish consumer the benefits of that corporation being able to deal in <Col N="1015" /> the market-place for oil and they have an obligation to prove their efficiency.</P>
      <P>I challenge them to request a legislative change to remove the compulsory offtake provisions obtaining at present.  Certainly, I would be willing to sponsor legislation, to bring in a Private Members' Bill, proposing its deletion from our laws as they stand.  There is an argument advanced about security of supply and all the rest of it.  Frankly, I do not believe that.  I do not believe it to be the real reason and I do not believe that the INPC believe it is the real reason.  I know that several years ago they had a problem; but, from figures they have published themselves now, they appear to be competitive.  I should like to see that competitiveness tried out in the market-place.  I would urge them to indicate to the Minister responsible that they no longer need that statutory whip over all the oil companies.  It would be a matter of very considerable pride for us to have a State corporation that could prove itself in that way.  The INPC say they can do it and are doing so.  I believe they can prove it to us and to the international oil industry by agreeing to the removal of the present restrictions.</P>

    <P>There is a provision in this Finance Bill that reflects a policy of Government announced some months ago, urban renewal.  Deputies from Dublin, but also those from other cities mentioned in the Bill, must be very pleased.  I am not.  I am from a town that would not be of a size to benefit from the largesse available or proposed in the Finance Bill.  I must admire the thinking behind the provisions of the Bill.  I might address myself to Dublin particularly, because it is a city I like.  But I have to say that in recent decades its development has been an absolute and utter disgrace.  I am not going to allocate blame.  It may have been the fault of planners or of developers, but the reality is there for everybody to see. The results of their endeavours are a monument to spectacular failure.  It is a beautiful city destroyed visually.  From the point of view of having a living city <Col N="1016" /> centre it is dead.  The proposal for urban renewal in this Bill is something that can play a very potent part in changing that. As a provision it is all right, but it will require commitment, whether on the part of Dublin Corporation or the Department of the Environment to push it and make it work.  The areas described in the Bill are ones that have suffered tremendous deprivation.  They are areas that are structurally vital to the city and that can enjoy a good commercial or residential future if people put their minds to the task.  There is a great opportunity not to be lost.  The general performance in planning and development of this city has been so bad that an awful lot of ground must be made up.  This is a good approach, to be pursued vigorously by the people afforded the opportunity.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I want to make in relation to the Bill which, while small in themselves, are of some importance.  The proposal to introduce a new annual tax on discretionary trusts introduces capital acquisitions tax and capital inheritance tax into the Bill.  I am very conscious of the complaints with regard to the returns from capital taxation.  I cannot understand why those returns are low.</P>
    <P>There is another side to it to which I want to refer briefly.  I am concerned at the fact that there has not been a significant or reasonable enough increase in the thresholds of capital taxation over the past several years.  Whether or not one is a property owner does not really matter.  There is a consequence for the country and it is well that we realise precisely what we are doing.  It does not take a big business nowadays, in terms of employment or profit, to find itself with assets of many hundreds of thousands of pounds, even £1 million, £1.5 million or £2 million.  There would be many companies with asset bases of that size who might be barely ticking over in the current difficult economic climate.  Many of those Irish-owned businesses are being placed in the position of having to be sold to pay enormous capital acquisitions tax liabilities.</P>
    <P>We need to question whether that is <Col N="1017" /> what we want to achieve.  I subscribe largely to the view of those who feel that the tax base should be widened as much as possible.  It should be done with regard to capital taxation.  But we need to assess the effect capital acquisitions tax is having at present on the ownership of businesses.  Agricultural land has not been that badly affected, although it went through a period of being very badly affected.  Because agricultural land prices have remained low and because of agricultural relief the position there has not been quite so bad, though it can be bad. In relation to business the position has caused sales where they should not have had to take place.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I would ask the Minister to take note of and reply to me when responding to the debate or by letter afterwards; I do not mind.  I understand a certain situation to exist at present whereby, merely because one owns property in Ireland and has a foreign domicile, liability to capital acquisitions tax does not arise at all.  If I may I will give an illustration.  Take two people, let us say, both of UK domicile who, let us say again, own stud farms.  If one of those persons owns a stud farm through a company registered in Ireland liability to capital acquisitions tax will arise on the transfer of shares on the death of that person.  But if the company who owns the stud is registered in the United Kingdom, then liability to capital acquisitions tax does not arise.  That is my understanding of the position obtaining.  I may be wrong in my understanding.  It seems to me extraordinary that in relation to a capital tax that arises on the transfer of real property in the country&mdash;whether through a company or otherwise does not really matter because there are all sorts of guises that can be set up to deal with these&mdash;where in both instances the beneficial owner of the shares of the company is of foreign domicile but, in one instance, merely because the company is registered in Ireland the shares are regarded as being Irish assets and liability arises.  But where the shares belong to an English registered company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Connolly referred to the proposal in the Bill to change and ultimately withdraw the stamp duty relief applicable at present on transfers of lands from father to son.  That relief was introduced some years ago to encourage transfers of land.  Deputy Connolly was correct in what he said&mdash;it is and has been a very great problem in this country to get land holdings transferred from elderly people to their children.  The provision introduced in, I think, the 1982 Finance Act to exempt from stamp duty transfers of lands from parents to children has been beneficial in that respect.  But the fact is that if that provision remains on the Statute Book indefinitely, then its effect is lost.  The proposals of the Minister for Finance are good.  He tells us now that it will be left until the end of September as it stands and then it will be changed by lowering the age from 35 to 30, increasing the obligation in terms of time spent on an agricultural course, time spent studying agriculture.  People are placed on notice that it will happen.  They had better get their act together.  They have approximately six months, affording them loads of time in which to do what they must.  The opportunity is being given them and they are being placed on notice.  If the measure were to remain on the Statute Book as it is, without any change, people would assume simply that it would remain indefinitely and the incentive that was there when the relief was introduced the first day would go.  A change is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Connolly said, there is a problem because many farmer landowners are concerned about their own security and for that reason are unwilling to transfer their lands to the next generation.  There has been only one means for dealing with this problem &mdash; I am talking particularly about families in which several children may be left unprovided for. It is a fact of life that when a child, whether a girl or boy, is not married there <Col N="1019" /> is a fear about how a new spouse would fit into the existing family home.  The only means for dealing with that in the past was to put in the formal transfer deed a revocation clause so that if circumstances arose to threaten the parents' security in some way the power of revocation could be exercised and the difficulties overcome.  More often than not it was the mere existence of that power in the transfer instrument that kept control of what otherwise might have been a difficult or impossible situation for the older folk in the family.</P>
    <P>For reasons that I do not understand, the Revenue Commissioners take the view that where there is a power of revocation in a transfer of land from father to son, the relief through the exemption in the 1982 Finance Act does not apply.  I know they have taken that view and I ask the Minister for Finance to amend that provision in this Bill to get over that problem.  I am sure the Revenue Commissioners have no objection to the power of revocation; I believe they are interpreting the law as they are obliged to and that they must apply the law as it stands, but giving the power of revocation or giving somebody stamp duty relief while putting the power of revocation in a transfer deal will enhance greatly the Minister's wish and intention that there would be a greater degree of transfer of lands from one generation to the next.  I believe that one step would generate more transfers of lands than anything that I could suggest as a change in that section of the Bill.  I have thought about it a lot and I cannot see any harm in it.</P>
    <P>I cannot finish on the Finance Bill without making some reference to what is known as &ldquo;the DIRT&rdquo;, the deposit interest retention tax, and the tax on insurance companies.  I cannot say I like either tax because I regard them both as blunt instruments: though they may be efficient in terms of collection, they can cause injustices that are not intended.</P>
    <P>The case for charity and for elderly people who are not otherwise liable to income tax has been made and largely met in the Bill, but I would urge the <Col N="1020" /> Minister for Finance to consider, despite possible enormous practical difficulties, the making of some arrangement whereby elderly people who are not otherwise liable to income tax would not have to suffer retention tax at all or, if they must suffer it for reasons of its practical application, can recover what is taken within a short period.</P>
    <P>On the day the retention tax was announced here I spoke to the Minister for Finance and other Ministers and expressed the view that injustices would ensue from it.  They rightly pointed out that there are other places in which people can invest money and actually get better returns than in the banks.  It is extraordinary that people do not avail of these.  For example, saving certificates can be bought in the Post Office that will yield ten per cent, tax free.  I cannot understand why some people still want to have their money in the Bank of Ireland or AIB at 7 per cent, shortly to be subject to the retention tax.  I cannot understand that, but there it is.</P>
    <P>I understand the Government's attitude that much money was being earned in bank interest on which income tax was not being paid.  That problem has to be addressed, and without doubt this tax is doing so.  I venture the view that the anticipated return from this tax will be significantly higher than the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners have suggested.  I presume the Revenue Commissioners have determined the amount, but if I were a betting man I would bet that the returns will be greater than indicated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This tax is efficient but I am not happy with it because people who otherwise would not have tax liabilities will suffer. I think the problem could have been overcome if the Government had announced it a year before introducing it.  There is no doubt that the deposit interest retention tax had to come &mdash; it has been in existence in Britain for the past few years. Because of the way our tax legislation has gone and the need for efficiency and the complaints made about tax avoidance, this tax was inevitable.  I am concerned because it was introduced without <Col N="1021" /> adequate warning and without enough opportunity being given to people in the community to explain to elderly people the opportunities for investment elsewhere.  Because people who were not acclimatised to this new environment injustices may be caused.  I do not regret the existence of the tax &mdash; I can see the logic and sense behind it &mdash; but a weak section in our society may suffer because of it.  I hope bank managers throughout the country will advise people who have no tax liabilities of their opportunities elsewhere to earn more than in banks at present.</P>
    <P>Changes have been announced since the budget with regard to the insurance tax.  Even people involved in the insurance industry will honestly tell you that the Government have been denied taxation revenue that they should have received.  Most people in the industry who are fair would acknowledge the fact that the Government were entitled to more revenue than they were obtaining from the insurance industry.  Given the frustration the Department of Finance gurus must have been experiencing I can understand them resorting to something like this tax.  However, it is another blunt instrument which has been improved considerably in relation to the amount the Minister proposes to take.  However, in the longer term it is an unsatisfactory tax, it is so seen, and I believe that the same amount of revenue or more could be obtained through a more refined tax system.  I urge the Minister to examine that area with care and to have discussions with insurance industry interests during the next 12 months in an effort to tackle the problem.  I am sure that the problem can be tackled.  There is goodwill and understanding in the insurance industry of the necessity for changes in this area.  I urge that a form of taxation be found which is not as blunt and which would not cause the problems which this tax might cause.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that some of my concluding points are critical.  I ask the Minister to explain the intention and purpose of section 100 of the Finance Bill, which proposes to reduce from 1.25 per cent per <Col N="1022" /> month to 1 per cent per month interest payable on refunds of capital tax.  In other words, where overpayment of capital tax has occurred and interest is due to be paid to the taxpayer, that interest is being reduced from 1.25 per cent to 1 per cent per month.  In the context of the deposit interest retention tax, there is a certain logic in doing that.  A person might be caught under that section who would not otherwise be liable for income tax.  Perhaps there is another reason for this and that I am wrong in my interpretation, but it seems a little unfair.  I urge reconsideration of it.</P>
    <P>On a general note, over the past year or two I have listened to several debates in the House, particularly in relation to the National Development Corporation, the function of left and right, the function of the private side and the public side of our economy.  I was of the view that in this country the public side had more often failed than succeeded.  In the past few years I have come to the view that the mix is what is most important and that we should never lose the opportunity to use the talents we have on the private side to develop certain public facilities&mdash; for example, the establishing of roads, building of houses and the like, or the development of forestry.  Equally, it is important that those who work in the public service are exposed to the private side.  There is a great dilemma there. There is also a lack of understanding, of communication and appreciation on both sides as to the function of the other.  In some countries, particularly France, there is much exchange of personnel from private industry to public.  That operates on a tiny scale here and it is not practical to think that that alone would deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>We are reaching a time of change in our economy.  This Bill gives certain signals of willingness to change.  I urge the Government for the remainder of their time in office and future Governments to be willing to use the best talents in the private and public side together to do certain things.  As the Minister for Finance has highlighted on many occasions in his speeches, it is not what you have that <Col N="1023" /> matters, whether in terms of ownership,. investments, or whatever, it is performance that matters.  We have the talent here to do a great deal better than we are doing.  We should try to get rid of some of our ideological hang-ups about whether things should be done by the private or the public side and recognise the great importance that both sides have in developing our economy.</P>

      <P>Tháinig sé i gcuimhne dom go ndúirt mé, nuair a bhí mé ag labhairt ar an gcáinaisnéis i Mí Feabhra, nach raibh sa cháinaisnéis sin muinín ná treoir, beag ná mór.  Bhí mé ag rá go raibh teipithe ar pholasaí an Chomhrialtais cé go rabhamar ag tnú go mbeadh a leithéid san cháinaisnéis a thabharfadh dóchas dúinn agus don tír uilig, athrú a thiocfadh as ghníomhaíochtaí an Rialtais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> Dúirt mé chomh maith gurb í an dífhostaíocht an fhadhb is mó sa tír faoi láthair.  An figiúr oifigiúil atá luaite ná timpeall 250,000 duine.  Tá a fhios againn go léir go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó ná sin dí-fhostaithe agus go bhfuil slua mór ag imeacht diaidh ar ndiaidh as an tír agus ag lorg fostaíochta i dtíortha eile.</P>
    <P>When contributing to the budget debate, I indicated that there was a feeling of some hope, before the publication of the budget, that the Government might realise, after their three continuous years in office, by some stretch of the imagination or from some of the advisers of which they have a superfluity, that they should come up with some solutions of the problems in the country and in the economy.  The greatest expectations came from the people who were seeking employment, the almost 250,000 who are registered as unemployed, the many more seeking employment but not registered for various reasons, people on short term courses and participating in training schemes of various kinds in the hope of sustainable jobs at the finish. A certain hope was building up in their minds and attitudes that the budget which we were about to have would contain some measure of hope, some direction away from the path that the Government had been travelling and from the state into which they had allowed our economy to drift.</P>
    <P>I must point out that the people felt let down by the budget.  Despite many suggestions and ideas put forward during the budget debate, this Finance Bill of 108 sections has emerged which, as the Minister said in the opening lines of his Second Stage address, gives statutory effect to the taxation changes introduced in the 1986 budget.  The Bill also contains a number of provisions not announced in the budget.  Many of us had hoped that the Finance Bill would contain improvements, ideas put forward during the budget debate when indications were given of where the Government were on the wrong course.  The changes which have actually been introduced are minimal.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is one of the most <Col N="1025" /> important Bills to come before the Oireachtas in any year.  I am very much aware of the restricted time allowed for Second Stage and the suggestion by the Government that the 108 sections should be dealt with in three sitting days.  I am aware that there is a statutory date by which the Finance Bill must be completed.  Time was lost because the commitment as to the date of introduction of the Bill was not honoured.  Many times our spokesman on Finance asked the Taoiseach when the Finance Bill would be introduced.  Dates were given but they were not adhered to and hence we are dealing with the Bill in a rather confined way. This is never satisfactory but, when our economy is in such a state, it is only reasonable to expect that more time and importance should be attached to the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>We have heard time and again that measures aimed at improving labour market conditions in times of recession and population growth have been severely restricted by the necessity to implement policies geared towards adjusting public finance and external payment imbalances.  Two of the main planks of the platform of the Coalition parties before the 1982 general election were the phasing out of the budget deficit and the reduction of foreign borrowing. Deputy Molony threw out some kind of a challenge but we will continue to remind the people of the commitments given and the promises made on those two aspects of our finances.  We will remind them, although I fancy they do not need reminding, that more money has been borrowed by this Government than by any other.  The money borrowed was not used for productive purposes. Our economy has contracted and the money is being used for day-to-day spending.  It is extraordinary that Deputies opposite should raise that matter because we are in a much worse situation, having borrowed much more.  They will hear much about this subject before the next election.  On the question of deficit budgeting, one party said something different from the other before the election <Col N="1026" /> but, in their cobbled-together programme for Government, they changed that in order to accommodate one another.  The target and the year set were abandoned long ago.</P>
    <P>During the Estimate debate in June 1983 the then Minister for Labour said:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these restrictions the Government have established the appropriate economic structures which are aimed at securing the environment for economic regeneration through proper economic planning and management.  These structures are centered on the Cabinet Task Force on Employment which brings a co-ordinated and integrated approach to the problem and also ensures that the competence and expertise available in the State are fully utilised.</P>
    <P>That is very nice phraseology but what has happened in the meantime to the coordinated and integrated approach to the problems as they saw them in 1983?</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>... programmes have been expanded rapidly in recent years to meet the twin objectives of maintaining a dynamic labour market and making some reductions in the level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>These are very interesting words three years later for this Administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the face of that kind of commitment, it would be fair to say three years later that the Government must acknowledge absolute and total failure in this regard.  I have indicated that we have never really been able to put an exact figure on the number of unemployed.  We have to go by the CSO figures but it is reasonable to suggest that the number out of work is close to 300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must take account of the estimated 45,000 who have emigrated in recent times.  On the matter of emigration, I hope the Government are aware that the annual report of the London Irish Centre <Col N="1027" /> gives some startling information.  It states that more and more Irish emigrants are arriving in London and facing difficulties in finding work, accommodation and food.  They say their forecast of a continual emigration upsurge has been confirmed by their community services department.  In 1985, 2,136 new clients arrived seeking help and advice.  The number of new clients represented an 18 per cent increase on the previous year and a 300 per cent increase over the preceding three years.  Many arrived in groups of four or five searching desperately for work.  Many brought with them personal problems, more often than not caused by the lack of employment in their own areas.</P>
    <P>The report makes the observation that either they had to leave in order to send home money or because there was continual family friction because of unemployment.  It details the procedure as follows: &ldquo;They collect their dole money, buy a ticket, escape another family row, get on the boat with nothing except resentment and fear&rdquo;.  The report contains the observation that many still believe that the streets are paved with gold but that they often get a rude awakening when they are refused benefit by the Department of Health and Social Security &mdash; because they failed to bring identification with them, that many want to return home but that is difficult if one has no return ticket and no money.</P>
    <P>I would add to that that the problem would be increased because of no hope of employment at home.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>While looking for employment desperation often takes over after 20 to 30 phone calls, interviews and often fearful underground journeys.  It is not unusual to find a whole family on the doorstep of the centre, with cases, requesting accommodation apologetically.</P>
    <P>If we wish to measure the performance of this Government in any one area, that <Col N="1028" /> report is an indictment of that performance and of the reluctance of the Government at all times to show their concern at least by inquiring about the welfare of the many young people who find themselves in those circumstances as they have been called on to do repeatedly by Deputy Fahey.  These matters are not dealt with in the Finance Bill.  The whole trend of the budget and of the Finance Bill should be to give some measure of hope to our people.</P>
    <P>In <i>Building on Reality</i> the Government projection was that the unemployment figure would be 226,500 at the end of the period of the plan.  After only one month of the plan's existence the unemployment figures were off target by 13,000 and have continued to be very much off target. There is no plan for reducing the unemployment figure.  In recent years the number of jobless has spiralled.  Closures and impending closures continue unabated.  The incentive to work has been diminished to some extent by the impact of high taxation, direct and indirect.</P>
    <P>Government speakers have been telling us that the changes both in direct and indirect taxation will have the effect of encouraging incentive to work and of encouraging people to invest in the area of the creation of employment.  That is not the reality because the minimal changes announced in the budget will have no effect so far as taxation is concerned.  Personal investment in risk taking enterprises is treated less favourably for taxation purposes than are other forms of investment.  I acknowledge that a small effort has been made in that direction but the level of the changes compared with the size of the problem indicates that the Minister should have gone further.  In that way he would have been helping to create an atmosphere conducive to investment in industry by both groups and individuals.</P>
    <P>Increased employment depends on a sustained growth in manufacturing industry plus a recognition that many jobs can be created in the service sector and that there be an expansion and development of small businesses; but these improvements will only occur if all the <Col N="1029" /> necessary ingredients for that expansion are available, not necessarily in the order of priority but certainly in terms of both direct and indirect taxation.  Those outside factors that we have heard about so often in terms of detrimental effects on our economy &mdash; the oil crisis and inflation &mdash; are no longer of such significance because the trend is being reversed in both cases.  However, one must ask whether in terms of their policies the Government are in a position to take advantage of those changes on the international front.  There is clear evidence that the Government are not in that position.  If we do not take the action that is required on a number of fronts to improve the climate for enterprise and to restore the incentive to work we will continue to experience increasing unemployment.  That is why the Government must change their policies.  In that respect I suggest that they face up to the fundamental question of whether they are prepared to take the road of development, incentive, encouragement and so on, or whether they merely intend continuing in reverse gear with all the cutbacks, controls and stagnation that involves.</P>
    <P>There have been many studies and task forces and reports.  One would have thought that by now the Government would have had sufficient documentation available to them.  In May 1985 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development commented &ldquo;Ireland faces a bleak economic outlook&rdquo;.  That forecast came amid news that exports had taken a sharp tumble in April.  The OECD predicted a gloomy economic future because of Ireland's huge debt and the poor prospects of recovery by our private industries.  Was that warning totally ignored by the Government?  The OECD also indicated that we now have proportionately the biggest debt of their 24-members.  The debt, in May 1985, stood at 128 per cent of gross national product, the highest figure in the OECD area.</P>
    <P>They further stated that the economic and employment outlook in Ireland was particularly bleak.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with where the Government get their advice <Col N="1030" /> but surely a body like the OECD should have been of sufficient stature to put the Government on notice, apart altogether from the promptings from the Opposition side of the Chamber.  The Government have ignored the warnings.  They have failed dismally to create an environment in which enterprise and investment and job creation can grow and develop.  Since they took office they have pursued policies which have had the effect of running down the Irish economy.  We have had retrenchment, cutbacks, closures, receiverships and liquidations regularly.  They have been the hallmark of this Government.  They will be remembered for many things.  But they will certainly be remembered for that lot.  They have not yet managed to create an environment which is conducive to investment.  Regrettably this Finance Bill, with its 108 sections, has addressed that problem in a very minimal way only.  To enumerate the failures of this Government since they took office would take the remainder of Private Members' Time and all of tomorrow as well and I still would not be finished.  What positive proposals or decisions have emanated from this Government in any Department?  There was one, the National Development Corporation.</P>

I always said it was a matter of keeping the two parties together.  I have been proven right because I see no evidence of activity on the part of that body except holding them together, and it is still holding them together because they are still together. Suffice it to say that the propaganda machine, despite working at full production, will not distort the facts.  The electorate, when they get the opportunity, whether it is in a week's time, a month's time, in 12 month's time or in 18 month's time will not be fooled by the Government's promises and platitudes. This time it will not work because the electorate are only too well aware of how <Col N="1031" /> they were conned by the propaganda machine during November 1982.</P>

It does not matter which way the Coalition switch the dates around, talking about 1977 or 1947 or whatever date they care to mention, that horse has been flogged so often that it is stone dead.  Surely the Government must be aware that everybody, whether coming out of a football match or coming out of the church or whatever, is wondering how long more the Coalition will last and asking when we are going to get them out.

We must acknowledge that times are changing with electronics and microelectronics.  Technology is changing so much that, of course, we have to take up some slack.

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We lost Dunlops, Fords and the dockyard.  I could go on naming them.  We had the dubious distinction of being the unemployment black spot because we were worst hit by the recession.  That was a dreadful distinction to have.  We had the sympathy and concern of many people which we appreciate, but we have been overtaken all around the country by Wexford, Dundalk, Drogheda, the Border regions and the west where all the emigration arises. Unfortunately, where Cork led, the rest of the country has followed.  We do not wish it to be like that, but this Government in the Finance Bill, in their budget, in any other of their activities have done absolutely nothing to redress the situation, which is becoming worse.</P>
      <P>Deputies might be amazed that because we put through an enabling Bill to designate an area of Cork as a free port, which has not been done yet because the legislation to confirm it has not been introduced, we have had requests from all over the country, from Dún Laoghaire, Wexford, Carlingford in County Louth, and I am sure Killala will be next.  All these areas see a possibility of a free port area having benefit for them.  They are grasping at straws, as we in Cork are, in order to recover, but the straws are not even falling from this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people are reasonable about it, they will admit that it is the responsibility of the Government of the day to create an environment in which enterprise can grow and develop.  I have never said &mdash; and I hope will never resort to saying &mdash; that the Government themselves should create jobs, because that is not correct, <Col N="1033" /> but the Government have a role to play in creating an atmosphere in which jobs can be created by the policies being pursued and by assistance being given to people with ideas and enterprise.  That is not happening at this time when we need it so badly.  Only very small encouragement is given in the Finance Bill in that direction.  Small though it is, I acknowledge it but it is not nearly enough, given the magnitude of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>You are getting your free port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We got an indication on the passing of the free port legislation.  It was an enabling Bill.  Ringaskiddy was mentioned but nothing has happened since then.  We must live on and wait and wait, and let me remind the Deputy that legislation came in as a result of a report submitted by the Cork task force to the Government, two years previously.  The Government have failed dismally to create the environment that I speak of. Since taking office they have pursued policies which have had the effect of running down the economy.  Instead of growth and development, we have reached this awful situation of closures and liquidations that I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>The environment seems hostile to enterprise, and that has the effect that talented Irish young people are unwilling to undertake the risks involved in bringing their ideas for new products and services to the marketplace.  The return on industrial investment is much too low to attract funds, and the evidence of that surely is in the fact that people are not investing in industrial development.  They are putting their money into Government gilts.  It is time the Government faced up to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me be more specific on industry and consider one of the best industries for the creation of employment, the construction industry.  I learned by listening to the debate that when this was mentioned by some of my colleagues there was almost an uproar to emphasise the great value that is accruing from the house improvement grants.  What is the <Col N="1034" /> situation regarding them?  We will come to that, but let me say that no industry has the facility or ability to create jobs more quickly than the construction industry and it does that at a lesser cost than many other areas of activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>You let them sign on for the dole too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of creating employment in the construction industry, per job created, is much lower than per job created in other elements of industry. There is considerable scope for Government action to increase employment in the construction industry, if they have the political will to stimulate the industry. I have never understood why, in periods of Coalition Government, the construction industry zooms downwards.  Have they lost faith in Coalition Governments? One sure fact is that now they have no faith in Coalition Governments.  Coalition Governments have demoralised the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent decision &mdash; taken last year, but again we are talking about the Finance Bill and the budget &mdash; was this 5 per cent increase in VAT in the construction industry, 100 per cent increase.  Despite the Second Stage debate, the amendments to the Finance Bill and the introduction of a Private Members' motion on that 5 per cent, the Government persisted in retaining that increase in VAT in the building industry, also despite the submissions made to the Government by that industry.  Why should the Government treat the construction industry in that manner?  We are all aware that, on our return to the Dáil after the 1985 summer recess, in order to stave off a near revolution from the back benches, the Government hurriedly, without any preconsultation, without studying the programme in any way, introduced as a saver &mdash; they were on the brink then &mdash; the famous or now infamous house improvement grants.  The backbenchers had come back in a fighting mood after the local election campaign because they had been told on the ground where we <Col N="1035" /> were and where the building industry was.</P>
    <P>They had not thought out the scheme and this was evidenced by the fact that the announcements made contradicted each other.  The rate of demand for forms because of the publicity was to be expected, but the Department were not geared to handle that demand.  The inspectorate had not been increased to examine the applications and when that was realised the message came out.  We can see the doubt, uncertainty and confusion this Government can create by the one small action of introducing the house improvement grant scheme when they could not do it properly.  Every Deputy here knows well the confusion that still exists.  We had an invitation in the media: &ldquo;Go ahead with the job.  We will look at it and then we will tell you how much we will give you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure that message has gone back to the Department but, if it has not, it is because they are not listening.  People are not accepting that sort of decision from this Government.  They do not trust the Government.  They will wait until the inspector comes and tells them they may do this or that because there is so much doubt in the minds of the people and lack of credibility that they will not accept that they should do the job, that it will be inspected later and that then they will get the grant.  As I said, if the message has not gone back to the Department by now, it will be there soon because that is what I have been hearing from my constituents, and I am sure other Deputies have heard the same.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the 7 per cent growth rate between 1985 and 1987 mentioned in the Government's document, <i>Building on Reality.</i> Everybody knows that is not achievable under present Government policies.  This Government's attitude to the construction industry makes it even more impossible.  Why they ever set it down in that famous, or otherwise, document is a cause for wonder.  The killer blow this Government inflicted on the construction industry in December 1982 was the <Col N="1036" /> reduction of capital programme money &mdash; £200 million.  That reduction must be condemned without qualification.  At that time the Government should have considered additional funding.  This is not the first time that has been said because we have been condemning the Government for that £200 million reduction since then. Yet they blunder on and leave the construction industry to decline into the extraordinary position in which it finds itself, with 50 per cent of the workforce out of work.</P>
    <P>Last October the home improvement grants scheme was introduced and now five months later the great increase in the number of people to be employed because of this famous announcement has not yet been seen.  Why?  Because the Government rushed into a decision they had not thought out or planned properly. That announcement has created a great deal of confusion.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to discuss a local matter which is really of national importance.  I tried to raise this matter on the Order of Business yesterday.  I accept your decision, Sir, that it was not a matter for discussion on the Order of Business.  I also sought to raise it on the Adjournment, but it was not considered to be of sufficient urgency.  Therefore, I am taking this opportunity to discuss Verolme Dockyard.  This Dáil and this country may think they have heard enough about that dockyard, but they are going to hear a lot more.</P>
    <P>The liquidation of Irish Shipping and allowing our only shipbuilding and ship repairing yard to go into liquidation is another hallmark of the failure of this Government.  But worse is happening. The local people, workers and former workers, got together to form a consortium to take over that dockyard.  They contributed some of their redundancy money, and sat long tedious hours with the liquidator with the specific purpose of re-opening the dockyard, perhaps on a small scale at the beginning, employing 50 to 100 workers, but with the obvious intention of making it pay, developing it and restoring it somewhat, if not entirely to what it was previously, that is a ship <Col N="1037" /> repairing and shipbuilding yard, and providing the skills and abilities which are latent in Cobh and the city of Cork.  All these people require from this Government at this time is the support of two Ministers &mdash; Minister Noonan and Minister Mitchell.  Their support is vital because the consortium are not in a position to put up anything like the £2 million the receiver is seeking.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day the Government will have to decide if they are willing to get involved and save the dockyard.  They let it go into liquidation before and I am asking them tonight to give a very serious and positive response to the efforts being made in the Cork area to have the dockyard reopened.  Minister Noonan and Minister Mitchell will have to decide the question of indemnifying the consortium against losses.</P>
    <P>The former workers formed a company known as the Great Island Shipyard, but so far they have missed much of the repair season.  Shipping repair jobs have gone abroad &mdash; the <i>Leinster</i> for a £2.5 million refit, to be followed by the <i>Connacht</i> for a similar job.  With Irish Shipping scuttled we had this unacceptable situation of a semi-State body, the ESB, supplying thousands of tonnes of coal to Money-point, using foreign vessels because we do not have our own since Irish Shipping was liquidated, and bauxite being brought into Aughinish in foreign vessels. I hope this Government realise what is happening.  We have Englishmen repairing our ships; we have Liberians and Panamanians transporting our cargoes; Irish people are stranded &mdash; some of them have been brought home &mdash; and more of them are idle.  An effort is being made by the workers in the Cork area to reopen the dockyard.  I am taking this opportunity to ask the Government at least to give recognition to what these people are attempting to do and to give a positive response to their efforts.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill should be modified further to boost investment in industry and to enable the economy to take advantage of the improved economic climate to which I referred earlier.  Falling oil prices and the projected drop in interest <Col N="1038" /> rates and their attendant consequences mean that the economy should be in a stronger position to take advantage of the upturn being experienced across Europe. Is it?  I should like Government Ministers to answer.  This will only happen if there is increased investment and that is why the Bill should be modified.  I reiterate that I welcome the measures designed to boost investment in industry in the Bill, but it is regrettable that the Minister did not modify the operating conditions of the business expansion scheme to enhance its attractiveness to investors in the manufacturing industry.  This is one positive result of the change of Ministers in the Department of Finance, because Minister Bruton, other Members and I discussed the Designated Trust Fund Bill and the Industrial Development Bill and I can see the effect in this measure which he introduced.  Clearly, it is a positive element and an improvement on the Bill introduced by Minister Dukes.</P>
    <P>There is a huge need to encourage the growth of venture capital, to encourage individuals to invest in manufacturing industry and to provide a new source of finance for small and medium sized businesses.  Under present legislation the designated trust funds are very restricted in their operation and cannot function as venture capital funds in the normal way. There is no need to elaborate any further on that.  We have discussed it.  The Minister obviously recognised the arguments we advanced during the discussion on designated trust funds, although he has not gone the total distance I hoped he would.  At the same time the urgency of generating an investment drive in Ireland was underlined by the review of the European Commission of industrial investment in 1985 and its proposals for 1986. When Governments, particularly Coalitions, make excuses for failures they blame outside influences.  I mentioned that already.  Across the Community industrial investment has been very buoyant, with European firms increasing their investment spending by 10 per cent in real terms.  In Ireland, however, instead of expected real increases, there <Col N="1039" /> was an average decline of 11 per cent in industrial investment in 1985.</P>
    <P>What hope have we of recovering if that is the trend?  We should be part of the positive trend in the Community, but I doubt if the provision made in the Bill will solve the problem.  The buoyancy of industrial development in Europe for 1985 reflected a new confidence and optimism and resulted in a 10 per cent increase in investment while ours dropped by 11 per cent.  The Minister and the Government must realise that this should not be the case and take the necessary steps to correct it.  Denmark and Holland led the way with a well above average investment growth of 33 per cent for Denmark and 21 per cent for Holland.  Real investment growth reached double figures in a number of other countries. West Germany was up by 14 per cent, France by 10 per cent, Luxembourg by 14 per cent and Greece, our new member, was up by 32 per cent.  What is wrong?  When we see these figures for our partners in Europe why is our figure 11 per cent in the wrong direction?</P>
    <P>In Ireland the gap between planned investment and the outturn was the widest.  There may be reasons for this, but the Government should identify them and take the necessary action to correct it.  The optimism sweeping across Europe may be gauged from the example of Luxembourg, a small nation, who instead of remaining static as expected found that investment rose appreciably in real terms and was up by 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>These statistics indicate that we are part of the same Community but we are not in the same league.  It shows that the Government must address themselves to the reasons for this, because we need investment in industry very badly to provide employment.  The Government must take a lead in the drive to make up the severe investment shortfall which has plagued Irish industry over the past four years.  A strong impetus to investment is a prerequisite if we are to exploit the improved economic climate to boost growth in output.  For this reason Minister Bruton should think again and further <Col N="1040" /> modify the quaifying conditions governing the attraction of investment under the business expansion scheme in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government are failing to provide jobs for young people.  A rock concert will be held very soon &mdash; I wish it well &mdash; to raise money to provide jobs for young people.  Does that suggest that the many existing agencies have failed in that respect?  Why are so many young people still unemployed in view of all the money being paid by taxpayers towards the youth employment levy?  I am often asked that question and I ask it here because it is relevant.  The youth employment levy was introduced in 1981 and so far has provided £384 million to help young unemployed people to train for jobs and in some cases to start their own businesses.  This year a total of £90 million will be divided among the various agencies engaged in the vocational preparation programme, employment incentive and environmental improvement schemes.  When that levy was introduced there was a feeling among taxpayers of being willing to give the 1 per cent to cater for the young people who need to be trained and retrained, if they fail in jobs.  I am not so sure that the same feeling exists towards the levy today.  It has been said very often that the efforts of the Youth Employment Agency are not having the desired effect.</P>
    <P>In the course of my contribution in the debate on the budget I, like other Members dealt with the retention tax or, as it has been described, the DIRT tax. The Minister, realising the unpopularity and unsavouriness of the measure, has attempted in the Bill to modify it and mollify the feelings of resentment.  Sections 27 to 34 relate in some way to this tax.  However, as I said on February 13, the Minister is discouraging young people from saving, although down the years we have all encouraged them to get involved in saving.  We all encourage our children to save.  When I was young we were encouraged to save for the rainy day but we had to abandon that phase because it has been raining every day in recent times, I am not talking about rain falling from the sky but the fact that the day <Col N="1041" /> of need has arrived.  The Minister who introduced the tax, and the Minister who has retained it in the Bill, have destroyed something that was painstakingly built up over the years in our national schools &mdash; the need to save.  Since I referred to this in the course of the budget debate I have not had any reason to change my views on the issue.</P>
    <P>Last year we all encouraged people over 60 because of the spate of crime throughout the country to deposit their savings with the financial institutions.  We did so for their safety, because if it became known that they had money in a biscuit box under a mattress or elsewhere they would be the subject of an attack. All sides of the House encouraged those people to deposit their savings in banks and elsewhere and the Government introduced certain measures to encourage them to do that.  The only way to describe what the Government have done in regard to the interest on the savings of such people is to say that it amounts to a betrayal of the confidence of the people we encouraged to deposit their savings in such institutions.  The retention tax will be a direct imposition on those we encouraged for their own safety to put their money in banks and so on.  Is it any wonder that people continue to question the credibility of public representatives when the Government betray &mdash; I do not know any other suitable word &mdash; the confidence of old people?</P>
    <P>It was because of the hostility of Members on all sides of the House to tax being levied on voluntary organisations and community associations &mdash; we are all part and parcel of them &mdash; that the Minister decided to change the provision in the Bill.  It is my view that the Minister has left this issue open in that the term used in regard to the taxing of voluntary contributions and money raised by voluntary associations does not accommodate them adequately.  In the course of my contribution on the budget I quoted correspondence I had received from an association.  It is my view that when people write to us they expect us to use the correspondence in the course of debates on various issues.  In regard to this tax <Col N="1042" /> I received a letter from The Sisters of Mercy who said:</P>
    <P>As you probably know, our congregation supports missions in Peru, Kenya and the Philippine Islands where our sisters depend on us for means.  At home we run meals-on-wheels, care for the sick, aged, travelling people and we are engaged in many other social works.</P>
    <P>For our works we depend principally on interest from investment and deposit accounts.  We contribute to these accounts from our salaries which are heavily taxed.</P>
    <P>The recent proposal made by Mr. Alan Dukes, then Minister for Finance, to introduce deposit interest retention tax proved to be disturbing and alarming.  Its introduction would necessarily spell the end of much of our social commitment.  I request you, as our interested representative, to act on our behalf and make the strongest possible protest to the Taoiseach on this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that it has been amended to some degree.  I contend that the reference to it in the Bill and its amendment have not been dealt with adequately.  That Bill of 108 sections is page upon page of technical detail.  I am not satisfied that all the voluntary organisations are covered.  For instance, the registered friendly societies are not mentioned.  There is a whole group of organisations not accommodated.  I want to stress that point.  This matter will have to be dealt with on Committee Stage to ensure that the people who need accommodation under the provisions of this Bill will be so accommodated.</P>
      <P>In his introductory remarks the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in energy prices and the continuing downward trend in inflation have increased confidence. This will be reflected gradually in <Col N="1043" /> improving investment and employment prospects.</P>
    <P>I would not dispute at all the sentiments expressed in the first part of those two sentences but I am very doubtful that the Minister's expressed wishes will be achieved because the Government have not provided the environment in which to take advantage of those factors.  That must be emphasised in the context of the Minister's remarks.  The Minister went on to say;</P>
    <P>... we must encourage investors to break out of the traditional mould.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the Minister is trying to find a scapegoat.  I will not go along with that. I am convinced that this Government, through their overall attitude, their policies and directions, are unable to take advantage of the conditions prevailing internationally.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Investment should also maintain the upward momentum experienced last year due to the better economic climate now in prospect and due to the measures introduced by the Government to assist activity in the building and construction sector.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that and there is no need for me to comment further. Then the Minister said:</P>
    <P>While price reductions and other developments will give a welcome boost to economic activity, ..</P>
    <P>Would somebody on the Government benches indicate where these price reductions have been effected, when we are told that the benefit in the reduction of the price of oil will not become available from the ESB until September next, when that portion of the food subsidies remaining has been removed resulting in increased prices of essential commodities such as bread, butter, milk and so on?  It is wrong to leave that type of statement unchecked.  That is why I want people on the opposite benches, the Minister when replying or anybody else for that matter, to say where all of these price reductions <Col N="1044" /> have been effected that will benefit our economy to the extent envisaged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The budget deficit remains uncomfortably high and reducing this deficit must continue to be a priority.</P>
    <P>After three years and four months in Government the Minister, in as light a way as possible, says that the budget deficit remains uncomfortably high. Nobody knows better than the electorate how uncomfortable are this Government.  They know well that that was one of the planks on which this Government were elected, that budget deficiting would be phased out over a four year period.  Now it is so high the Minister has acknowledged that it is uncomfortably high and its reduction must continue to be a priority.  That is not much of an indication of confidence or of achievement on the part of the Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>In emphasising this I am not preoccupied with book-keeping ...</P>
      <P>Now the Deputy opposite will see why I need plenty of time.  After three years and four months in Government, a total of eight and a half years out of the past 13 in office when we heard so much about the book-keeping exercises necessary to get our economy right, to get public finances in order, now we have it from the Minister that he is not preoccupied with the book-keeping exercises.  Perhaps this is a change of policy on the part of the Government.  Perhaps the Minister is honest enough to admit, in a couched way, that all this preoccupation with book-keeping about which we heard so much has contributed in no uncertain manner to the dismal failure of this Government, that they are running from the deficit and the book-keeping exercises.  It would be as well for them to run and keep running because the electorate will run them anyway.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister said that the consequences of high taxation are disturbing.  I have to agree with him that the consequences of high taxation are disturbing.  I will add that they are more than disturbing, that they have disturbed everybody in this country and have put an awful lot of people out of work.  Even at this late stage in the life of this Government it is good that at least one Minister has realised that the consequences of high taxation are disturbing.</P>
      <P>With regard to taxation and its collection, the fifth report of the Commission on Taxation &mdash; a commission initiated by our Government over four years ago &mdash; indicates that there could be tremendous savings effected in the manner in which the system is operated.</P>
      <P>On budget day when the deposit retention tax was introduced, there was a group of people in those middle benches cheering at the idea.  They have since learned that their cheers were misguided because the ideological theory was that it was the financial institutions that were being taxed.  The present Minister referred to it in his introductory remarks when he said:</P>
      <P>Much attention has been focused, however, on the taxation measures affecting the financial institutions.</P>
      <P>All of us have learned that this supposed taxation of financial institutions turned out to be taxation of the individual &mdash; the children, the not so young and the small saver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to hear Deputy Molony say there is some hope needed.  However, he did not say there is any measure of hope in this Bill.  There is no doubt that the hopelessness of the Government is reflected in people's attitudes.  The national debt was referred to by Deputy Molony and when I said something to him, out of order, he said it was hypocrisy to be talking in those terms about it.  Now we know where the hypocrisy is in regard <Col N="1046" /> to the national debt.  The second plank, after deficit budgeting, in the Government's election propaganda was foreign borrowing.  Now we know their hypocrisy because the national debt stands at £21 billion.  When the Government came to power it was at the unacceptable level of £12 billion.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the child benefit scheme, a new gimmick by the Government.  They took away the £100 income tax relief and said the children's allowance was being increased from £12.05 to £15.05 per month per child, amounting to an increase of £36 per year per child. This is coupled with the elimination of the child dependant tax allowance and a freezing of the dependant social welfare rate.  The elimination of the £100 tax allowance means a loss of £48 per child per year in the case of those paying tax at 48 per cent.  That outweighs the increase in the child benefit, meaning a net loss of £12 per child.  The loss in real terms is even greater, so I suggest that Deputies opposite stop making such a great show of the child benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>In their eight and a half years in office out of the last 13 years, the Government have not succeeded in retaining any semblance of the confidence expressed in them when they were last elected.  The Government tried hard to create an opinion, through a PR exercise, that they were the greatest.  Where is the leadership we heard so much about but saw so little of?  Where is the integrity and the honesty the electors heard so much about?  Their failures in Government have been matched only by their arrogance.  Their only commitment is to hold on despite the widely expressed desire of the people that, in the best interests of all of us, they should resign and put their case to the electorate.  In all areas they have failed dismally.  They have not listened to promptings from this side on many issues.  We put forward suggested remedies in an effort to divert them from the course of ruin they were following. They have failed in Government.  As they did last October when they frightened the Government into introducing the house improvement grant, I hope Government <Col N="1047" /> Deputies will frighten them into further activity before the country goes down the drain altogether.</P>

He did not talk about the 1977 manifesto which offered the Irish nation a bribe which was accepted.  The people will be paying for it well into the next century because the reverberations of that manifesto will be spoken of with awe, with the same awe with which we speak of the Famine in the last century.

I want to discuss the neglected Border area which has borne the brunt of the <Col N="1048" /> Ulster troubles on behalf of this nation, without compensation from any Government, this one included.  Deputy Lyons shed tears for Cork, justifiably.  The Cork area was stocked full of industry by successive Governments in the past 20 years and, though we have had a bad patch in recent times, my town of Dundalk, the biggest town in the country, has withered to economic extinction because of lack of action by successive Governments.  If Deputy Lyons wants to see deprivation and hardship he should come up to the Border region and he will see it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking to the motion, it is with regret that I have to talk on this very serious matter.  This dispute has been handled very badly from the outset.  There is no doubt that the performance of the previous Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey, is the cause of our problems here tonight, her arrogance and her attitude to the teachers. Before the terms of the arbitrator's award were brought to the Government and before the Dáil had an opportunity to hear them, she took it upon herself to refuse to grant it.  She also incensed thousands of teachers throughout the country by her moralistic and degrading tone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of their position in society, teachers have always been responsible in their actions and the industrial action <Col N="1050" /> taken by them was not taken lightly, but as a result of the arrogant manner in which they were treated by the Minister, Deputy Hussey, and also by the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Boland.</P>
    <P>For over 35 years since the teachers' arbitration and conciliation scheme was first introduced in 1951, there have been peace and harmony in the field of education.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure that peace and harmony continue. Unfortunately, we are here tonight because the Government have failed totally in their duty.  Due to the incompetence of Deputy Cooney's predecessor, the Minister now finds himself trying to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>Teachers have always been held in respect and esteem by children, parents and citizens.  It is in the interests of the country that that respect should continue.  It is of the utmost importance, therefore, that this dispute be settled as soon as possible.  If the Government adhere to &ldquo;no compromise&rdquo;, as came over very clearly in the Taoiseach's performance on television last night, the future of the children in our schools looks very bleak.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, Deputy Hussey, had taken the advice of Deputy O'Rourke, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Education, in the early days of this dispute, and meaningful discussions and negotiations with the teachers' representatives had taken place, we would not now be in the present very serious situation.  Instead of confrontation, we should have co-operation with the teachers.  It is quite obvious to all, including many Deputies on the front benches and in particular Deputies on the other side of the House, that an <i>impasse</i> has been reached and that a mediator must be brought in to try to resolve it.</P>
    <P>It is not in the interests of the children, many of whom are preparing for examinations, that their future careers should be put in jeopardy because of a certain Minister threatening to resign from Government if that Government compromise with the teachers.  This is a most unsatisfactory and unacceptable situation and the Taoiseach should face <Col N="1051" /> up to his responsibility and deal with that Minister.  The future careers of many thousands of our children should take precedence over the wounded pride and career of any Minister.  The use of the veto at the Cabinet table in relation to this dispute cannot and should not be condoned.</P>
    <P>Is it not a matter for serious concern also that a non-elected Government handler should be instrumental in taking a decision to reject the pleas of many people, including the Hierarchy, in refusing to accept a mediator?  Was this decision not taken without even consultation with the Minister himself who has the ultimate responsibility for resolving this dispute?</P>
    <P>The time for mediation is now, not in five or six weeks' time when the examinations are due to take place.  The teachers' unions have indicated their willingness to accept a mediator.  It is time for a Government response.  The Taoiseach on television last evening posed the question: &ldquo;What would the appointment of a mediator mean?&rdquo; Perhaps the Taoiseach does not know, but I know and everybody else knows that it would mean the resolving of this problem on behalf of both sides, bringing this dispute to a conclusion.  His action in appearing on television in the middle of a Dáil debate on the dispute seems to suggest that he does not have the support of some of his backbenchers, but, more importantly, the support of many Labour backbenchers.  I now call on these Deputies to support the motion before the House.  They must do so in the interests of the children.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke last evening on television of going back on decisions made in Dáil Éireann.  Surely this is what democracy is all about.  There are precedents in this House for that.  If it is in the interest of and for the good of our citizens &mdash; and in this dispute it clearly is &mdash; then it is our duty to go back on these decisions which were made in the House.  It was wrong and misleading of the Taoiseach to suggest last evening that the teachers were challenging the authority of the Dáil and that many of them were not familiar <Col N="1052" /> with the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme resulting with the Dáil vote.  We all know, on all sides of the House, from our discussions with the teachers that they are well versed in all aspects of this dispute.  They have certainly had enough time to become conversant with them.</P>
    <P>Having complimented the role of the teacher, the Taoiseach last night on television castigated them for what can only be described as pursuing their democratic rights, a point clearly accepted and supported by Deputy Bell, whom I am delighted to see here in the Chamber.  He made that comment on the Pat Kenny radio show yesterday and I am looking forward to the Deputy's contribution here tonight.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his closing address to the nation last evening issued an invitation to the teachers to sit down for talks with the Minister, Deputy Cooney. Would he and his Government not take up the invitation of the general secretary of the INTO, Gerry Quigley, issued minutes after the broadcast for both the teachers and the Government to sit down with a mediator to settle this dispute?  No doubt they would come to a satisfactory conclusion.  The Taoiseach also stated in relation to examinations that the standard of other years could be maintained. Nothing could be further from the truth. As Lord Mayor of Cork I have had many representations from parents and pupils, even by telephone today, conveying their concern.  The Taoiseach should know better, as a man who has been involved in education.  It goes to show how out of touch he is at present.  It is not true that things would be as they were.  This House has been very clear about that.  It must go out clearly and loudly tonight that the Taoiseach has misrepresented the situation and we do not accept his statement.</P>
    <P>It is also clear from the Taoiseach's performance on television that the Government have lost the confidence of the people to handle and solve this dispute.  Surely if common sense is to prevail, a mediator must be appointed immediately.  I appeal to the Minister here tonight.  This motion has been tabled <Col N="1053" /> in the interests of the Government and the people and the Minister has a responsibility to face up to that responsibility with his colleagues, and to get this dispute over quickly.  I cannot do it.  The Minister can take the initiative and show the kind of leadership which has been totally lacking on that side of the House during the past few weeks.  I strongly appeal to the Minister to act tonight in the interests of the people and the country.</P>

      <P>I have to say that I deprecate the personal note of attack which has been introduced by at least three speakers on the other side, Deputy O'Rourke, Deputy Tunney and Deputy Wallace, in regard to my predecessor.  They have made personalised attacks on her which are singularly unfair and equally singularly inaccurate. The policy which is being pursued by the Government is collective policy agreed to by all the members of the Government, including myself.  There has been no difference in policy since the change of officeholder.  I want to make that very clear.  It does not add to the debate to have this element introduced into it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes considerably from the status of the debate and from the seriousness with which I hope the Opposition approach this debate.  Deputy O'Rourke in her speech yesterday evening said there was an attempt by the Government to confuse the size of the offer, that it was being presented <i>simpliciter</i> as 17.9 per cent with the implication that this was now immediately available. In no speech of mine, in no statement issued by the Government, will she find such a presentation.  It was always made very plain that the offer was an accumulation of phases &mdash; the phase of the 10 per cent and the phases of the 25th round that are available.  That has been made very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also has to be made clear and reiterated that the action taken by the Government in coming to the Dáil was <Col N="1054" /> totally and correctly in line with the provisions of the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme.  This does not seem to have got across to the public in as wide a manner as one would have thought. Indeed, it does not seem to have been appreciated by the totality of the teaching profession.  I want to put on record again what that scheme provides.  This scheme was agreed many years ago by all the parties to it, one party being the teachers.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of the scheme states:</P>
    <P>The existence of the scheme does not imply that the Government have surrendered or can surrender their liberty of action in the exercise of their constitutional authority and the discharge of their responsibilities in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 46 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>In relation to a report from the Chairman of the Board the Government will adopt one of the following courses:</P>
    <P>(a) within three months of the date of receipt of the report by the Ministers signify that they, the Government, propose to give immediate effect to the finding of the Board in full...</P>
    <P>(b) at the expiration of three months from the date of receipt of the report by the Ministers... introduce a motion in Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>(i) proposing the rejection of the finding</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(ii) proposing the modification or the authorisation by the Minister for Education of the modification of the finding</P>
    <P>That was the option the Government decided to avail of in the motion voted upon on 6 February.</P>
    <P>It could not be clearer that the Government moved precisely, strictly and accurately in accordance with the scheme for <Col N="1055" /> conciliation and arbitration which had been agreed by all the parties.  It is open to both parties not to accept the findings of the arbitrator.  The union side can reject them, full stop.  The Government side cannot do that and are limited in what they can do if they find that they cannot implement the award.  The limitations are very precise.  It is no easy thing for any Government to come to this House and ask the House to reject or modify an arbitrator's finding.  This is something which can only be done in exceptional and grave circumstances.  It was in such circumstances that the Government moved in accordance with the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme which had been agreed to by the parties.  The Government are not in breach of that scheme and, no matter how much it is misrepresented by the other side or by anybody else, those are the crystal clear, simple facts.  I hope they will not be called into question anymore.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that the charge of inflexibility which has been made against the Government does not lie. When the arbitrator's findings were originally announced and the award of 10 per cent became known, it was felt because of the size of the public service pay bill that a finding of 10 per cent would be beyond the public pay budget.  That was the initial reaction, our initial thought. On reflection and reconsideration of the figures in the context of the entire budgetary situation, the Government felt that they could accept the finding in so far as the 10 per cent award was concerned, provided it was phased.  In the sense that the Government have accepted the finding of 10 per cent, albeit phased, the Government have moved and any suggestion of inflexibility does not lie there. There has been no move by the other side.  There has been a suggestion of phasing the retrospective element, putting the bill into the future on the back of some other Government, putting the bill on the Irish taxpayer later rather than sooner, but that does not reduce the weight of the bill.</P>
    <P>During the time preceding the Dáil <Col N="1056" /> debate on the modification of the finding the question of the reappointment of the arbitrator was a major issue.  It was said that the Government's failure to reappoint the arbitrator was a grave breach of faith and a reflection of inflexibility on the part of the Government.  In order to take that issue out of the scene, the Government have now agreed to reappoint the arbitrator.  The teacher unions wrote to me before Easter asking that the arbitrator should be reappointed and shortly afterwards I was happy to announce that the Government had agreed to reappoint the arbitrator.  I have so informed the three unions concerned and have put forward a name to them. One of the unions has responded to date. The Government have moved.  They have initiated the mechanics for the reappointment of the arbitrator and have conceded the 10 per cent, which is of course the kernel of the arbitrator's finding.  Any charge of inflexibility or intransigence on the part of the Government does not lie, is not justified by the facts.</P>
    <P>The current issue is the question of the appointing, the invoking or the recruiting of a mediator.  The idea of a mediator is something that people seize on quickly and avidly without too much reflection in the context of a dispute.  It seems at first sight to be a handy mechanism, a way out, something that will get everybody off the hook.  One has to consider what is involved in the idea of a mediator, some prestigious third party, coming in. It has to be considered in the context of the issues between the parties at the moment.  That issue is essentially the question of the payment of this award retrospectively.  The total cost of that retrospection, no matter how it might be phased or blurred, is £100 million.  If one were to invite in a mediator who has no responsibility to the Government or to the taxpayer, who does not have to frame a budget to present to this House, a mediator in accordance with the normal procedures of someone put in that position would look for a <i>via media.</i> He will seek to split the difference, to see what is the sum and whether there can be any compromise on it.  He would have been <Col N="1057" /> brought in to try to find a solution so he would not be very interested in how equitable that solution might be either to the taxpayer or to the other side.  The obvious solution that a mediator would opt for, and the whole history of mediators confirms this, would be a compromise on the sum outstanding.  The Government feel, and feel sharply, that there cannot be compromise on a sum of the magnitude involved.  The matter then is made more complex by the fact that the present position into which a mediator would be called if some people had their way would be in effect to set aside a vote of this sovereign Parliament.</P>
    <P>It has been said that parliamentary procedure can permit a second vote.  Of course that is true.  The mechanics involved in that respect would not present any difficulty but that is to ignore that what would be involved would be the reversal of the substantive issue.  What credibility would this House have if, within a matter of six weeks after making a solemn adjudication following a lengthy debate, it were to decide suddenly to reverse engines because some third party decided that line should be adopted?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if Government and the business of this nation were to be carried on in that fashion, that the Dáil came to a decision on day one but reversed that decision on day 21.  To act in that way would make of us a laughing stock.  The realities behind this benign concept of a mediator are unpalatable and unacceptable.  This issue is not one that can be subjected to haggling or horse trading. <Col N="1058" /> The matter involved is much more serious and fundamental than that.</P>
      <P>Having made that clear, as the Taoiseach made it clear last evening also, I wish to refer to the statement issued yesterday by the teachers' unions and I quote:</P>
      <P>The National Co-ordinating Committee of Teachers United decided this afternoon that in the event of the Government accepting mediation or third party intervention in an effort to resolve the current dispute the Teachers Unions would review their proposed industrial action.  The teachers believe that given good-will on both sides it should be possible to reach an amicable solution.</P>
      <P>I was encouraged by that statement and today I wrote to the three unions as follows:</P>
      <P>You will be aware of the remarks made by the Taoiseach in his address on radio and television last night including his invitation to the Teacher Unions to meet with me to discuss the current dispute situation.</P>
      <P>I wish, now, formally to invite your Union, and also your colleagues in the other Unions concerned, to meet with me as soon as can be conveniently arranged.  It is in no one's interest that this dispute should continue or that the education of our children should be damaged.  I believe it is essential that we explore together every possibility for reaching an understanding between us having regard to your statement of yesterday afternoon and also having regard to the constraints within which we are forced to operate.</P>
      <P>I hope that you will respond positively to this request and that a meeting can be arranged forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the teachers have difficulty in coming directly to me, despite my clearly stated willingness to meet them, I would not be averse to the use of some kind of mechanism by which we could talk to each other or by which options or ideas could be explored.  If such a body or <Col N="1059" /> group &mdash; for example, the Employer-Labour Conference has been suggested &mdash; can serve the purpose of being a neutral channel of information, for my part I would be willing to co-operate.  I trust that what I am saying now will be taken on board and that we can sit down to talk, but to talk with realism and with a realistic acceptance of the options that are available.  There is no point in my misleading the teachers or in their coming to talks hoping to achieve something that has been excluded.  However, there must be other avenues to explore, within the mechanisms I have suggested, which would bring new perspectives, fresh ideas and perhaps ingenuity to the scene.  It may be possible to devise something that could have within it the seeds of a solution.  The problems are difficult and may require talks about talks, but I will be anxious that this process of consultation be got under way.  If some such development takes place I shall be very happy to co-operate in it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of the examinations.  It has been suggested that my advertising for superintendents and examiners to fill the gap left by the possibility of the teachers not volunteering for this work has been in some way provocative.  Since early in March when this possibility of their not volunteering first became apparent, it has been made clear to teachers that contingency plans would have to be put in train and were being put in train and that a critical and fundamental part of those plans would be the recruitment of an alternative corps of superintendents and examiners.  I must reject the suggestion that the advertisement in this regard is in any way provocative.</P>
    <P>I had hopes that the teachers' unions and the members of the profession would regard the examinations as transcending the dispute.  I made the analogy of power workers on strike but maintaining supplies to hospitals without prejudice to the overall industrial dispute.  By analogy, the teachers could volunteer to undertake the work associated with the examinations without in any way prejudicing the <Col N="1060" /> other industrial relations issues.  I had hoped, too, that the Opposition would have joined me in that call in the hope that the combined forces of this House would have taken that point but unfortunately that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I wish to take issue with the Opposition also, and particularly with Deputy Wallace who spoke last, and to state categorically, unequivocally and as clearly as possible that the standards of the examinations this year, if they are to be marked by a substitute corps of people, will be the same as in any other year.</P>

      <P>I say to the people opposite that they should join with me in the appeal and stop denigrating the efforts to <Col N="1061" /> hold the examinations by the use of an alternative corps of examiners.  For the information of Deputies opposite I might add that part of the corps of examiners has been composed for many years of people who are not engaged in education, people who had retired for some years from teaching and who were, therefore, no longer teaching the curricula.  The point being made by people on the other side is that only teachers teaching currently can mark examination papers satisfactorily.  That is nonsense.  To parents or pupils who might be disturbed by these irresponsible allegations I repeat the assurance that the examinations will be marked to the normal standards and that the certificates will have the same validity as was the case in any other year.  I must be critical of the Opposition and suspect their motivation in this entire debate and in putting down this motion.</P>
      <P>I am suspicious of a certain sense of opportunism on the part of the Opposition also because in all the words that have been spoken in this House on this issue since the original debate in February last on the motion to modify the arbitrator's findings at no stage did they say they would be prepared to pay the retrospective element of the award or any part of it.</P>
      <P>If the Opposition are to be honest with the teachers, with the country, with the taxpayers and with this House, before the debate ends we should hear from the benches opposite whether or not, if they have the opportunity in Government, they will meet the outstanding claim for retrospection amounting to £110 million, or any part of it.  The taxpayer is entitled to know what is the thinking of the main Opposition party on that point.  That is the kernel of this issue.</P>

      <P>That is an awkward question.  One tactic in this House when faced <Col N="1062" /> with an awkward question from the benches opposite is to try to drown it out with noise.  Let me repeat it again.  I would like to hear from the party opposite before this debate ends if they will pay the retrospective element of the arbitrator's finding.  That point has not been made clear up to now.  Until it is made clear by the party opposite, having regard to this whole scene, having regard to their attitude towards examinations, having regard to their failure to clarify the position on the kernel issue, I have to make a charge that political opportunism is behind most of their approach.</P>

      <P>In the light of what the Minister for Education has just said I am pleased that the Government have finally decided that, if necessary, a third party can be involved in bringing the two sides together in this most sensitive and difficult dispute.  I regret that it took so long for the Government to come to this decision.  Nonetheless one has to welcome, albeit at this late stage, their decision to, if necessary, allow the Employer-Labour Conference to get involved in bringing the teachers' unions and the Government together to talk about difficulties and to negotiate on a possible settlement to this most horrific dispute.  In view of what the Minister has said, let me say that this party will not, therefore, have any need to move our amendment.  We have sought&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me say to Deputy Leyden that if he thinks he is going to stop me now he is going to have another think coming to him.  I hope I will be allowed to speak in this debate.  The main Opposition party have sought throughout <Col N="1063" /> this issue to politicise it, to use it as an opportunity for purely political opportunistic reasons, to score political points, as was evidenced by their failure to allow a pairing arrangement for you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when you were deputising for the Ceann Comhairle who is away on official business.  This was as predictable as it is despicable.  This party will not, on this issue or on any other issue, engage in that kind of politics.  I know the vast majority of parents and students have, throughout this debate, been forgotten and they are not going to thank those of us who seek to score political points off each other, to prolong the agony, to delay and to worry those people who are affected.  Listening to the Taoiseach's broadcast last night I was disappointed that the Government did not at that stage see fit to announce what the Minister announced tonight.  In that broadcast the Taoiseach seemed to close the door, to leave no way open whereby a third party could be involved in bringing the two sides together.  The Taoiseach said that the possible appointment of a mediator may be leading the teachers up the garden path.  I would suggest that in saying last night that no third party could be involved he was leading the teachers up the garden path.</P>

I listened last night to the remarks made by the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Education.  I have not heard Fianna Fáil say that they would pay this award if they were in Government.

If this House goes back on its decision made on 6 February, a decision which this party supported, and agrees to the payment in full of the retrospection which is being sought by the teachers unions they would be putting the sovereignty of this Dáil at stake.  What we have sought throughout this dispute, particularly in recent weeks, is a mechanism whereby the two sides to this dispute could be brought together.  I am pleased that this evening we seem to have this formula.  I hope that the teachers' unions and the thousands of teachers around this country who are reasonable people, professional people engaged in the education of our young people, will respond to what the Minister has said, will prevent the boycott of the exams and will now sit down with the Government and try to come to terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Whip of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Vincent Brady, for allocating a few minutes to me in this debate.  But I feel bound to say that I, as an Independent Member of this House, should not be dependent on any party, for time to speak in this Assembly. It is the duty of the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann to ensure that the rights of minorities are safeguarded in this House. The voice of minorities must be heard. That is the first and primary duty of the Chair as guardian of the rights of the Members of this House.  I resent deeply the fact that I was denied the opportunity to speak on this fundamental issue on 6 February last.  The rights of minorities in this regard is not open to compromise and the Chair must have strict regard to that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the contention that everything possible be done to avert the obstruction of the national certificate examinations this year and I appeal to both parties, teachers and Government, to come together forthwith and initiate talks which will lead to the speedy conclusion of an agreement which will enable our 100,000 pupils to settle down and study for these crucial tests which will determine in very large measure their future status in life.  At present the situation is bedevilled by fear and rancour, by anxiety and uncertainty, by bitterness and strife.  The good relationships which <Col N="1066" /> existed between the Government and teachers, between teachers and pupils and parents, have been shattered and the educational future of our young people is seriously blighted.  The integrity of the examination system must be upheld, must be safeguarded, and the fears of the parents and pupils allayed.  The children of this nation should not be used as mere pawns in the battle between any union or any Government.  Their future must be safeguarded at all costs.  In the name of all that is good and noble in the character of the Irish race let us have mediation, and let us have that mediation now.</P>
    <P>I believe the real damage was done when this House, by a majority vote, rejected the arbitration award in the teachers' case.  I voted for the implementation of the arbitration award on that occasion because, as a lifetime trade unionist and supporter in the cause of labour, I learned as a fundamental principle that when an issue goes to arbitration and an award is handed down, no outside body interferes.  To do so would be to make a mockery of that procedure and to create turmoil, as has transpired. Let us not forget that when it comes to arbitration one has reached a pinnacle of negotiation and to repudiate an award at that final stage is to throw the issues in dispute into a maelstrom of strife and strike, as is happening today.  These issues will have serious repercussions and I appeal to the Government to rescind that decision, to adhere to the arbitrator's award or at least to give us the type of mediation we now desire in order to settle this serious matter.</P>

    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I appeal to this House for support for our motion</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the deep and widespread anxiety of parents and pupils in regard to the holding of the school examinations this year, calls on the Government to arrange for the immediate appointment of an independent mediator in the dispute with the teachers.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been compelled by the sad scenario of recent events and the escalation in this dispute which is causing anxiety, concern and hardship throughout all our communities, to bring this Private Members' motion before Dáil Éireann over the past two evenings.  I am appealing to the House for support for the motion.  It is essential that the motion be supported because each day of the conflict embitters and polarises the parties to the dispute.  It is sensible, therefore, to seek a solution as soon as possible to avoid this polarisation.  Anybody genuinely concerned with a solution must support our very reasonable motion. Remember, no matter what stand is taken by either side, this dispute must be settled some time and the sooner genuine, magnanimous attempts are made by both sides, but particularly by the <Col N="1068" /> Government, the less venom there will be to extract before good relations are restored.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I want to question the Minister for Education on the statement he made in this House in relation to his invitation to the three teacher unions for discussions.  This House should know if any pre-conditions have been set down or implied by his Department in relation to these discussions.  From time to time I had a certain respect for the level of discernment of Deputy Harney, but her statement this evening disappointed me because in my view she has either been deliberately or unwittingly misled or she has chosen to accept what Deputies have aptly referred to as a pig in a bag.</P>
    <P>Despite the Taoiseach's deplorable discourtesy to the Dáil in hijacking the airwaves last night, the people want compromise, the parents want compromise, the students want compromise, all responsible bodies and organisations throughout the country are calling for compromise, and they have repeatedly made that view known over the past few weeks.  They all realise that if there is one thing this country does not want, and the nation simply cannot afford, is an embittered, defeated and demoralised teaching profession.  They are only too painfully aware of the short, medium and long term consequences of such a situation.  Their appeal tonight to this House, to the Taoiseach and to his Government to appoint an independent mediator, particularly when it is widely known that there are many able, responsible and experienced people about, must not fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>In his speech last night on radio and television when dealing with the Dáil decision of last February he said that if the Dáil were now to go back on that decision:</P>
    <P>The authority of Dáil Éireann &mdash; the supreme democratic authority of this State &mdash; would thus have disappeared so far as arbitration findings are concerned...</P>
    <P>Any Government which allowed this to happen would have betrayed the <Col N="1069" /> nation's trust, and in respect of this area would have deprived the Dáil of its effective authority to govern.</P>
    <P>This is a load of rubbish, it is balderdash. This is a democratic House of Government where publicly elected representatives are duty bound to take cognisance of ongoing situations and developments. If a decision made there in one month has to be reviewed the next month because of subsequent developments, so be it.  That is the essence of democracy.  It makes no sense for the Taoiseach, the Leader of the House, to suggest publicly that to reconsider, even to the slightest degree, decisions made here two months earlier would be to subvert the authority of the House.</P>
    <P>Many people, having listened to and watched the Taoiseach last night, are now concerned that his intervention during the course of a very serious discussion in this House, Dáil Éireann, the place to which he refers as the supreme democratic authority of the State, was a deliberate attempt to circumvent this Dáil.  Many people are alleging it was an attempt to subvert the very authority of which he boasted so proudly last night. That is a very serious development.</P>
    <P>We have the unions readily acknowledging in their press release today that there is no impediment to Dáil Éireann considering the teachers' case and making, through their own procedures, any further decision they may democratically decide.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to which the teachers unions, the public service and other unions are affiliated, clearly and succinctly are expressing what we all know to be the truth.</P>
    <P>The people are not impressed by the facile promises of the Taoiseach, that the State examinations this year will be conducted to their usual unimpeachable standards.  No one believes that a professional standard of supervision can be achieved uniformally and universally by inexperienced, untrained personnel.  If the Minister does, he knows very little about education.  Copying will be rampant in some centres.  We all regret that <Col N="1070" /> but if what he is proposing is proceeded with, that will be one of the immediate outcomes.</P>
    <P>There can be no confidence in a supervision corps that is totally inexperienced when we know that in the past the Department of Education were careful to recruit for this job only teachers who were over 30 years of age, with some years of teaching experience and these people are put in centres where there are more experienced supervisors to guide them.  Are we now to believe that this practice is worthless and over the years was only pursued for a cosmetic reason; or was it really pursued to ensure high standards and uniformity?  How will this year's corps of supervisors measure up? I wish to tell the 120,000 candidates, not for opportunistic reasons or to be irresponsible, but because of the concern felt genuinely on this side of the House, that I would not wish to have my child sit State examinations this year if that is what the Minister proposes to do.</P>
    <P>Supervision may be bad, but correction, evaluation and marking cannot be done to an objective and professional standard without the professionals, without the experienced directors, without the senior examiners whose job is to monitor in each case 20 examiners. In the past these jobs were given only to teachers of high standing and extensive experience of teaching the course and of correcting State examination papers.  Are we to believe the Taoiseach in the face of this?  Are we to believe for one moment that, even if they were willing, the inspectorate could ensure uniformity of standards and objectivity in marking, realistic expectations and thorough professionalism?  In the absence of the professionalism and the experience nothing of this nature is assured.  Children and their futures are to be subject to lottery, chance and the vagaries of fortune.  This is not good enough for my child or for any other child.  They deserve better, and the Taoiseach's <i>prima donna</i> attitude must be rejected so that better can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the inspectorate <Col N="1071" /> will co-operate in running these examinations.  Let us face it, the contract of an inspector obliges him or her to do the work which has traditionally been done by inspectors at examination time, that is supervising, briefing and monitoring professional and experienced supervisors and examiners.  This year, if we are to believe the Taoiseach, they are going to supervise, brief and monitor people who are not necessarily qualified and most certainly not likely to be experienced. This will represent a change in their working conditions which I do not believe the inspectors will accept, especially since it would mean giving their professional approval and endorsement to work which cannot be expected to reach their normal standards of excellence.  For many other reasons which I will deal with, but especially and primarily for this reason, I call on all responsible Deputies still left in this House to support our motion.</P>
    <P>We have reached a time of crisis in education in our schools and classrooms, a crisis that need never have happened. We have been brought to this sorry, sad state by ineptitude, bungling and downright insensitivity on the part of the Government.  One recalls sadly the first shots fired last summer in the form of a morality speech by the then Minister for Education.  I say to the Minister across the floor that I make absolutely no apologies for being critical of the then holder of that office for her insensitivity, irresponsibility and failure to appreciate the need for consultation and greater discretion in her dealing with professionals who had a long standing tradition.</P>

      <P>This set the scene for ongoing confrontation and in that process threatened to dismantle and wreck long established, dearly cherished machinery for conciliation and arbitration.  The politics of confrontation &mdash; it can be called nothing else &mdash; perpetrated by the present Government which have led us directly into the present <i>impasse</i> must not continue and this House must <Col N="1072" /> put an end to it tonight.  Confrontation is not the solution to a problem that is basic and fundamental to the value we as a society place on education and the regard we must have as legislators for our youth and students.  Education has always been about consultation, discussion, reasoned argument.  It is simply not good enough, it is not sufficient or acceptable, for any Minister or any Government to say that this row, this needless damage to our students, to our examinations, to the education system generally, is in essence about money.</P>
      <P>Just as the Government motion of 6 February last called on this House to endorse a course of action which represented reneging on a principle, this evening's amendment seeks the support of the House to reject a motion from this side which is reasonable and rational and which expresses legitimately the concern and anxiety so widespread around this country among parents, students, the clergy, management boards, the national parents' council, the trade union movement and other responsible and concerned organisations.  I suggest to the Chair, to the Government and to the Minister that this House's reputation is at stake this evening.  Its sense of fairness and appreciation of its duties is in question.  The very humanity of its deliberations is being put to the test.  We are not talking about numbers or figures here, but about young human beings whose future is at stake, whose commitment has been given as a mark of confidence in our educational system and whose plight at this time must be our primary and statutory concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question really is: are we prepared to let down our young people, or are we, as we should be, prepared to take a mature, sensible and reasonable approach to this issue?  If we are not, each of us must ponder on the consequences of our actions; each must ask to what extent we too can be impugned for either refusing or failing to appreciate what is at stake here.  This is a most vital time of year for our students studying for examinations, for the leaving certificate, intermediate certificate and group certificate. <Col N="1073" /> It is the culmination of all their hard work and their commitment to research and study over the years in pursuit of a goal set for them through the machinery established in this House in the provision of an educational system.  They have worked tirelessly and with confidence so that, at the end of the day, the results they would obtain as a reward for their efforts would provide them with a platform for their future careers.  They believe in this system because we convinced them that it is the best system for them.  It is the high point of their efforts. It is a time when motivation and morale are high in the expectation that their respective goals are attainable.</P>
    <P>Surely these students, caught up in stress and strain from the rigours of examination oriented courses find the going tough enough in the normal course of events without further uncertainty or disruption of their classes.  If we refuse here tonight to take the reasonable step of calling for the appointment of an independent mediator rather than spurious invitations to talks with what we detect as definite pre-conditions set down, we are deciding to impose on these already over-burdened shoulders unnecessary distraction which inevitably will have a heavy impact on morale and motivation. These two key elements, morale and motivation, are among the most important assets that a student has at this time of year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the arbitration award could not be honoured because it would <Col N="1074" /> cost too much.  I have heard mention of £110 million and of roughly 100,000 students.  I make that out to be £1,100 per student and that reckoned in terms of a student's education is a very small drop in the ocean.  We should get it into perspective and stop codding ourselves that we cannot afford it.  I ask the Fianna Fáil Members if they are prepared to honour it in Government.  I do not mean now, but when they become the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been asked not just in this House but of me by people outside who feel that I should know.  I do not and I want to know, so that I can assure them that the noises we have been hearing are that they are prepared to honour the agreement of the arbitrator which the present Government have not done.  I say seriously to the Government that if they did not wish to honour it, then they should not have entered into it.  They should have said in advance: &ldquo;Because of the stringency of our finances we are not capable of honouring whatever may be the reward.  Here is the most we can give&rdquo;, or: &ldquo;We are not prepared to give an open cheque to the aribtrator.&rdquo;  That would have been honest and we would not have the strife we have at the moment had they taken that course.</P>
      <P>Now damage has already been done. Many of our students are confused as to whether there are to be exams.  They are unsettled and unsure, and this in itself will have an impact whether or not the teachers become involved in the examinations and the whole procedure in the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal that between the Government and the teachers' unions this should be resolved quickly.  I welcome the new Minister's suggestion tonight, which I have no doubt derives from the fact that a motion has been put down in the House, offering talks, apparently unconditional and under any aegis whatsoever that might be helpful.  This is a move in the right direction.  I sympathise with the Minister who inherited this dilemma the <Col N="1075" /> Government find themselves in.  On the other hand, collective responsibility being what it is, I suppose he is as much to blame as everybody else in that Government.</P>
    <P>The people who are most affected by this and who would lose most are not only the leaving certificate students who would be going on to third level education who, either through a debased certificate or none, would not be entitled to enter third level education next year as planned, but the group certificate, inter certificate and vocational pupils who are not capable, because of financial stringencies, of going any further will also be denied the right of having even that qualification.  Because of lack of funds they will not be able to do the examination again.  They will really be hit if the examinations do not take place and, despite what the Minister said, I do not think these examinations will take place unless teachers are involved in them.  In any event, if teachers do not participate those certificates will be regarded as somewhat debased in value in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government and the unions count for nothing compared to the students.  It is a sad day when their future is at risk. Therefore, I appeal to all concerned to try to solve this dispute.  All credit is due to the Deputy who moved the motion which sparked the reaction of the Minister in offering talks.  I believe that the teachers will respond and I hope it will be tomorrow because the first practicals in the examinations to which I referred start very early in May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It was clear earlier today that this dispute was rapidly approaching the point of no return.  The Fianna Fáil motion and The Workers' Party amendment are the last opportunities to avoid a very serious situation where pupils, parents, teachers and the Department would all suffer serious disruption.  Despite the impression given by the media and Government spokespersons, the teachers' unions have not <Col N="1076" /> refused to supervise examinations or to correct papers.  However, they have decided to ballot their members on that issue and there is a strong possibility that they would vote to boycott examinations unless there is a movement in the direction of mediation.  That makes this debate and the placing of the motion and the amendment before the House extremely important because it is clear that the very strong position which the Government adopted up to tonight in relation to this dispute meant that the Government were on a course which sought total victory over the teachers' unions.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's statement tonight that they have backed off from that position and I have no doubt that the teachers' unions will respond positively to the offer which the Minister made. However, I hope that it is not simply a device to get the Government off the hook and to avoid losing the vote tonight. I also hope that the Minister is genuine in regard to a third party reaching some accommodation with the teachers' unions.  The House and the people will be watching very carefully to see that the Minister is not playing games with us because there has been a very dramatic turn around in the Government's position since last night and tonight when the Minister made his statement.  There has been wide acceptance for many weeks that a mediator or a third party was required.  I have been aware for some time that the Employer-Labour Conference had made it known that they would welcome an invitation to become involved.  The teachers' unions made it known that they were open to that procedure but the Government adamantly refused to become involved in that process.  The motion and The Workers' Party amendment should be passed by the House to show the Minister and the Government that the House wants serious negotiations to take place between the Minister and the trade unions involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points which the Minister made tonight, and which the Taoiseach made last night, that an employer-labour dispute between the Government as employer and the teachers' unions as <Col N="1077" /> employees has created a constitutional crisis are totally dishonest.  To imply that every issue which has ever been decided by this House has never been overturned or changed is untrue and dishonest.  We had before us over the last few days a Finance Bill which has introduced wideranging changes from the budget passed by this House some time ago.  Trying to indicate that there is some kind of constitutional crisis and that the authority of the Government is being questioned is dishonest and the Government should not adopt that approach to the dispute.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government and backbench TDs on the Government side, particularly the Labour Party members of the Government, to support the motion and The Workers' Party amendment tonight to indicate to the people, teachers and the trade unions involved that serious negotiations are required and will be pursued from tomorrow.</P>

      <P>There were very strong feelings in regard to the teachers' dispute and I am sure that the Minister for Energy used his good offices to convey that to his Cabinet colleagues.  I have had the feeling of late that backbenchers, particularly Labour Party backbenchers, were used as political fodder, rubber stamps for Government decisions, that on many <Col N="1078" /> occasions were contrary to Labour Party policy.  I must say to the Minister that there is no doubt in my mind that the whole question of the handling of this dispute from the beginning left a lot to be desired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was handled in a very amateurish way.  There is no doubt that many of the problems we are now faced with emanate from the way the dispute was handled at the outset.  It is not true to say that the teachers would not compromise because the proposal carried by the House sets back considerably the arbitrator's award and proposes to pay it over a longer period of time with a substantial loss in relation to teachers' pay.  It appears to me that they have been very reasonable in their approach to this.  I have not encountered any trade unions that would accept an award of any sort, whether it was made by the Labour Court or by an arbitrator, after three years of negotiations, without some form of retrospection.  It is only on the basis of a concession in that regard that trade unions can bring their members with them.  A period of three years is a most unreasonable length of time for negotiations.  I do not agree with the Minister that concessions have not been made by the teachers. In fact, I suggest respectfully that any concessions that have been made to date have been made by the teachers.</P>
      <P>Last night I listened with interest to the speech by the Taoiseach and I thought that the door was closed on this issue.  At that stage I was very much in favour of supporting the Fianna Fáil motion to appoint a mediator.  I look upon the Employer-Labour Conference as the most skilled body in regard to industrial relations.  I had the privilege of being involved at that level for many years, particularly from 1969 onwards when national wage agreements were negotiated, and I am satisfied that that body has the skill and the ability to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in teachers accepting the Employer-Labour Conference as the <Col N="1079" /> mediator unless there is a will on the part of the unions &mdash; I am sure that exists &mdash; and on the part of the Minister to negotiate a reasonable settlement that will be acceptable not to the negotiators but to the people they represent, the teachers.  I should like to make it clear to the Minister that as far as I am concerned the idea of employing people other than teachers to carry out the marking of examination papers amounts to scab labour.  There is no other definition for that.  That is not acceptable to me as a trade unionist and is not acceptable to my colleagues.  If there is any attempt to do that and the matter is referred to the Dáil I will not be voting with the Government.  I will be anxious to see how the talks progress and I suggest to the teachers that they immediately take up the invitation the Minister extended by letter today.  They should go for the Employer-Labour Conference and we will ensure in the House that every opportunity is given to them and the Government to settle the dispute to the satisfaction of both parties.</P>
    <P>Unless the dispute is settled to the satisfaction of the teachers I can assure the teachers that the next time the issue comes before the House my vote will be steadily behind them.</P>

      <P>I support the motion in the name of Deputy Vincent Brady.  I had a look at the amendments tabled by Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa and Deputy Harney and I noted that they were in the same vein as the motion tabled by Deputy Vincent Brady.  I had intended indicating that to the House but I could be told before I came into the House that the Progressive Democrats had made a deal with the Government. Those who set themselves up as moral arbiters will also have to subject themselves to the moral judgment of other people as regards backdoor arrangements made before a proper debate takes place in the House.  I should like to point out that Deputy O'Rourke, the spokesperson for our party, asked last night in the House why the Employer-Labour Conference had not been utilised to achieve a resolution of this dispute.  Perhaps Deputy Bell was not listening to that but I want to put it on the record of the House that that suggestion came from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Liam Fitzgerald said, this whole problem started from the moral miasma that came from Bray at the beginning of this dispute.  A noxious emanation from the same quarter came after Deputy Cooney became Minister for Education, not with the intention of helping to solve this dispute but with the intention of queering the pitch on Deputy Cooney as Minister for Education and other people who are committed to a solution of the problem in the House.  When the debate took place on 6 February I indicated that the responsibility lay on the Taoiseach in particular, and on individual members of the Government, as well as upon the then Minister for Education and, as a moral body, the present Minister.  At that time I knew what was coming and I said that down the road we would have disputes and disruptions, disruptions in the schools, possible disruption in public examinations and disruption in planned careers.  I said that we will have low <Col N="1081" /> morale among the teachers.  It was easy for anybody who understood the scene to prophesy at that time.  That was the time that the Minister for Education should have been about her business in trying to resolve the dispute in good time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, who must bear a heavy responsibility with regard to this whole problem, went on television last night and talked about the provision of £65 million.  He talked about taxpayers' burdens but I must say that he was very selective when talking about burdens on the taxpayer.  The load of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland could be put on the shoulders of the taxpayer and Irish Shipping may end with £100 million of taxpayers' money to pay off people in the Orient because of a mistake in liquidating the company.  That will also go on the shoulders of the taxpayers.  A total of £135 million was promised from the taxpayer for Dublin Gas.  The Taoiseach was very selective about his care for the taxpayer and was only concerned that £65 million should not be paid to the teachers. I condemn that as an outstanding example in hypocrisy on the part of the Taoiseach last night.</P>
    <P>Certainly it would be dishonest of the Government, he said, to go into mediation but that is what the Minister for Education has said tonight, he is going into mediation in accordance with our motion.  The Taoiseach said it would be dishonest of the Government to go into mediation with the intention of rejecting any and every proposal to pay any part of the extra money sought by the teachers but was it dishonest to go into conciliation with the teachers and to make no offer to the teachers in conciliation?  Was it dishonest to argue the case before an arbitrator who was agreed between the Government and the unions at that time? Was it dishonest then to refuse to abide by what the arbitrator decided.  He said he would be leading them up the garden path.  Where was he leading them throughout the whole process of conciliation and arbitration?  Was it not up the garden path?  Was he not fooling an honourable, responsible group in our society <Col N="1082" /> by going through the gymnastics of conciliation and arbitration when he had no intention of honouring the actual award when it was made?  He referred to the extra burden on taxpayers: my granny's grunt; he is not a bit concerned; he just wants to beat the teachers and that is it. It is a matter of triumphalism; it is a matter of Thatcherism; it is a matter of Sir Keith Joseph transferred across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Then he said that, the authority of Dáil Éireann &mdash; and I am 100 per cent in agreement with what Deputy De Rossa said about this &mdash; the supreme democratic authority of this State would thus have disappeared.  He said he felt that many teachers did not fully appreciate &mdash; notice the condescension &mdash; just what was involved.  First we have the placebo and then we have the insult.  That seems to be the style of negotiation that this Government and this Taoiseach in particular indulge in.  The implications for democracy, as Deputy De Rossa said, were mentioned by the Taoiseach.  To impute near idiocy on the one hand and enmity to democracy on the other is to insult and injure.  What more stable element is there in our democracy than our 40,000 teachers?  Who helps more at local level to sustain and nourish democracy? Who helps more to develop our communities, to make democracy work at community, local and national both professionally and voluntary?  Who understands better than our teachers that it is the essence of democracy that what February 6 did April 16 can undo, as Deputy De Rossa said a few moments ago?  They have been bulwarks of our democracy, making it work at local level by organising and developing games and athletics, cementing our community, boys' and girls' clubs and so on.  That is democracy.  That is not Dublin 4 democracy; that is democracy as this party on this side of the House perceive it.</P>

Only practising teachers can understand the rapport that is set up as between teacher and pupil, the interest that the teacher takes in the pupil and the advice and the guidance that are an everyday occurrence in the classroom, about careers and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney mentioned social mobility which, to my mind, is at the root of our educational system.  We are not all that wealthy when considered in the context of the worldwide wealth so that education constitutes the only ladder to social mobility.  Anybody who damages that will have a very heavy burden on his conscience for the future.  The symbiosis that develops between teacher and pupil is somthing that one must have experienced to understand properly.  It is something that this House will damage at its peril.</P>

      <P>A game was played, a referee was appointed, but it is only the spoiled children, the Taoiseach and his Government, who refuse to accept the referee's decision as to who won the game.  That is something that is not lost on the rising generation either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here in the House with a Government whining about £65 million, although they have lashed it out to Dublin <Col N="1084" /> Gas.  They have lashed it out to Whai Whong in Hong Kong.  They have lashed it out to cultivate a very advanced style of living in London for the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  They cannot lash it out to the teachers.  There is a national debt of £20 billion.  Perhaps a little saving could have been effected there.  One billion pounds was taken out of the black economy, transferred out of the country because the people who transferred it had no confidence in the administrative which would encourage them to invest here so that money would be available for worthy causes like the development of education.  One might well compare the expenditure of £746 million on social welfare with the figure that was paid by this party when last in office, when one will see quite clearly the failure of this Government to provide jobs and ensure development which would enable them to pay arbitrators' awards when arbitrators had decided on them.</P>
    <P>This Government are without honour. They seem to me in every way to be apeing the worst aspects of the present administration in Great Britain.  Sir Keith Joseph has his row with the teachers in Britain.  We must have our row: otherwise we would not be with it.  To be quite frank, the present Minister for Education is not a man who goes along with that kind of thinking.  The saddle has been put on him by the Taoiseach and the bridle is the bridle of the former Minister.</P>

      <P>I am still asking for support for Deputy Vincent Brady's motion and its interpretations on the Order Paper.  I am calling on people who really feel for the young people who are dependent on education and the sacrifices of their parents for a chance to make it in a socially, upwardly mobile society.  I know that the practicals &mdash; and Deputy Blaney mentioned this when speaking &mdash; in woodwork, mentalwork, in music and so on are coming up.  No preparation has been made for those examinations.  Do not let anybody cod this House by pretending that any preparation has been <Col N="1085" /> made.  No such preparation has been made and I challenge anybody to deny that in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say a few words on the nature of the job of correcting examination papers.  It is a demanding, exhausting, energy-sapping job.  I resent the Minister for Education saying that we know nothing about it.  Many Members on this side of the House have had experience of it. It is not unusual for examiners to crack in the middle of marking 600 papers, having to give up a job because of physical and mental exhaustion.  Now we are going to get hirelings to try and do that, hirelings without experience or expertise. These will be paraded as people who will do justice to our national examinations and our students' future.  I resent the implication and I reject the proposition that this can be done.  The percentages that teachers are getting are irrelevant. What is relevant is the principle.  The principle is of paramount importance. The principle is what will count in the <Col N="1086" /> end when the existing salaries and demands are items of history.</P>
    <P>We do not want the Army and the Garda &mdash; and they would find it distasteful &mdash; to be brought in on running these examinations.</P>

      <P>All persons of no fixed abode are required to attend at their local offices between 11.30 and 12 noon each Thursday for the purpose of claiming unemployment benefit or assistance.  The common pay day was introduced in 1981 to combat personation and multiple claiming of unemployment benefit and assistance on the part of persons of no fixed abode.</P>
      <P>The common signing pay day applies to all people of no fixed abode regardless of the distance they reside from the nearest local office.  In view of the general mobility of travelling people and their tendency to move about frequently, certification of unemployment by the Garda, would not give adequate control against irregular claiming at local offices.</P>
      <P>All unemployed persons are allotted a specific time at which they are required to sign the register.  In this regard it is not considered that the present arrangements for persons of no fixed abode are any more onerous than the arrangements which apply to other unemployed persons.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in view of the very small number of children from lower income homes who receive a third level education, she will amend the social welfare code so that parents on social welfare can claim benefit or allowance in respect of dependants aged 18 or over who are in full time education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, increases in social welfare payments are generally payable in respect of child dependants up to age 18 years.  However, special arrangements apply in the case of widow's pension, deserted wife's benefit or allowance, prisoners wife's allowance or unmarried mother's allowance where such increases may be awarded in respect of children up to the age of 21 years if they are receiving full time instruction by day at any university, college or other third level institution.  This also applies where persons in one of these categories are in receipt of old age, retirement or invalidity pensions.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to extend these arrangements to persons in receipt of other social welfare payments and any such proposal would have significant cost implications.  However, the question of the different age limits for child dependency increases under the social welfare system will be examined in the light of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

The usual practice is that in the normal control of disability benefit claims, the Department's medical referees suggest when claimants should be referred for further examination.  If the medical referee indicates that a person is permanently incapable of work after receiving disability benefit for a year then an application for invalidity pension can be accepted from that person.</P>

      <P>The number of appeal cases under consideration in my Department in respect of applications for unemployment assistance from smallholders in Kerry is 17.  This number is based on the number of appeals on hand in employment exchanges in County Kerry.'</P>
      <P>As regards the time taken to process appeals much depends on whether further investigations of means are necessary following the lodging of an appeal. In these cases there can be delays before the appeal is finally submitted to an appeals officer.  Where a case is straightforward and all inquiries have been completed or where it is possible to decide a case summarily a much shorter time scale is involved.</P>
      <P>In the cases referred to by the Deputy additional inquiries have been necessary. Some of these have been completed and an appeals officer is scheduled to visit Kerry next week to deal with two of these.  A further two cases have been recently heard and the appellants will be notified shortly of the results.  The remainder will be disposed of as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The PRSI exemption scheme applied in respect of additional employees taken on between 23 October 1985 and 5 April 1986.  The scheme was, therefore, open to employers' applications for a period in excess of five months.  Much of the intended employment boost under a temporary scheme of this kind depends on its having a clearly recognised and limited period of availability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a significant increase in interest by employers is known to have occurred in the two weeks before the scheme finally closed on 5 April 1986, no precise information is as yet available on the total <Col N="978" /> number of additional employees finally taken on under the scheme.  In order to establish this, a survey of all employment exchanges-offices is at present being conducted by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In order to accommodate applications from employers who were ready to take on additional employees before 31 March 1986 but unable to make the inquiries necessary to complete their application forms before that date, the original closing date for applications under the scheme was extended from 31 March to 5 April 1986.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of deaths in the last year for which figures are available associated with misuse of: (a) drugs; (b) smoking; (c) alcohol.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to determine accurately the numbers of deaths attributable to the misuse of drugs.  Such deaths may be registered as due to various direct causes but it is not possible to isolate the number of deaths in which drug misuse was a factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of causes of death are regarded as smoking related.  These include coronary heart disease; diseases of other blood vessels (including stroke); <Col N="982" /> bronchitis and emphysema; cancer of the lung, bronchus and trachea; cancers of the mouth, larynx, oesophagus, pancreas, bladder and kidney and peptic ulcer.  The number of deaths attributable to all these causes amounted to approximately 16,700 in 1982.  While tobacco smoking is involved as a cause in many of these conditions, other factors such as environmental conditions and old age are also involved.</P>
    <P>The number of people who died from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis of the liver in 1982 was 97.  This disease is associated with alcohol abuse which may also be a contributory factor in deaths registered as due to other causes.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of old age contributory pension at maximum rate since 29 July 1983.  Originally he was in receipt of increases for two qualified children.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the regulations under which payment of increases for children could continue in payment to a person in receipt of old age contributory pension after the children have reached age 18.  The increases were accordingly withdrawn when the children reached 18 years of age in September 1984 and March 1986 respectively.  There are no proposals to amend the regulations at the present time.</P>

      <P>When the inquiries, which will be completed as soon as possible, are completed, his case will be submitted to an appeals officer for determination of means and the person concerned will be informed of the outcome as quickly as possible.

      <P>Following reinvestigation of his unemployment assistance claim, the means of the person concerned were assessed at £36 weekly, derived from the beneficial occupation of a holding.  His means exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case and, accordingly, his claim was disallowed.</P>
      <P>He recently appealed against the disallowance of his claim and he is being afforded an opportunity of submitting a written statement of the facts and contentions on which he relies in support of his appeal.</P>
      <P>When a reply is received from him, his papers will be submitted to an appeals officer for determination of means, at the earliest available opportunity.

      <P>Expenditure on the scheme in 1985 amounted to £7,253,716.  The difference between the allocation for 1985 and expenditure is attributable to a number of factors, including time-lags in formulating and starting projects and delays in submitting claims for payments by sponsors.</P>

      <P>Participation in the social employment scheme was confined to persons over 25 years of age who had been unemployed for more than one year and who were in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I am waiving the requirement in relation to the one year qualifying period. As a result, all persons, including small farmers, in receipt of unemployment assistance and over 25 years of age are eligible to participate in the social employment scheme.</P>

      <P>An amount of £55,692 was allocated under the social employment scheme for the operation of the environmental scheme at the Glen, Newfoundwell, Drogheda, over a six month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sponsors of the project, Drogheda <Col N="994" /> Corporation, recently sought approval to recruit additional workers and to have the project extended for a further six months.  This approval has now been given and the additional financial allocation, which includes provision for wages, supervision and materials, amounts to £11,384.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with progress on the project at the Glen, Drogheda, and I hope that other groups will follow the example being set by the sponsors in this case.</P>
