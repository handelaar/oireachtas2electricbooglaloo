      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware of a rather extraordinary happening here last night when one of his Ministers announced considerable public expenditure in the form of social welfare benefits but did not have have available to the House a script of her speech?  As a result, the House has no official record of the exact details of the changes announced or their cost to the Exchequer.  Will the Taoiseach take steps today to try to repair this extraordinary omission by the Minister for Social Welfare and let us have in some form or writing or other the exact nature of the changes which are, for the third time, proposed in the implementation of the equality directive and if possible, if it is known, the cost of these changes and, if it is even further remotely known, the savings which are supposed to have been identified out of which these extra expenditure can be paid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> In page 4, lines 12 to 18, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Whenever an order is proposed to be made under this Act, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The section concerns the making of orders other than in relation to section 6. Our amendment is a repeat of amendments we put down previously to other Bills requesting that negative orders be replaced by positive orders.  My reason for tabling the amendment is because I have found it impossible in the past, like other Members, to have orders similar to those referred to in the Bill debated in the House.  There is no provision in the rules of the House for a debate on these unless the Government permit time.  On a number of occasions in the past I tried, and failed, to have such negative orders debated in the House and it is for that reason that I am proposing that any orders made by the Minister under section 3 (2) should be of a positive kind. I am proposing that any orders made by the Minister should be brought before the House, discussed and agreed before the order comes into effect.  For instance, I notice that in section 25 the Minister has the power to make an order to give additional functions to the boards of the companies concerned.  It is important that the House should have an opportunity to discuss any such additional functions being given to the board, the reasons for them and so on but, because of the type of order proposed in the Bill, it is unlikely that such a debate will take place.  I should like to ask the Minister to accept our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not out of sympathy with the line Deputy De Rossa is proposing as a general rule but I cannot accept his amendment.  We are trying to create a new environment in the Bill for CIE and we are trying to get the company into a <Col N="456" /> position where they can react speedily and flexibly, like any private company, to opportunities.  The orders we can give, including the one the Deputy referred to under section 25, are designed towards that end.  We can give orders under four headings.  In section 7 (2) there is a mechanism for changing the names of the companies. The reason that provision was inserted in the Seanad was because there was a great deal of criticism of the names in the Bill.  I accepted that criticism and said I was not very happy with the names proposed but nobody could come up with any better names.  We decided to provide a mechanism so that if better names emerged, they could be changed by order.  I do not think any Member can quibble about that.  Orders under section 9 are purely for the adaptation of enactments where there might be wording slightly out of kilter with other enactments and that is fairly routine.  Section 25 is about conferring additional functions on the board in order to be able to exploit their many assets, physical and human, to go into new businesses if opportunities arise.</P>
      <P>Section 26 deals with policy directions which are more appropriate to the Minister than to the House.  However, there is a provision in the section under which if a Minister gives a policy direction, the board may require it to be made by order and if so, the order is made public and put before the House.  In all the circumstances, I do not believe that the amendment is appropriate or would be wise.  We wanted to give CIE more flexibility and we do not want to have to come back to either House of the Oireachtas every time the company want a change in their business arrangement or in their Memorandum and Articles of Association. I do not think that would be wise and I do not think anybody who supports the concept of State enterprise would, on examination, want to tie down the company by such a restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said in regard to the need to provide a flexible environment within which the company, or companies, may <Col N="457" /> have to operate.  However, I take the view that in the normal course, any company are or should be responsible ultimately to the shareholders.  I understand that in the case of any company taking extra powers or having extra powers or functions granted to them, it is important that the shareholders have a say in such a move.  The Minister represents the public at large who are, in effect, the shareholders of CIE.  The Minister is answerable to the House.  I do not see how it would delay things if we had a discussion, if necessary, on the powers the Minister proposes to give to the board.</P>
      <P>I understand there is a proposal on the Order Paper to provide public time on Tuesday next for a discussion on orders of that kind.  Implicitly, there is a suggestion that such discussions would not cause unnecessary delays.  From a general point of view it is important that when the House gives powers, as those in this Bill, there would be a discussion on such powers instead of nominal approval by the House, as at present.  To my knowledge there have been negative orders made by Ministers that have never been debated.  I did some research on this and I can find only one occasion in 15 years when such an order was debated here.  It is a bad principle to have orders approved without the House being given an opportunity to discuss them.</P>
      <P>In the past I have been concerned about this and put down motions to have orders annulled, but even if Fianna Fáil were to put down annulment motions it would not be possible to have them discussed in Government time &mdash; they would have to take their turn in Private Members' time.  From the point of view of Members' responsibility in respect of the running of CIE, positive types of orders, to be debated in the House, would be necessary.  If we take our role seriously, orders of this kind should not be there only in name, as window dressing. In appearance, we have the right to annul orders, but in fact we do not.</P>

      <P>The Chair hopes to acquire some wisdom in a minute or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Deputy knows the Chair has wisdom.  The substantial amendment before the House seeks to have two companies instead of three: our proposal is that there would be a specific company for Dublin city services and one company incorporating the provincial bus services and the railways for the whole country.  As I said on Second Stage, the first consideration when the structures were explained to me by the consultants was that there was a lot of reason in what, theoretically, they put before me.  I said then that I appreciated the care the consultants had taken to explain what the new structures were to be.  However, when briefed by people who were not taken up totally with theory &mdash; who were the practitioners on the ground &mdash; I gave it further consideration and we considered it further in Fianna Fáil.  The result of that consideration is the group of amendments now before us.  In the main, the argument against the three-company proposal is on the grounds of efficiency and practicality.  I referred to the main points on Second Stage but it may be worth repeating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICTU, which we can rely on for a broad view because they represent not merely the trade unions in CIE but have a considerable amount of labour wisdom, are of the considered opinion that two companies would be better than three in the circumstances.  The memorandum which I received from Congress states that the amendment submitted altering the restructuring proposals to two companies instead of three is clearly intended to protect the strength and flexibility of existing CIE rail and road passenger services. The memorandum elaborates on the theme.  I mentioned on Second Stage the fact that many decisions in regard to matters of detail will eventually end up on the table of the parent board worries me.  The parent board, as conceived, is not for that purpose.  It has a broader role with regard to management and the role <Col N="460" /> that is laid down for it is a sound one. For that reason I regard the possibility of disputes and problems arising at local level being referred back to the board as frustrating the purpose of the board.</P>
    <P>Road passenger services feed into mainline rail services and <i>vice versa.</i> Thousands of passengers are concerned with this and there is a kind of linked in unit operating.  The Minister himself was concerned about this and was successful in having a feed in from the Dublin city services to the DART system.  The Minister achieved that and I am glad to be able to say a word in appreciation of it. While the two company proposal we have before the House is not relevant as far as that service is concerned, the Minister will admit it is important to have this liaison between the provincial bus services and the rail service.</P>
    <P>The Congress memorandum mentions also that in quite a number of provincial locations control points, booking offices and other office accommodation, rest rooms, waiting rooms and so on are shared equally by road passenger and rail operative staff in the same premises.  As it is a national transport company there is a major problem in separating these services.  Who will get what would have to be decided at too high a level.  These are matters which should come up for decision at a lower level than is envisaged in the Bill and in what the Minister told the House.</P>
    <P>The memorandum states that a similar criterion exists in relation to existing maintenance services provided by the various provincial garages.  Much of the savings and cost reductions achieved in recent times at provincial locations have been the result of the umbrella negotiating procedures which apply in the relevant areas.  The present co-ordinated structure is more conducive to resolving such problems than having to deal with separate units, separate groups of staff and so on.  Perhaps the Minister can indicate to the House that this will not involve the company or companies in any extra cost, but on the face of it that argument seems to make sense.</P>
    <P>The next point was how does one have <Col N="461" /> a rational system of competition between road and rail &mdash; and the Minister seemed to favour some competition &mdash; when one considers that it comes under the heading of a social service and £115 million has to be voted by this House for that company. The problem of competition seems almost impossible to resolve.  I brought before the House complaints from hauliers &mdash; they were denied in this House and I have no way of knowing with absolute certainty whether the allegations are correct or not &mdash; that CIE hauliers were providing services which they could not provide if they were not subsidised by this House and, consequently, were driving the private hauliers out of business. By private hauliers I mean a man with one truck, not a large company.  What happens with regard to competition between rail and bus services under this regime if they are expected to indulge in at least a measure of competition?  If I could be convinced that such competition would result in better services and that the taxpayer would not suffer as a result of it I would be happy to go along with it but I am not sure that can be avoided in the circumstances envisaged.</P>

      <P>We were taking amendments Nos. 2, 11 and 15 together but then the Minister asked what other amendments could be taken together. Now it is proposed to take amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 15 together because they are interlocked, but to have separate decisions on amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  Those decisions will govern the remaining amendments Nos. 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10.  That is agreed.</P>

      <P>I had been talking about competition and the difficulties of seeing how it would work without the taxpayer suffering.  One of the big fears has been that the thrust or eventual aim or objective is the closing down of sections of the railway.  I know it has been denied but many people who are involved in the transport business are afraid that is the purpose of the Bill.  It would be as well to have it on the record of the House and to accept my amendment to ensure that this is not the purpose of a separate company for rail and a separate company for provincial buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is that when this House looks for more transparency in the finances of CIE, or individual areas of CIE's operations, immediately the suspicion <Col N="463" /> arises that the purpose in knowing which areas specifically are losing money is to close down those services.  That should not be the purpose.  This House should be entitled to totally transparent accounts for the various activities of CIE, while at the same time not flinching from the obligations to provide a service which is in effect a social service, costing £115 million in 1985.  I have a later amendment designed to develop greater transparency in the way the accounts are presented.  It is not with a view to finding out which service is not paying and closing it down.</P>
    <P>The rail people always complain that losses are attributed to them which they have not really sustained, in the fond belief that this House is so romantically attached to railways that it will not close down anything that is left of our railway system and therefore it is safer to lay the blame on them.  Trade unionists have been worried about the idea that part of the railway system would be closed down and that part of the road passenger social services will be abandoned, leaving the worst off members of society without any public transport and resulting in the probable loss of thousands of jobs in CIE. The Dublin Transport Authority have no nominee from CIE.  I do not know what this indicates but it is used as part of the argument that the objective is to close down part of the railway system and the road passenger service.</P>
    <P>There has been an indication that the unions involved are prepared to negotiate a major reorganisation of the management structures.  They emphasise heavily that the social role must not be lost sight of.  In this House there is a general commitment to that.  I do not think there is any strong, ideological stand on purely capitalist philosophy with regard to CIE.</P>
    <P>I am arguing for two companies as against three companies and putting forward the argument about the integration of the rail function and the road passenger function.  Only yesterday I received a document from the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association.  The secretary of the Dublin No. 1 branch gives his views on <Col N="464" /> the breakup of CIE, to which the association are opposed.  They accuse the Minister of having made a U-turn and they quote from a Fine Gael document which stated that Fine Gael in Government would provide the capital required by CIE to implement within the next five years the sections of their rapid rail scheme and provide rapid rail services from the suburbs of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown to Heuston and Broadstone stations and would establish a busway from Dundrum to the city along the track of the old Harcourt Street line.</P>
    <P>The document went on to say that further stages of the rapid rail system would be considered by Fine Gael in Government. The secretary goes on to deal with the subsidies and other matters which are not relevant to this section of the Bill. In general he takes the view that the companies should not be separated and expresses fear about that.  I do not know how valid are these fears.  Sometimes fears are exaggerated but a fear obviously exists that the establishment of these companies could lead to privatisation.  I do not know how much substance is in that but perhaps the Minister would refer to it.  I do not regard it as all that important because it is fairly evident that when we decide to retain a national transport system which is wholly dedicated to giving a social service &mdash; not £115 million, but whatever it costs &mdash; the idea of privatising any part of it would be foolish.  I said on Second Stage it is important to identify what each separate part of the system is costing in the annual subsidy, to commit this House to maintaining the services.  We cannot do that without being able to identify them.  At present nobody can say &mdash; except perhaps the inner circle of CIE &mdash; what is and what is not a very heavy draw on the £115 million, and what is making money for the company.  We would be better off if we knew that and committed ourselves to maintaining the services at as good value for the taxpayer as possible.</P>
    <P>I have been convinced that the problems arising from having one separate company for rail and one for the provincial bus services will create too many <Col N="465" /> difficulties.  It is too big a wrench and too many problems at local level and too many difficult problems will be referred back to the board whose function is defined in the Bill.  It is not envisaged as a board which will deal with the minutiae of local and regional organisation.  I hope the Minister at this late stage will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 are being taken in conjunction with amendment No. 2 so I propose to speak to amendment No. 2.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 are consequential on amendment No. 2.  If amendment No. 2 is passed, amendments Nos. 4 and 6 will automatically follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points made by Deputy Wilson are the same points I propose to make so I will not repeat them at length.  It is odd that a provincial service and a rail service which are so closely linked and which depend on each other to a great degree should be hived off into two separate companies.  The case has been well made by the employees in CIE that whatever about Dublin city services being a separate company as it is a single type of service which can in theory be run as a separate company, the provincial bus services and the rail services use the same facilities in many cases and the same staff. It is impossible to figure out the thinking behind hiving them off into two separate companies.  In Dublin we have the Dublin city service operating more or less as a separate entity and the provincial bus service operating from Busaras.  I know of at least one instance where the manager in a Dublin city garage has had considerable difficulty in getting the use of a bay in Busaras for a bus and he was obliged for a long time to park a Dublin city service bus outside Busaras.  That is the kind of petty obstacle that will arise if we have two separate companies operating in competition which each other. There will be all sorts of demarcation and problems about which is entitled to use facilities and at what times and so on. The provincial bus services and the rail services work well together and it would <Col N="466" /> be unfortunate if they were to be disrupted, giving rise to all sorts of problems which would in the end make the service inefficient and would be contrary to the aim of the Bill which is to provide a more efficient service.</P>
    <P>The Minister on a number of occasions has denied that there is any intention to privatise CIE services.  I am happy to take his word on that but the reality must be accepted.  If we introduce a free-for-all competition in the public transport system, if there are three companies involved, not only will they be competing with each other but with private operators. Presumably the Minister proposes at some stage to license private operators. There is an obvious possibility that the social services aspect of CIE will go by the board and the bottom line at any time will be whether a route is profitable. The inevitable outcome will not necessarily be privatisation but simply a transfer of the operations of CIE from public hands to private hands with the consequent loss of the social services aspect of public transport.  There are many concerns among the staff in CIE both in connection with the security of their jobs and the fact that at the end of the day providing three companies, as is proposed in the Bill, will result in a less efficient rather than a more efficient service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Wilson and Deputy De Rossa relating to the provincial bus and rail services.  Would it not be more sensible to have one company controlling the rail and bus services with two sections? At present it is proposed to have three companies controlled by the board of CIE and any problems which may arise in regard to bus and rail services will be dealt with by the holding company.  In view of the concern expressed by the workers at all levels within CIE regarding the problems which they see arising from the use of premises, to which Deputy De Rossa referred, it is no use saying that these problems will not occur because, human nature being what it is, it is inevitable that there will be problems.  One <Col N="467" /> company dealing with rail and provincial buses would cut down bureaucracy and red tape when the new company are in operation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson and Deputy De Rossa referred to concern among the staff.  I understand that worry when there is uncertainty about the future, and that is why we should get on with this Bill to ensure that the reorganisation goes ahead smoothly. However, the vast majority of the worries and fears of the staff are totally unnecessary. I am surprised there has not been one word about the concern of the taxpayer and the travelling public.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to cement the very big improvements which have taken place in CIE over the past four years for which everyone in the company deserves credit.  We must also provide a system which will enable those improvements to be built upon and developed in the financial performance of the overall group of companies and in the level of courtesy, efficiency, cleanliness and so on of the services provided to the public.</P>
      <P>The main worries of the staff are in relation to the railways because they are concerned about their future.  However, the McKinsey report underlined the fact that there is no room for further truncation of the railways.  No further branches of any significance could be chopped off to make the service less costly and the choice, according to the report, was to continue the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to be able to give that assurance.  The McKinsey report said that you either closed the railways or kept them.  It is very clear that a decision has been made to keep them. We have a marvellous new DART system and, although it is costly, most people are delighted with it.  A set of inter-city coaches is in course of construction. Some are already in service and more are being built.  Those coaches will be in use for 30 or 40 years.  In addition, there has been an enormous investment over the past five years in signalling, tracking etc. There has been a huge upgrading of the railways in that respect and, therefore, any fears in relation to the future of the railways are totally unfounded, certainly for the next 30 years.  We are trying to ensure that the railways will not cost more than is absolutely necessary and the same applies to other services operated by CIE.</P>
      <P>It is worth recalling the awful developments which took place in CIE between 1969 and 1982 when the deficit escalated from £3.5 million to £109.2 million, seven times the rate of inflation.  We can never let that happen again.  Over the past four years the deficit has fallen in real terms each year.  Among the factors leading to the terrible escalation during that period was that CIE were too big.  Decisions were made by management far too remote from the shop floor, too inflexible and lacking in understanding of the sort of decisions which needed to be taken. Another factor was very poor industrial relations, especially in Dublin city buses. Many people in CIE very much resent the impression that CIE have been strike-ridden for years because it does not accurately reflect the true picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, the industrial relations record in regard to the railways has been very good, especially as far as strikes are concerned, and naturally they resent the label of being strike happy.  I know the record of Dublin city bus services has been extraordinarily bad but there has been a great improvement in the past four years and I hope it will be sustained for a long time to come.  Public confidence is crucial.  The fact that a service <Col N="469" /> is reliable and that buses come on time will be an important factor in getting people back on the buses, thereby reducing costs to the taxpayer.  Of course, the more passengers you have the lower the fares.  Industrial relations have been a problem contributed to by the remoteness of management which is inevitable in a company as big as CIE.</P>
    <P>I can quote some examples, with which I am very familiar, of issues which have been at the base of many of the wildcat and other strikes and tensions in the Dublin city bus services.  One such example is where a man rings in to take a day's leave because his wife is sick.  He is refused a day's leave by the garage manager because he has been told by the top people to get tough on people not turning in for work etc.  What does the man have to do?  He has to go sick and he goes sick for perhaps a week or ten days whereas, if he had been given the day's leave he had asked for, he would have had a day's leave which would not have cost the company anything.</P>
    <P>That sort of nit-picking, which is part of the fact that the company are too big, is illustrative of many other attitudes which have led to industrial relations problems in the Dublin city services.  The other problems arise from the remoteness of the management.  It was recommended by McKinsey that we break up CIE completely and have three totally separate companies &mdash; city buses, the provincial buses and the railways.  We said no to that.  There is a great deal of sense in having an overall national transport company because of the need for a comprehensive national transport system. There is a need to retain this group because of the interrelationship of all those services but, at the same time, we recognise the need to get the management down to specific functions and nearer the shop floor.  That is what we are trying to do in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In order to allay some of the concerns which have arisen and to underline the continuity of CIE we have made several provisions.  We have, for instance, underlined in the Bill the full interchangeability of staff as between the companies and <Col N="470" /> the board.  Promotions are possible and transfers are possible within and between the companies.  Secondly, there will be one pension scheme organised at the main board level for all the companies. Those two factors underline the continuity of CIE as one group of companies just as Guinness are one group of companies but include Smithwicks and Harpsales etc.  Of course, the main board of Guinness ensure that there is no cutthroat competition between those companies but there is competition.</P>
    <P>We have also provided &mdash; this deals with the privatisation fears and worries &mdash; that there cannot be privatisation.  That is specifically provided for in the Bill.  There can be no selling of shares.</P>

      <P>The only shares which are permitted are the statutory shares required by the Companies Act.  They are the two nominee shares.  Otherwise no shares may be sold or alienated.  That is provided for in the Bill.  Therefore, the privatisation fears or worries are totally groundless.  Privatisation is specifically ruled out by the Bill.  We have complete complementarity.  At the same time we have interchangeability and promotability of staff and are getting management down to specific functions and nearer the shop floor.  Also, we are getting greater transparency of the cost of each of the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to the social dimension of CIE.  The fact of the matter is that the Government decided in 1983, on my proposal, that we had better settle <Col N="471" /> this thing once and for all because there never had been any proper consideration given as to the extent of the social role of CIE.  There have been arguments for a long time.  It is implicit in one of the amendments we will deal with later on in Deputy Wilson's name that we should identify the cost of each route on the railways, on the provincial bus services and on the city bus services.  That is for the birds.  One would spend an awful lot of time and money in trying to measure the cost of the Crossmolina-Belmullet bus service.  To what benefit?  I do not think Guinness &mdash; I mention them because they are the company with which I am most familiar having worked there &mdash; measure the cost of delivering a barrel of Guinness to Belmullet as against delivering it to Galway city.  They take the overall cost of getting all their beer out to their customers.  They are committed to a comprehensibility of service throughout the country so that their product is available throughout the country.  CIE are very much in the same&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to see to it that they will not, but the point I am making is that there is not much sense in deciding route by route, service by service what the cost is and what the social dimension is.  Apart from the difficulties it is a recipe for political chicanery of the worst sort.  One can imagine one social dimension which would suddenly attach to certain services in constituencies where there was a by-election.  I do not <Col N="472" /> think we should get into that.  Looking at the record of CIE and the overall cost over a number of years, the Government decided that one-third of what they did was identified in general as a social dimension.  Therefore, one-third of their expenditure would be met in the future provided that expenditure was kept within certain declining limits.  That is how we have got it under control.  Those declining limits which are reasonable limits have been met and exceeded in each of the past four years without a massive disruption of services or without redundancies.  That is what we are trying to build on and that is what the Bill is about.  That is why it is necessary to have three companies rather than two.  If one were to have two companies one would still have too big a company.  There would still be remoteness of management from the shop floor and a lack of flexibility.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was introduced in the Seanad this was welcomed on Second Stage by speakers from all parties.  The conversion to the two versus three arose during Committee Stage when Members of the Opposition throught the Government might have some difficulty among themselves, which did not prove to be the case, and all of a sudden an amendment to this effect was put down which was defeated.  I ask the House to accept the arguments I have put forward and to join with me in giving a pat on the back to CIE and to all who work there and to say this is a welcome further development in ensuring the future of CIE and their component companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  I am still convinced that the trade unions concerned would not be so firmly in favour of two companies were it not for the fact that they know there are difficulties ahead.  I have mentioned Congress, the TSSA and the National Association of Transport Employees who are very heavily involved in the railway operations.  Of all the representatives I have met, no union were as firmly in favour of the two companies structure as that latter union were.  They <Col N="473" /> indicated that their fears were that, whatever is being said now, the thrust of the triple company arrangement was to cut down on rail operations.  That produces an echo from areas where railways have been closed down in the not too distant past.  For that reason the House should consider very carefully what they say. Our road system has deteriorated to such an extent that we should be thinking of developing the rail system.  When people are talking about inflation and relating costs and subsidy to inflation and giving totals of subsidies and so on, the one thing they leave out is the fact that the railways provide their own roadway system, their own permanent way, and economists do not always take that into account when gauging the cost to the taxpayer of the respective systems of road and rail.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the investment in DART and in the coaches, and he made a point that this House should listen to.  I cannot help claiming credit for this side of the House for both big investments that came under criticism from the then Opposition and have been criticised since then.  If the people involved in the railway operation are worried, we must not forget that part of the responsibility rests with the Government and the Minister in that there was an indication in a public statement from the Government side that there would not be any investment in railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's thesis was that money was lost because CIE as a company were too big and that management decisions were being made too remotely from the people involved.  I do not think that was the real reason for the lack of profit or development.  The late Dr. Andrews, who had a very distinguished career in the public service, headed Bord na Móna, a large company, for a long number of years and he headed CIE for a long period as well.  He devoted a whole chapter of his autobiography to what the Minister mentioned in his speech, the industrial relations problem in CIE.  He indicated in that autobiography that industrial relations were at the heart of CIE's problem, but I do not think that <Col N="474" /> was because the company were too big. I think not enough attention was paid to industrial relations as time progressed into this quarter of this century.  The expertise was not being deployed in that area which should have been deployed there.</P>
    <P>When I was asked some time ago to issue headlines for a transport policy, as I said to the House on Second Stage, I indicated that I thought the Dublin city services should be set up as a separate company.  In so far as this Bill does that I am in full agreement with it.  As I have put on the record of the House, I was disappointed.  My idea was to link it with the Dublin Transport Authority and that, as was originally envisaged, CIE would be the agent for the DTA as far as the supply of the Dublin city services was concerned.  That line of policy &mdash; which I still think was a sound one &mdash; would have had the Dublin city services operating on their own with this special statutory relationship with the DTA and there would have been a period to look at the provincial bus services and the railway services acting on their own and then to come to a conclusion, rather than jump in and have this omni-comprehensive Bill covering all three areas.</P>
    <P>I still maintain that is so.  As the Minister said, and I agree with him and commend him for it, the trade unions involved in the railways for the most part have been highly responsible.  They have not in any way softened their demands for the workers, their own members, but they have been models in negotiating rather than causing industrial stress or coming out on strike.  I do not believe the Member's thesis that the money was being lost because the company were too big.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister said about the interchange of jobs, the continuation of pension rights and so on.  That is specially designed in the Bill to remove some of the worries from the workers.  I will have an opportunity later to deal with what the Minister said with regard to transparency in costs.  By way of interjection my colleague, Deputy Ahern referred to this.  I do not accept that at <Col N="475" /> present with the advanced state of computer technology we cannot know the financial situation of every single operation in a company such as CIE.  After all, in the Twenty-Six-Counties there are about 3.6 million people.  London Transport have to deal with a population in the total London area of about ten million people, so ours is not a big operation. There is no great fear nowadays of tackling a job such as specific costing.  I will be talking about that on an amendment which I have down.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point on this section that it is a real recipe for political chicanery.  I do not accept that.  The phrase is a neat one but I do not accept what the Minister said, that if you have the information before you it will cause any sudden expression of political chicanery in the House.  It would do so if there was not a generally agreed philosophy that where a social service is required it should be supplied.</P>
    <P>If we have rabid, right wing, straight up the centre capitalists anxious to abolish all services, except those which would show a profit, and the higher the percentage of profit the better, I have not heard from them.  There are a few Members, who are not here at the moment, who might subscribe to that new Tory type philosophy &mdash; I do not believe anyone putting forward that theory would prevail &mdash; but taking it all in all the general agreement is that a national transport company should continue to supply a social service where profit making service cannot be developed.  That is not to give <i>carte blanche</i> to the people who put forward the idea that it does not matter a damn what it costs because the taxpayer should pay for it.  What I am saying is that a tight efficient service for the benefit of the taxpayer is needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke a lot about what happened over the last four years.  In 1981, the year Fianna Fáil left office and the Coalition took office, the cost of a barrel of crude oil was $39 plus.  Today &mdash; and CIE must benefit by this &mdash; a <Col N="476" /> barrel of crude oil costs a little more than one third that figure.  The North Sea Brent quotation for a couple of weeks ago was about $14 and a few weeks ago it was $13.  That is a very real help to CIE in improving their finances.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take into account what has been said from this side of the House about adopting two companies. The Chair will probably be able to help me with regard to the parameters for discussions on amendments Nos. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 15 because we have been concentrating on amendment No. 2 up to now.  I do not want the discussions to close until we go through these amendment's to the limit and I wish to know about the decisions by way of vote, if we cannot persuade the Minister to accept our amendments.</P>

      <P>May I deal with some points raised by Deputy Wilson?  As regards the concern about the future of the railway, in 1985 we invested £17 million in the railways, this year we are investing £19 million, and it is planned to invest £21 million in 1987.  These figures speak for themselves, and they include carriage building, signalling and communications. Last year £5.3 million was provided under signalling and communications, £5 million was provided for this year and an estimated £4 million will be provided next year &mdash; and that includes a sum for Rosslare Harbour.  To say there is worry about the future of the railways is just another red herring.  The existence of the railways is assured for the foreseeable future, and I expect for my lifetime.  As a native of Inchicore, an area which depends more on the railways than anywhere else.  I am glad to be able to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage Deputy Wilson mentioned fuel costs and the benefits there must be in this regard for CIE.  Of course the reduction in fuel costs is of some <Col N="477" /> benefit but strange as it may seem, fuel, including, electricity, represents only 7.3 per cent of CIE costs.  Out of over £300 million they spent £24.63 million on fuel in 1985.</P>

      <P>Labour and capital costs are much greater.  I want to put this matter in perspective I do not believe this alters the main point which is that this Bill is being introduced to assure the future of CIE and of each of its components and to try to maximise that future.  Anyone who suggests that this measure threatens in any way the future of CIE, or any part of CIE, is completely wrong.  Great progress has been made in CIE over the last four years and this measure is designed to ensure the future of each part of CIE.  I urge the House to reject the amendments.</P>

      <P>In replying earlier the Minister referred to fears of privatisation. When speaking to that point I said that while I accepted the Minister's assurance that it was not his intention to privatise any part of the public transport system, in the sense of handing over bits of the companies to private enterprise, it is inherent in this Bill that at some point whether by this Minister or a future Minister, the various road services will be licensed to private operations.  It is obvious that this is going to come and this Bill will facilitate that move.  Many CIE employees fear that when the opportunity is right for whatever Government are in power to try to get out from under <Col N="478" /> the social commitment to public transport, the power and the possibility of doing that lies within this Bill and that the three companies will be obliged to compete with companies licensed by the Minister for Communications, whoever that may be.</P>
      <P>The Minister says the investment in CIE's rail services is such that it must be obvious there is no threat to that service. I would go along with him to a certain degree but I am not sure that that arises from any pure commitment to rail traffic and the use of rail for public transport in itself.  I am not an expert in this area but I understand that rail services are regarded by the EC as an important infrastructural service from the point of view of security and so on, and that it is mainly for that reason that rail services are maintained throughout Europe, and not for love of that particular form of transportation.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that no private entrepreneur in his or her right mind &mdash; now that we are encouraging women to become capitalists as well &mdash; would take over the rail services in Ireland or in any other country simply because there is no way they could make money out of so doing.  For any private enterprise person, man or woman, the only criterion to be applied at the end of the day is whether they can make money out of the operation. There would be no way in which they could make money out of running the rail services or, say, a bus to Belmullet providing a service needed by the people in that area.  Whether the Minister accepts it or not, the threat remains; whatever about his good intentions the threat remains.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson raised the spectre of a right wing Tory Government.  Some of us believe we have already at least 60 per cent of a right wing Tory Government in power, the remaining 40 per cent not very alive at present.  The makings of such a Government exist.  There are people who sit behind me here who would love to be in coalition with Fine Gael after the next election &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and use the provisions of this Bill to obliterate much of the services at present provided by CIE.  Whether the Minister for Communications would be prepared to serve in such a Government would be a matter for the future.  The fact is that that possibility exists.  It is no more than a possibility at present but the tools for carrying out such an operation exist in the provisions of this Bill.  That is the fear of CIE workers which we are endeavouring to express here today.</P>
      <P>The Minister is wrong in arguing that the reason for the proposal that there be three companies rather than two is size. As Deputy Wilson said, one could name dozens of multinational companies, ten and 20 times the size of CIE, employing four or five times as many people.  It is the management structures of these companies which is important in terms of their being run efficiently, not the way in which the shares are held or the manner in which the boards meet, whether they are hived off into three boards as subsidiaries of a main holding company. What is important is the philosophy of the company, the capacity of the employees to respond to good management, whether that company be CIE, Guinness or any other.  If the size of CIE is the strongest argument the Minister can advance, then it does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the point raised by Deputy De Rossa in regard to the size of the company.  There are 14,000 to 15,000 people employed in CIE with approximately 6,700 in the rail section.  Therefore, the balance to be struck would be between Dublin city and the provinces.  The basis of the Minister's argument a while ago for having three companies was the remoteness of management. That argument does not stand up because there are many other companies with more than or less than 15,000 people employed &mdash; some with less than perhaps 1,000 people employed &mdash; that <Col N="480" /> experience management problems.  It is not the number of people employed that causes management problems.  Rather is it the type of management, the organisation within the company and how their public relations are handled.  If that is the Minister's strongest argument, then the whole <i>raison d'etre</i> for three companies falls flat on its face.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson raised a point about the breakdown of information regarding the specific services provided by CIE, that that would give political chicanery the go-ahead.  If there were specific detailed information available that would deter people from circulating stories, just using headlines, going into flights of fantasy and receiving plenty of press coverage without the relevant facts.  The availability of such facts would stop much of this nonsense being printed about different companies.  One must have facts before arriving at any reasoned judgment on any issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa says that, no matter what, there is anxiety about the future, that a future right wing Government or whatever could do this, that or the other.  They cannot do anything. The provisions of this Bill prevent the alienation of any shares.  Any change in that arrangement would necessitate additional legislation being introduced in this House.  In relation to the licensing of other services, there is no change proposed in the existing arrangements under the provisions of this Bill.  The licensing of other road transport services is governed by the Road Transport Act, 1932, being reviewed as part of the recommendations of the White Paper but is not affected by the provisions of this Bill. The existing statutory provision remains, that I, as Minister, may only license private bus operations for routes that are not closely similar to the routes serviced already by CIE.  That is not being changed.  Therefore, the provisions of this Bill in no way change the competition CIE bus services face at present from the private sector.  That is completely separate. There is no threat or danger whatever to the future of any part of CIE.  The <Col N="481" /> intention of the Minister is precisely the opposite.  Rather is it to maximise the future of CIE and each of its component parts.</P>

I would like the Minister's views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Senators put down amendments in Seanad Éireann for the purpose of having two companies rather than three, indicating that there would be an interchange of directors.  It was an attempt to meet a particular problem. The fact that the Minister suggested and agreed to the amendment indicates he realised there could be problems.  I cannot agree that all the problems will be removed by that device.  I would like the Minister to indicate how he thinks the board will be able to cope with the problems from Crossmolina, as he mentioned, to Killarney &mdash; I cannot go too far up <Col N="482" /> north because we were deprived of railways some time ago in my area &mdash; right up to Dundalk and across to Sligo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>It was done.  When we were in Government we stood by the promise to provide more money for roads on account of losing the railways but that promise has been forgotten by this Government.  They are not giving any money towards roads and the potholes are getting more dangerous.  Some people are looking for fishing rights for some of the potholes in my county at present.</P>
      <P>I am a little wary about taking all these amendments together.  Amendment No. 3 in my name is to establish two companies, Comhlacht Iarnród-Bus &mdash; CIB, and Bus Bhaile Átha Cliath &mdash; BBAC.  I think that CIB would be a good title and one that could catch on.  It also has the merit of retaining the Irish language.  I am afraid that because of what is incorporated in section 7 &mdash; the titles Iarnród Éireann - Irish Rail; Bus Éireann - Irish Bus; Bus Átha Cliath - Dublin Bus &mdash; the Irish language will be forgotten because the Irish title is a bit too long.  The use of initials would be a good idea.</P>

Mar a deirim, tá an leasú ansin agamsa chun dhá chomhlacht a bheith ann.  Tugann an Conradh le fios gur mhaith leo go mbainfí úsáid as na hainmneacha Gaeilge seo: An Ráil, mar shampla, ar an iarnród; Buslínte nó Buslínte Éireann, Busanna Éireann, Córas Buslínte Éireann, Córas Bus Éireann, is é sin don chomhlacht <Col N="484" /> bhus náisiúnta; agus ansin Bus Átha Cliath, Córas Bus Átha Cliath, nó, mar a deir an litir céanna:</P>

      <P>I have long felt that the practice of putting a name in Irish on any company that the State establishes, whether it be companies of the form we are proposing in this Bill or other forms, is a kind of confidence trick on ourselves that we are doing something useful for the Irish language. I received a letter from Conradh na Gaeilge and while I accept that they have a case in regard to having the names of companies in Irish it is in large measure a continuation of the genuflection towards an aim, the restoration of Irish as a spoken language throughout the country.  There is little else done either with the general public or within any of the companies we establish and put Irish names on to promote the use of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the function of the companies we are discussing will not be the restoration of Irish as a spoken language but the provision of an efficient and effective public transport system.  At the same time it is a bit of nonsense to think that we are doing anything worthwhile for the aim of restoring the language by putting a name on the company which in Irish may not mean anything to 90 per cent of the population.  To me as <Col N="485" /> a young boy CIE did not mean Córas Iompair Éireann but Crush In Everybody. At that time CIE simply meant the buses.</P>
    <P>I do not have any objection to the names of companies being in Irish but if we do that we are not doing anything except codding ourselves.</P>

      <P>I accept the suggestion made by Deputy Wilson that there should be an Irish name.  I do not agree with the point made by Deputy de Rossa.  There is great value in having Irish names for our companies. This retains for the future something distinctive and gives to our administrative machinery, and the public service, a distinctive Irish flavour which is useful.  I would extend that principle to include streets.  I do not see why we should have two names for streets.  Why do we not have just one Irish name for streets and areas in the country?  By extending the Irish language in that way we are bringing it into greater use.  It ensures that there will be more use made of the language at no great inconvenience to those who may have difficulty in learning it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take on board the suggestions put forward by Deputy Wilson.  I received letters from Conradh na Gaeilge and Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, in which several suggestions were made. The letters arose from my invitation to those organisations to put forward their views.  The Seanad at my suggestion adopted a provision which will allow me change the names of the companies by order and it is definitely preferable that we should leave the matter like that because we will have more time to think about the titles of the companies before they are set up.  Many names have been suggested such as Éire Ráil, An Ráil, Ráil Línte, Ráil Éireann, An Tréan, Bus Línte, Bus Línte Átha Cliath, Bus Línte Éireann, Bus Cúrsa and Bus Náisiúnta. <Col N="486" /> The title An Ráil has a certain make-up dimension about it.  Certainly, it was not a word that was in my Irish vocabularly when I was going to school but I accept that the language is taking on new words all the time.  In fact, an carr was not in the Irish vocabularly but my children use that word instead of gluaisteán.  In my view it is better to leave the provision as it is because it will give us more time to consider the titles of the company later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said in the Seanad and that he sought advice on names.  I am not sure that if we chose Ráil Éireann there might be confusion between another well run national institution.  I disagree with what Deputy De Rossa said.  In introducing the amendment it was not my intention to genuflect towards any institution, any philosophy or any language.  I introduced the amendment because I felt we should make the change.  It is easy to ridicule the idea and say we are only just nodding in the general direction.  I disagree with what Deputy De Rossa said about CIE. I know top officials in CIE who are very committed to the use of the Irish language. Those people write about the language in journals and magazines.  From the beginning transport companies here indicated their general interest in the Irish language.  The late Dr. Andrews who was head of that company had a cultural, economic and political commitment to the area of our national life and he tried to promote the use of the Irish language not by way of genuflection but by indicating his philosophy.  He was a republican, an economic nationalist who was committed culturally to the best that came from Ireland by way of literature and so on in the Irish language.  As far as I am concerned this is not just window dressing.  I do not want to exaggerate the section.  As the amendments are being taken <i>seriatim</i> I thought it better to bring this point in under amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I do not wish to be misunderstood.  I would much prefer that there would be a single name than to have an English version of the Irish name or, rather, to have the name in the English language or to have it in the Irish language.  That would be far preferable &mdash; something along the lines of Aer Lingus and Busarus.  My point was not meant to be offensive to Deputy Wilson in any way.</P>
      <P>In general, I think we are conning ourselves that we are promoting the cause of Irish as a spoken language.  We tend to genuflect in the direction of Irish and say it is something we would like to achieve and we stick an Irish name on something, or introduce and end our speeches with a few words of Irish.  We think that in that way we are serving the cause of its restoration.  That will not restore the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency people attempted for years to establish an all-Irish school but they got nothing but obstruction and piffle from the Department of Education who we are told, are the front line in the promotion of Irish and developing the language.  It was only after many years of hard struggle, of lobbying and fighting, that the people in Ballymun managed to get their Irish school.  That school, in a working class area, is now thriving.  They got the school not because the Minister of the day thought it was a good idea but because a general election was imminent; promises were flying, and it was a good promise to make.  The people there are promoting Irish as a spoken language and are now trying to get a pobal scoil, a second-level ceárd scoil in the area but they are being told, &ldquo;No, you cannot have that&rdquo;.  I will not use the term I would <Col N="488" /> like to use, but I tend to get fed up with genuflections, sticking Irish names on this and that.  When ordinary people in an effort to promote the language try to educate their children in Irish they get nothing but obstacles, being told they do not know what they are about or what they need.</P>

I make a final appeal to the Minister to accept the substance of the amendments before us for the reasons I gave, in particular because the people who are involved on the ground are convinced that from the point of view of giving a service to the people, of efficiency, of giving value for money to the taxpayers, and of the general management structure, two companies would be better than three.</P>
      <P>I have stated, and I have not got any indication that the unions or Congress were worried about this, that the structure proposed in the Bill would put too heavy a burden in the wrong way.  I did not think you could burden a board charged with the running of CIE heavily enough, but we are here, through minor details, putting a burden on them which they should not be asked to bear, though the Minister made a gesture in the Seanad to provide machinery for resolving difficulties when he amended the Bill to include a majority of directors from one company on the other company's board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the arguments which were put forward in favour of the amendment to section 6 did not prevail in the House.  I hope the explanations the Minister has given will in effect come true with regard to the structure and running of the company.  We have put on the record of the House our own reservations with regard to that point.  The one area that has not been teased out, discussed or met as far as I am concerned by the Minister is the one with regard to the functions of the parent board.  We should now and through the remainder of the debate address ourselves to this problem of what by implication is being imposed on a parent board who by definition should be concerned with policy and the overall running of the company.</P>
      <P>I know I am not alone in thinking this will cause trouble in the future.  With regard to the other arguments, I have given my own arguments buttressed by arguments from the ICTU, the National Association of Transport Employees, the Transport Services Staff Association and other unions involved in CIE.  I thought the weight of the arguments might have borne fruit, but I want to say finally on this section that I am still not convinced we have had any teasing out about the problem which the parent board will have if they have to settle disputes about accommodation, booking etc. in Schull and Ballydehob as well as trying to lay down a general policy for CIE.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (10), line 23, after &ldquo;winding up&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and unless the Minister and the Board have had consultations with the recognised trade unions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (10) states that a resolution for the voluntary winding up of a company shall not be adopted unless resolutions have been passed by each House of the Oireachtas consenting to such winding up.  I put forward this amendment because the procedure of winding up one of the three companies being set up under the Bill is a serious move and could cause a problem.  While the House should clearly have a say in the winding up of a company, the staff of the company should be consulted on the matter.  It is conceivable that, even though there are staff representatives on the board, a decision could be made by a majority of the members in opposition to the views of the worker directors.  Therefore, there is a need for a specific section in the Bill requiring the Minister and the board to have consultations with the recognised trade unions before such a serious step is contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is superfluous as the Bill provides that if any such closure takes place the services of the company and the employment of the transferred workers would automatically revert to the board.  The workers are fully protected if any of the companies is wound up.  The section says that no voluntary winding up should take place without the prior approval of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  In any event, if a motion <Col N="497" /> to that effect was tabled in both Houses, it would be comprehensively aired.</P>

Statutory format does not allow for flexibility because it is bound by law whereas, in a company format, you can change the memorandum and articles of association. We wanted a company format as is the case with Telecom Éireann and An Post and at the same time we want to provide the maximum protection for workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will comment on the view that the Irish Sea is the most radioactive stretch of water in the world; if he will express clearly his concern at this issue and outline the action he proposes to take in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of discharges from Sellafield, the Irish Sea has a higher level of radioactive contamination than any other sea. However it must be emphasised that the levels are extremely small in so far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been confirmed by the ongoing monitor programme carried out by <Col N="498" /> the Nuclear Energy Board and the universities to measure levels of radioactivity in the Irish Sea.  This programme includes the regular testing of sea-water, seaweed, sediment, fish and shellfish collected from the Irish Sea and the Irish coastline.  The results of these programmes show that for the average consumer of seafood the dose would be less than 1 per cent of the European Community dose limit for members of the public.  The Nuclear Energy Board have advised that such doses are negligible and do not represent a significant health hazard.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, every opportunity has been taken to express to the UK Authorities the Government's concern about radioactive discharges from Sellafield. The Government are totally opposed to any discharge of radioactive waste from Sellafield into the Irish Sea and want to see these discharges minimised and eliminated as soon as possible using the best available technology.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the frequency of incidents at Sellafield has caused a loss of confidence in the operation of the plant. The view of the Government is that this is an international rather than a bilateral issue and that it should be resolved under the provisions of the Euratom Treaty. The Government consider that a European Health and Safety Inspection Force is necessary to assess the safety of nuclear installations generally.  Such a force could assess independently whether Sellafield can operate safely or whether operations should be suspended or cease until it could be rendered safe.  The Government are vigorously pursuing the question of such a force at European level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state clearly the Government's fundamental opposition to the principle of dumping waste of a toxic or radioactive nature into the Irish Sea?  I gather that there are some nine establishments in Britain from which such waste is discharged.  Secondly, will the Minister undertake to galvanise some form of international diplomatic initiative to bring pressure on the British Government to cease this dumping as a <Col N="499" /> matter of principle unacceptable to the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became Minister for Energy and prior to that as Minister for the Environment I took an interest in all matters relating to the environment and to radioactive effluent.  The matter has been raised at numerous bilateral meetings with British Ministers and at Council level in Europe.  I can assure the Deputy that it is the determined and considered policy of the Government to ensure as soon as is both practicable and possible the elimination of radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea or any other of our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister's reply that he still pins his hopes on European action.  Does the Minister think that there is any possibility of having a suitable and effective inspection machinery instituted by the Community? Would he not agree that the possibility of getting anything of that nature into operation is very slight or has there been some change in the situation recently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much a change in the situation as that the Government and I on behalf of the Government initiated a procedure at European Council level.  A number of meetings have taken place in this regard and the commissioner with responsibility has visited this country for meetings to hear our concerns at first-hand.  The position is that the matter is for discussion at ministerial level.  Not only is the method which the Government have pursued as a matter of policy the best possible method but also it has the best prospect of providing the solution we are seeking.  Notwithstanding the fact that there are some countries in Europe which obviously have a large reliance on nuclear installations who would have their objections to the nuclear inspectorate, this is the best method and we shall be able to get agreement from our partners to establish under the Euratom Treaty a nuclear inspection force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that what is being sought in the question and what is the request of most people in this country is not a force to monitor continuing discharges which inevitably by their nature will increase the level of radioactivity but a principled decision that dumping dangerous waste into the sea anywhere, particularly the Irish Sea, is fundamentally wrong and not the way to do business?  In view of the Minister's repeated appeals, requests and supplications over many years which have apparently fallen on deaf ears would the Minister now propose some form of determined action by a European forum to have this dumping ceased?  We are not interested in having it monitored; we want it stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy even in his short period as Minister of State is aware that we have certain powers conferred on us as both Ministers and Ministers of State and, indeed, as Governments.  The nuclear installations the Deputy is referring to are located in Britain.  Britain, as the Deputy is well aware, is a sovereign state just like we in the 26 Counties are a sovereign state and I have to say to him that if he has any ideas in relation to how we can determine that the British Government should close plants which are the property of various companies within Britain I should gladly listen to them.  The position at present is that we have made the case at bilateral meetings and at European Council level. We shall continue to do so in an effort to end the discharges of radioactive materials into the Irish Sea.  We shall continue to do that to the best of our ability but we must recognise that it is a matter for another sovereign Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be a little premature if I were to give at this stage my personal views on cutaway bogs, important as they might be to Deputy Reynolds. One of the options I favour is forestry but that is not seen as the most economic prospect for cutaway bogs.  As I said, any personal views I might mention might be previous to the report.  The report, when published will be of interest to this House and to the many people interested in cutaway bogs, both the horticultural and forestry sectors.  When the report is published, a discussion should take place in this House.  This would be of enormous value because in the medium term we will have a natural resource which we would do well to evaluate and to bring to the development stage.  I would have no hesitation in having a discussion on the report in this House at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the acreage of cutaway bogs that is and will become available before the end of the decade? I am glad the Minister and I at least agree on something, because we are thinking in the same direction as regards the proper use of cutaway bogs for forestry. Will he agree that the sooner this problem is tackled the better.  Will he also agree that Bord na Móna will have to remain the landlord &mdash; that dirty word in Irish society &mdash; of the bogs because of the drainage problems that would arise if the bogs are given willy-nilly to farmers or anybody else?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>By 1990 there will be about 10,00 acres of cutaway bogs available for development and it is believed that figure will double, at least, by the end of the century.  The cut-away bogs consist of a wide variety and complexity of peat types, peat depth, sub-soil type and degree of drainage which would have a major bearing on future uses.  It is likely there will be different solutions for different areas, and I am sure the Deputy understands that well.  I would say &mdash; and this is a matter I have neither studied nor gone into in depth &mdash; that it would be most likely that in the long term Bord <Col N="505" /> na Móna would continue as at present, primarily because of the drainage involved and the manner in which they have carried out their responsibilities on behalf of the State down the years.  I see Bord na Móna having a major role to play in the development of cutaway bogs.</P>

      <P>Exploration is taking place at Galmoy under a prospecting licence granted by my Department.  There have been encouraging results from prospecting in the area but I am unable to make a detailed statement in the matter because information furnished by prospecting companies is treated as confidential by my Department during the currency of the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a report from the Geological Survey on the possibility of viable coal deposits in the Kish Bank basin.  The Geological Survey are currently completing their preparation of a document drawing together all the departmental material on hand on the subject.  It is my intention to publicise the availability of this material shortly and to indicate my Department's <Col N="506" /> readiness to consider applications for exploration facilities in the area.</P>
    <P>The amount of information available at present on the coal resources in the basin is too limited to arrive at any firm conclusions at this stage on their commercial mining potential.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of press reports that there has been a significant coal find in the Kish area.  Has there been any discussion on or thought given to how such a find might be developed?  Will he indicate that it is his intention to ensure that the State retains control of any such finds, and that he does not permit cowboy companies to come in and rip it out and leave the State without anything?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very wary of cowboys, as I have been in the past and I intend to be in the future.  It would be premature to attempt to have any discussion on this at present.  Soon a report will be available to the House and to anybody concerned about coal deposits in the Kish Bank basin, which I hope to have published before Christmas. At that stage a discussion could take place.  The Deputy is aware of my own political and personal views on the development of natural resources, and if <Col N="507" /> the State is in a position to develop these resources I would like to see it doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the discovery of large coal deposits in the Irish Sea was made a number of years ago? In what year were the Government first made aware of these coal deposits?  What have the Department been doing in the meantime to see how these deposits could be exploited for the benefit of the Irish people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to me is that it was in 1982 that a company called British Mining Consultants &mdash; as part of a study of the Irish onshore and offshore coal resources &mdash; produced a report on the Irish offshore.  My Department would have been examining the technical aspects of that report in relation to the development of offshore coal, which is something we have not done in the past to my knowledge.  Obviously they would have had discussions with people with technical experience and ability in this area.  Any discussions in relation to the long term prospects and so on would be far more constructive when the report of the Geological Survey Office is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness a historical question was not asked in relation to when there might have been indications of coal in the Irish offshore area.  The information available to me is that there was a study undertaken in 1982 by British Mining Consultants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's answer most unsatisfactory.  It seems to indicate a lackadaisical approach on his part and that of his Department with regard to steps I believe they should have taken to exploit this resource at a much <Col N="508" /> earlier stage.  I understand that the Minister's Department have been aware of this since the late seventies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a certain amount of study has been undertaken on that aspect but it is early days yet to examine the total technological possibilities of this find.  For the benefit of the House I should say that in June 1981 the then Minister for Energy directed the Geological Survey Office to carry out a feasibility study and their report will be published before Christmas.</P>

I am quite satisfied that the procedures agreed between my Department and the various mining <Col N="509" /> companies are satisfactory and reasonably up-to-date.  I am sure the Deputy will recall from his own days in the Department of Energy that there is a very important question of confidentiality involved during the currency of the licence, and that all of this information becomes public in due course.  I am quite satisfied, both from the point of view of confidentiality and of information being passed to my Department, that I am getting adequate and up-to-date information.</P>

As Minister responsible for this area can he give the House an assurance that there are no deals being done with companies for the extraction of any deposits that may be there which would leave the State unable to gain revenue from them or ensure the best use of the coal for the <Col N="510" /> benefit of industry and so on in this country?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware of the detailed statements which I made in April 1985 and in September of this year concerning the Irish Offshore Exploration Licensing Terms of 1975. From these it will be clear what is my policy in regard to further oil and gas exploration in the Irish Offshore.</P>
      <P>I presume Deputy Mac Giolla is referring to my recent statement of 19 September 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware our terms have to be sufficiently attractive to induce people in to explore and develop, and <Col N="511" /> sufficiently firm to ensure a fair share of any resulting revenues for the State.  They have to be competitive with those of other nations, especially when there is less exploration money to go around, and they have to reflect the realities of the day.  Given the radical change in circumstances today and in the light of my responsibility as Minister for Energy to encourage the ongoing exploration of our offshore with a view to bringing oil or gas ashore to meet national requirements, I decided that it was incumbent on me to bring forward the new adjustments. There can be no benefits to this country if activity in our offshore is not encouraged.</P>
    <P>I believe the 1986 adjustments to the 1975 offshore licensing terms have struck the right balance between the interests of the State and concerns of the oil companies.</P>
    <P>My policy in regard to further oil and gas exploration is already enunciated in these statements to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>My plans are to continue to consider all the avenues open to me for promoting exploration of the Irish offshore. More specifically at present my Department are carrying out analyses of technical data and are preparing technical reports on the offshore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the Minister's September statement and seeking some clarification of the changes that have been made.  I should like to pose two specific questions to the Minister: first is the 50 per cent stake option we had now definitely gone &mdash; referring to the September statement?  The Minister will understand how complicated this has become because, in less than two years, there have been three changes and it is very difficult to keep up-to-date.  My second question is: does the definition of a marginal field &mdash; referring to the April 1985 statement &mdash; of 75 million barrels still stand when he refers to a marginal field in his September statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy <Col N="512" /> wanting clarification.  I am rather surprised that he has not asked for detailed, written clarification if he has some technical problems with the terms as announced and adjusted over the last two years.  I would have no hesitation in supplying him with any clarification in writing of any concerns he has in relation to the whole of the offshore area.  The Deputy will understand &mdash; I have no difficulty in saying this to him &mdash; that the whole question of the offshore licensing terms is a highly complex one.  If the Deputy so wishes, I will outline, in writing, all of the changes, or clarify any aspects of the statements with which he has difficulty.</P>

      <P>I should be very glad to receive that.  Perhaps the Minister would reply to the two simple questions I posed, that is if the 50 per cent stake option has now gone and if the marginal field is still a 75 million barrell field? I want to know, before asking another question, if that is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes in relation to the 50 per cent option.  That will no longer persist.  The 75 million barrel field is considered to be a marginal field.  A lot will depend on the options available which the companies decide to exercise.  They may decide to remain within the clarifications offered in 1985 or they may wish to operate within the clarification of 1986.  That is a matter for discussion between the company and the Department of Energy when discussing any proposals to develop a find.</P>

      <P>Each time there is <Col N="513" /> a statement from the Minister the whole position becomes more complicated.  I wish to ask the Minister in regard to the 75 million barrel field if, as has been stated in some newspapers over the past year, the Gulf oil find and other exploration off the Waterford coast have disclosed that it is unlikely there will be one large well, that it is more likely there will be a series of relatively small wells close together?  If this is so, would each of those not be regarded as a marginal field rather than the other type of field to which the Minister referred and where there are large profits?  In other words, the State would only get a 25 per cent share in profits from each of these rather than a 50 per cent share overall.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that I came before the House recently and explained how the funding was made available.

I have no responsibility in the monitoring of such prices.</P>

I should like to add that this is a matter I intend pursuing.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the reasons he felt it necessary to change the exploration licensing terms for the second time; if the changes have resulted in any further commitments to drill new wells under the second and third round; and the number of wells being drilled in 1986 and 1987 under the second and third rounds respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 33 together.  I presume that Deputy Reynolds is referring to the statements which I made in April 1985 and in September of this year concerning the Irish offshore exploration licensing terms of 1975.</P>
      <P>The first of these two statements was intended not to change the 1975 terms but rather to clarify for the oil exploration industry the precise manner in which certain specific provisions of the 1975 terms should be applied in the event of the development of any marginal fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy probably knows &mdash; and I adverted to this in my detailed statement <Col N="523" />&mdash; the 1975 terms provided the Minister for Energy with discretionary powers to reduce the levels of royalty and &ldquo;carried&rdquo; State participation if he was satisfied such measures were necessary in order to enable a marginal field to be developed and at the same time to provide a reasonable return on the expenditure to be incurred by the licence holders to secure such a development.</P>
    <P>For some time prior to my announcement it was alleged both to me and to my Department by exploration companies that lack of certainty as to how I, as Minister for Energy, would actually apply these flexibility provisions at the time of a development was having an inhibiting effect on exploration offshore in that the companies tended to assume in their financial projections the maximum levels of State take and, on that basis, which was the worst scenario for them to assume, particularly in the case of small or marginal fields, their projections did not support the economies for development. The 1985 clarification of the terms, therefore, to meet a particular concern of the oil companies at that time, to that end set out to define a marginal field and set the limits for &ldquo;carried&rdquo; State participation in such a field.</P>
    <P>The actual arrangements which I announced provided for a formula to governing royalites, State participation and carry on the basis of a profitability indicator.</P>
    <P>The formula, as already indicated, applied only to marginal fields where I, as Minister for Energy, was satisfied that no other opportunity remained to enhance the profitability of the project. The new arrangement, designed to remove uncertainty as to how the discretion allowed to the Minister by the 1975 terms would be applied in practice, facilitated the more competitive and better endowed companies in committing the funds to exploration while at the same time it safeguarded the State's entitlement to a fair share of revenues from a developed field.  It should be noted that at that time oil prices ranged between $28 and $30 a barrel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> In my statement of 19 September last announcing adjustments to the 1975 terms, I pointed out that prices were then hovering between $10 and $15 a barrel, that is, at about half of the price levels of last year, and were likely to remain so for the immediate future.  As oil company revenues fell, exploration budgets generally were cut significantly, even in regions where oil reserves are well established.</P>
    <P>Three main factors influence the exploration companies to invest exploration funds in any area.  These are:</P>
    <P>(i)  the perceived geology of the area;</P>
    <P>(ii)  market price of oil and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the licensing terms prevailing in the area.</P>
    <P>Of these, the only one which we can control ourselves is the licensing terms. Against the background of sharply falling oil prices and exploration expenditure cutbacks I had to ensure that our terms continued to be sufficiently attractive to invite people in to explore and develop, and sufficiently firm to ensure a fair share of that development for us, the people who own the oil.  Our terms have to be competitive with those of other nations, especially when there is less exploration money to go around, and they have to reflect the realities of the day &mdash; a discovery considered valuable when oil is scarce and expensive will be seen as less worth while when oil is plentiful and cheap.</P>
    <P>Exploration companies, for their part, when calculating the return expected from a development, assume that the State will take the maximum possible.  As our terms specified a 50 per cent level of participation as a discretionary maximum they made the assumption, for the purpose of their own calculation of costs and benefits, that this is the actual figure they would have to pay.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, but principally because the dramatic fall in the value of oil has led to a very significant worldwide decline in exploration, I decided to bring forward the new schemes which I announced last September.  They clearly <Col N="525" /> represent a significant development of the 1975 terms and are designed to take account of the realities I have mentioned. I will be pleased to let the Deputy have copies of the detailed statements in question if he so wishes.</P>
    <P>While seven wells have been completed offshore Ireland in 1986, it is not possible at this stage to be precise about the level of drilling in 1987.  One further well is scheduled for drilling before the end of this year.  Of the wells completed to date in 1986 none arose under third round licences while two were obligation wells under second round licences.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year there were expectations that another two wells would be drilled in 1986 under third round licences but the contractual obligations under those licences do not arise until 1987 and there is no doubt that market conditions strongly influenced decisions not to drill them in 1986.</P>
    <P>In accordance with specific obligations under particular licences, three contractual wells as a minimum are listed for 1987.  Two of these wells arise under third round licences and one under a second round licence.  There is also the possibility that further drilling commitments will arise consequent on the September 1986 terms announcement.  While the general reaction of the oil industry to the new terms so far has been positive, it is too soon to say what new drilling commitments will result.  Companies clearly must analyse the adjustments before they can take them into account in their constrained budgetary allocations of exploration funds.  I hope for a positive response from the industry.</P>
    <P>The extent to which our terms now are competitive cannot be precisely determined because of many different features embodied in other countries' terms.  The view of my Department is that they are now competitive with terms obtaining in other north-west European countries apart from the UK terms for small fields.</P>
    <P>I believe the 1986 adjustments to the 1975 offshore licensing terms have struck the right balance between the interests of <Col N="526" /> the State and the concerns of the oil companies, one of the main objects in designing these provisions was to have a formula which gave due recognition to the present difficult realities of the exploration market which we cannot ignore and, at the same time, ensures a commensurately higher return to the State when the market improves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his lengthy reply.  Will he say briefly if there have been commercial activities over and above that which had been taking place before his clarification of the terms?  Am I right in interpreting his reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement was made in September and it would take the oil companies months to prepare their budgets.  The timing was made with that in mind.  I had information to suggest &mdash; it is normal commercial practice &mdash; that the oil companies would be making presentations to their boards on a worldwide basis and lodging claims for exploration funds.  It is too soon to see the impact of the clarification issued in September.  I was careful to make the details as clear as possible because it is in the best interests of everybody to understand the complexities of the oil industry not just here but internationally.  I believe that in 1987 we will see a heightening of exploration activity as a direct result of the clarification in September.  I would point out that we are a very small part of the world exploration scene.  The Deputy will be aware from documents available of the cutbacks that have taken place by exploration companies.  Even the very largest companies, the most economically sound ones, in oil exploration and development have been making enormous cutbacks in monetary and personnel terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that when he brought out his third licensing round it was a long time before there was any talk of a reduction in oil prices? Does he accept the third licensing round was a failure and that not one well has been drilled, only two being talked about <Col N="527" /> for 1987, as a result?  Does he agree that the clarification of the 1975 terms, as I told him time and again, were far removed from what the industry required to keep to the level of drilling that had been going on here?  The Minister came with too little, too late.  He missed the boat in relation to oil investment here.  If he had announced terms when he was asked to do it, the level of activity would have been maintained.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that when he said to this House on 22 October that if the Dublin Gas Company went out of business the banks would lose their money, he was misleading the House?  That letter clearly gives the banks a blank cheque in relation to Dublin Gas and it is absolute.  Why was this letter not produced last June or July when I asked for it?  Why have I to ask three or four times, and why is it only in the final analysis that it comes in when other political pressure has blown off? The House has been misled.  I want to ask the Chair's guidance as to whether I am in order in asking the Minister to make a personal explanation to this House in regard to the serious manner in which he has misled it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to nationalise Dublin Gas was taken by the Government in April 1986 and I refer the Deputy to the Government statement issued on 22 April 1986.  As to the action taken since then the receiver embarked on a programme of reorganisation of the workforce and of operations as a necessary first step to the return to viability of the company, and this programme has been substantially realised.</P>
      <P>As to the method of nationalisation, I hope to make a statement on this at a very early date.</P>
      <P>As to part (4) of the question, Dublin Gas Company, as an unregistered company, are subject only to certain provisions of the Companies Act.</P>

      <P>So the normal procedure does not apply in relation to what can and cannot be done with them?  Why did the Minister not reappoint his own appointed chairman and four directors of the Dublin Gas Company when they resigned?  For whatever reasons they resigned, obviously they were not in agreement with what was happening. Why did they resign?  Why did the Minister not replace them to keep his strength in the board of directors of Dublin Gas? Maybe by so doing he would have stemmed the decisions taken recently that could land the whole company in the High Court looking for liquidation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of reap-pointing directors to the Dublin Gas Company is the responsibility of the Minister for Energy.  I made a decision not to reappoint directors on the receiver being put <i>in situ</i> by BGE.

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that where any of the companies proposed under this new Bill are about to be wound up which under the section will require resolutions of this House to do so, there will be a mandatory requirement on the company to consult also with the recognised trade unions in the company affected.  In responding to that amendment the Minister seemed to misunderstand the purpose of the amendment.  It is a requirement to consult with the recognised trade unions.  The Minister in response suggested that this would in some way affect the flexibility of the company in responding to market conditions and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that if a company is about to be wound up the question of them responding to market conditions or otherwise is no longer an issue.  What is at issue is the reasons for the wind up, the question as to whether the staff involved are adequately briefed about <Col N="576" /> what is happening, the reasons for it to have happened and that there is full agreement from the staff about the course of action which it is proposed to take.  That is the purpose of the amendment and it is not intended to in any way shackle the company in their day to day activities.  If the winding up of a company is important enough to have it brought before this House, it is equally important that the staff employed by the company should be consulted about the proposed move.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 12 to 16, to delete subsection (9).</P>
      <P>Section 8 relates to competition between services of the companies and provides that the companies shall have regard to the overall interest of the board and in any conflict between the companies the board shall decide the issue with due regard to its overall interest and the interest of the particular companies concerned. This section is obviously the result of unease with regard to competition as between the various companies and specifically between the national bus company and the national rail company.  The very fact that it is in here is an admission that this may be an area of difficulty.  The Minister said that he wants an element of competition but that that would be moderated and monitored by the board.  I presume that the amendments accepted about the participation of directors across the company, the mutual sharing of directors, was also an attempt to meet the case that there could be competition which would not be to the advantage of either one or other company or the board of CIE.  The reason I asked for the deletion, although I can see why the Chair ruled that it would not be taken with the other amendments, was in the context of having suggested that there would be one company covering national rail and bus.  If there were one company then this element of competition would not occur.  I still think that the original suggestion was a sound one and that asking for this deletion was logical in the context of that sound proposal.</P>

      <P>Section 8 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>8.&mdash;(1) The principal object of Iarnróad Éireann-Irish Rail shall be stated in its memorandum of association to be to provide, within the State and between the State and places outside the State, a railway service and a road freight service and for those purposes to exercise functions in that behalf conferred on the Board by the Act of 1950 or any other enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage we referred to the position with regard to freight and the Minister assured us, although some experts in that field whom I have consulted since are not inclined to accept it, that the freight services had been justified by making a profit.  I presume that the principal object of the railways company would be also to provide extra rail services if it were so decided and we would not exclude development of the rail service. Yesterday's post brought to me an account of the new rail service to a very run down and dilapidated part of the London harbour and port area, the Isle of Dogs and the area around there, where they are going to run a new train service which will not have any drivers.  There may be one conductor on the train, but it will be a totally automated service. While they know that at the moment there is not a very heavy population in the area they have a feeling that the availability of this service will increase the population of that area.  Just as is happening with the DART where house values have risen because of the existence of this service close at hand.  I presume that the articles of association will be so framed that the railway people will be <Col N="579" /> empowered to think of such developments.</P>
    <P>I read from one of the trade union documents an indication that the Minister had said that he had intended to develop a rail service to Tallaght and other places, but this was by way of a preelection policy document and for some reason or another we have not seen anything on the ground since then with regard to it.  The Minister may have changed his mind on that.  Section 8 (2) says:</P>
    <P>(2) The principal object of Bus Éireann-Irish Bus shall be stated in its memorandum of association to be to provide,</P>
    <P>I do not like the English language there. It is not a solecism but it is a very awkward phrase.  The subsection goes on:</P>
    <P>within the State and between the State and places outside the State, a passenger service by road, except in so far as such a service is provided by Bus Átha Cliath-Dublin Bus, and to provide ancillary services and for those purposes to exercise functions in that behalf conferred on the Board by the Act of 1950 or any other enactment.</P>
    <P>The memorandum of association should keep a developmental role in mind.  We have been conditioned for practical reasons to think of restricting services, of cutting down rather than developing.  I would urge the Minister in his communications with the companies to keep that in mind.  The Dublin bus company could be made into a commercially viable profitable service and this will demand a parting of the ways with rigid thinking and the idea that double deckers should be on various routes at all times of the day.  Flexibility in planning and in the use of vehicles should be taken into account. I mentioned places in Europe where a mini bus service is made available in off-peak hours or between awkward points which are not on direct routes.  The present bus services are on the same routes as the Dublin train routes with extensions demanded by the expansion <Col N="580" /> of the city boundaries.  If the Dublin city services were properly organised with a good traffic management system, in conjunction with the Dublin Transport Authority and further areas pedestrianised, we should and could have a profitable company which would do a lot for CIE's prestige.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
    <P>There may be included among the objects of each company such other functions of the Board as may be approved by the Board with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall prevent or restrict the inclusion among the objects of a company as stated in its memorandum of association of all such objects and powers as are proper for or incidental or ancillary to the due attainment of the objects aforesaid.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) states:</P>
    <P>Each of the companies shall have power to do anything which appears to it to be requisite, advantageous or incidental to or which appears to it to facilitate the achievement by it or any of its objects as specified in this Act or in its memorandum of association and is not inconsistent with any enactment for the time being in force.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) states:</P>
    <P>Where any function of the Board is, by virtue of this Act, a function of a company every provision of any enactment relating to the Board shall, in respect of that function and subject to the provisions of this Act, apply to the company as it applies to the Board.</P>
    <P>That is a logical subsection to give powers to the new companies in relation to the board.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) states:</P>
    <P>Each company shall undertake the functions assigned to it by virtue of this Act in compliance with such directions <Col N="581" /> as the Board may give to the company in writing from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have already commented on subsection (9).</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) states:</P>
    <P>The Board and the companies shall have due regard to the Board's social role and the need to maintain public transport services integrated to the maximum extent possible within the financial resources available to them.</P>
    <P>The amendments which this side of the House and Deputy De Rossa put down in regard to subsection (10) would guarantee the integration to a much greater extent than will three separate companies, specifically two separate companies for rail and bus services.  This House is particularly interested in the board's social role because in 1985, as has been repeated over and over again, it voted £115 million to CIE and that was categorised as the social price we pay for services throughout the country.  It was a substantial sum and when we are taking the amendment dealing with transparency I should like the House to have the maximum amount of knowledge in regard to where this subsidy goes.</P>

      <P>Nothing in the Bill will preclude the possibility of future extensions of the railways.  The extension of DART is a priority for consideration by the newly formed Dublin Transport Authority and I expect they will make recommendations to me within the next year.  This section provides that the principal object of the railway company should be to run a rail service and that the principal object of the city bus services is to run a service for the city.  However, it allows other objects to be added because I am very keen to exploit the fantastic human and property assets of the company to enable them to participate in other business opportunities so that there might be profits to offset the calls of the Exchequer as was successfully executed <Col N="582" /> by other State companies like Aer Lingus.</P>

I thought on account of the strong proposals made in support of the two company solution from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other individual unions involved in the running of CIE, that this would have commanded support.  I am not speaking in a political sense but it is hard to understand why we could not agree on the two company solution.  It may very well be that in the future we may have to revert to that position by way of amendment to the Act.  I do not know what the result of separating the three companies will be but if the problems I mentioned arise and if they prove too much for the parent board the House eventually may have to adopt it as a solution to the problem.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 16 and 17, to delete subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to explain that this amendment was put down in the context of my earlier amendments for two companies. The logical step was then to delete subsection (4).  Having said that it was a clever amendment which was accepted by the Seanad.  It linked in with the problems we have mentioned already while talking on section 8 (9), the problems of coordinating and integrating services for the rail and bus.  I would like to commend the Minister and/or his advisers, the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad, the <Col N="584" /> Labour Party in the Seanad, the trade union representatives or whoever thought this one up to improve the Bill in the context of three companies.  If we could not have two companies then the idea that the majority of directors of the railway company and the Irish bus company shall be common to both companies does go a good bit of the way to solving it.</P>
    <P>From reading the debate in the Seanad I know that certain people thought there could be trouble about a majority because the number of directors is small. There are worker directors.  This can cause a certain amount of trouble with regard to coming to decisions later on.  I am sure that danger is there.  It is my hope now, having lost the game so to speak in the two votes we have had, that there would not be a paralysis in making decisions or in deciding on policies.  There will be a majority of the directors in the railway company and in the Irish bus company who will share this majority of directors, so at least, there is a forum below the parent board in which certain problems can be thrashed out.  Admittedly, the board will finally have to decide on what policies are to be pursued or what piece of property will be allocated to which company and so on.  It means, of course, that if they cannot come to a decision it will be referred back to the board when this load will be put on them. I do not think that this load should be on the board.  The more problems which are solved at that level the better for the future running of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 132 states:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Acts, no alteration in the memorandum, of association or articles of association of a company shall be valid or effectual unless made with the prior approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance and, where appropriate, the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
      <P>It is in that context that we have been talking.  Obviously, the Companies Acts would normally empower an alteration in the memorandum of association in the case of an ordinary company.  This is a caveat section to give the Minister the power, in collusion with the Minister for Finance and at times with the Minister for the Public Service, to see to it that the companies do not go haywire in any particular way.  I am always suspicious of people who prepare the heads of the Bills and those in Government who finally decide on sections such as this, because the purpose is to make it more cosy for the Minister and for administration.  I suppose it is a necessary safeguard.  If we take it that the people who will be appointed to the boards are committed to the development of the company and to the provision of the type of service the company are supposed to give, we could take it for granted they will not go haywire and alter the memorandum of association or the articles of association in such a way as would damage the company or the country.</P>
      <P>I have no further comment to make except that we are inclined to be cautious. People who are involved in legislation will always tell you that you cannot be too cautious because if any loopholes are left they will be taken advantage of eventually.  I will continue to look with scepticism at everything which arrogates extra power to the Administration or to a Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is an improvement on the position we used to have and about which I used to be a little sensitive. Section 13 subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>Where a director of a company is&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, or</P>
      <P>(b) elected as a member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities, or</P>
      <P>(c) regarded pursuant to section 15 (inserted by the European Assembly Elections Act, 1984) of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977, as having being elected to such an Assembly to fill a vacancy,</P>
      <P>he shall thereupon cease to be a director of the company.</P>
      <P>On balance over the years, I have changed my views.  I have spoken in this House on occasion against this whole trend on the basis that it was giving some kind of credence to people who thought actual participation in politics and membership of this House in some way impaired their judgment, their impartiality or their capability of making a contribution to a particular company.  I would like to repudiate that kind of suggestion, and the suggestion is there.</P>
      <P>Over the years I have come to the conclusion that it is probably better if Members are excluded, but there is a distinction here between a director and an employee.  Before I deal with that, I want to look as section 13 (1) (a) which says &ldquo;nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann&rdquo;.  In my opinion, a nomination is not enough to preclude a person from directorship.</P>

      <P>I suppose I must leave it at that, but I want to underline what I have said already about this type of thing.  The fact that the person participates, or gets elected to Seanad Éireann, to Dáil Éireann or to the European Assembly, in my opinion should not be taken as impairing him in such a way.  I have an idea that at one time even nomination to contest Seanad elections precluded a person from membership of certain boards and committees.  I shall maintain opposition to that.</P>
      <P>As everybody knows, there are a series of nominating bodies.  If the royal association of organ-grinders nominate somebody he has not a hope of being elected to the Seanad, but some legislation precludes him.  The distinction here between director and employee is valid.  I am glad to see the Minister has made provision for secondment.  Is that right?</P>

      <P>I wonder if that is a new development in legislation or if it has been in existence for some time? However, I welcome it because it is a <Col N="588" /> good idea and secondment gets over what is in my opinion, an injustice.  Section 13 (3) reads:</P>
      <P>A person who is for the time being entitled under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas to sit therein or who is a member of the Assembly of the European Communities shall, while he is so entitled or is such a member, be disqualified from becoming a director of or from employment in any capacity by a company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section.  The intent of this section is to give all the necessary guarantees and assurances to the staff about their position in the future, that is, the staff who are at present employees of the board who will be transfered to any one of the companies.  It also requires each of the companies to set up the necessary industrial relations machinery for consultation with the registered trade unions.  It also provides that where any of the companies is wound up, the employees transferred on vesting day would be transferred back automatically to the employment of the board as if their employment had not been interrupted and the responsibility for the services provided by the wound-up company reverts back to the board.  It also provides that the employees, for the purposes of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, shall be <Col N="589" /> deemed to be employees of the entire group of companies.  This underlines the unity of the group of companies and the very firm intention that they remain so.</P>
      <P>Many of these provisions are routine for State companies and in large measure are based on the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act introduced by Deputy Wilson.  Some of the provisions in the section were proposed in the Seanad on Committee Stage following a very useful discussion.  I believe all the employees of the companies will be very gratified by the provisions in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is a very important part of the Bill.  The provisions are designed to put at ease the present employees of CIE.  There are some points I would like the Minister to comment on.  I would like him to comment on the powers of allocation to specific companies; in other words, that each employee of the present CIE will be retained as an employee of one of the companies as and from the vesting day.  What procedure will be adopted by the board? Will they select the individual workers for individual companies?  The words &ldquo;officer or servant&rdquo; are used but objection was taken to them in this House already. &ldquo;Employees&rdquo; would cover both areas and I suppose it is out of deference to terms that have been used in legislation for some time that they are used here.  What is the position of those people in CIE at the moment who are designated to work in one of the three companies &mdash; and it seems from the voting that there will be three companies &mdash; but who do not want to go there?  How is the problem resolved?  Is there specific machinery under the Bill to try to resolve that difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the reorganisation scheme was announced originally the point was made that there would be 500 to 600 redundancies. Since then, I think the Minister &mdash; and the chairman and chief executive officer of CIE in conversation with me &mdash; indicated that most of those redundancies had occurred already.  I would like the <Col N="590" /> Minister to tell me how many people are affected.  Is there any special machinery or will the general redundancy machinery be operated in this case?</P>
    <P>I want to make another point on the section with regard to conditions.  Subsection (5) reads:</P>
    <P>Save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union concerned, every person who, immediately before the vesting day, is an officer or servant of the Board shall not, while in the service of the Board or a company, as the case may be, receive a lesser scale of pay or be brought to less beneficial conditions of service than the scale of pay to which he was entitled and the conditions of service to which he was subject immediately before the vesting day.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I indicated that there were some things happening which would indicate to me that some persons who immediately before the vesting day are officers or servants of the board will be brought to less than official conditions as a result.  I gather that the chief civil engineer's staff were being summarily transferred from Pearse Street to the former British Railways offices on the North Wall.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on whether this has come to his notice.  This would seem to me to be in conflict with the terms of section 14 and its relevant subsections.  The main points made &mdash; and they are valid ones as far as I can see &mdash; are first, that staff located at Pearse Street would have the services of the DART line at their disposal to take them to and from work.  I do not have to emphasise to the House that that is a very strong and specific advantage, a very beneficial condition of service.  If the words in section 14 mean what they purport to mean, or what is their normal meaning, then that should not happen. It was announced that there would be specific discussions with the trade unions with regard to problems such as this.  The people involved in this case are not unreasonable.  In fact they state that they fully appreciate the difficulty of doing this job of reorganisation within CIE and are <Col N="591" /> ready, able and willing to co-operate in the plan and to be as helpful as possible. I gather that this transfer would involve considerable capital expenditure.  Therefore, before that expenditure is incurred the problem should be resolved.</P>
    <P>I mentioned specifically the advantage of having the DART service right to the office door, so to speak, at Pearse Street, which is a very considerable advantage. Apparently the services to the North Wall are very poor indeed, there is one bus, the 53A, that serves the area.  This is something that should be taken into consideration when relocating a considerable number of staff.  The former British Railways offices are the best part of a mile or more from O'Connell Bridge. Another point about which staff are concerned is safety and security in going to and from their work in that area.  There have been instances of mugging in the area.  I do not want to exaggerate.  In fact I know the area; I know both the North and South Quays.  It is easy to get an exaggerated sense of danger but there have been some incidents in the area which have caused concern to the staff. In general the staff of the chief civil engineers' office feel the new area would not have the same amenity value as the area in which they are at present located.  I do not want to labour that point.  Perhaps the Minister would let me know whether he knows anything about it, whether the problem may have been solved since then, whether the large capital expenditure has already been decided or whether anything is under way in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is that I do not know very much more about the issue than what he said in the House or what I have read in the newspapers.  I think there was a little about it in the newspapers.  I would very much desire that the reorganisation be implemented by the board with the greatest sensitivity.  I am satisfied that that is the way the board are approaching it.  Obviously there will be a number of thorny problems to be resolved.  I would <Col N="592" /> hope they could be resolved with maximum agreement and consultation. However, I should point out that these arrangements of locations within a company like CIE do not just take place at a time of reorganisation like this but all the time when new offices or workshops are being provided and so on.  It is desirable that there be the maximum amount of flexibility among the staff concerned.  I will convey to the chairman of the company the points raised specifically by Deputy Wilson and I hope they can be resolved.  It would be wrong for me, as Minister, to become involved in the detail of who goes where, who does what, or to be a referee.  Nonetheless I will pass on Deputy Wilson's concerns in the matter.</P>

      <P>There is much debate at present about companies going into liquidation and starting up business again under another name.  Some people might think that this smells of the same thing.  I am sure the Minister would like to reassure the House that it does not.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Membership of the main board is not affected in any way by the provisions of this Bill.  But the position of members in relation to the subsidiary companies is provided for, whereby at least two worker-directors of the main board must be members of each of the subsidiary boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not necessarily follow that they have to be the same. What is provided for elsewhere in the Bill is that a majority, in other words four, of the directors will be common to the national bus company and the national rail company.  As it is provided that two worker-directors will be members of the board of the national bus company and the national rail company it is highly likely that they will be the same two <Col N="594" /> people.  It is not certain that it will be the same two people but it is highly probable.</P>

      <P>Section 14 (8) is tantamount to an amendment of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  It provides a definition which is different from the definition that would apply to a worker-director under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, in relation to CIE because CIE was only one company at that time.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I raised the question of recruitment of employees to CIE.  In the clerical area there had been a system of a national open competitive examination.  I gather that method has been dispensed with.  It was one which commanded the confidence of our young people and one I would like to see adhered to.  We could bring into operation methodologies for testing which have been developed as well as the written examination.  The reason I am raising it on this section is because the existing personnel of CIE will now be allocated to three different companies and also to the parent board.  There will be four different units and they will all, for the purpose of electing worker directors, be regarded as the same constituency. When the companies are set up, will each company recruit its own staff?  For example, will the Dublin city services company recruit its own staff or will the parent board recruit for all the three subsidiary companies?  This definition will cover the position with regard to the worker-directors.  I would like to <Col N="595" /> know the Minister's view on recruitment generally, on methods of recruitment, whether the individual companies will do the recruitment or whether the board will recruit for itself and the other three companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Each company will recruit for itself.  In relation to the changing methods of recruitment, this has been requested by the board and the trade unions.  Under the present law CIE are required to have open competitions for clerical appointments which, when there are only one or two vacancies, is very expensive as there might be thousands of applications.  Over a number of years they have taken on temporary people and that has been very unsatisfactory for the people themselves and for the company. Because of the small number of vacancies that are likely to arise in the future it is not very sensible to require the companies to have open competitions.  They should be able to recruit in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said.  The Committee on Public Expenditure made a very thorough investigation of this problem.  We learned that large sums of money were being spent and the candidates were being fooled as large numbers were examined and very few were appointed due to the restriction on recruitment.  I am a little dubious about leaving the recruitment to the companies. It will be stated, often without very much substance, that the recruitment to the companies is not carried out on a very fair basis.  I do not know how to get over that difficulty.  I agree with the Minister that holding a nationwide examination with thousands of applicants and maybe only ten vacancies is ridiculous and a waste of public money. Some system should be evolved to get over this problem of employing people in a temporary capacity without there being specific criteria for such employment. Can I ask the Minister if that rule still holds as the CIE board will not be affected by this new legislation?  It will still exist as the board of CIE.  Will the <Col N="596" /> law still obtain with regard to that despite the setting up of the new companies?</P>

      <P>With regard to liabilities I presume that the Minister, and the House, are aware of ordinary citizens who have had occasion to sue CIE for injuries and so on have found it the most difficult company from which to get legal redress for injuries.  I have had some experience of this and I know of cases that have gone on for a long time.  One can see CIE, acting in the public good, feeling obliged to fight everything to the bitter end and paying out as little as possible. In doing that they are looking after the interests of the company and the Exchequer that subsidises it heavily but I am aware of cases where the company's legal representatives have thrown every obstacle in the way of people who got awards in court.  The process was held up by way of appeals and not putting in documents in time for the appeals.  Perhaps now that there is a new structure pending there will be an improvement.  If I have a car accident involving a bus the property of the new bus company, will the parent board have legal responsibility or will it be a matter for the provincial bus company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subparagraph (5), lines 11 and 12, to delete &ldquo;such period after the end of each accounting year as the Minister may direct&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three months after the end of each accounting year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We anticipated some of the argument in favour of this amendment earlier in the debate.  If we go back to the original transport reports, particularly McKinsey, and the contributions of various Ministers in the House, including Deputy Bruton, we will find that there has been an anxiety to know exactly how the revenue raising services of CIE have been developed, and, of course, the need for subsidisation. The Chair will appreciate something I said on the occasion of an Estimate debate, that very often the railway company had to relate to losses which did not belong properly to them on the basis that the House would not interfere with the railway service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prime objective of the amendment is to make available to the House in good time an account of the financial activities of the company for the year.  As Deputy Ahern has said, times have changed greatly in recent years with regard to information technology.  It is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to talk about it, and people involved in this technological revolution refer to &ldquo;transparency&rdquo;. <Col N="602" /> Perhaps I am being over generous in giving CIE a full three months after the end of the year to complete their audit.  If the new companies are to have the effect the Minister wants, namely, that as smaller entities they will be nearer to the action, including industrial relations, etc., they will be able to put the accounts together more quickly.  It should be possible to do this within three months after the end of the financial year which in the case of CIE is 31 December. That means the amendment is allowing January, February and March for the putting together of the accounts, and that is long enough for the House and the taxpayers to have to wait.</P>
    <P>In one of the Oireachtas committees we discussed this matter and there have been submissions from various State-sponsored bodies about difficulties.  An experienced man from the accountancy profession indicated that in the US there is a big drive to have audited accounts ready at a certain time of the year and that the accountants at that time are working around the clock.  Many companies here end their year on 31 March, CIE's is 31 December, so that the year is staggered already.</P>
    <P>I should think that the Minister in his heart agrees that the annual figures should be available not later than three months after the end of the financial year in CIE.  In his speech he indicated he has developed reporting procedures to provide &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; so that we will be able to see what is happening in a reasonable time.  I was surprised earlier when the Minister suggested that this could lead to an outbreak of political chicanery.  He thought it might mean, for instance that some person would say that the line to Westport was losing money and that somebody who did not like it would seek to have it closed down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>One would not need to have transparency to provoke suggestions that the fares should be reduced &mdash; that suggestion will be there anyway. <Col N="603" /> According to accepted philosophy, there is a strong social element in the activities of CIE &mdash; if that is not accepted by all of us here it is accepted by the vast majority of Deputies from all parties.  Therefore, transparency, or quick knowledge in the most detailed manner, will be necessary and it is for that purpose that I move the amendment.  Deputy Ahern is an accountant and he will have some remarks to make on the amendment, which I feel very strongly about and urge the Minister to accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Wilson in support of the amendment.  It would be better if this were written into the Bill so that in future some other Minister might not insist on it.  Nowadays, with the change in auditing procedures and the availability of sophisticated computer systems to produce information it should be quite easy to have an audit completed within three months of the end of the year.  It is not a major problem for an organisation like CIE, considering the firm doing the company's audit.</P>
      <P>As I have said, there has been a change in auditing.  There is continous auditing throughout the year nowadays so that at the end of the year there is not the same amount of work necessary.  Under the new regime it should be quite easy to have the figures available three months after the end of the year.  It is particularly desirable in a company such as CIE in which so much public money is invested. Deputy Wilson expressed clearly the necessity for bringing out information at an early date and detailed information is most important particularly for companies such as CIE where a lot of public money is utilised.  On those grounds I urge the Minister to accept Deputy Wilson's amendment specifying three months as the maximum period within which the accounts should be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the intention of this amendment so I regret all the more that I am unable to accept it.  I accept that there has been a problem in getting out the report and <Col N="604" /> accounts not only of CIE but of many other companies in the past.  However the House will be interested to learn the progress achieved by CIE in accelerating the submission of their accounts in recent years.  The accounts for 1982 were presented to the Dáil and Seanad on 29 February 1984; those for 1983 were presented on 14 December 1984; those for 1984 were presented on 1 October 1985 and those for 1985 on 16 September 1986.  Each of these represents an improvement on the preceding year.</P>
      <P>There is however scope for earlier presentation and CIE are working in that direction.  It is my intention to invoke the powers in the subsection at the appropriate time to specify a deadline.  I would think that three months is too short.  I would be inclined to say it should be more like four months.  But to start off with I have in mind a six month deadline and my aspiration would be to get to a four month deadline.  Three months would be difficult because of all the work that has to be done, and very few private companies achieve a deadline like that.</P>
      <P>If we were to write the deadline into the Bill we could have all sorts of problems, for example, if there was a strike in the printers or the auditors could not complete the work by the deadline.  In such cases we would be in conflict with the legislation.  The Minister should have the power, in exceptional circumstances, to alter the deadline.  I intend to implement the principle behind the amendment to get to a stage, within a reasonable number of years, where CIE would be presenting their report and accounts to the Dáil within four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to urge this amendment very strongly.  The Minister has really proved my point.  He has indicated that there has been an improvement and that improvement is welcome.  How bad it was is indicated by the fact that the 1982 accounts appeared in 1984; the 1984 accounts appeared in 1985 and the 1985 accounts appeared in September 1986. That is far too late for this House to assess and make decisions with regard to the payment of money.  Admittedly this <Col N="605" /> House would be bringing in a budget in January for, for example, 1987 and in the Vote for the Department of Communications there would be subheads covering the subsidy for CIE.  Even if the accounts were published by 31 March information that should really be available in January could not possibly be made available.  But March would not be too bad and any modifications of policy or adjustments could be taken in the same year.</P>
      <P>I asked questions also about the B &amp; I accounts and no accounts had been published for up to two years.  If this House decides to pay money or take up equity in a particular company, it is not good enough that the whole scene is not transparent to them.  For that reason I urge the Minister to accept this amendment. I know by his response that he is totally in sympathy with the thinking behind this amendment and that he wants his Department to have up-to-date information on the various semi-State companies under his aegis.  Therefore he would be doing a good job for the companies, the legislators and the taxpayers if he accepted this amendment.</P>
      <P>I would like to know if the same auditors will audit for the parent board and for the individual companies or if the individual companies will have the power to appoint their own auditors.  If they do, and I see no reason why they should not, it would be necessary to co-ordinate them so that the over-view will be available and so that the audit procedures of the different auditors could be properly aligned.</P>

      <P>That is an argument against the amendment, because when the accounts are audited by the auditors they are then submitted to the board for approval; the board submits them to the Minister for his approval and when the Minister is satisfied he then submits the accounts to the Government for approval.  All that takes a number of weeks and then the Government brings it before the House.  Therefore one of the dangers in specifying too short a time is that it might not be possible to do it in such time.  I do want it much shorter than has been the practice up to now.  On 29 May the 1985 accounts were submitted by the auditors.  They were signed by the chairman on 15 August 1986.  They were then approved by the Government and tabled before the House in September.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister could concentrate on speeding that procedure. It goes from the chairman to the auditor and then from the chairman to the Department.  In this case the Minister has power and I am sure that the accounts could be made available to the Minister at the same time as they are made available to the chairman of the company, and both the officials of the Department and the chairman and his top brass in the company could get down to examining them immediately.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my question about his view with regard to the auditors.  Does he envisage the board having one firm of auditors and the individual companies having the freedom to employ their own auditors or what?</P>

      <P>In other words, at the moment the auditors have to be approved by the Minister, that is to say, selected by the board subject to the consent of the Minister. Effectively the companies are going to select their own auditors provided they have board and ministerial approval.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister can still insist that he gets the report faster than he has <Col N="608" /> already been getting it.  The fact that it does not appear here until October and it is held up along the line still does not stop him from putting a section into the Bill insisting that the work be done more quickly than it is being done at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We get a faster report because, as I explained to the House on Second Stage, we get four-weekly reports from the board on their performance against budget under each subheading. For the 13 four-weekly accounting periods &mdash; 52 weeks not 48 periods &mdash; it gives an aggregate performance for the full year.  Within about six weeks before the end of the year we have a clear picture of what has happened.  It remains for that to be audited and the board to make their written report to me with the audited accounts.  As I have said, it is far too slow and will be speeded up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (7), line 21, after &ldquo;require&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, in particular, profit and loss accounts for specific services to and from specific places which services attract Government subsidy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 is in the same context and proceeding from the same philosophy which I share with the Minister with regard to accountability and transparency of all kinds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions during the debate we referred to profit and loss accounts for specific services to places which attract Government subsidies and, although the Minister did not accept amendment No. 13, nevertheless, I was more than pleased with his acceptance of the idea behind it.  The Minister said, encouragingly, at the end of our discussion on amendment No.13 that perhaps a four month period might be acceptable to him and that we might, by agreement, arrange for the insertion of &ldquo;four months&rdquo; on Report Stage with the agreement of the Minister, the Opposition and the Chair.</P>
      <P>This amendment is looking for transparency. It says &ldquo;... and, in particular, profit and loss accounts for specific services to and from specific places which services attract Government subsidy&rdquo;.  I want the suggested amendment taken in the context of a general agreement that the national transport company are involved in a nationwide social service &mdash; in the Twenty-six Counties anyway &mdash; which commands the support of the House at a cost of £115 million in the last year for which accounts are available. The reason behind this is that the House and the taxpayer should know exactly what they are supporting.  In certain parts of the country where, for example, rail services have been terminated, there is often a sense of grievance &mdash; in some cases a legitimate one &mdash; that moneys are being paid to subsidise other areas to retain rail services.  For all I know, the services to specific areas that have what on the surface looks like a legitimate cause for complaint may be commanding an equally high subsidy.  I do not know and it is because of this large region of darkness that I put forward this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point the Minister made that some people might use it for purposes of chicanery &mdash; I love that word &mdash; if the transparency applied to every line and that people would advocate the lowering of fares which would mean raising subsidies. Anything suggested in the accountancy area is capable of being twisted if people decide to advance arguments for or against certain courses of action.  However, I rely on the common sense of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the taxpayers who, because they have more information, does not necessarily mean that they will pressurise a Government Minister, the chairman of CIE or the chairman or boards of the various companies to suspend a service. It would also give us some insight to other developments which might provide as good or an even better service without necessarily incurring extra expense.  I am referring to the whole area of city services transport where people complain that large double decker buses at certain times of the day are travelling practically <Col N="613" /> empty.  In rural areas, which would be within the competence of the national bus company, large single decker buses are plying in places where smaller buses would suffice and be more economical to run.  In other countries, as I mentioned already, smaller buses holding about 30 people are used for shuttle and link services to beaches and so on which means that capital and fuel costs are less.  Admittedly, as the Minister said, salaries and wages are a very large proportion of the expenditure of CIE and a fully qualified driver would be needed even for a small bus.  It is only by having transparency that this House &mdash; whatever about the management in CIE &mdash; can see where developments take place.  I urge the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment because it is potentially dangerous.  It would be wrong of the House to be involved in measuring the cost of individual services.  The board should do this although they should not waste too much manpower and money in doing so.  It would be much better to set a limit on the subsidy for each service, railways provincial and city bus services. We could base this on the subsidy per passenger or passenger mile.  We can get details about passengers and passenger miles instead of weighing up every route and service in peak and off-peak times. This would not make sense although it has often been advocated by transport economists.  However, I do not know of any administration which does this.  I was in Toronto about a year and a half ago and I had discussions with members of the transport commission in that city.  I asked them how their subsidy was worked out and they told me they had this idea of trying to assess the social dimension of a particular service.  To what extent is the service to Naas social?  To what extent is the service to Portlaoise social?  To what extent is the service to Nenagh social? That is an area in which we can get into impossible difficulties.  Is a Sunday night service from Nenagh to Dublin as social as a Monday night service or is a Friday night service from Dublin to Nenagh as <Col N="614" /> social and liable to a subsidy as a Wednesday night service?  The Canadians firmly rejected that proposition and rightly so.  We would be getting into a great deal of bureaucracy.</P>

      <P>Maybe I am wrong to presume that CIE as they stand &mdash; probably more so when the company are broken up &mdash; will be able to break down areas of profit and loss and will be able to give some information as regards the social content of certain services.  They must have been able to do so in the past because they were able to cut off many services.  I agree with Deputy Wilson that for specific services information should be available to the Minister.  I am not declaring that every detail of CIE business or any of the companies' business should be made public.  Giving full information in a business content is not always the best for a business but, where decisions have to be made and where wrong criticism is being made, information to justify what is being done should be made available if possible.  It should be striven for and if it is necessary for it to be produced let it be made available. The Minister should consider this amendment in order to have the necessary information available within the company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a comment on the Minister's contribution. I know McKinsey recommended above the line payments to CIE.  I agreed with <Col N="615" /> that suggestion.  The Minister has put that recommendation into effect.  We now have an above the line contribution to CIE.  All round it was a beneficial development as far as CIE are concerned. The Minister emphasised how important morale is and how important it is for the management and the work-force to be of the opinion they are taking part in a worth-while business exercise, that they are being paid by this House for part of that service and that the customers are paying for the other part.</P>
      <P>The £115 million which was provided in the past year is a payment for a social service to the community.  One could say in a lumpen kind of way that the £115 million worth of the service is social. What I am trying to do is to give this House a look at how that £115 million is made up, not with the intention of closing services but with the intention of making clear to the piper or to the people who call the tune and pay the piper what they are paying for.  It is for that reason I am pressing the amendment.  It has nothing to do with withdrawing services because they cost too much.  I take it that in the global area we have decided to pay £115 million in 1985 and that that payment has the backing of the House.  What I want to know is how that £115 million is divided up.  I do not accept that a better way for doing it would be to put a limit on the subsidy per service and I do not think that is an ideal way for handling it at all. The subsidy per passenger or passenger mile which is from one realm of commercial viability or non-viability is being transferred to the social area.  Thinly populated areas are going to lose out on that criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister asked the question as to how far we can reckon a service to Naas as social I would say the answer is precisely the difference between what CIE make in running their service to Naas and what it takes to run that service. The Naas service may very well pay for itself and the accounts may show that.  It may very well make a little profit but for the information of the House we should know that.  How does the rail service from <Col N="616" /> Dublin to Rosslare fare out?  That service is linked to another area of our national life, specifically it is linked to tourism. The Rosslare harbour authority and the people in Wexford take a deep interest in that service and the service which goes from east to west from Rosslare.  It could be argued that, for the benefit of tourism, it cannot be taken that if the service from Rosslare to Munster loses money, that is in effect losing money for the nation. That need not necessarily be so if it is supplying a tourist need.</P>
    <P>What I have in my amendment is a push towards something the Minister agrees with, that is, that we know exactly what the £115 million is devoted to.  I urge the Minister to accept this as it will help in the area in which he is concentrating, namely, to make it as clear as possible where moneys voted in this House are going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe there is any sense in repeating what I have already said.  We have already put a limit on the expenditure on each of the main services provided by CIE and we have set targets for reducing each of them over the next five years.  Over the past four years these targets have been met each year, or bettered.  The £115 million to which the Deputy referred is broken down as follows, and I gave these details in my Second Stage speech: railways, other than DART £75.6 million; DART £7 million, other than the £16 million interest; Dublin bus services £16.8 million: provincial city bus services, £2.1 million: other provincial bus services £0.3 million: canals £1.4 million; and the Galway/Aran ferry service £0.8 million. I urge Deputy Wilson not to press his amendment because it would lead to a great deal of bureaucracy which would not meet any particular objective.  It would be much better to have an overall limit and to let the board decide on the services to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept what the Minister said if I believed it would mean an excess of bureaucracy but it could only <Col N="617" /> mean an excess of bureaucracy if all we had invested in the computer science field in third level education over the last number of years has been a total failure. I believe we have qualified people who could be employed, and not great numbers of them, by CIE who would be able to make this kind of information available with the minimum expense from the manpower point of view and with the maximum benefit to legislators and to administrators in the Department and to give information to the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the figures the Minister gave now, on the Second Stage and in reply to my parliamentary question not too long ago.  For example, it must be discouraging to the Dublin city services <Col N="618" /> sector, a very busy sector, when they are told they have to be subsidised to the tune of £16.8 million when it is well known that there are services within that service which are profitable.  All I am seeking in this amendment is further clarification of the area that is profitable and that that should be shown in the normal accounts of CIE.  It was on that basis that I appealed for a shorter delay in the presentation of accounts and in this instance that I have appealed for more detailed reporting to the board, to the Minister, to this House, and through this House to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Yes, among other things.  The section provides for any temporary shortages of funds.  Up to a few years ago CIE had short term borrowings <Col N="621" /> of £36 million.  The Government have taken on board £30 million of that.  There were shortfalls in the subvention in preceding years.  The company took on responsibility for £6 million.

      <P>The then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Bruton, abolished the National Prices Commission.  So far as I remember that commission used to examine fares and so on.  The Government had a final veto on fares and that has been maintained. Where the prices Acts do not apply what provision is there in the Bill?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I attach considerable importance to this section.  It substitutes for section 14 of the Transport Act, 1950, and extends the scope of it greatly.  One of my pet interests for a long time has been to exploit and develop the assets of CIE to the advantage of the companies, <Col N="624" /> the board and the taxpayer.  There is great potential in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recall that I mentioned the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; in my contribution on Second Stage of this Bill. I wish that word was present in far more documentation and legislation coming from the Government.  Development has almost become a dirty word in our economy. There is no developmental outlook and for that reason I was glad to see that the Minister included the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; here.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention a CIE works in which the Minister has a special interest, the works at Inchicore.  There is a lot of expertise available there.  In that context I should like to mention that Mr. Ciaran Kennedy, Director of the Economic and Social Research Institute, who some years ago carried out a survey of the economy in Denmark found that many of the new engineering companies there had been developed by people who had been employed in larger concerns.  There is a great volume of expertise in the Inchicore works and the Minister, the chairman, who has a developmental mind, and the board should encourage the workers to use their skills and expertise.  They should not be satisfied with the ordinary weekly wage, fighting for more and so on as has been the custom in the past.  That must be done but those workers should concentrate their minds on development. There must be several useful subsidiary industries in the engineering field where the skills of those people could be deployed.  We should encourage the workers to develop a spirit of enterprise among themselves.  For those reasons I am glad this provision has been included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the debate but I should like to mention that for the past few months the former bus building company at Shannon has been in operation, under the direction of CIE, completing the work on a number of vehicles that were not completed by the last concern.  This excellent plant is in an ideal location and has a highly skilled workforce.  I should like to impress upon <Col N="625" /> the Minister the need to develop that plant.  I appeal to him to keep the plant in operation now that CIE are finishing work on 25 buses that were on the production line when the former owners closed the factory.  I should like to compliment CIE on the way they have tackled this.  With the co-operation of the liquidator they managed to complete the buses which will prove a very valuable asset to the company.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the need for a bus building plant here.  The attention of CIE should be directed to the potential of the Shannon operation.  Many school buses and city and rural buses need to be replaced and the replacements can be produced at the Shannon plant.  The work would provide badly needed jobs in the locality. If CIE take over the concern they will be buying a very valuable asset.  If we do not build replacement buses at Shannon we will have to import them at a greater cost to the Exchequer.  It is important that that plant is developed to build coaches for CIE.  Last year we criticised the decision of the company to import coaches.  They could have been manufactured at the Shannon plant.  I hope the Minister takes a special interest in this matter to see if it will be possible to continue building buses in Shannon.  That plant is capable of building school buses, city buses or coaches for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Daly.  His comments are in line with what I said about a developmental attitude in the works at Inchicore.  I am aware that the school bus fleet has been badly depleted.  There has not been any decision to abolish the service or continue it but there has not been any capital provision. It should be remembered that CIE own the machinery in what was formerly the GAC plant and, before that, the Bombardier company.  We are not advocating the establishment of an industry that would not be viable in the ordinary commercial sense but the areas mentioned by Deputy Daly should at least command the attention of CIE.  The company <Col N="626" /> should consider building a smaller type of bus for use in off-peak hours in cities or as a link on heavily frequented routes.  One can see a model for such a bus on the continent.  These matters should be brought to the attention of the chairman and the board of CIE with a view to the company taking action in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Deputies have said about this matter.  I agree that the plant and rigs are in place and are owned by CIE.  The possibility is always there for a resumption of bus-building at the Shannon plant.  However, it would be wrong of us to give the impression that that could happen easily.  It would not be sufficient to get orders for school buses or ongoing replenishment of the CIE fleet. That would not keep the plant in operation. For that plant to be successful it will be necessary to secure substantial export orders.  Even if we had plenty of money at home to order the fleet replenishment that the company would like, the amount of work involved would not be enough to keep the plant going.  Export orders are crucial.  Since the plant was opened it has been impossible, despite the best efforts of Bombardier and GAC, to get export orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that economics are very important but the Minister should investigate the possibility of building a small type of bus for the purposes I have suggested.  When I was Minister I inaugurated the post bus service in County Clare but I do not think that was followed up.  We should specialise in a special type of bus that could feed into the school bus service, to off peak services in the cities and feeder services.  There would be a better chance of getting an export business going if there was a major market for such a vehicle at home.  It should not be beyond the wit of accountants and assessors to put the whole picture of an operation such as this into a report taking the cost to the country of imports and the loss of PRSI and PAYE payments into account.  Another factor that should be taken into account is the <Col N="627" /> fact that if people are employed at the plant the number on unemployment benefit will be reduced.  It should be possible for an actuary, or a highly qualified accountant to put the sum together and show us exactly how much extra it would pay the country to be building the buses while still making on the swings money it had lost on the roundabouts I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I direct the Minister's attention to the desirability of having a modest bus building operation at Shannon.  The skills are there and the plant, and it has been proved that buses can be produced there successfully and economically.  This is a separate issue that could be taken into account later.  There is a need for such an operation in the area not only from the point of view of employment but of the economics involved.  I am talking about a small operation, the production of two buses per week, 100 per year.  It would make economic sense and it would be realistic rather than closing the plant and have CIE importing buses in the near future, which would be a major mistake. I emphasise I am not calling for an elaborate operation through which the product could be exported; I am asking that the plant be kept open to produce CIE's needs in regard to school, rural and city buses and coaches.  They are being imported at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems is that in any plant like this the overheads are steep and the smaller the number of units produced the greater the cost per unit.  If you produce two buses a week, 100 per year, the unit cost would be far greater than if you were producing 1,000 buses a year.  It would not be economic to talk in these terms.  It would give me great pleasure to reopen that plant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It would be wrong of us to create unjustified expectations about reopening the plant, raising the hopes of people in <Col N="628" /> the area who are desperate.  We should give hope only when it is justified &mdash; we should be reasonably sure of securing and being able to fill export orders.  Our home market would not sustain such an undertaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <P>It is right that the Government and the Oireachtas retain policy direction but I believe that such policy direction should be given by the Minister by order and the direction should be given in writing when requested by the board so that the House will know when the Minister has given a policy direction about which the board are not happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in an ambivalent mood about this.  The Minister berated various Governments for interfering in the affairs of CIE in the past.  A definition of policy direction could be argued to include anything to do with the running of CIE.  The next section gives the Minister considerable powers.  Subsection (1) of this section states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may give to the Board such directions in writing as to policy in relation to the functions of the Board, the companies, or any of them, as he thinks proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the directions will be given to the board rather than to the individual companies, or does it mean that the Minister can give directions to the companies through the board?  I will not be opposing the section though the powers are <Col N="629" /> pretty extensive.  A section giving such powers to the Minister and the administration requires careful scrutiny and attention, with possible modifications by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>If the Minister were to extend the rapid rail system to Tallaght, as he promised, the board would need compulsory powers to acquire land.  A good deal of land was acquired by CIE from Dublin to Tallaght.  If it is to be used for the purpose of extending the rail link to Tallaght we should support it.  I would point out that CIE sold off little parcels of land along the Harcourt Street line.  If there is to be a road or a rail development in that direction, the company would have to proceed to acquire land, and there would be considerable opposition from people who paid considerable sums of money for land on that route to extend their back gardens.  I know some of the people who did that.</P>

      <P>Under this section an amended wording has been substituted for section 35 (1) of the Act of 1950 which relates to the appointment of staff by the board.  The purpose of this section is to remove, in the interests of flexibility, the statutory obligation on the board of CIE to appoint a secretary and a general manager. This flexibility is particularly desirable in the current situation where the chairman holds office on a full time basis and where the organisation is undergoing a period of change and restructuring involving the movement of some of the duties of the general manager to the subsidiary companies.</P>

That is not to say that the board may not wish to make those appointments.  It possibly will in the beginning.</P>

I very much hope that the work we have done here will set the stage for a resurgence of CIE in the future.  A great deal has already been achieved in the past four years.  There has not been a time for many years when there was occasion to have more confidence in CIE than we have now.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment to the motion before the House.  It is of some importance to trace how measures of this nature such as the Christmas bonus and <Col N="634" /> the double payment originated in their unique way in our country.  Many things have to go back to the Leader of the Opposition.  In the good old days when the Leader of the Opposition was Taoiseach he used to say to trade union leaders &ldquo;Ah, it is only money&rdquo;.  He decided as a special measure as part of one of the national understandings which was certainly very well understood at the time, that additionally as a special measure in 1980 the Government would provide &ldquo;a double payment for one week in December 1980 in weekly social welfare payments to long term social welfare recipients&rdquo;. In that year the then Taoiseach authorised his then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, to pay £9.3 million to 378,000 people.  Needless to remark, I would not dare to refer this House to the state of the Exchequer finances in 1980.  It is well and truly documented and requires no repetition in this House.</P>
      <P>Then in 1981 the Government were in the horrors.  Deputy Haughey took no decision on the double welfare payment until 6 November 1981 when he went ahead and brought in legislation which was not passed until the end of November, and there was no money there either, as we know well.  We know well and truly the state of the finances by November 1981.</P>
      <P>Lo and behold, in 1982 what happened? I was in the House on the night the Dáil was dissolved on 4 November 1982.  It happened so frequently at the time that one runs out of years.  On the following day with the Dáil dissolved the Fianna Fáil Party discovered they had forgotten about the Christmas bonus, so a Government decision was taken on 5 November, to spend at that time £17 million.  The then Government did not even have the authority to spend the money, but, by God, they spent it because within a matter of a week or two there was to be a general election the date of which had been fixed for December.  That is the kind of carry-on which happened at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1983 I was Minister.  My colleague, <Col N="635" /> the Minister for Social Welfare, and I know the Taoiseach permits no end of the year fiddling with the books.  It is not on in our administration.  Money is money, not just money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1983 and 1984 when I was Minister we managed within the framework of the projected over run on the current budget deficit to pay the bonus to 404,000 and 414,000 respectively, an increasing number, at a cost of £20.35 million to be exact.  In 1985 I went to the Government and pointed out to them that there were 90,000 long term unemployed who were totally excluded from the Christmas bonus.  They did not even get a bob because in the <i>ad hoc</i> method of Fianna Fáil at the time it was confined to particular groups of pensioners, and short term beneficiaries and long term unemployed beneficiaries were excluded from the measure.  I do not know why because there were plenty of long term unemployed around in 1980 and 1981.  I pointed out to the Government that a substantial number of persons were on long term unemployment, that is over 15 months, and the bonus payment should at least be distributed among them all as far as practicable on a reasonable and fair basis.  Therefore, last year we used the £21 million and spread it more equitably and rationally and it benefited more than half a million people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year we went through the same exercise at Cabinet and I stress that, as with Fianna Fáil but for different purposes, the decision was taken towards the end of the year, on the sixth budget report to be exact.  On that basis the Government had saved by good management, including savings by my Department of Health, moneys to the tune of around £18 million.  We decided that the current budget deficit was around £180 million. We did not wish to exceed our current budget deficit on outturn which was already substantially high, and on that basis we decided to pay a 65 per cent bonus.  We could have fiddled the books. <Col N="636" /> There was no problem.  You would not know until January anyway and we could have paid 75 per cent but, as a matter of public propriety, we said despite the sure knowledge that we were going to face considerable difficulty that we could afford to pay £18 million and we tried to do the right thing.  We did it and will continue to do it.</P>
    <P>That is the basis on which this payment was made, but there was one further complication, that of the very substantial additional cost towards the second half of the year in implementing the equality legislation.  In the first instance we gave an extra £6 a week to 46,000 married women since last May.  We provided £18 million and that is money paid out since the first pay day of May last.  That is net expenditure after all.  We decided to bring in a £50 ceilling limit and that cost £4.6 million.  Deputies know well we have been particularly concerned to implement the directive.  I have not read in the papers a letter from any woman saying she has got the extra money of £41 or more.  These women in any event since 1979 should have enjoyed equality.  They did not enjoy it because in 1979, 1980 and 1981 the Fianna Fáil Party ran like scalded ducks from the implications of the directive because it would cost money.  The Deputy knows that when he was Minister for Social Welfare, the late Minister for Finance, Deputy George Colley, a man for whom we both had regard, made quite sure they entered the reservation which they were forced to enter in Brussels on a particular day.  It was entered at that time.  The Deputy is the person who said that dependancy cross over payments should not be permitted in terms of equality of treatment. Now he has the gall as Leader of the Opposition to enter the House and say that it should not happen.  I lack the capacity to verbalise that kind of political transition from one side of the House to the other.</P>
    <P>Married women can now enjoy unemployment assistance on the same basis as every other applicant.  That will cost a substantial amount.  In addition, the Government decided we should ensure <Col N="637" /> that there would be no discrimination between married women and men generally in relation to unemployment benefit. Up to this year a married woman could only enjoy 312 days of unemployment on unemployment benefit as against 390 days for every other insured worker.  We paid money for that and last evening we added £8.6 million in a full year to the 1987 Estimates.  The money can be easily calculated.  For this year there is an additional £1.8 million to give further relief to families who have a transitional problem, namely those families where a wife is working and her husband is drawing social welfare benefit or where a husband is working and a wife is drawing social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>The Government have the obligation of introducing equality and the gross cost of that exercise in a full year, with £8.9 million already committed on the basis of the original £10, with the £50 floor and with the further measure last night of £1.8 million, all of which would amount to £8.6 million in a full year, will be no less than £36 million.  About 95 per cent of families will not lose a shilling because of the implementation of equality.  This has come from a Government who have been caricatured as being a Government who are cutting social welfare expenditure. The great irony of the situation is that implementation of equality of treatment has cost in net budget terms a total of £36 million in a full year and the roll over will go on into the middle of next year.  It has been said that we are exceptionally mean about our social welfare payments, particularly in terms of our Christmas bonus.  I would remind the House that we are the only country in Europe other than the UK which is paying that type of bonus and the UK pays a flat £10 for Christmas only to pensioners.  Here we extended the payment to those in receipt of long term unemployment assistance. This year we are paying an average of £36 bonus per family and the total cost this year is over £18 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy last week made the observation that the Government has been stingy and so on about social welfare. <Col N="638" /> However, for the first time in the history of the State, we are spending £1 billion on pensions.  When Deputy Haughesy was Taoiseach in 1982 the corresponding figure was £740 million, by 1984 it was £930 million and in 1986 it is more than £1 billion.  That is an outstanding achievement for any country in a time of recession.  In terms of unemployment related expenditure, in 1982 we spent £380 million, in 1984, £550 million and in 1986 we will spend £690 million. That is an outstanding record of real growth in expenditure.</P>

      <P>We have given the extension of the bonus payment this year. Last year 99,000 long term unemployed gained.  This year an additional 10,000 people will benefit.  In addition to the bonus payment we must remember that five out of every ten contributory pensioners who are in occupations have pensions in addition to the contributory old age pension and that is not aninsignificant source of general income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been accused of not putting money into social welfare programmes.  When I came into office the rate of payment for an unemployed married man with two children on assistance, in June 1983, was £65.15.  It is now £81.75, an increase of 25 per cent over that period.  Inflation went up in the same period by around 22 per cent.  There have been real increases in short term benefits, a real gain of 6.5 per cent.  In long term benefits there has been a real gain of 9 per cent, and for the long term unemployed the real gain has been no less than 14.5 per cent.  A lot of that has been done on borrowed money and we make no secret of it.  It had to be borrowed to keep some sense of social cohesion, to maintain our social services, our health services and our educational services.  We have done that while endeavouring not to impose massive PRSI increases on the ordinary workers.  When the PRSI system <Col N="639" /> was introduced in 1979 the contribution rates for employers and employees was 8.75 per cent and 4.4 per cent.  In three successive budgets in which Deputy Haughey was very involved, the employees' share of PRSI contributions rose by 70 per cent and the employers' share went up by 33 per cent.  For the past four years this Government in four successive budgets have ensured that there has not been an actual increase in the rate of social insurance.  That is a remarkable achievement for any Government in a time of recession and within major financial constraints.  The income levy was abolished last year and if the Deputies dispute it I will quote the facts. In 1979 the employees' contribution was 4.4 per cent.  Fianna Fáil put it up to 4.5 per cent and later on to 4.75 per cent.  In 1982 it was raised to 7.5 per cent, by 1985 it was 8.5 per cent and last year we brought it down to 7.5 per cent.  We did that by keeping control of social welfare expenditure.</P>
    <P>We must examine the general undesirability of <i>ad hoc</i> payments as our social welfare system is littered with schemes and it is almost impossible, even for the Minister for Social Welfare, to understand the precise social benefits related to them.  I warmly endorse the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare which said that it is generally undesirable to have piecemeal changes over the years unrelated to the level of available resources and needs.</P>
    <P>I deplore the attack on my colleague in Government.  Cabinet decisions are taken collectively and I resent the phrase &ldquo;unfortunate woman&rdquo; used by Deputy Haughey about a member of the Government which I serve.</P>

      <P>I am begging you if you get this letter please read it out to Mrs. Hussey in the Dáil.  I want her to know what she has done to my family.  My husband has been crippled by arthritis for 13 years.  I am also disabled.  We have 3 boys (aged 13 to 7 years) dependent on us.  My husband was getting £109.20 invalidity pension.  I was getting £41.10 disability benefit, total £150.30.  This has now been cut to £128.85.  As Dr. FitzGerald knows only too well, a person with arthritis needs all the nourishment and care they can get. How can I give him this on £128?  In God's name tell them to stop crucifying the sick and disabled people of my country.  All I can say now is I hope God will forgive them as I cannot find it in my heart to.  As I look at my husband's crippled legs and hands and at my 3 children, the youngest is an asthmatic, I say to myself maybe Christmas won't come this year.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>Margaret Leeson (Mrs),</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> That adds balance to the Minister's remarks about paying out an additional £35 million this year in social welfare payments and achieving equality which, to that woman and her family, means a loss of £22 per week.  Even with the magnificent concession we got last night, after the posturings of a number of Labour Party Deputies, that woman will still lose £12 per week.  We are told that 60 per cent of a Christmas bonus will bring her back to square one, which is nonsense.  Equality must mean that people are equal to the best, that they are not lowered to the lowest possible denominator.  It is astounding that a Minister and a Government supported by the Labour Party &mdash; who claim to be socialist &mdash; are acquiescing in driving the poorest into greater poverty and despair.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of listening to the well meaning middle class liberals in Fine Gael who wring their hands and tell us that they are in favour of equality for women.  They say that you cannot have equality in social welfare without damaging the poorest in society.  They should throw away their liberal mask, forget about liberalism and admit their Tory leanings like the PDs or any other Tory Member in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare should resign, not because she is a woman but because she took over a Bill from a Labour Party Minister and implemented it without any thought for its effects.  She does not know what they will be because she is a Fine Gael, middle class liberal who does not know how the working class have to survive.  Not only should she resign, this excuse for a Government should also resign.  It is time that they copped themselves on and realised that they can no longer stagger from crisis to crisis.  All the posturing by Deputy Cluskey and Deputy O'Leary does not disguise the fact that they did not think it worth their while to come into this House last summer to add their voices to the opposition which was being raised about the cutbacks which were imminent as a result of this legislation.  Their postering will not save them from the wrath <Col N="643" /> of the working class whenever the Government decide to go to the country. They cannot avoid it forever.  A 100 per cent Christmas bonus should be paid.</P>

      <P>The Government's penny pinching attitude to the Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients speaks volumes for their overall lack of policy in the management of Government expenditure. This year they have allowed spending to rise at a rate which is more than twice the level of inflation.  They have missed every economic and monetary target they set themselves.  Not only this year but for the past four years have this Government presided over this country.</P>
      <P>Nor can the Christmas bonus issue be isolated from the total shambles the Government have made of the implementation of the EC equality directive. Three times in the past three weeks this unfortunate Government have revised and reversed policy.  They have shown themselves to be totally out of touch with ordinary people.  They have no understanding of how those on social welfare live.  They had to wait until their own backbenchers returned screaming from their constituency clinics about the awful injustice that had been done to the most vulnerable families in the country before they could understand the impact of their decision so far as the EC directive was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As our party leader, Deputy O'Malley, pointed out yesterday, it was a bit late in the day for the Minister for Finance to seek to justify the Scrooge like attitude to welfare recipients by blaming them for the level and cost of Government borrowing.  There are a number of ways of reducing public expenditure and the <Col N="644" /> Progressive Democrats recently spelled out public spending cuts totalling £370 million in a single year.  Therefore, nobody need have any doubt about where we stand on this fundamental issue.  We have always maintained that public spending adjustments must be carried out in a way which does not adversely affect the least well off in our society.  Therefore, the issue of the £3 million reduction in the Christmas bonus is about something much more than that relatively paltry sum in the Government's overall budget.  This money is of vital importance to the families on social welfare and it should have been one of the last places any Government would have turned to in the task of reducing expenditure.</P>
    <P>We see a Government who have funked the task of cutting much larger sums of money where other interest groups were concerned.  They added at least £30 million to the deficit this year by way of the devaluation of the Irish pound last August.  This puts into perspective the Government's priorities. They have no hesitation in making cuts in the Christmas bonus.  The Progressive Democrats are most concerned with getting public expenditure down but we will not do that at the expense of the least well off.  The Government have shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the implications of the EC equality directive.  We have no hesitation in voting against the Government on this issue this evening.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree with spending £18 million on building a huge dental hospital in Dublin when a hospital half the size would be adequate to provide all the necessary dental services for the Dublin area, thereby making a saving of at least £6 million?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Fianna Fáil motion.  It is a tragedy that in this day and age one has to come into this House to look for £3 million for the least well off in our society particularly when one <Col N="645" /> looks over at self professed people who claim they are led by a Taoiseach, one of whose main objectives was to eliminate poverty.  There are more impoverished people in this country now than ever before.  What we are seeking is what the Minister gave last year, which was 75 per cent of the full payment.  What we are seeking is that the Government would meet the commitment they gave last year, which was £20 million.  This year they say they are giving £18 million to these people.</P>
      <P>The Minister in her speech cleverly broadened the issue.  We are not talking about major cuts in Government expenditure or about major borrowings.  We are talking about an extra £3 million for those in receipt of social welfare payments. The Minister in her speech and the Minister for Health tonight theorised about the need to control Government expenditure.  The Minister for Social Welfare talked about the need for rational people to understand that one cannot give money which is not there and that there is a need to keep deficits in compliance with one's plans at the beginning of the year.  The fact of the matter is that those planned deficits have been exceeded already, probably by as much as £20 million.  If we are prepared to accept £200 million of an increase in the current budget deficit would it be in the hearts of the Government to accept £203 million of an overrun on the current budget deficit so that these people could get what they got last year?  We are talking about a minimal amount of money for the people concerned but what we are forgetting is that these people are living from day to day, let alone from week to week.  These people depend on this payment to get them over Christmas. They will not get over it as well as I or anyone else in this House but they are entitled to the dignity of receiving what they got last year.  Why should they take a cut in their Christmas present from the Irish people?  That is what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Health talk about this money they say we should realise it is taxpayers' money.  I realise it is taxpayers' <Col N="646" /> money but I would say this: the Irish people are a generous people.  They showed this when millions of the world's starving were brought to our attention by the Band Aid project.  We were shown to be the most generous when we took money out of our pockets then.  We applauded the Government when the Taoiseach gave £250,000 to help that project. Are we to sit here tonight and say we have not got £3 million for the most underprivileged members of our society? Let us forget about the cant of controlling public expenditure because the Government have borrowed more money than any previous Government in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The ordinary man who last weekend came to see me in my constituency clinic or who went to any public representative said we had money for everything else but not for him or his wife and children. That is politics in Ireland today.  It is not about percentages, current budget deficits or overruns, it is about whether we will produce what we gave last year to social welfare recipients.  The fact of the matter is that the Government will not.  There is no getting away from that. That is what the ordinary people of this country are saying about the Government. This has caused resentment not just among social welfare recipients but also among the hardpressed taxpayers. This money will not be taken out of their pockets; it will be put into the pockets of their brothers and sisters because every family is affected by the plague of unemployment under this Government.  If this money is given to these people they will be getting what we believe, and what every decent ordinary person in the street believes, they are entitled to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">

      <P>The payment of the double week for certain categories of social welfare classes has come to be an accepted thing in recent years and once started can hardly be withdrawn or curtailed in any form.  It has become an integral part of the social welfare code at Christmas.  Like a child who looks forward to seeing Santa at Christmas time, there are many thousands of under-privileged <Col N="647" /> people who look forward to receiving this double week bonus from the State at Christmas.</P>
      <P>To the vast majority of these people it can mean the difference between a happy Christmas or a miserable Christmas.  It can mean the difference between there being a little extra comfort at Christmas, or Christmas Day being the same as any other day.  It can also mean there will be a little extra comfort at Christmas, a little extra food on the table, adequate fuel to keep the family warm or clothes on the backs of the children.  This bonus can help to make the difference between a happy Christmas or a miserable Christmas.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing the bonus this year is, I understand, £18 million.  To make the bonus payment on the same basis as last year would cost an extra £3 million.  When one considers that it costs the State some £2.5 billion per year to finance the social services, £3 million is a paltry sum.  Such a meagre saving should not be made at the expense of the poorest and weakest in our society.</P>
      <P>As a result of public outrage and the revolt of Government backbenchers, the Minister came here last night and announced she had found extra millions of pounds to try to compensate those people who had sustained massive losses resulting from the implementation of the so-called equality directive in respect of social welfare payments.  Does anyone seriously suggest that she could not on this occasion find this paltry £3 million to pay the double week bonus to all social welfare categories this Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said here last night, &ldquo;Let me make one thing clear at the outset. The bonus is not an item that is provided at the beginning of the year.  It never has been&rdquo;.  That is the nub of this issue.  This vital item of expenditure must no longer be left to chance.  In future, it must be provided for in the budget, thereby ending the suspense, the scraping, the scrounging and the economising at the end of the financial year.  This £18 million to £20 million must be provided in future budgets.  To fail to do so would be to <Col N="648" /> make a mockery of the suffering of the unfortunate people we are concerned with this evening.</P>
    <P>As one who fought tenaciously over the past 25 years to build up and maintain our social services in terms of health, welfare, education and local government, I have been deeply saddened to observe that these essential services are continually under attack by this Government. They were cut back, dismantled and torn down before my eyes in a very short time and in an unprincipled, reckless and renegade fashion by people, erstwhile colleagues of mine, who claimed to have a social conscience, who claimed to be socialists, and who pledged, as I do, to defend the weak and the under-priviledged in this House.</P>

      <P>There are few who would deny that the true litmus test of democratic Government is the manner in which the old and the needy are treated. How this Government have failed that test.  The Coalition treatment of the old is a sad reflection on the validity of the so-called social policies.  Coalition policies have sought in a very callous way to regard the old and the unemployed as parasites, a burden on hard-pressed Exchequer funds.  People and their problems do not matter to the Coalition.  The important thing for them is to keep up the facade of monetarism and to bluff their way, but not to allow the ordinary people to get a say and give a direction as to what they want the Government to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had another instance of that this evening when the Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, came into the House and said they will pay the extra money from the projected overrun of the deficit of £180 million.  More Government dishonesty.  That budget deficit is not £180 million but £1,400 million this year.  This is the Government of no word, the Government who promised the budget deficit would be nil in 1987 but they seek to mislead and say that the <Col N="649" /> budget deficit is £180 million in 1986.  The Minister tried to fool us.  He had the effrontery to suggest, as he is so capable of doing, that there are further savings of £18 million in the various Departments, including his own Department of Health, when everyone knows he has decimated the health services and he has created the longest waiting list for health services in the history of the State.  The health boards are in hock to the banks to the tune of £50 million extra which the Minister could not find for them this year to fund services.</P>
    <P>What this Government are doing is mean and stingy.  Whether they like it or not, real poverty stalks this land tonight. This Coalition have no understanding of the difficulties of the old and the unemployed. What does £5 mean to the Minister? It is the price of two gins and tonics in the room next door, but to an unemployed person it means food, shelter, clothes, transport and the necessities of life for one day of every week.</P>
    <P>Reputations are at stake here.  That is what we are talking about, the reputation of this Government and the reputation of some of the Ministers.  The credibility of this Government is in tatters and the credibility of individual Ministers is lessening each day.  The so-called high ground of honesty and integrity we have all been treated to for the past four years has been abandoned in the barefaced pursuit of power for power's sake.  That is the only reason this unfortunate Government continue to stay on that side of the House.  They want to hold on to the miserable semblance of power the people want to take from them, but the Government will not give them the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stood up and said he was proud of the record of his Government in the provision of health services. He said he was proud of what the Minister, Deputy Desmond, has done and, in the same breath, he said he was proud of the record of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Gemma Hussey.  I ask him to put that achievement to the test <Col N="650" /> and to see what the Irish people think of their proud achievements.  How can this Government run away from the fact that they stand disgraced for their total lack of control and authority?  We got a good example of that here last evening when the Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, spent 45 minutes trying to cajole, threaten, and sweet talk Deputy Michael Bell in the lobby to get him and his unfortunate erstwhile friend to do the right thing by his policy tonight.  That is what we are treated to.  There is no substantial Government.  There is instability of Government to be seen every day in the corridors of this House.  One could have been suffocated in the welter of bad decisions that have emanated from this Government in the past few years. The instability is everywhere.  I could smell the mendacity as I walked down the corridors of this House over the past few months.  Unfortunately we still have a Government who persist in holding on to their shambles of authority.</P>
    <P>Our concern on this side of the House is legitimate.  We always had that attitude to the unemployed and weaker sections of our community.  We will not be brow-beaten or dressed down by this unfortunate Coalition Government for the attitude and position we have taken.  The needs of the weaker sections of the community have always been a fundamental part of Fianna Fáil policy.  We are proud of it.  We are the trade union of the old and needy of this country.  Fianna Fáil have traditionally been the defenders of the weak and we are proud of that tradition. We will not have our concern minimised or downgraded by snide personal remarks about the leader of this party who has the finest record so far as any leader or any Minister for Health or Social Welfare since the foundation of this State is concerned in terms of social welfare and of giving to the poor.</P>
    <P>The old and the unemployed are entitled to generosity more than just in spirit or word.  They are entitled to it in cash as well.  We are not for taking away their Christmas bonus.  We are not for taking away the little extra that would <Col N="651" /> give them some comfort this Christmas-time.</P>
    <P>This Government have one unfortunate attribute.  They continue to browbeat the electorate into believing that what they are doing is in their best interests.  Political survival has no upper price tag in Coalition terms.  Bad decisions can be altered by backbench revolt which can be cajoled, threatened and defused in any way one likes to think of.  We say to them now that the new Labour philosophy would seem to be: we are ready to wound you but we are not ready to strike you dead.  We say to the Labour Party, the so-called pseudo-socialists of this Government and of our time: cast aside the allegiance you have to this right wing monetarist Government, take at least one stand of which you can be proud, go to the electorate and seek their support on the basis of supporting us in this motion.  That would restore some semblance of decency to that for which your party was founded and give some little extra comfort to the old, the unemployed and the needy of our time.</P>
    <P>There have been dirty tricks used against the old and the needy in the past.  I do not have to remind the older Members here of the famous shilling reduction in the old age pension.  Neither do I have to remind them of the way in which this Government sought to twist and distort the fact that they have reduced for two years in a row the amount paid by way of Christmas bonus to social welfare recipients.  They are not getting 64 per cent or 75 per cent.  They are getting less each year by Government diktat.  The only Government who have any record worth standing up for so far as doing the decent thing by the old, the needy and the less-well-off is concerned were Fianna Fáil Governments in the past.  We took those decisions even in hard times because we felt that, whoever had to suffer, certainly it should not be those who could least afford it.  That has been a basic Fianna Fáil philosophy and it will be the philosophy of the next Fianna Fáil <Col N="652" /> Government.  Obviously the people cannot wait to see that time come.</P>

      <P>I find myself in strange company this evening.  I say that with a certain amount of sadness.  I have been involved in politics, mostly as a Labour Party man, since the age of 18 to be exact.  I have always felt that I and the Labour Party were committed to helping the less well off in our society.  I am now worried that there is some change so far as this Government are concerned in their commitment to the less well off. I had believed, until this decision was announced, that they had a sympathetic approach to the less well off.  I had that impression from the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the present Minister for Social Welfare.  I am now beginning to wonder about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this occasion I find myself on the side of Fianna Fáil because they have put down the kind of motion that I indicated I would support.  I did not put down a motion, nor would not be able to get a motion on the agenda but this one put down by Fianna Fáil seems to suit my way of thinking.  Perhaps that was done <Col N="653" /> deliberately &mdash; I do not know &mdash; if it was, so be it.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to bring down Governments. This is probably the last speech I will ever make in this House because I am not seeking re-election or publicity of any kind.  I believe that £3 million in the context of £12,000 million spent by the Government every year is chickenfeed.</P>

      <P>For the sake of the expenditure of that amount of money we give a lesser rate, 64 per cent rather than 75 per cent to the less well off in our society.  It is not a lot of money either way.  The Government do not want to give those people the same rate as they received last year.  I regard £3 million, and it is £3 million at the outside, as a pittance.  Having said that, it appears that millions can be produced for other things. The Taoiseach travelled around the country recently &mdash; people said he was on an election tour; I do not know what it was and I am not concerned &mdash; but there were millions of pounds thrown here, there and everywhere for different projects, some in my constituency which were badly needed.  It is my opinion that £3 million could easily be found without destroying the finances of this State.  It would have absolutely no effect on the finances of this State, the state of our play in foreign borrowing or anything else.  If we had to borrow those £3 million, so what?  What about borrowing for the good purpose of helping the less well off?</P>
      <P>I do not blame the Minister personally in this regard.  This was a Cabinet decision for which every member must take responsibility. The Minister is a concerned person.  From my contacts with her I think she is concerned about the less well off in our society.  It appears she was not able to convince the rest of the Cabinet of the necessity at least to show that they had that sympathy.  There was the necessity for us to show that we were not going to begin pruning public expenditure by taking it from the less well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> I have shown the Minister correspondence I have received from people, people who have said they are hungry one day a week.  I speak of people in receipt of the lowest form of unemployment assistance.  They might be less hungry on that day if we gave them the extra pittance we are talking about.  We are giving them some.  Yet, for an additional £3 million, we could give them that little bit extra for Christmas.  It reminds me of giving a child £1 for sweets last Christmas and we can only afford to give him 17 shillings this year.  We should be ashamed of ourselves.  If we, as an independent State, cannot afford to keep our people from being hungry one day a week then in the name of God let us get somebody else to run this country because we are not fit to run it ourselves.</P>

It is very strange that some of the heroes who have spoken tonight voted against me on that occasion when a much more important and fundamental Bill which had a very important impact on the social welfare code was put through by the very same people who are criticising this measure tonight.

      <P>This debate has shown up one thing, that there are very few people in this House who understand the social welfare code.  I do not blame them for that.  This issue has highlighted the capacity of a Government who regard themselves as caring and compassionate to shoot themselves in the foot.  It is quite incomprehensible that any Government who set out to remove anomalies in the system, to provide a long overdue measure of equality for women and devote £17 million of scarce resources to do so, should end up causing hardship.  It is particularly incomprehensible because it is so unnecessary.  Any one of several dozen back bench TDs could have advised the Minister in plenty of time on ways and means of avoiding hardship and confusion, ways that would not have caused the spending of any more money than has already been spent.  I calculate that the Government will have spent between £40 million and £50 million on implementing this directive by the end of next year. They will have attracted much more odium than if they had cut spending by the same amount.  The reasons for this are not hard to find.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last six months staff in employment exchanges were sent circular after circular about this matter, each one countermanding the other.  When the day came to implement the directive the staff were as confused as the public they were dealing with.  Information was promised but never materialised.  Back-up services were offered but were never put in place. New categories of affected people were discovered on virtually a daily basis.  The total number of people had to be revised upwards almost every day.  In an exercise that was almost mind boggling the only <Col N="656" /> body that appeared to know what was going on was the Department that recently described itself as one of the largest users of computers in Europe.</P>
    <P>There was one very bad feature of the outcome of the review undertaken by the Government.  That outcome could and should have been announced a month or more ago.  It has been suggested to the Minister time and time again that there was no inherent equality in halving the child dependency rate if one parent was out of work.  Its restoration should not have been necessary because it should not have been cut in the first place.  The Minister has known for some time that the £10 transitional payment was too small to be effective.  I told her that when I met her.  Instead of allowing the situation to get to a point where the very survival of the Government is in question this matter could have been dealt with in a practical and commonsense way.</P>
    <P>I have been endeavouring today to try to clarify a number of issues arising from last night's announcement.  I am now satisfied in relation to a number of points. First, I am advised that the supplementary welfare arrangements put into effect in the Department to ensure that there is no hardship will be available to cover such cases that might still arise. Secondly, although it was not explicit in the Minister's announcement last night, I understand that it is the intention that several thousand families consisting of a pensioner and his wife who is still at work will be covered.  In this case it means that the extra £10 per week transitional payment will also be applied.  My calculation is that there is an additional payment but perhaps not what we would like to have seen.  The fact that the new level of payments has been increased will mean that the Christmas bonus will now amount to approximately £18.5 million. I would also like to point out to the House that if we make the calculations based on the level of payments made last year, together with the bonus payment paid this year, we will find that in cash terms the payment is slightly above that of last year.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to listen to a former <Col N="657" /> colleague of mine, Deputy Treacy, talk about the 100 per cent bonus, the double payment, when he voted last year for a payment that was 75 per cent of that of the previous year.  Again, that is the type of hypocrisy we hear in this House. Maybe if we were in Opposition we would be saying the same.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Treacy when he was speaking.  He can hand out remarks but he cannot take them.  One has to be able to give and take. We, in the Labour Party, have made an honest endeavour to correct a system that has gone very far wrong in regard to a number of anomalies.  All Members are aware of that and I am sure the Minister will be the first to accept that our social welfare system is badly in need of an overhaul.  There are many anomalies in this system and we have made an honest effort to try to redress something that had gone seriously wrong.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare have pointed out the serious anomalies in the system and I suggest to the Minister that every effort should be made by her, and the Department, to correct them. There are so many difficulties in administering the system that it is almost impossible to control.  The system was designed not for the level of unemployment we have today but for another era.  The staff in the local social welfare offices are unable to cope with the system.  The Minister, and her Department, should have a serious look at the report of the commission and make every effort to implement their recommendations in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>

The Opposition must acknowledge that 46,000 women now in receipt of social welfare have gained equality as a result of this measure.  They should also take into consideration that we are responding to the wishes of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and its affiliated unions, who have consistently pressed for the implementation of equality for women. If the Opposition are as caring as they profess to be, why is it that they did not respond to the representations made to them by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and its affiliated unions, to implement equality when they were in office?  Perhaps the Deputy concluding on behalf of the Opposition will answer that question.  A milestone has been struck.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is some balance we have heard of.  I listened with sympathy to Deputy Bell in his pathetic inept way as chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party trying to defend an indefensible position.  He spoke of hypocrisy but I should like to say that he was a neat side-stepper himself long before his entry to the House.  Deputy Bell, and Deputy Treacy, know what I am talking about.  Deputy Bell used that side-stepping opportunistically for many reasons that I will not go into now.  I thought I had heard everything until I heard the Minister for Health in his most sanctimonious tones say that he was proud of the growth in unemployment social welfare payments: in other words, a Labour Minister gloating and boasting about the growth in the numbers unemployed in the past four years.  Can one imagine a Minister, being supported by the chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, making such a statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a claim and a boast is alien to what the Labour Party once stood for. The people who are suffering under the crazy economic policies of the Government <Col N="660" /> get little joy or cheer.  The Minister for Social Welfare has made life miserable for many social welfare recipients in recent weeks.  The Government took <i>ad hoc</i> decisions weekly to try to untangle the dreadful mess she has made but each time they get deeper into the mire.  I heard Deputy Bell refer to the necessity to review the social welfare code and I do not disagree with that statement but tonight we are talking about a mere £3 million for the long term unemployed, the long term social welfare beneficiaries. That money is needed to give them a few extra pounds for Christmas.  Is it too much to ask that those who are in receipt of old age pensions, the poor, the sick, the disabled and the long term unemployed be given that consideration?</P>
    <P>I agree with those who referred to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste running around the country throwing money here and there.  Ministers have met community associations with anything from £5,000 to £50,000 in their back pockets to hand over.  I accept that some of those causes are good ones.  I expect that at the end of the year there will be unexpended balances on many schemes and that money could be used to give a few extra pounds to the poor people.  I should like to tell Deputy Bell, and his colleagues in the Labour Party, that the most conservative right wing person in Europe would not support his concept that equality had to be introduced by starving people at Christmas time.  That was a strange view to come from the chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Had the Minister attended some of my clinics last weekend she would have seen women crying in desperation.  She would not be talking tonight about equality but would be worrying about the problems of such people or those who are suffering from arthritis, asthma and other illnesses. How can a Minister, or a Government, brazenly preside over such a vicious and mean attack on the weakest section of our community?  Many Cork people who were happily at work on the eve of Christmas in 1982 when the Government took office are now among the long term unemployed and are being deprived of <Col N="661" /> what any caring and concerned Government would give them, at least the level of last year's Christmas payment.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLoughlin, who has been interrupting continuously, should understand that.  This misguided, misdirected Government, have lost their way.  There is no option for them but, for God's sake and the sake of the country, to resign. Would they let the Irish people begin to live again in confidence and hope?  It has never been forgotten that a Cumann na nGaedheal Government took a shilling from the old age pensioners, and black November 1986 will never be forgotten for this Minister or this Government who have neglected the poor, the sick and the old and unemployed.  This Minister will be remembered as the cost-cutter, first in Education, now in Social Welfare.  How can the Labour Party Members march into the lobby tonight and vote with the Government?</P>

      <P>The Government like to pretend that there have been significant improvements in welfare payments since they took office.  The real value of social welfare payments has barely kept pace with the rate of inflation under the Coalition.  The last real increase of any significance was in the 1982 Fianna Fáil budget.</P>
      <P>The Christmas bonus introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1980 is in the process of being whittled away.  The reduction of the bonus from 75 per cent of a full week's allowance to 64 per cent shows a meanness of spirit, a cold calculation worthy of a party in the tradition of Ernest Blythe. Like him, this Government are determined to cut back on the entitlements of old age pensioners and to reduce them to the bare minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition have executed U-turn after U-turn.  They do not care a damn about the wellbeing of social welfare recipients, but they will do anything to save their own political skins.  Principles <Col N="662" /> and integrity and credibility, it seems, are irrelevant to this Government.  Clinging on at any cost, irrespective of what it means for the country, is now the name of the game.  We have the spectacle of the Government and the Taoiseach making bad, indeed often indefensible, decisions and then being pushed from pillar to post by individual backbenchers seeking to salvage themselves from the impending political wreck.</P>
    <P>Is it not the truth that the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers Bruton, Hussey, Desmond and the rest of them will carry out any stroke, any deal, to purchase a few more weeks of office?  We are told there is no money for worthy causes, no money to save social welfare recipients from severe cuts in their incomes or to give old age pensioners something extra for Christmas, but let a few backbenchers threaten the Government's survival, and the State's coffers are suddenly transformed into a crock of gold from which to draw out limitless millions to ensure this utterly discredited Coalition's limping survival for another few weeks.  There is no talk then of protecting the taxpayer or the mountains of foreign debt or of fiscal rectitude.  The Minister talks of finding savings in her Department.  Were we not told that this Government maintained rigid control over public expenditure, so how is it that suddenly savings emerge, as if from nowhere?  There is now a state of total confusion as to what the Government's position is and what they have money for.  Is it not the truth that they have money for anything, if it is necessary to help them to hold on to power for a few more weeks or months?</P>
    <P>Originally, there was provision only for a £10 transitional payment plus the possibility of assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The Minister in this House on 29 October stated, &ldquo;The Government have made an effective response to the difficulties for certain families&rdquo;.  The Minister was fully backed by certain Fine Gael Deputies, who may now be less than proud of their contributions.  Deputy Owen, for example, said: &ldquo;The discrimination that has existed here cannot be removed without <Col N="663" /> causing hardship to some people&rdquo;. Ministers of State, Deputies Doyle and Fennell, thanked God for the Government's courage.  I wonder is courage exactly the word most people would use to describe this whole sorry saga.</P>
    <P>Then a couple of weeks ago as the public outcry grew, a review was promised in connection with consideration of the Estimates, the clear implication being, however, that nothing could be done until next year.  Since last night a further £10 million is to be found, and dependency allowances are to be restored. Perhaps the Minister would explain how long she proposes these arrangements will last.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that we should be discussing the equality directive, when the motion before us is about the Christmas bonus. The truth is that Deputies Cluskey and Taylor voted in this House on 29 October 1986 for the Minister's motion which stated that Dáil Éireann &ldquo;in the circumstances considers that the overall provisions are reasonable&rdquo;.  They did not have the courage to make any stand at the appropriate time.  Deputy Taylor claimed they were in &ldquo;a negotiating situation&rdquo;. That is simply not true.  There is nothing in the Minister's speech that might have indicated that there were to be any negotiations. The credibility of the Labour Party has undoubtedly suffered over this whole debacle.  Let us not forget that the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Barry Desmond, was responsible for making the arrangements which his successor was forced to defend.  On that occasion he said &ldquo;such reductions are inevitable&rdquo;.  The original directive spoke of &ldquo;the gradual application of equal treatment&rdquo;. The Coalition have tried to implement it virtually at one fell swoop. There has been political blackmail of the lowest kind and the Government succumbed to save their political necks.  That is the only thing that matters now to them &mdash; all other considerations have been thrown aside.  They are not fit to govern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> Last night the Minister for Social Welfare did another Houdini and produced another rabbit out of her hat, despite the fact that Ministers John Bruton and Deasy yesterday had said that more money would not be available.  Hey presto, suddenly money appears out of the blue: in typical three-card-trick fashion, the Minister for Social Welfare found nearly £11 million and said it came from savings.  Which Minister are we to believe?  The House and the country are entitled to be told where the savings came from.</P>
    <P>Of course there are no savings.  This is just political deception of the lowest kind. The Government blackmailers have been bribed to save the Government's political skin.  Credibility and honesty have been thrown out the window.  The only thing that now matters is what bribes will be accepted by the blackmailers.  The party once known as the party of credibility, honesty and integrity are being seen for what they are, a collection of political frauds of the lowest form.  Families on social welfare will lose £350 in a full year and families in which the wives work and earn £50 a week will lose £850.  As the Leader of the Opposition said last week, this is an obscenity and a scandal.  Sadly, in the political dealing, the half million old people and those on long term unemployment assistance have been forgotten this Christmas: they have to pay the political bribes offered to the blackmailers.</P>
    <P>This Government have completely disgraced themselves particularly over the last few weeks and survival is the only game that now matters.  Surely this section of the community deserve their support.  I implore the honest, common, decent people &mdash; and I know there are a number of them over there &mdash; to come and vote for this motion tonight because then they can face the people with honesty and integrity and they will be known for what they are, honest people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>On 11 March last I announced electricity price reductions which, as I stated at that time, were based on the savings which it was estimated would accrue to the ESB in the year ending December 1986.  Increased use of coal, reduced oil prices and favourable interest and exchange rates were expected to yield a surplus of approximately £30 million in the year.  All of this projected surplus was allocated to giving considerable price reductions to electricity consumers.</P>
      <P>It is not at present possible to say whether changes in the ESB's situation since March will increase or decrease the surplus then projected.  However, any opportunity which arises for further reductions will be taken.</P>

      <P>Following the Chernobyl accident I set up an Interdepartmental Committee to coordinate measures for dealing with the consequences of that accident and to draw up an emergency plan for dealing with any future nuclear accident which might affect this country.  It became evident at an early stage that the Nuclear Energy Board would require additional resources for its environmental monitoring programme.</P>
      <P>In May, 1986 a sum of £383,000 was approved for office and laboratory facilities for the Nuclear Energy Board.  In addition £60,000 was provided for equipment and provision was made for five extra staff.</P>
      <P>As monitoring demands continued to increase in the wake of the Chernobyl accident, the Nuclear Energy Board sought and was granted an additional £167,000 for further monitoring equipment and four extra staff.  To assist in a monitoring programme at national level, in the event of a nuclear accident, the Civil Defence organisation have acquired about 60 new dose rate meters capable of reading low levels down to background radiation.</P>
      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board has the responsibility for monitoring radioactive contamination which might result from fallout and for advising on its potential impact.  During the assessment of the Chernobyl fallout, the Irish universities and the Civil Defence organisation gave substantial assistance to the Nuclear Energy Board.  It is envisaged that this collaboration would continue in any future emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role envisaged for the Civil Defence organisation in the event of nuclear accidents has been extended to include: monitoring radiation levels throughout the country; monitoring radiation levels on ships, aircraft and vehicles at seaports, airports and border crossings, and implementing decontamination <Col N="543" /> measures as necessary; providing samples of water, grass, vegetables etc. for analysis; assisting as may be decided in implementation of control measures.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for implementing any control measures which might be required following a nuclear accident rests with various Departments and statutory authorities within their particular fields of expertise.  For example the Department of Health is currently examining the response which might be required from the health services in the event of such an accident.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the emergency plan currently being formulated is to establish a structure which will provide a co-ordinated response to a nuclear accident from all responsible departments and authorities. The plan will identify the particular responsibilities of those involved.</P>
    <P>As regards training, there are trained personnel in the various organisations which would be called upon to participate in an emergency.  For example most staff at the Nuclear Energy Board are widely experienced and the recently recruited staff are undergoing appropriate training. Civil Defence are being trained to carry out their role in anticipation of the adoption of an emergency plan.</P>

For that reason I would not wish to make any comment on the recent court proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke at length and in considerable detail about energy policy during the debate on the Estimate for my Department on 11 June 1986.  Energy policy has been continuously developed over recent years so as to improve the security of supplies. Examples of decisions which have improved long term security are the construction of Moneypoint, the successful takeover of the refinery to avert its closure and the extension of natural gas supply to a number of areas.  We are thus diversifying the types of energy used, widening the sources of supply and maximising indigenous sources.</P>
      <P>In addition, the energy State companies are submitting five year corporate plans annually now which are a basis for medium term policy reviews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the characteristics of a satisfactory energy policy is flexibility so that <Col N="549" /> changes can be made in appropriate directions to take account of significant movements in relation to prices and security of supply.  The need for this has again been demonstrated in recent times by dramatic changes in relation to a number of energy forms.</P>
    <P>Both the Energy Directorate of the EC Commission and the International Energy Agency take particular interest in long term policy, planning and review and we participate fully in their activities.</P>

      <P>From mid-November 1986 men and women claiming benefit, assistance or pension under the Social Welfare Acts are being treated equally.  Up to now a married man claiming a social welfare payment automatically got extra benefit for his wife and children but a married woman could only get the extra benefit for her husband and children in limited circumstances.</P>
      <P>Men and women will now have an equal right to claim benefit for a spouse and for children who are dependants. However the income of the claimant's husband-wife will be taken into account in deciding whether or not the extra benefit is payable for the spouse and whether the increase in benefit for the children should be paid at the full rate or at half rate.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of invalidity pension at the personal rate of £47.10 plus an allowance of £30.60 in respect of his wife and £41.05 in respect of four qualified children.</P>
      <P>His wife is employed and earning in excess of £50 a week and she cannot be regarded as an adult dependant.  Consequently, since 20 November 1986 his entitlement was assessed at £67.60 weekly, that is, £47.10 personal rate and an increase of £20.50 for four children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the special alleviating measures announced last night following the promised Government review of the cases affected by equal treatment, it has been decided that beneficiaries whose allowances have been reduced because their wives are earning over £50 a week will have their child dependant allowances restored to their full value and they will also receive an additional £10 weekly payment on a transitional basis.  This means that the pensioner in question will have his allowances for his children restored to their former value of £41.05 <Col N="566" /> and he will also receive a payment of £10, bringing his total weekly payment up to £98.15.

      <P>Prior to the introduction of equality of treatment measures in mid-November 1986, the person concerned was receiving invalidity pension at the weekly rate of £99.65, consisting of £47.10 personal rate, an increase of £30.60 in respect of his wife as adult dependant and increases of £21.95 in respect of two qualified children.  His wife was receiving disability benefit on her own record at the weekly rate of £41.10. Total income to the family was £140.75.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From mid-November 1986 men and women claiming benefit, assistance or pension under the Social Welfare Acts are being treated equally.  Up to then a married man claiming a social welfare payment was automatically paid dependancy allowances for his wife and children, but a married woman could only <Col N="567" /> get the extra benefit for her husband and children in limited circumstances.</P>
    <P>Men and women now have an equal right to claim benefit for a spouse and for children who are dependants.  However, the spouse of a beneficiary can no longer be classified as a dependant where the spouse is on social welfare payment or is working and earning over £50.  Where the spouse is receiving benefit in his or her own right both parents are entitled to the child dependant allowances with the appropriate benefits at 50 per cent of the normal rate.</P>
    <P>As the wife of the person concerned is receiving disability benefit she cannot be regarded as an adult dependant, and consequently since 20 November 1986 his entitlement was assessed at £68 weekly, consisting of £47.10 personal rate, increase of £10.90 in respect of the two qualified children (being half the normal rate) and an extra temporary weekly payment of £10 which is being paid to married men whose wives are receiving a social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>Under the additional alleviating measures announced yesterday, the person concerned will receive a further £10 per week on a transitional basis bringing his total entitlement to £78 weekly.  The disability benefit in payment to the wife of person concerned has also been increased from £41.10 to £51.05 per week since she is now entitled to be paid the full personal rate and an allowance for the children at half rate, consisting of her personal rate of £41.10 plus half the normal child dependant allowances with that benefit. The £41.10 includes an increase of approximately £5 paid earlier in the year when the rates for married women were increased to the full rates under the first stage of equal treatment.  Total income to the family between both spouses will now be £129.05 a week.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that checking systems in use in Northern Ireland and Britain for livestock grant purposes involve different levels of inspection which may reach 100 <Col N="570" /> per cent of applicants' herds in the case of the calf premium scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to modify the checking system here because the inspection of all flocks and herds (combined with the use of composite application forms to reduce farm visits to a minimum) provides a safeguard against abuse of Exchequer and EC funds at a reasonable cost (less than 2½ per cent of the grants paid).</P>
