    <P>That a sum not exceeding £252,415,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the <Col N="2183" /> Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1986 is for a net sum of £252,415,000 of which £193,865,000 or 77 per cent provides for pay and allowances.  This represents an increase of 5 per cent on the net provisional outturn for 1985.  The gross provision in the 1986 Estimate is £263,965,000.  It includes £70,100,000 for non-pay items.  The provision of £11,550,000 for Appropriations-in-Aid shows a decrease of £2,250,000 on the 1985 provisional outturn.  The Estimate is based on an average strength of 1,600 officers, 50 cadets and 12,450 other ranks, a total of 14,100 in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>Demands made on the Defence Forces continued at a high level during the past 12 months, particularly in regard to internal security matters.  While the Garda Síochána have primary responsibility for internal security, events for some years past have clearly shown the need to have a strong, well-equipped Army available to assist the Garda as required in internal security arrangements.  The rendering of such assistance to the Garda has imposed a heavy burden on the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The employment of Army personnel and resources in aid of the civil power involves the Defence Forces in a wide range of activities.  By way of illustration of the involvement of the Defence Forces in such activities, the following are some particulars of the main security tasks undertaken by the Defence Forces in 1985:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 11,000 parties were supplied in the Border area for operational duties; 9,500 check-points were set up; 15,000 patrols were sent out into the road network along the Border or in other areas; escorts for explosives and blasting operations were provided on about 900 occasions; almost 4,500 escorts for the protection of movement of cash were provided; about 150 <Col N="2184" /> requests for bomb disposal teams were handled.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Defence Forces provide guards for the movement of prisoners and assist in searches for arms, ammunition and explosives.  Certain vital non-military installations are also protected either by permanent military guards or military patrols.</P>
    <P>Deputies who may have seen our troops operating in the Border areas will have been impressed by the dedication and hard work of the troops and their readiness to support the Garda Síochána on a round-the-clock basis.  While I know that there is general recognition of the significant contribution which the Defence Forces are making in the security field, I think it is important to highlight the demands which these security operations make both in terms of manpower and resources.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the Defence Forces have the capacity to respond to requests for assistance from the Garda, the strength of the Defence Forces must be kept at an adequate level and the equipment of the forces must be kept up-to-date. While general recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force is restricted at the moment, it was possible in 1985 to have an intake of 1,070 recruits &mdash; 910 for general service to fill vacancies in operational units and 160 for the Naval Service.  As a result, the average strength of NCOs and privates for 1986 is expected to be over 300 higher than in 1985.  Stability and a sense of security are essential prerequisites for social and economic progress and although the cost is high, it is essential to maintain law and order and to preserve our democratic freedoms.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies will agree that personnel of the Defence Forces, and their colleagues in the Garda Síochána, are worthy of our highest praise and gratitude in their endeavours to maintain the peace and to uphold the rule of law for all our citizens.</P>
    <P>In the international field, the Defence Forces continue to make a significant contribution to United Nations peace keeping missions.  Their participation in <Col N="2185" /> such missions indicates in a practical way Ireland's dedication to the United Nations' aims and ideals of maintaining international peace.  By their participation in peacekeeping the Defence Forces have shown not only devotion to duty but also commitment to the service of the international community.</P>
    <P>At present an Irish contingent of about 740 all ranks is serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).  In addition eight Irish personnel are serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and 21 Irish officers are working with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in the Middle East.  The Minister for Defence will be visiting our troops in the Lebanon this weekend to see at first hand the conditions prevailing there.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the difficult and often tense situation in which troops of the Irish contingent serving with UNIFIL have been required to operate over the past 12 months.  During this period confrontations between Irish personnel and Israeli-backed militia occurred on numerous occasions and resulted in the woundering of an Irish soldier on one occasion.  Other incidents occurred as a result of firing close by Israeli-backed militia at positions held by the Irish contingent. There have been incidents involving other armed Lebanese elements, mainly at check-points manned by the Irish contingent.  In one such checkpoint incident an Irish soldier was shot and wounded.  Happily, both wounded members of the Irish contingent made satisfactory recoveries.</P>
    <P>These incidents were the subject of vigorous protests both locally to the parties involved in the conflict and also, where appropriate, to the Israeli authorities at diplomatic level.  The safety and welfare of Irish troops have been a constant source of concern to the Government and we are continuing to monitor developments in Lebanon very closely so as to avoid any unnecessary risk to Irish personnel.</P>
    <P>Despite the general unsatisfactory situation in South Lebanon, we should not underestimate the positive aspects <Col N="2186" /> attributable to the presence of UNIFIL. These include the protection and humanitarian assistance afforded to the local population and the relative stability and sense of security provided in the region by UNIFIL.  The employment of the force still appears to be the best available way of trying to ensure the withdrawal of Israeli forces to the international border and of restoring peace and the effective authority of the Lebanese Government in the area.  Efforts to resolve the causes of conflict must be continued by all the parties concerned with a view to giving the necessary co-operation to UNIFIL to enable it to implement its mandate fully.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Irish officers and men serving in Lebanon and Cyprus, and to their colleagues serving as military observers with UNTSO, for their exemplary dedication and courage in performing their difficult tasks.  I also wish to pay a well deserved tribute to Lieutenant-General Callaghan, on the relinquishment of his appointment after more than five years service as Force Commander UNIFIL.  Through his distinguished service with UNIFIL, Lieutenant-General Callaghan has brought honour to the Defence Forces and to our nation.  I wish him every success in his new appointment as Chief of Staff, UNTSO.</P>
    <P>The pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces continue to be maintained at a high standard.  The remuneration of the Defence Forces has kept pace with that of other sectors of the public service.  The pay of a recruit is now almost £121 a week rising after about 14 weeks basic training to just under £140. On advancement to Private 3 Star, which usually takes place during the first year of service, gross pay rises to more than £145, while after 3 years' service the gross pay of a private is more than £159.  I am sure that the House will agree that these rates of pay are reasonable.  The increase of 3 per cent from 1 May 1986 under the first phase of the Public Service Pay Agreement will, of course, be applied to the rates of pay of all members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Allowances are also payable to officers <Col N="2187" /> and men who perform duties of a security nature.  The rates of these allowances are kept constantly under review to ensure that personnel are adequately compensated for the duties which they are required to undertake.  As a result of the most recent review of these allowances the rates for service in the Border areas were increased to £21.28 a week for officers and £18.48 a week for men.  The allowances for other duties in aid of the civil power, such as guard duties on vital installations, cash escorts and prisoner escorts, were increased to £9.06 for each weekday and £18.12 for each Sunday or Army holiday.</P>
    <P>Great emphasis is placed on education and training in the Defence Forces. There are 99 officers at present attending full time at university and similar institutes. In addition members of the Permanent Defence Force who attend educational courses in their own time may be recouped costs of tuition and examinations.  A scheme also exists in association with AnCO whereby apprentices may be qualified in various trades.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to send a number of Defence Forces personnel on training courses overseas this year, in order that they will be competent to maintain up-to-date military equipment and to secure information and experience of military developments.</P>
    <P>Competitions for the award of cadetships in the Army and the Air Corps were held in 1985 and 34 cadetships were awarded.  Further competitions for 1986 will be advertised shortly.  I should like to draw to the attention of the House that the rule that canvassing will result in disqualification will continue to operate in respect of these competitions.  Last year 80 apprenticeships in the Army Apprentice School, Naas, and the Air Corps Apprentice School, Baldonnel, were awarded.  Competitions for the award of up to 59 apprenticeships in 1986 were advertised in February last.  The apprentices will commence training in August of this year.</P>
    <P>It is also intended later this year to commence a potential officers' course for <Col N="2188" /> up to 25 non-commissioned officers.  The course will run for nine months and the successful participants will be commissioned as officers of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>As regards the Reserve (First Line), the FCA and an Slua Muiri, I regret that because of financial considerations it is again necessary this year to reduce annual training by seven days.  However, notwithstanding the reduced period, the gratuity payable to qualified members of the reserve who complete the maximum permissible training period in 1986 will be at the full rates and not at the reduced rates which would normally apply in respect of attendance at training for the shorter period.</P>
    <P>The non-pay provisions for this year, which amount to £70.1 million, are required to maintain the capabilities of the Defence Forces and to meet commitments already made.  There is a continuous programme of improving the equipment of the Defence Forces by the provision of modern up-to-date equipment within the financial constraints necessarily imposed on all Government spending.  My Department will be in a position this year to procure some of the equipment which is more urgently required for the present needs of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>With regard to the five twin-engined Dauphin helicopters, on order from the French aircraft manufacturer, Aerospatiale, the position is that some difficulties were experienced by the manufacturer in the incorporation of certain specialised avionics into the aircraft.  This is an area of technical complexity.  However, the company has assured us that the difficulties have been overcome and the aircraft are at present being accepted by the Air Corps.  Two of the new helicopters will be used in connection with the Naval Service's partol vessel, <i>L. E. Eithne,</i> and the other three for search and rescue, air ambulance and transport services.  The aircraft will have the capability of flying at night and in conditions of reduced visability. As a result of the delay in delivery, the provision in the 1985 Vote for Defence could not be availed of and the <Col N="2189" /> provision in the Estimate for 1986 in respect of helicopters is inadequate to meet the final payments on all aircraft.  A supplementary Estimate to cover the additional expenditure involved will be necessary later in the year.</P>
    <P>The provision in subhead S of the Estimate for building and engineering works is £8.25 million as compared with last year's outturn of £7 million.  This enhanced provision will enable further progress to be made in improving accommodation and other facilities for the Defence Forces.  Included in the provision is a sum of £5.25 million for a number of new buildings and some major refurbishment works.</P>
    <P>As indicated in last year's debate, the programme for the improvement and modernisation of accommodation and facilities includes the construction of new billets and renovation of existing ones; the building of new cookhouse/dining hall complexes and the renewal of others; the development of recreational facilities; the provision of modern administrative and operational accommodation as well as suitable storage arrangements for equipment and material.</P>
    <P>Genuine progress has been made in recent years on the provision of much needed accommodation.  New billets with amenities have been provided at a number of locations and further billets are planned for Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin; Ballincolling Barracks, County Cork and in other barracks.  A scheme for the improvement and redecoration of existing billets is in hands.</P>
    <P>At present a considerable number of major projects are in train and work is proceeding on the construction of the following: Phase two of the new Ceannt Barracks, Curragh Camp; the transport stores, Clancy Barracks, Dublin; the catering complex at Casement Aerodrome; billet accommodation, Collins Barracks, Cork; the cookhouse/dining hall, Ballincollig Barracks, County Cork; and officers' quarters at Finner Camp, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Some major maintenance tasks such as reroofing and rewiring are also being undertaken.  Planning is well advanced on <Col N="2190" /> other projects such as Cavan Barracks; surgical facilities at St. Bricin's Hospital; the transport stores, Collins Barracks, Cork; refurbishment of hangars at Casement Aerodrome; billet blocks at Lifford, County Donegal, and Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin; and gymnasia at various locations.</P>
    <P>Despite the progress being made, a lot remains to be done.  As Deputies who have visited military barracks are aware, many of these barracks are well over 100 years old and are inefficient and costly to maintain.  However, I am pleased that this comprehensive programme of building and renovating is proceeding right throughout the country.</P>
    <P>On the question of soldiers' married quarters, I am happy to say that some alleviation of the problem has occurred in the past year.  The inclusion of the occupants of these married quarters in the special grant scheme administered by the Department of the Environment for the purchase of private housing, has led to the evacuation of a significant number of married quarters.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Rural Resource Organisation has been examining the possibility of providing low cost housing at suitable locations on lands which are surplus to Defence requirements.  These lands would be made available to the organisation at the Valuation Office's assessment of value.  The houses would be available for occupants of soldiers' married quarters and others.  One such project has already commenced in Knockalisheen, County Clare.</P>
    <P>The Department have a long-standing involvement in equitation through the Army Equitation School and I am glad to report the 1985 was another successful year for the school.  Army riders competed in competitions both at home and abroad, which yielded prize money in excess of £37,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Asgard II</i> completed a full programme of cruises during 1985.  The vessel covered over 12,000 miles and carried a total of over 300 trainees.  There was increased sponsorship of trainees by the Probation and Welfare Service, by St. Augustine's special school and by the Asgard Support <Col N="2191" /> Group.  The Youth Employment Agency also sponsored some trainees for the first time in 1985.  Sponsorship of this type helps young people who can derive most benefit from cruises on <i>Asgard II</i> but who are least able to afford the fees.  This is something which Coiste and Asgard are most anxious to encourage.  An coiste would like even more support from schools and clubs in inner city areas.</P>
    <P>The highlight of the 1985 season was the visit of <i>Asgard II</i> to the United States. The visit, which was undertaken in response to an invitation received from the St.  Brendan Cup Committee in America, was a great success.  The young people involved made a very favourable impression everywhere.</P>
    <P>A full programme of cruises is being carried out again this year.  The highlight of the season will be the participation of <i>Asgard II</i> in án international race of sail training vessels from Newcastle in England to Bremerhaven in West Germany in July.  The vessels will then sail from Bremerhaven to Larvik, the Norwegian port where the original <i>Asgard</i> was built in 1904.</P>
    <P>The provision of £1.71 million for Civil Defence this year underlines the importance which the Government attaches to the maintenance and development of this aspect of the State's defensive capabilities.</P>
    <P>Our philosophy as regards Civil Defence is that it can most capably be undertaken by the community itself, given the proper instruction, organisation, and basic equipments, all of which are provided by my Department in collaboration with the local authorities.  The focal point through which training and instruction are transmitted to the volunteers is the Civil Defence School in the Phoenix Park, which in terms of personnel and equipment is capable of imparting the skills necessary to mitigate the effects of war and kindred disasters on the civilian population.  The actual recruitment and organisation of the volunteers and their training locally are undertaken by the local authorities.  This has been going on for many years now with the happy <Col N="2192" /> result that the number of volunteers in active service is approaching some 20,000, with at least as many more on the trained but inactive list who are available to serve the community should the need arise.</P>
    <P>About two-thirds of the provision for Civil Defence is utilised to grant-aid local authorities in respect of their expenditure on administration, including staffing, publicity, training, exercises and competitions and on maintenance of equipment and on county control centres.</P>
    <P>As regards equipment, the Department have acquired the total requirements of a new basic radiac instrument and the stock is now available for distribution to the local authorities.  Various other purchase programmes are being continued to cater for the needs of each Civil Defence service and purchases completed this year or in train include eight fire appliances, nine personnel and equipment vehicles, a truck, four new mobile welfare trailers and a further supply of uniforms.</P>
    <P>The ongoing provision of new and replacement equipment is a vital aid to the training and operational capability of the Civil Defence services.  The contribution of the Civil Defence volunteers and of their colleagues in the voluntary aid societies to the provision of effective well-trained services in peacetime emergencies is, I am sure, well recognised. Their role in providing and maintaining a skilled response to the primary hazard of radioactive fallout is vital.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note the increasing awareness of the value of the Civil Defence volunteer organisation, with all its resources, expertise and training, which has become mainfest not only in the plans of local authorities for major peace-time emergencies but also in the demand for their assistance at various events.  This is as it should be; theory and training are all very necessary but practical application of their skills in a peacetime role will add to the effectiveness of the volunteers.</P>
    <P>I should not allow this occasion to pass without making some reference to the publicity which surrounds the recent <Col N="2193" /> nuclear accident at Chernobyl.  There have been a number of quite misleading assertions made about Civil Defence, some very prominently featured and I would be failing in my responsibility to those who serve Civil Defence if I did not correct any suggestion that Civil Defence has not planned and prepared to fulfil its responsibilities.  It is important to bear in mind that, as part of the national defence structure, Civil Defence was established principally to provide for the protection of the civil population in war time.</P>
    <P>In relation to any possible risk from the peace-time use of nuclear energy, responsibility in the first instance rests with the Nuclear Energy Board operating under the aegis of the Department of Energy.  The correct general perspective in this regard has been given in the statements made by the responsible Ministers. In so far as Civil Defence is concerned, the first requirement is regular close liaison with the Nuclear Energy Board, which does take place, and an appropriate contribution from the Civil Defence organisation should the board and the occasion so demand.  Civil Defence does have the capacity and would be prepared to make trained personnel available to assist the Nuclear Energy Board, should such assistance be deemed necessary.  A Civil Defence national, regional and county warning and monitoring network has been established, intensive training has been carried out in the detection, measurement and prediction of radioactivity and Civil Defence radiac instruments, to which I have already made reference, are capable of detecting levels of radiation over a range from very high &mdash; such as might be expected to result from a nuclear war &mdash; right down to levels below those which would entail the declaration of a state of emergency in peace time.</P>
    <P>I regret the disservice to Civil Defence personnel caused by ill-informed and misleading information.  We owe them a great debt of gratitude and to all such people who give their time and energies free in the service of their fellow citizens I express my own thanks and that of the Government.  I also take this opportunity <Col N="2194" /> to record my appreciation of the voluntary aid societies, namely, the Irish Red Cross Society, the Order of Malta and the St. John Ambulance Brigade, who make common cause with the Civil Defence casualty service in their service to the community.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the army pensions estimate for the year ending 31 December 1986, which is for a net sum of £37,330,000.  The net provisional outturn for the year ended 31 December 1985 was £36,848,000.  The 1986 Estimate represents an increase of £482,000 or a little more than 1 per cent on the 1985 provisional outturn.</P>
    <P>The main increase in the Estimate in terms of cost is £817,000 in subhead E1. This subhead provides for retired pay, pensions and gratuities granted under the defence forces pensions schemes.  The increase is due to a rise in the number of former members of the Defence Forces on retired pay and pension.  There are decreases in the subheads which relate to pensions and allowances payable to veterans of the War of Independence. This of course is attributable to a fall in their numbers.  There are now only 1,025 in receipt of military service pensions and just over 2,300 in receipt of special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts.  These represent reductions of over 300 and 700 respectively since the beginning of 1985.  The total number of pensioners, dependants and allowance holders at present being paid is approximately 18,000.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget the Minister for Finance announced a concession relating to the <i>ex gratia</i> pensions payable to the widows and children of pensionable public servants who retired or died prior to the introduction of the contributory spouses' and children's pension scheme. Since 1979 the rate of such <i>ex gratia</i> pensions stood at ?ths of the rate payable under the contributory scheme.  The Government decided to introduce full parity for such <i>ex gratia</i> pensions in two steps &mdash; on 1 January 1986 and 1 January, 1987.  The cost of this concession in respect of widows of former members of the Defence Forces will amount to £260,000 <Col N="2195" /> in 1986.  Provision for the increase will be made in the Vote for increases in remuneration and pensions.</P>
    <P>I commend both Estimates to the favourable consideration of the House. If Deputies require more information on any point I shall be glad to supply it.</P>

      <P>First, I want to congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Defence and to wish him every success in the very responsible and demanding role he has.  The fact that he is the man in Government and within the State responsible for Civil Defence gives him a major responsibility in modern times.  I look forward to many innovatory ideas being put into practical operation while he is there.</P>
      <P>I would also like to compliment and congratulate the new Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Toole, and wish him well in his new post.  I am disappointed, however, that the Government saw fit to amalgamate the very important ministry of defence which has a distinct place in our Constitution with another important Department, Roinn na Gaeltachta.  The Department of Defence should have been left as one single Cabinet responsibility in the traditional manner.  I wish Deputy O'Toole well in the very responsible dual role he now has to play.</P>
      <P>I would also like to pay tribute to and thank the former Minister, Deputy Cooney, for his co-operation and courtesy to me while he was Minister and his contribution as the political head of our Army.</P>
      <P>I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate Lieutenant Tadhg O'Neill, formerly OC of the western command on his appointment as the Chief of Staff.  I wish him well in his new rule.  He is an excellent military man and will make a major contribution to the development of our armed forces in the years ahead. I wish him well, and as a person who lives within the western command I want to say how honoured we are that a man from the western command has been chosen as Chief of Staff of the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2196" /> I would also like to thank and compliment the former Chief of Staff, Lieutenant O'Sullivan, now retired, for his courtesy and co-operation to me while he was Chief of Staff.</P>

      <P>Finally, I want to thank Dr. Somers and his staff in the Department of Defence for their co-operation and courtesy to me as spokesman on Defence.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with some aspects of the Defence Estimate.  I will go through them in more detail as we proceed.  They are all very important aspects of defence. There has been a reduction in the allocation of funds this year.  This is very serious and must be rectified either by way of supplementary estimate or by way of the prepared Estimates for next year. Defence is important to the security of this island.  The State cannot renege on its responsibility to ensure that funds are available.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the Army for their excellent performance and the level of efficiency with which they do their work.  We are fortunate that our Army has gained international recognition across the globe for the contribution they have made over the years.  I want to acknowledge that and pay tribute to them as Opposition spokesman on Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last week we had a major show of strength by the Army close to the Border.  This is a very good situation and I want to pay tribute to the men and officers involved.  The efficiency and co-operation and camaradarie between the various units of the Army, the battalions and commands and the co-operation and co-ordination between the Army, the military police and the Garda Síochána were excellent.  This will have a very good effect on morale within the Army and in <Col N="2197" /> regard to security generally.  It demonstrates that we recognise the responsibility we have to the people of Northern Ireland and I am delighted that the Army decided to have that show of strength in the Border area.</P>
    <P>There was also tremendous co-operation with the FCA who manned the various Army barracks when the Army were along the Border.  This is very good. It is essential for us to recognise the importance of the first line reserve and the role they have to play.  I am disappointed that again this year there is a cutback in the involvement and training of the FCA; they are confined to seven days' training this year.  At the moment morale is low in the FCA.  They are affected by emigration.  Their numbers have reduced over the past two years and it is time we recruited people into the FCA and made more money available for training to keep morale high and create opportunities for people who want to be involved in this tremendous national service. The radiation disaster at Chernobyl demonstrates the necessity we may have to call on defence, both civil and military. It is therefore important to review and renew all levels of defences and ensure that all people anxious to do so are given an opportunity to play their proper role in the defence of this country.  I therefore regret that the amount of money that should have been made available by the Department in 1986 has not been made available.</P>
    <P>The Army often comes to the aid of the civil power.  The Minister has outlined in detail the contribution they have made in the normal traditional way.  This has not been acknowledged by many people. We must pay tribute to the Army for the tremendous back up they give to the civil power.  This is a major draw on the financial and personal resources of the military powers and it must be acknowledged.  It is important to look at the constant need to have the Army available as an aid to the civil power in the event of incidental disaster, national disaster or international disaster.</P>
    <P>Specific plans should be available to ensure that the Army can be brought <Col N="2198" /> quickly and efficiently to aid the civil power at all times.  A few years ago sections of the Army were being called very quickly to aid the civil power in the south eastern part of this country.  That plan was not too specific or too clear.  The durability, flexibility and resilience needed by the Army in coming to the aid of the civil power can be diminished and frustrated if there is not a detailed plan.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the Army, particularly for the contribution they have made to world peace keeping. Various battalions have served with the United Nations Interim Force in the Lebanon and have made a major contribution in trying to restore that hotbed of tension to normality and bringing about a balanced sense of dignity and a certain life style to the people in that area.  I also want to pay tribute to the soldiers and officers who served there and in particular to wish the 59th Battalion who are serving there at present, every success.  I also want to pay tribute to Lieutenant General Callaghan and to wish him well in his new position as Commander of UNTSO.  He was previously the Force Commander with UNIFIL and brought distinction to the Irish Army and to this country.  We are delighted he is the man in charge of UNTSO and I wish him well.</P>
    <P>We have a duty as an independent neutral nation and as a member of the United Nations and the European Economic Community to play our role in international affairs and to bring pressure whenever we can to ensure that all members of the United Nations and all nations with a commitment to peace, bring peace and stability to mankind and play their proper role.  It is disappointing that some of the wealthier nations are reneging on their commitments to the United Nations peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>The mandate for UNIFIL was in doubt some weeks ago but it has been renewed for a three month period as distinct from a six month period heretofore.  This is disappointing and it cannot be good for the morale of the personnel serving with UNIFIL.  This can also lead to confusion in the Department because the Army will <Col N="2199" /> not be sure where they are going or when. If the members of the United Nations have not an international commitment then world peace will be constantly under threat.  The bigger nations, the super powers and the smaller nations like Ireland have a common international duty to bring peace and stability to the world.  I appeal to this Government and to all Irish politicians at all international fora to highlight Ireland's contribution in this area and to stress that all nations have a responsibility to make their contributions physically and financially.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that £20 million is owed to this country in contributions which should have been paid by members of the United Nations over the years &mdash; as far back as our involvement in the Congo in 1962.  Twenty million pounds is a very large sum to a small country.  If we had that money we could build a new Army headquarters, buy new military equipment, provide greater opportunities for Army personnel and ensure that they could compete with the sophisticated equipment which is available to other Armies.  This is a point which should not be lost sight of.  If a member of the Government, a TD or an international diplomat gets the opportunity, he should make this point because the contribution Ireland has made will stand the test of time.  We have made a unique contribution to world peace and the more often we highlight that the greater the honour we can bring to this country.</P>
    <P>The amount being made available for defence equipment has been reduced by 14 per cent on the 1985 figure.  This is a very big reduction when one realises that our equipment is almost obsolete, some of it almost 35 years old and costing more to restore and keep in working order than to replace it with new equipment.  I know tests are being carried out regularly in this area and I hope that at least some of the equipment will be purchased in 1986. We need a great many small arms urgently and a flexible type of adaptable folding stock should be purchased to ensure that we get the maximum use from this equipment.  When the Government <Col N="2200" /> are considering purchasing this equipment I hope they will bear in mind the fact that we are a neutral, non-aligned country and if possible we should purchase this equipment from another non-aligned country.  There are a number of such countries who are anxious to sell that equipment.  I hope the Government and the Department will take this view into consideration when they are buying this equipment.</P>
    <P>Earlier I complimented the Minister of State and wished him well in his new role. Civil Defence is very important as was amply demonstrated recently when there was a radiation leak from Chernobyl some 1,500 miles away.  Radioactive dust was blown across Europe into Ireland. Compare this position with Sellafield where we have a silent nuclear oozing volcano only 60 miles from our shore. This shows that the Department have a grave responsibility in this area.  I am very disappointed that only £1.7 million has been allocated for Civil Defence in 1986, a 2 per cent reduction on the 1985 Estimate. I am not satisfied with the equipment available for Civil Defence.  I appeal to the Minister of State and the Government to take a new critical look at Civil Defence <i>vis-á-vis</i> investment, administration and the provision of equipment.  I know that about 20,000 volunteers are involved and available for active service at any time, but the vast majority of the people are aware of the consequences of an incidental small disaster or an international major disaster.</P>
    <P>While Sellafield is so close to our country we must always ensure that the maximum protection is available for our people.  The time has come for a critical look at all of this.  We must have a new, vigorous, co-ordinated programme of Civil Defence activity right across the country.  The Minister of State assured us today that the whole Civil Defence organisation and co-ordination are in order, but from my investigation I think there is not sufficient commitment within local authorities or sufficient opportunity to make local authority members and the public at large aware of the need to have constantly available the Civil Defence <Col N="2201" /> mechanism to meet the event of any holocaust or disaster.</P>
    <P>I must question the fact that the Department of Defence are responsible for grants-in-aid to local authorities in respect of expenditure on administration. Local authorities have administration and the Defence Estimate should not be responsible for any contribution <i>vis-à-vis</i> expenditure on the administration of Civil Defence.  There is ample administration within all our local authorities to ensure that they carry that burden and that people responsible therein are readily known to the public.  I question also the responsibility for expenditure on staff.  Again local authorities have excellent staff and there is no reason why we should be responsible for any expenditure on staffing.  I know we would be responsible for publicity, training, exercises, competitions and the maintenance of equipment.</P>
    <P>What equipment have we?  Where is that equipment?  How much have we got? Is it modern or obsolete?  Tomorrow the all-Ireland finals of Civil Defence competitions will be taking place in Westport and in three countries on the western seaboard only one Civil Defence Group are involved.  I presume that is fairly similar to what prevails in other parts of the country.  A new programme of Civil Defence activities must be promoted and an invitation extended to all civic minded people to make their contributions to Civil Defence.  It is vital that we have a proper co-ordinated programme involving the Department of Defence, local authorities and all public servants within urban and rural areas.  By that I mean members of the Garda Síochána should be fully trained in and know exactly the position on Civil Defence matters and that local people can identify with that.</P>
    <P>Members of the postal authorities and postal staff who are constantly in communication with the people, State and semi-State employees should also be involved and should understand and be able to react to any occurrence if the necessity arises.</P>
    <P>A major amount of money should be spent on publicity for Civil Defence.  All <Col N="2202" /> State and semi-State and public buildings throughout the country should carry posters indicating who the local Civil Defence officer is and whom to contact in any emergency.  We must bring Civil Defence down to the people at ground level.  We must ensure Civil Defence activity within ten miles of every fairly large centre of population and, indeed, in hamlets throughout the country where there is any concentration of population.  The farthest anybody should be away from a Civil Defence officer should be ten miles. We must create such a new, co-ordinated programme involving staffs and members of the public service in all areas.</P>
    <P>In modern times successive Governments have invested large amounts of money in various community centres and in the provision of public and civic buildings.  Consideration must be given in future where State funds are being expended to providing within those buildings community facilities and safe, strongly protected areas against the event of a nuclear holocaust &mdash; although they may not be of much use after that &mdash; or in such event as a nuclear leak from Sellafield.  We must recognise the terrible disaster that any type of nuclear leak is and our difficulty if there were to be a major disaster in Sellafield.</P>
    <P>It is time that we considered control instrumentation for monitoring radiation. The radiac workshops in Clancy Barracks have had such equipment since the fifties.  Is that equipment up to date and sufficiently accurate in the context of the sophisticated progress made in atomic and nuclear developments over the past 30 years?  Again it begs the question: how safe are we on this island now?</P>
    <P>We must renew our commitment to bring Civil Defence to the people and ensure constant awareness of its importance to our community, and that people will be properly trained, actively involved and available at any time of difficulty.  I hope the Minister of State will spare no effort to ensure that a new programme of Civil Defence is implemented and that every opportunity will be availed of to provide funds for Civil Defence activities particularly next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2203" /> I commend the Minister for Defence and the Minister for the Environment on their consideration of the proposals put forward by me and by other speakers in this House over the past year to ensure that the special grant for relocation from local authority houses and in this case from Army houses, would be made available to members of the Army. Under section 107 of the Defence Act, 1954, members of the Defence Forces or reservists called out or to be called out on permanent service are exempt from any kind of criminal liability for debts incurred.  This has created major difficulty for members of the Defence Forces. The special £5,000 grant is available and many Army members wish to purchase their own homes and get mortgages, and financial institutions are not prepared in many cases to consider applications from members of the Defence Forces for mortgages and financial assistance.  I asked the Minister to consider bringing legislation into this House to amend the Act and to put members of the Defence Forces would par with ordinary citizens in that regard. Members of the Defence Forces would welcome that.  Officers are exempt from the provisions of section 107 of the Defence Act, 1954.  I ask the Minister to give that priority because a small number of people are in difficulty in that regard now.  I hope such legislation can be brought forward quickly, perhaps in this session.</P>
    <P>Maintenance staff are taken on annually by the Department.  Last year a fairly large number of staff were taken on and, as far as I know, last month the Department agreed to take on some 100 men on a temporary basis, but I understand this is being held up because some of the names omitted from last year's list have been questioned.  The names of a small number of men have not been forwarded for various disciplinary reasons and I hope that the other 100 people who are anxious to continue the temporary work which they do each year in the Department in the maintenance area would be taken off the unemployment <Col N="2204" /> register and given an immediate opportunity of working in this area.  I hope this will not be held up any longer.</P>
    <P>The time has come to reconsider the system of awarding medals for distinguished service in the Defence Forces. Members of the Army who go overseas on international duties readily recognise that, compared to other armies, the number of awards we make are not very numerious.  They are prestigious and distinctive awards for those who receive them but many military people who never left this country have been honoured for exemplary domestic service while others who risked their lives at home and abroad, and in some cases lost their lives, have not been honoured.  The victims of the Niemba ambush in the Congo are a typical example.  These men risked their lives for the honour and glory of Ireland and the cause of world peace.  Many lost their lives on that occasion and a special medal for gallantry should be awarded to the survivors posthumously.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the situation as it seems that various decisions have been made in regard to not awarding these special medals.  They were a very gallant group who lost their lives in the early sixties and I hope on the 25th anniversary of Niemba these men will be honoured in a special way and the medals presented to their families.</P>
    <P>I understand the frustration many people feel in regard to expenditure on internal defence security but we must at all times ensure the safety of our people, territory, institutions and installations and the right of people to pursue their activities in a normal manner.  All this places a major drain on our civil and financial resources and are proof positive of the chaotic situation which we have reached in regard to security.  I want to pay a tribute to the Army for their contribution in that field and for aiding the civil power.  Individual citizens and those in commercial life have no option but to spend millions of pounds on an ever-growing security industry, which is a sad reflection on modern times.</P>
    <P>There seems to have been a complete slowing down of the recruitment of <Col N="2205" /> women into the Army over the last few years.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not make any reference to the provision of new headquarters for the Department of Defence.  It is imperative that the Minister and the Department should proceed immediately with the provision of a new headquarters as the conditions in which Department of Defence staff and senior Army personnel have to operate are not conducive to getting the best contribution from them and it is also very bad for morale.  The location for the new headquarters is strategic. While I know that the Government plan to fund it on the basis that it will not have to be paid for until the building has been completed and will probably be passing on the cost to another Government, nevertheless it is important in view of the historical documents which are stored in bad conditions, to have a proper army complex, especially in view of the fact that the other heads of State and military personnel will visit it.  People operating in the present headquarters cannot possibly give a modern, efficient service and I hope the Minister of State can tell us when work will start on the new headquarters.</P>
    <P>The provision for pensions in 1986 is only 1 per cent greater than that for 1985. I appeal to the Minister to abolish the means test for surviving members of the Old IRA.  These people risked their lives in gaining freedom for this country and there are not many survivors.  As an acknowledgment to their contribution to the founding of the State, we should abolish the means test for the few who are left.</P>
    <P>It is a coincidence that we are discussing the Defence Estimate on International Disarmament Day, designated as such by the United Nations.  Ireland as an independent, non-aligned, neutral, democratic state has consistently expressed concern at the inherent dangers in the escalation of arms growth.  We believe that the need to make efforts to halt the arms race and towards effective disarmament, with special regard to militarisation and the production of nuclear, conventional and chemical weapons, is <Col N="2206" /> very important.  I hope that we will avail of every opportunity as politicians, as members of Government and at a diplomatic level to ensure that we will continue to strive to bring about the deescalation of the present serious situation. It is ironical that we are discussing the Estimate on such a day although I am not sure what arrangements have been made to celebrate it here.  Perhaps the Minister of State could enlighten us in that regard.  We must take that into account and be always conscious of it. We must at all times make an effort to bring about peace and stability not alone here but throughout the world, as we have been doing consistently down the years.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Army to display its ability, its colour and the contribution it is making to an Irish way of life.  The Army School of Music has not been used to the maximum to project the image of the Army.  The bands of the various commands should be used on more public occasions to highlight another facet of Army life.  It appears that there are constraints on those bands. They do not get many opportunities to play at public functions.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to note that the Estimate has been reduced under many headings. There has been a reduction of 14 per cent under the heading of defence equipment, a reduction of 2 per cent for Civil Defence and of 6 per cent in the contribution to the Irish Red Cross.  The latter organisation has made a major contribution down the years and is deeply involved in Civil Defence.  I hope the Minister will reconsider those cuts in the coming year.  He should ensure that sufficient funds are made available to the Civil Defence and the Irish Red Cross.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister saw fit to reduce the Estimate for the sail training scheme on <i>Asgard II.</i> A new departure under that scheme is that those going on the sailing trips will be charged. The many young adventurous people anxious to participate in this scheme should not be charged.  The Minister should consider encouraging children from less well off areas to go on those <Col N="2207" /> sailing trips.  It appears that it is the intention of the Government to charge for all services provided by the State, and that is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State, who has a special responsibility for Civil Defence, to organise a display later in the year by Civil Defence personnel so that the population will be made aware of the ability of those involved to deal with emergencies.  I suggest that the Minister should consider following the example of the Army who carried out a wonderful display last weekend.  It is important that the people are aware of what the personnel of Civil Defence can do.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Skelly, the next contributor, that 22 minutes remain for this debate, because I must call on the Minister to reply at 12.15 p.m., and that Deputy Haughey is offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to confine my remarks, but it is disappointing to learn that only a limited amount of time is available for the debate on this important topic.  I do not think this Estimate has been taken seriously by the House, given the economic crisis the country is facing. Everybody loves the Army, but the Opposition spokesman on Defence did not go into the cost factor involved.  He did not deal with the cost of the Army to the taxpayer.  This debate is about how the Minister is running the Department of Defence and whether taxpayers are getting value for money.  It appears that Members are afraid to criticise, even constructively, the Army.  We are fortunate that the Army has not had to engage in combat on this island in recent times; but we might not be so affectionate towards the Army if, like the British Army in Northern Ireland, many soldiers were killed.  Those deaths prompted people in Britain to call for a withdrawal of the Army, and if our sons were being slaughtered up there we might adopt a different attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that 14,000 people <Col N="2208" /> are in the Permament Defence Forces and that 11,000 parties were supplied in the Border area for operational duties, a decrease on the figure for the previous year when 14,000 parties were supplied. Given the amount of wages paid to soldiers, it appears that 1,200 people were involved in doing that work.  One is tempted to ask what the other 12,500 soldiers are doing apart from those who are on international duty.  It appears that a lot of time is spent on escort patrols for the transport of explosives and blasting operations &mdash; there were 900 such patrols &mdash; on the protection of the movements of cash and on bomb disposal duty.  In addition, the Defence Forces provide guards for the movement of prisoners and soldiers are used in searches for arms and so on.  If the Army is being used in that way should we not examine its role and ask ourselves if it is necessary to have an Army of that size and if we should spend so much money maintaining it and the paraphernalia that goes with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give much reason for the Army and said that the stability and a sense of security are essential prerequisites for social and economic problems and that, although the cost was high, it was essential to maintain law and order and preserve our democratic freedoms. That begs the question.  &ldquo;Are our democratic freedoms under threat&rdquo;? Recently we concluded an Anglo-Irish Agreement and it is fair to say that we have friendly neighbours.  We have a problem in regard to terrorism and a problem in the North that certainly warrants back-up security services, but is it necessary to this extent?  Taking into consideration the cost of maintaining such personnel and equipment, are they effective? Are the Army in a position to be effective if they have to swing into action?</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Defence in 1984 showed a certain lack of faith in the Army being able to do the job which they are consitutionally required to do, that is, safeguarding the State against attack from external forces.  He said:</P>
    <P>We are hardly in a position to defend <Col N="2209" /> our neutrality as we stand now.  It would cost thousands of millions of pounds if we were to try to enhance our defence capacity to put us in that position.</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>Because of the size of the Army, their capacity is extremely limited and being ideologically and geographically allied to the western block, we can confidently rely on it to protect our territory should any State or combination of States hostile to the western world threaten it.</P>
    <P>These are the only indications that I can winkle out of debates on Defence Estimates over the past couple of years that there has been any real discussion about the need for the Army.  I know the Army are held in great affection in the hearts and minds of the people and by all Members of the Dáil and Ministers. However, people should not become paranoiac if Members go so far as to question that need, as I am doing.</P>
    <P>On 3 March last, I tried to draw the attention of the House to this matter by asking two questions, one about the cost of the Army and one concerning the need for it.  I think people understood what I was getting at.  I got much flak about that in recent times from Army personnel. On an occasion at a formal private party when leaving the dance floor with my wife, I was accosted by a very senior Army man in military dress concerning my cheek or audacity in asking those two questions and my reference to the outmoded system.  He invited me to come to his quarters so that he could show me that he was available to his soldiers at all times.  I did not accept that invitation. Yesterday at a function on Constitutional Day at the German Embassy, I was approached by another senior Irish officer who was very annoyed that I should dare question the role of the Army.  He said that my remarks were insulting.  The Army are very sensitive about that.</P>
    <P>I have been waiting for a long time to debate these matters, perhaps under the <Col N="2210" /> heading of Defence policy, rather than on a limited Estimate.  We should have had much more time available to discuss the Estimate.  This was the case in 1981 when Deputy Haughey was Taoiseach.  I should like to have had the opportunity to go into the matter more deeply and have many suggestions concerning the £263 million annual Estimate, the workings of the Army, the total ethos surrounding it, its value to the country.  I shall not go into the UNIFIL operations or our efforts for the United Nations, except to say that we should be questioning the value we are getting for these.  We appear to be getting merely our daily running costs for providing these services for the United Nations.  However, the super powers are making a huge profit in their case.  Some are running their economies on what they are getting for the manufacture and supply of military equipment.  Deputy Treacy rightly pointed out that the costs we are incurring are not paid immediately.  I do not know if we are getting interest on these amounts.  If we are needed to supply a backup service because of the mess that the super powers are making in different parts of the world, risking lives in so doing, we should be paid adequately for that.</P>
    <P>I have not time to make the speech I intended to make, but summing up, there is nothing sinister about my questioning the role of the Army since 1922, bearing in mind what the situation was like from the twenties to the fifties.  The Army offered a sinecure, as far as the officers were concerned.  There have not been many casualties in the Army, or much conflict.  We might have a different attitude on the matter if that had not been the case.  In order to keep 14,500 people employed, we are providing £263 million in this Estimate.  Bearing in mind that we are a neutral country, we should be getting away from such cost, but we appear to want to expand and encourage the Army.  There is not the slightest hope in the world of a little country like this ever getting into the big league and supplying the technology necessary for the Army.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2211" /> I should like to see armies eliminated altogether, if that were possible.  Soldiers are trained to kill and if we keep going along this road people might be killed, not the odd unfortunate soldier killed on duty on behalf of the nation in different parts of the world, or as in the awful accident which killed four children from my constituency who were walking through the Glen of Imaal a few years ago and whose relatives were never compensated. Many could be killed.  Had I time, I should have referred to what Deputy Haughey said as Taoiseach, giving his objective in starting negotiations with the British Prime Minister as a reduction in the threat to peace for our people.  I hope an opportunity will arise over the next year or two to debate this matter fully, but I am sure that it will not. I regret that, on a Friday when we have plenty of time available, we must proceed to the Public Service Estimate in the afternoon.  I do not think there is a speaker lined up on this side of the House, apart from the Minister himself. Here we have £263 million going through on the nod and we cannot discuss the subject as we should like.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Skelly for giving me a few moments.  I fully agree with him that it is absolutely ridiculous that on this matter we have not time even to look deeply into this Estimate, even the financial Estimate itself, apart altogether from discussing much broader issues of policy which are presenting themselves increasingly urgently to us today.  I must comment very briefly on the statement by the Minister in the early part of his speech today &ldquo;that while the Garda Síochána have a primary responsibility for internal security events for some years past have shown clearly the need to have a strong well-equipped Army available to assist the gardaí as required in the internal security arrangements.&rdquo; That is perfectly true as far as it goes, but it is a totally inadequate statement of what policy should be.  Just to indicate that that seems to be the only role of the Defence Forces <Col N="2212" /> at this stage of our affairs is quite ridiculous.</P>
      <P>I wanted to get in very quickly to say that one of our greatest concerns at present must be the adequacy of our Civil Defence and the other arrangements which we should have for dealing with the effects of a nuclear accident such as that which occurred recently at Chernobyl. Since Chernobyl there have been a few other accidents, what some people would call minor accidents but which I would regard as serious, one recently again at this menace of Sellafield.</P>
      <P>On the 11 o'clock RTE news summary a member of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission was quoted as saying that a Chernobyl type of accident is inevitable in the United States in the next 20 years and that the reactors are not designed and not able to cope with serious accidents.  That is a pretty chilling statement from a member of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Surely, all these things indicate to us the need to take this whole nuclear menace much more seriously and deal with it much more urgently than we are doing. In the moment or two available to me I want to appeal especially to the Minister of State and, through him, to the Minister to have a complete and thorough review of our Civil Defence apparatus and evolve a policy for dealing with the different types of nuclear dangers that now present themselves to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said in this House on another occasion that there was perhaps a defensible theory by some people that in the event of a nuclear war holocaust, no one would survive and, therefore, there was no point in doing anything in the Civil Defence area.  That has now been shown to be erroneous.  It is clear that we can have nuclear dangers coming to us against which we can take some measure of defence.  I want to reiterate again the simple truth that this Government are misleading us in regard to the danger of Sellafield.  We had that question debated in this House on two separate occasions and on both those occasions the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy <Col N="2213" /> endeavoured to create an impression that we could have this menace of Sellafield dealt with through the European Commission.</P>
    <P>I want to say categorically in this House that that is not so.  I have ascertained for myself beyond doubt that there is no inspection mechanism available to the European Community or to the European Commission that will do what this Government are purporting to say to us they want done.  It is not just that there is no inspectorate which would have the capacity to inspect Sellafield from the point of view of safety, but it is almost certain that the European Community have not got the legal capacity to create such an inspectorate.  Will the Government please accept that position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by saying that the only remedy available to us is to confront the British Government directly and bilaterally on the danger of Sellafield. Like other Deputies such as Deputy Skelly, there are many other aspects of this Defence Estimate that I would like to talk about but because of the constraints I will confine myself to that one aspect.  I ask the Minister to concentrate at this stage on a complete review and reassessment of our Civil Defence capability and evolve a policy and apparatus capable of dealing with the very real menace of nuclear fallout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies for their contributions.  In the short time I have I will concentrate on replying to the points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy mentioned the recent exercises close to the Border.  One of the important reasons for having these exercises close to the Border is to enable the defence forces to familiarise themselves with the terrain and to ensure that <Col N="2214" /> they are a backup to the civil power which, indeed, they are at all times.  The Government are always anxious to ensure that along that area we do have adequate security for the protection of the people living there.  That can be done by having regular exercises.  This shows to people who might have notions and ideas that there is a real intent to ensure that they cannot use that area as a haven for their illegal activities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy suggested that the morale of the FCA is low and that numbers had reduced over the past few years. In 1984 and 1985 recruitment did take place to replace the wastage which had occurred over those periods of time.  I believe that morale is high and there was no significant variation in numbers over that period of time.  It is important to say that.  Last year, recruitment was 1,070 which was a reasonably large intake. Slightly over 900 were taken into the general service and 160 into the Naval Service.  This brings the total numbers to 12,500 which we believe is adequate to meet the needs which are there.  Like anything else, one must review the strength of the Army from time to time and look at their needs and requirements. At present, we are satisfied that what we are doing is adequate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy raised the question of military medals for gallantry.  This was dealt with some time ago.  The Defence Force Regulations provide that awards of military medals for gallantry or a Distinguished Service Medal should be made by the Minister for Defence on the recommendations of a military board appointed by the Chief of Staff for that purpose.  Therefore, it is an internal Army situation.  The Minister would take advice from that board.  It is better to do it that way rather than the Minister or some civilian body making decisions on this matter.  The Army on the ground are the better people to know when that type of medal should or should not be awarded.  I would be satisfied to leave it that way.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the overall effect of Civil Defence.  Civil Defence play a very important and effective role <Col N="2215" /> throughout the country.  Some areas are better than others.  That is the result of how active a local authority are and the type of staff they have.  I want to assure the House that we are always trying to ensure that Civil Defence are effective and how we can make them more effective.</P>
    <P>The Chernobyl accident has quite clearly indicated that there is a need to ensure that we can deal with a problem that could arise, not necessarily at Sellafield but in France or other parts of Europe which are quite close to us.  An annual exercise has been held for many years involving networks right across the board.  RTE television is available for the purpose of warning and monitoring and the health boards and local authorities are also involved.  This is a mock nuclear fall-out and is a very effective exercise. With regard to the equipment and the meters which monitor the fall-out, new stock has been acquired to ensure that we have an up-to-date and efficient system.  I am glad to say that this equipment is manufactured in Ireland.  We continue to look at this.  We must encourage our voluntary organisations to participate in this.  Deputy Treacy indicated that it should be devolved down to the people. That is basically what it is.  The local authority is the forum through which it operates.  There are people working fulltime on this in the local authority.</P>
    <P>When wearing my Defence hat I would be quite happy to think that the local authorities would foot the bill for the general operations, but when wearing my Environment hat I would like to think that the other Department would look after it.  The important thing is that it works effectively and efficiently.  We will continue to look at this, because changes take place and lessons have to be learned. What happened quite recently brought home to us all that what can happen overnight can affect a whole country and a whole way of life.  I take that seriously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly raised the question of the purpose of the Defence Forces.  I did not think that question would be raised. It is necessary for many reasons.  We all <Col N="2216" /> known that there are subversives operating in our society.  They quite clearly stated that when they dealt with one part of our country they would then turn their attentions to this part.  If, when people specifically spell out what they intend to do, we sat back with a cosy, complacent, neutral, non-aligned attitude to those people, then they would fulfil that promise. Any civilised state that wants to maintain its democratic institutions must have an Army.  We are fortunate that we have an Army of the highest calibre.  The people not only hold it in affection but also in high esteem.  They look to it with confidence because of its impartiality &mdash; it is totally independent, as any army should be.  There is an army in all neutral countries.  The exercises at the Border are a clear indication of where we stand in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey raised the question of Sellafield and the Government's intention or lack of it in this regard.  I totally disagree with this.  He doubted whether or not there could be a European inspection. If we want supervision we should be part of the European Community and if we want effective action it must be done through that Community.  I have attended Council of Ministers meetings on Environment.  They have brought in laws prohibiting leaded petrol.  They are going to bring in laws which will prevent the emissions from cars.  That will happen because the EC and the Council of Ministers can make these decisions.  Because of what happened in Chernobyl the Europeans will take this much more seriously. I raise this point because it was raised by Deputy Haughey but it does not come within the responsibility of this Department.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Energy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish they would look after it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that they are looking after it and that the Government are dealing with it in the right way.  It is easy to pass bland motions in this House about the closure of Sellafield or about doing one thing or another <Col N="2217" /> and then to walk away and say we have done a good job.  We must look at this in a much more positive way.  Approaches have been made to the UK Government at all levels, including approaches, from the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and my own Minister in the Department of the Environment, Deputy Boland, who had talks quite recently on this matter.  It should be done through an international inspection unit by the EC.  That would be a positive contribution.  If we think that by throwing our hands in the air, bemoaning it every now and again and hoping that that is the way it will be done, we are living in cloud cuckooland.  It might be good for the optics but it has no real effect at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such inspectorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware of that. This country have taken up the cudgels to get that inspectorate going.  We do not intend to be pushed aside.  If we are to have muscle in this area it must be through a body such as that.  We would have the support of the largest countries in Europe to bring about the kind of pressure we all want to see to ensure that whatever plants are operating are operated in a safe and better way.  I am not taking issue with the Deputy, but I believe what we are doing is right and he obviously believes that his approach is better.  The Government are very concerned about this and we are dealing with it in a responsible way.</P>
      <P>I wished to refer to other points but time does not allow it.  Deputy Treacy mentioned means tests.  They have been relaxed progressively over the years and they are now far from severe.  It is negligible and we can look at it again from time to time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The past year has been a period of solid achievement by my Department and I am very pleased to be able to outline for the <Col N="2219" /> House some of the significant developments in the performance of the Department during that period.  I am fully committed to building on the developments to date and continuing progress during my term of office.  The high point of 1985 was the publication in September of the Government's White Paper on the Public Service <i>Serving the Country Better.</i></P>
    <P>The development of the public service which the White Paper proposes in not just for its own sake but for the public and the taxpayer who at the end of the day are entitled to receive from the public service courtesy and efficiency in dealing with their affairs.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to the implementation of the White Paper is also beyond doubt.  The commitment can be seen in their decision to underpin with legislation many of the decisions in the White Paper.  The drafting of the Public Service Development Bill is well underway and I am continuing my efforts to bring it before the House at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Government are also receiving regular progress reports on implementation. Efforts to date have been very encouraging particularly in relation to the introduction of management systems but we still have a long way to go.  I can assure the House of my continuing determination to achieve the aims and targets set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Mention of management systems brings me to what is essentially the foundation stone of the White Paper.  The management system which is proposed for Departments is based on the following elements:</P>
    <P>the identification of the aims, objectives and programmes of the Department.</P>
    <P>the assignment of responsibility and authority for the achievement of the objectives of each programme to individual managers together with the necessary budgets.</P>
    <P>the identification of the results expected from each manager during a <Col N="2220" /> specific period and the measurement of results.</P>
    <P>the development of a climate of cost effectiveness and more critical examination of programmes and their value for money.</P>
    <P>This system emphasises personal responsibility and accountability for results and value for money and, while it may not appear to be very novel to Deputies who have business experience, it is a significant development in the very different circumstances of a Government Department.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed that there should be total uniformity in the development of management systems across the Civil Service. That would make a nonsense of the White Paper proposals and would probably be doomed to failure.  Provided that the general guidelines are adhered to, Departments are free to adapt the system to their own requirements.  My Department has and will continue to make its expertise in this area available to other Departments to help in developing their systems.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to bring about through the management systems a situation in which Civil Service managers will produce good results because of the system in which they operate rather than in spite of it.  The latter, all too often, has been the situation up to now.  The harnessing to better effect of the considerable commitment and potential which exists among Civil Service managers is a point I will touch on later.</P>
    <P>As to the degree of progress which has actually been made in introducing management systems, this has varied across Departments.  My Department first introduced a system of accountable management during 1984 and since then has refined the system so that we now have a comprehensive plan for the management of the Department.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the White Paper substantive progress in the introduction of management systems has been made in a number of other Departments. I shall be expecting further evidence of progress by the time of the next report to <Col N="2221" /> Government and I take this opportunity to impress on all Departments the need to give priority to removing any obstacles which at present hinder their progress in developing appropriate systems.</P>
    <P>The introduction of management systems is a fundamental step if Departments are to improve the service they provide.  It is not however the only step. Departments need to look at what areas of their activities could best be carried out in separate executive offices.  The Public Service Development Bill will empower Ministers to set up executive offices to cater for large volumes of executive work.</P>
    <P>The offices will have a large degree of autonomy in carrying out the work assigned to them.  The establishment of such offices will free Ministers from involvement in time consuming routine administration and give them more time to concentrate on longer term planning and policy issues.  The officials responsible for the offices will be able to concentrate on the delivery of services in the most efficient and cost-effective way. Ministers will not, of course, relinquish any policy-making functions under these arrangements.</P>
    <P>While the formal establishing of such offices must await the passing of the Public Service Development Bill, progress has already been made in one area on a non-statutory basis.  The Department of Social Welfare is in the process of establishing a Social Welfare Services Office to cater for the making of social welfare payments.  Other examples of possible executive offices mentioned in the White Paper are the Central Statistics Office, the Air Navigation Services Office and the Meteorological Service.</P>
    <P>As further proof of their commitment to better management the Government have also set out in the White Paper its proposals for the transfer of authority and controls from the centre.  According as systems of management are developed, the controls exercised by the Department of the Public Service and the Department of Finance over the management decisions of other Departments will <Col N="2222" /> be reviewed with the intention of delegating as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Of course, this move towards greater delegation and decentralisation is entirely consistent with the programme of devolution from central Government to local government which was announced last May.  I am chairing the implementation group set up by the Government to oversee this programme and I expect to have shortly the reports of the sub-committees which are considering how best to transfer a range of centralised functions to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The drive for improvements in management will require continuous attention to efficiency and effectiveness throughout the Civil Service.  The continuing severe limitation on resources has created a climate in which more attention and energy has to be devoted to providing existing, and often additional, services with diminishing resources, especially manpower.  My Department has a major role to play in this area and has carried out major reviews in staff intensive areas such as the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare to identify potential savings.  A similar review is underway in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>These reviews of efficiency and effectiveness complement the new management systems and will greatly help management to monitor the operation and results of programmes and to better assess priorities when it comes to allocating resources.</P>
    <P>While the development of improved management structures and systems is essential for the development of the public service, special attention has to be paid to the two critical areas of numbers employed and pay costs.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there are curbs on recruitment in local authorities, health boards and grant-aided bodies and an embargo on recruitment and on the filling of two out of every three vacancies in the Civil Service has been in operation since 1981.  There has been a reduction of 3,700 posts in Civil Service staffing levels since that time.  <i>Building on Reality</i> envisages <Col N="2223" /> a total drop of 5,000 in public service numbers during the plan period.</P>
    <P>These cuts are necessary but are hardly draconian in the light of the total size of the public service and the large and unsustainable growth of almost 40,000 jobs which occurred in the public service during the period 1977-1981.  Despite the overriding need for economy, the Government has not adopted a negative or insensitive approach in the area of numbers control.</P>
    <P>Where increases have been necessary &mdash; for example, where more gardaí or teachers were required &mdash; they have been provided.  In addition, the restrictions on staffing have been administered with flexibility.  Staff have been transferred over the past few years from other parts of the Civil Service to alleviate pressure in overworked areas and to ensure that overall staff reductions do not detract from the level of service being provided. The areas which have been relieved by these interdepartmental transfers include the Departments of Social Welfare, Foreign Affairs, during the Irish EC Presidency, and Finance and the offices of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Revenue Commissioners as well as the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>The embargo on staffing has never been an end in itself.  Its importance lies in its contribution to reducing the overall cost of the Civil Service and producing a leaner, fitter system of public administration. The White Paper outlines how the embargo will be progressively modified, to give Departments more say over the detail of their staffing allocations while achieving further reductions in the numbers employed in the Civil Service as envisaged in the national plan.</P>
    <P>For the remaining period of the national plan, instead of applying a standard embargo across the board in the Civil Service, the staffing level to be reached by each Department, in the light of their particular circumstances a year hence will be determined.  At the same time, a decision will be taken as to what proportion of vacancies arising during the year may <Col N="2224" /> be filled in each Department.  These overall staffing complements are at present being settled for end 1986.  The general aim will be to achieve a reduction in posts, bearing in mind what would have emerged in 1986 had the embargo continued to apply.  In determining the end 1986 staffing targets all factors will be taken into account, such as the effect of the embargo to date in each Department and the need for special arrangements in areas of particular need.  It will be the responsibility of each Department to work within their allocation.  Equivalent measures will be implemented by the Departments directly responsible for the local authorities, health boards and noncommercial State-sponsored bodies within the Government's overall policy.</P>
    <P>Mention of grading leads to the issue of reducing the number of Civil Service grades.  Almost all serious commentators on the Civil Service have drawn attention to its large number of different grades &mdash; it includes now around 700 &mdash; and have suggested that this proliferation of grades hampers the development of the service and the encouragement of mobility within it.  While some of these distinctions of grades reflect significant differences in the work which they do, others are clearly the products of historical accidents and have questionable relevance to the later decades of the 20th century.  The Government have decided that the number of grades should, where feasible, be reduced and Departments have been told to set about reducing them.</P>
    <P>If we were starting out to establish the Civil Service from scratch it would probably be possible to slot all of our 700 or so existing grades into nine or ten large groups.  To do so against the background of established pay relationships and career path expectation could, if embarked upon without careful assessment of the implications of each move, involve substantial immediate and long-term cost and industrial relations problems which would diminish rather than enhance service to the public in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>One area where we have had an opportunity to weigh up the balance of advantage in amalgamating grades involved <Col N="2225" /> two of the larger groups in the General Service &mdash; 2,000 executive officers and 800 staff officers.  The intention to proceed with the amalgamation of these grades has already been announced in the White Paper and detailed arrangements for the amalgamation are being finalised.</P>
    <P>In the period immediately before and after Christmas last, the former Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Boland, had an exhaustive series of discussions on pay issues with various public service unions.  The negotiations eventually resulted in a package of proposals covering the 25th round and other pay-related matters.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;round&rdquo; increase of 7 per cent consists of a 3 per cent increase from 1 May 1986, 2 per cent from 1 January next and a further 2 per cent from 1 May 1987. As regards special increases, outstanding findings on claims for special increases will be implemented in three phases over the period from 1 December 1986 to 1 July 1988, while other cases may be implemented in three phases over the period from 1 December 1987 to 1 July 1989.</P>
    <P>The package of proposals has now been offered to a wide variety of public service unions and associations and perhaps I could give a brief summary of the current position in the main areas.  On the Civil Service General Staff Panel both the Civil Service Executive Union and the Federated Union of Government Employees have indicated their acceptance of the 25th round package.  The package has been offered to the other unions on the staff panel and is being considered by them.  Discussions have also taken place with the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants.  These have proved protracted and difficult and broke down yesterday evening on the issue of arbitration findings.  It is my belief that a realistic settlement is possible even at this stage and I exhort the UPTCS to look further at the proposals put to them and to consider the damage to the country before escalating the dispute.  I should also add that my Department are available at short notice for further discussions.</P>
    <P>Two of the three unions on the Civil <Col N="2226" /> Service Higher Staff Panel &mdash; the Association of Higher Civil Servants and the Veterinary Officers Association &mdash; have accepted the package as have three of the main Garda bodies that is, the Garda Representative Association, the Represenetative Body for Superintendents and the Chief Superintendents' Representative Body.  The Prison Officers' Association accepted the offer yesterday.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, detailed discussions have taken place separately with the teacher unions.  A successful conclusion to these discussions was reached recently on a set of proposals which included the acceptance by the teacher unions of the package on the 25 round pay increase and related matters.  We are awaiting a formal response on the package from the Local Authority and Health Services Staff Panel.</P>
    <P>Some confusion seems to exist, particularly among State bodies themselves, about the implications of the Government's decision in the White Paper to extend to all commercial State bodies the statutory requirements about pay and conditions which already apply to some of them.  I take this opportunity to clear up some of the confusion.</P>
    <P>The White Paper decision is not a new development.  The statutory requirements are already well established.  They were introduced in the Gas Act, 1976, and have since been extended to a number of other bodies.  They do not imply statutory wage control, nor are they intended to undermine the existing industrial relations procedures in the commercial State bodies.  These fears have not been realised in the case of the bodies where these legal provisions already exist.</P>
    <P>Negotiations still remain a matter for management and unions in accordance with existing procedures.  Indeed, the Government, in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> stated explicitly that the basis for determining conditions of pay and employment should be free collective bargaining.  That will remain the position in all the commercial State bodies.</P>
    <P>The need to reduce the size of the public service has been a priority for the <Col N="2227" /> Government during the past few years. It has not, however, operated in such a rigid fashion that worthwhile job creation initiatives have been neglected.  The highly successful schemes of job sharing and career breaks have resulted in the provision of over 4,000 extra jobs at minimal or no extra cost.  In the Civil Service alone, 281 staff are job sharing and 1,476 are on career breaks.  Comparable figures for other areas such as local authorities and the health sector are 44 and 2,552 respectively.</P>
    <P>The Government have as their main priority the reduction in unemployment particularly among young people.  In the White Paper they announced their decision to establish a temporary clerical trainee category in the Civil Service to give work experience to 1,000 young school leavers.  The first temporary clerical trainees had been taken on by November 1985.  The full 1,000 have now been recruited, including 50 disabled young people, and have been distributed to Departments and offices throughout the country.  About 600 are located in Dublin and the remainder in various centres around the country.  They are being given a variety of clerical experience and are receiving appropriate training.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the success of the scheme and I have heard nothing but favourable reports from Departments and offices employing these young people.  In the autumn we plan to hold a special competition allowing the trainees to compete for 100 specially reserved permanent posts of clerical assistant. Obviously all cannot succeed at the competition but even those who do not will leave the Civil Service with a range of useful work experience behind them which will fit them for employment in other areas.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue this programme of work experience for young people because of the vital contribution it makes to their development and the 1986 scheme will be launched in the latter half of the year.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to continue their programme of increased <Col N="2228" /> utilisation of information technology to improve the efficiency of public service administration, to increase the effectiveness of management and professional staff and to make access to services more readily available to the public.  The widespread use of modern technology is essential to deliver an increasingly complex range of services at a time when we are committed to further reduction in Civil Service numbers.</P>
    <P>Central support, co-ordination and control of such widespread development is important if the momentum is to be maintained and resources used to best advantage.  For this purpose the old central computer function in my Department was reorganised in 1985 into a structure more in line with the rapidly changing technology.</P>
    <P>First a central computing service is responsible for developing and supporting common and service-wide applications and for supporting smaller Departments which have not as yet established their own systems development services.  Second, the information management advisory service advises and assists Departments with the development of information technology plans and co-ordinates plans between Departments. Evidence to date with the information technology planning process has shown that it is an area requiring quite sophisticated techniques which should pay off in much improved systems.</P>
    <P>The advisory service also undertakes research into areas of information technology and formulates guidelines and standards for the acquisition, introduction and use of systems and applications. At present a major study with the assistance of consultants is being undertaken on the subject of networking to facilitate service wide communications between different Departments and systems.</P>
    <P>The third function to be exercised centrally is one of control of expenditure on information technology which has now been merged with the general control on staffing to give an overall balanced control of organisational expenditure. This is a time of rapid developments in information technology and I could spend <Col N="2229" /> a long time listing and describing the many new directions being taken across the Civil Service.  Perhaps one example within this House will suffice.</P>
    <P>Members will be particularly interested in a proposed development of direct relevance to their work as public representatives. The proposals of the Leader of the House in relation to the use of technology in the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas are progressing and I am making funds available for this purpose from Subhead E &mdash; Information Technology Initiatives &mdash; of the Vote for my Department.  Our policy and action in relation to information technology are based on continuing review of the latest developments and best practices in this rapidly evolving and critical area.  We will continue to promote and expedite its effective utilisation as an essential feature of developing public services to meet modern requirements.</P>
    <P>So far I have concentrated largely on the changes in systems and structures which are a vital part of our efforts to overhaul the public service.  This, of course, is only half the story.  The success of any new approaches will depend on the motivation and commitment of the staff who operate them.</P>
    <P>The commitment and dedication of civil servants has always been beyond reproach and I am confident that this will continue to be the case.  I am also convinced that civil servants themselves are seeing in the White Paper greater opportunities for their own development and for more fulfilling careers than heretofore existed.</P>
    <P>Specific development initiatives which are already under way include the preparation by Departments of comprehensive plans for the training and development of staff.  These plans are to cover all aspects of development from placement, mobility, appraisal and education as well as on and off the job training. My Department are currently organising a series of workshops to help Departments in formulating these plans.</P>
    <P>A half day module on information technology has been incorporated into all management courses presented by the <Col N="2230" /> Civil Service Training Centre.  The training needs of Departments which are implementing the technology are being met through learning groups of officers who come together at intervals over a period to identify and undergo common training programmes.</P>
    <P>Promotion will continue to be one of the main rewards for civil servants who perform well.  The White Paper stressed the principle of merit, allied to that of mobility, in the arrangements for promotion in the Civil Service.  The top level appointments system has opened all posts at Assistant Secretary level and above to all staff at Principal level and equivalent throughout the Civil Service.  To date, 44 vacancies have been filled through this system, 14 of these by officers from Departments other than those in which the vacancies occured.  The top level appointments scheme, by breaking down barriers to promotion, allows the best talent to get ahead, thereby improving the overall management of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Similarly at Principal and Assistant Principal levels, the White Paper proposed that the interdepartmental promotion schemes at these levels would be widened to cover all staff who have not already been included, Negotiations on this matter are taking place with the relevant staff associations and unions and I expect them to be successfully concluded in the near future.</P>
    <P>Effective ways of assessing performance are required to operate successfully a system of promotion based on merit and to identify the development needs of staff.  Performance appraisal schemes are already in existence for all grades from Executive Officer upwards in the general administrative stream, for all posts under the top level appointments committee and for certain departmental grades.  The aim now is to extend performance appraisal to other grades particularly those in the technical and professional areas.</P>
    <P>The principle of introducing merit pay has already been decided by the Government and a scheme is being prepared by my Department in consultation with other Departments.  Staff interests will <Col N="2231" /> also be consulted as envisaged in the White Paper.  Merit awards &mdash; within a range of 5 to 10 per cent of annual salary &mdash; will be made to not more than 10 per cent of the staff in any grade or department and then only in accordance with rigorous standards.  I would hope to see merit pay in operation in the near future as I believe it will further motivate staff to achieve excellence in performance.</P>
    <P>A scheme of staff exchanges was introduced in 1979 for the purpose of giving staff fresh experiences and more challenging tasks as well as to introduce new ideas to the Civil Service.  The White Paper states that there should be about 50 exchanges each year, 25 per cent involving the private sector.  I am quite disappointed with the results of this scheme to date.  While the exchanges which have taken place have been very successful, very few Departments have achieved their exchange quotas.</P>
    <P>Participation by the private sector has also been disappointing despite a major marketing exercise by my Department last year.  I must, however, record my appreciation to the small number of private sector companies who have wholeheartedly co-operated in the scheme.  It might be invidious to mention names but those who have co-operated have the sincere thanks of the Government.  I shall be making every effort during my term of office to improve participation in the scheme and I shall, if necessary, be reporting to the Government on the matter.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are continuing with staff interests on the development of the welfare service as envisaged in the White Paper and I expect them to be successfully concluded shortly.</P>
    <P>As part of the Civil Service programme to deal with alcoholism a successful series of information seminars on alcoholism has been held for Civil Service managers and supervisors throughout the country. Three thousand six hundred civil servants attended.  Each seminar was of two hours duration and 58 seminars in all were held between September 1985 and April 1986.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2232" /> The Government also announced in this year's budget that pensions payable under the public service widows' and children's <i>ex gratia</i> schemes were being increased in two stages from 1 January 1986 and 1 January 1987 to bring them into line with pensions payable under the contributory widows' and children's scheme.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom rud éigin a rá anois mar gheall ar Ghaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí agus ar an Láraonad Forbartha Gaeilge atá ag feidhmiú mar chuid de mo Roinn.</P>
    <P>Tá Gaeleagras ann chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa Státseirbhís trí chúrsaí Ghaeilge agus imeachtaí caidrimh trí Ghaeilge.  Tá foireann riaracháin agus múinteoirí, buan agus pairtaimseartha, acu.</P>
    <P>Bíonn cúrsaí Gaeilge ar siúl acu i nGaeleagras féin, laistigh de na Ranna Stáit agus ar imeall na Gaeltachta. Chomh maith leosan bíonn cúrsaí trí Ghaeilge ar siúl acu, mar shampla, ceol, rince agus amhránaíocht, agus imeachtaí soisialta trí Ghaeilge chun timpeallacht dhátheangach a chothú.  Bíonn cúrsaí ar siúl acu sa Ghaeltacht faoi scéim scoláireachta atá oscaialte don tSeirbhís Phoiblí ar fad.</P>
    <P>Tugann an scéim sin deis freisin do sheirbhísigh phoiblí agus dá gclanna a laethanta saoire a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht le Gaeleagras agus a gcuid Gaeilge a chleachtadh agus a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Is cuid den Láraonad Forbartha é Gaeleagras.  Tá Rúnaí Cúnta as mo Roinnse i gceannas ar an Láraonad.  Is é an aidhm atá ag an Laraonad ná cuidiú le Ranna an Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm ar fud na Státseirbhíse agus go háirithe seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a thairiscint agus a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeilge.  Tá ceangal ag an Láraonad le Ranna eile trí Chomhairle a thagann le chéile ó am go ham.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Laraonad Treoirlínte chuig gach Roinn tamall ó shin chun cuidiú leo an Plean Gníomhaíochta a chur i bhfeidhm de réir a chéile.  Reachtáil siad le deanaí dianchúrsaí trawnála sa Ghaeltacht chun cuidiú le seirbhísigh phoiblí seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2233" /> Chuir siad comharthaí ar fáil freisin ag tairiscint seirbhís trí Ghaeilge agus leabhráin chun cuidiú le seirbhís a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Chuideodh sé, dar liom, leis an iarracht dá dtabharfaimís &mdash; ionadaithe poiblí &mdash; idir Airí, Teachtaí agus Seanadóirí spreagadh agus dea-shampla.  Ó mo thaobhsa de táim ag fáil cúnaimh ó Ghaeleagras chun feabhas a chur ar mo chuid Gaeilge féin.  Tá sé ar aigne agam socruithe ar an gcuma céanna a dhéanamh le haghaidh mo chompánaigh uile san dá Theach.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that one of the fundamental purposes of the White Paper is to improve the quality and courtesy of the service given to the public.  A number of specific initiatives have already been taken which I believe will result in a marked improvement in the relationship between the Civil Service and the public. Reception areas in a number of Departments have, for example, been improved &mdash; in the Departments of Education, Social Welfare and the Custom House.</P>
    <P>About 130 Civil Service forms have been redesigned to make them more understandable and informative.  Redesign has also included the elimination of some unnecessary forms.  Guidelines have been issued to Departments about selection and training of staff in public offices and courses on providing good customer services are also being held.</P>
    <P>Progress in establishing general inquiry offices and a central tax inquiry office are well advanced and I expect to see some of these in operation by the end of the year.  Arrangements about the identification of individual civil servants dealing with the public &mdash; through wearing name badges and giving names on letters and in phone calls &mdash; are already in operation.</P>
    <P>I turn now to some of the financial details relating to this group of Estimates. The Estimate for Vote 20 &mdash; the Office of the Minister for the Public Service &mdash; is £10.043 million, an increase of £3.057 million on the 1985 outturn.  This Vote covers the day to day running expenses of the Department and comes in the main <Col N="2234" /> under four headings, three of expenditure and one &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash; of income.</P>
    <P>The increase on this Vote compared to 1985 is due mainly to increased expenditure on technology.  A new provision of £1.7 million has, as I referred to earlier, been included to facilitate the exploration of major new directions and opportunities in the application of information technology throughout the Civil Service. A sum of £1.05 million has been provided for the purchase, leasing, rental and maintenance of computer equipment used by the Department's central computing service.  Provision has also been made to cover consultancy and equipment costs relating to the development of computerised personnel administration and information systems for the civil service.  Pay of staff in the Department amounts to £4.945 million which is 49 per cent of the total Estimate.</P>
    <P>A provision of £1.21 million has been provided by way of a grant-in-aid for the Institute of Public Administration.  This grant-in-aid is a contribution towards the general expenses of the institute and includes the corporate subscriptions on behalf of Government Departments.  The institute are involved in the training and education of public servants, in promoting and undertaking administrative research and in publishing sources of material on public administration.</P>
    <P>Appropriations-in-Aid on the Vote arise mainly from receipts in respect of computer services provided by the central computing service for bodies other than Government Departments and, in the case of the Department of Social Welfare, costs properly chargeable to the Social Insurance Fund.  Receipts for 1986 are expected to come to £0.877 million which will be £0.344 million less than the outturn for 1985.  This is mainly due to the transfer in March 1986 of the processing of the social welfare benefits system from this Department to the Department of Social Welfare's own computer equipment resulting in a large reduction in the amount to be recouped from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>On Vote 21 &mdash; the Civil Service <Col N="2235" /> Commission &mdash; the cost of running the Civil Service Commission and Local Appointments Commission in 1986 is estimated at a net amount of £1,628,000. This amount is required to cover the cost of salaries, wages and allowances of the staff of the two commissions, the cost of the competitions run by them and various other expenses.  The gross cost comes to £2,271,000 but revenue received will reduce this by £643,000 to £1,628,000.</P>
    <P>On Vote 22 &mdash; the Office of the Ombudsman &mdash; the Estimate for this Vote is £749,000, and increase of 27 per cent on the 1985 outturn.  This is due to increased staff and other costs following the extension from 1 April 1985 of the Ombudsman's remit to cover local authorities, health boards, Telecom Éireann and An Post.</P>
    <P>The fourth Vote is Vote 23 &mdash; Superannuation and Retired Allowances &mdash; which required a net amount of £46.757 million. The Vote covers payments of pension and retirement lump sums to established and non-established civil servants, to their widows and widows of the Judiciary. The increase on this Vote compared to the 1985 outturn is due to the increase in the number of pensioners and the revision of pensions in line with pay increases.</P>
    <P>As regards Vote 51 &mdash; Increases in Remuneration and Pensions &mdash; this Vote provides £70 million to meet the cost of the 25th round pay package and other pay-related matters for public service groups.  As announced in the budget, the cost of two pension concessions, that is, the introduction of full pension parity in relation to special increases with effect from 1 July 1986 and the concession for public service widows' and children's <i>ex gratia</i> pension, are included in the figure of £70 million.  The provision in the Vote will be distributed to Departments later in the year when the full position on departmental provisions for pay can be assessed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of important issues in this Estimate that we should debate.  Over the years the <Col N="2236" /> Department of the Public Service has become more important because of their involvement in several key areas of Irish life.</P>
      <P>I could easily speak for 45 minutes on one or two issues which the Minister did not mention, for example, 15 October last year and other issues, but I will not do that.  I will talk about the White Paper and some of the views which I and Fianna Fáil have about Civil Service and public service reform.  The Minister said that some of his suggestions might not seem novel to Deputies who have business experience.  This echoes my own idea. Today we have a 20th century State with Victorian administration, although I acknowledge the efforts of the people in the Department of the Public Service to change that.  We need to equip ourselves with an administrative machine capable of meeting the demands of a modern State but also capable of bridging the growing gulf between the Government and the people who pay the taxes.</P>
      <P>For 20 years we have talked about Civil Service reform.  Fianna Fáil initiated the process by establishing the Devlin Commission to examine the structure and organisation of the public service.  The work of that commission was presented in 1969.  The report of the Public Services Organisational Review Group proposed a grand review strategy for virtually altering the administrative system inherited when this State was established.  That was almost 20 years ago.  At that stage Fianna Fáil, in Government, committed themselves to the principal proposals in the report and then, because of difficult times and the Northern Ireland trauma of the seventies, it became rather difficult for much reform to take place.  When we joined the EC the task slowed somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tragically for the country and for the Irish administration new regime the Coalition, when they took power in 1973, lacked the capacity, the experience, and above all else, the political will to progress the reforms recommended in the Devlin Report.  When, in 1977 the Taoiseach took up the issue again, he said in his very first speech when elected as Taoiseach in this House, that the <Col N="2237" /> reform progress would continue.  The late George Colley as Minister for Finance, reiterated that commitment and Ray MacSharry was appointed to implement it.  It is on record now that a significant amount of the spade work was done at that stage and the enthusiasm of Ray MacSharry was acknowledged by those people who take an interest in reform in the public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

It is getting difficult to do as the Ceann Comhairle says now and that is why the other practice is creeping in.  We have some Ministers of State who hold many portfolios that one almost has to have it in writing which job he is doing &mdash; I know it does not apply to this Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since then there has been almost no effort made to bring real reform into the public service.  The White Paper issued last year was an attempt to do something in this direction.  At that time I criticised the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Boland.  I know there were internal difficulties.  There has been a lack of co-operation with some of the unions, and perhaps the Minister had difficulty in communicating with a number of the people involved, but, unfortunately, very little of what is contained in the White Paper was brought into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently told the House we would have legislation before the summer legalising some of the proposals in the White Paper.  I may have missed it, but I did not hear the Minister give such a commitment this morning.  Perhaps he will tell us later what is happening <Col N="2238" /> in this direction.  Will we see this legislation this session?  If not, it is unlikely we will see it in the life of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Experience of the grand reform strategy approach, which was advocated in 1969 and again in the White Paper, is not unique.  Many European countries which attempted the root and branch administrative reform in the sixties and seventies experienced difficulties.  I do not want to be too negative but it is not easy to reform an administrative system which has been in existence for 60 years.  A number of European countries, particularly OECD countries, have written a lot about this and in the past five years have responded to the situation by adopting a more selective approach aimed at achieving radical change in key problem areas rather than an overall change which was the ethos of the Devlin Report.  This is probably the approach of the present Government, although they have achieved very little so far, and it is the approach the Fianna Fáil Government would adopt.</P>
    <P>The reform package we have spoken about is on the one hand aimed at creating a public service whose members are more directly responsible for their actions and, on the other hand, a public service which will be more responsible to the citizens it is intended to serve.  By making public servants more responsible for their actions, the aim would be to create a situation where something approaching modern management practices will be introduced to effect in the public service. The objective would be to ensure that the Irish taxpayer receives a £1 service for every £1 tax spent.</P>
    <P>Ideas for making the public service, and more particularly the Civil Service, more responsive and more individually responsible have been explored over the past 15 years.  Since there has been a number of debates about this subject inside and outside this House, I would like to concentrate my remarks on the challenge of bringing the administration to the citizens.  There are a number of striking features in the concept of the relationships with the citizens.  The most universally true fact in public administration in recent decades has been the <Col N="2239" /> growth of Government.  The past 25 years witnessed an unprecedented growth in the public service.  This growth in scope has been accompanied by a corresponding expansion in the scale of Government in terms of the number of public service agencies, the number of public servants and the costs.  The growth both in the scope and scale of State activities has, in turn, led to a growth in the level to which the State determines the individual citizen's economic and social well being.  The growth has also led to an unprecedented level of interaction between the citizen and the State.  It is in this area that I feel we should focus attention in the immediate years ahead.</P>
    <P>Improving relations between the citizen and the administration is very important. There are very real and practical advantages to be gained from improving relations between the citizen and the State which would be reaped not just for the administration of political leadership, but most importantly for the citizen, there would be very real political economic organisation and social benefits.  Politically it is important that we improve relationships between citizen and State for a number of reasons.  In the short-term by ensuring that the citizen is not injured in his dealings with the State, we get public co-operation and consensus which are vital elements in the success of any public policy to be implemented.  In the long-term, improvements are necessary because, unless the Government and the people can learn to co-exist, political stability will ultimately be threatened. We in Ireland sadly have a perfect example of political alienation within an artificially created State which has led to mistrust and ultimately to violence north of the Border.</P>
    <P>In economic terms improvements in citizen administration relations will bring cost and development advantages. Unnecessary bureaucracy means unnecessary costs.  These costs are borne not just by the public purse but also by the citizen, in particular the smaller businesses on which we will be depending in the years ahead to generate economic <Col N="2240" /> growth and more importantly to generate jobs.  By rectifying the relationship between the citizen and the administration and by improving that relationship, we can only cut out unnecessary and excessive bureaucracy and thereby trim costs.  We can also lift some of the burden of bureaucracy from the shoulders of the people.</P>
    <P>Administratively improving relationships between the citizen and the State will mean that there will be better feedback and, therefore, better evaluation schemes.  It will also mean that public servants will feel more directly and personally committed to the tasks they perform. Socially the advantages are obvious.  The relationship between the citizen and the administration has grown so complex that much of the life of Irish political figures is spent in attempting to mediate between the citizen and the State.  This undermines public confidence in the impartiality of many public programmes. It also creates suspicion of injustice.  It should not be necessary for people to seek the services of their public representatives to guarantee the delivery of these public services.  By improving relations between the citizens and the administration we are improving the capacity of the individual citizen to gain the services to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>Public administration reform is not just about economics.  It is about politics.  It is not just about organisation improvements. It also concerns social justice. There are some steps which we in Oppostion have been looking at in relation to public service reform.  There is the one stop shop I have spoken about on many occasions, information, consultation and institutional measures and an attempt to take some of the bureaucracy out of our present administration.</P>
    <P>The aim of the one stop shop would be to create an environment within which public business is conducted and which minimises potential friction between the citizen and the administration.  A very wide variety of innovations come to mind under this heading.  An area in which improvements can and must be made is access to public service institutions and <Col N="2241" /> to public services.  The type of measure I have in mind would be the opening of street front offices in convenient locations, the grouping of activities in one location, the simplification of language in official communications, the reduction in the number of forms and the simplification of legal measures ranging right across the spectrum of improvements in the training of the public service contact staff and the personalisation of services by abolishing the remaining areas of anonymity.</P>
    <P>While the present Minister has made much of abolishing anonymity in the Civil Service at contact level, the first initiative in this area was taken during the term of office of the last Fianna Fáil Administration. Some attempts have been made to include the level of information.  For example, the Department of Social Welfare feel that this move has not gone far enough and these initiatives must be carried right through the public service. The media could be used to better effect, as could the highly successful and largely voluntary information centre system.</P>
    <P>An area which features in Fianna Fáil discussion papers, one of which has been issued and the other which we hope to issue shortly, is freedom of information. For far too long even the most minor administrative matter has been treated as if it were a State secret.  No harm can be done by throwing the light of public scrutiny into the darkest recesses of our administration.  In so doing we can expose much that is good and, if the light of public scrutiny shows something which is bad, that is an additional benefit. Another area of information which we are examining is the issue of privacy on information in the public domain.  None of us knows what lies in official files regarding ourselves, and in a democracy that is not healthy.  At a minimum we have a right to know that any material on official files is accurate.</P>
    <P>A number of countries have taken initiatives in this regard the aim of which has been to protect the citizen with regard to information in both public and private data banks.  We would be well advised to consider the necessity for similar codes <Col N="2242" /> of law and practice here, and with the help of advisers we have done a considerable amount of work in that area.  I am interested in the creation of privacy ombudsmen and privacy commissioners in a number of States and, we have examined some of the institutions that have such a service.  Presumably in future these can be added to or expanded in conjunction with the Ombudsman's office.</P>
    <P>Under consultation measures I would include all forms of consultation and consensus building, but not the type of public relations exercise at which the Government are so adept.  We have gone some way towards improving consensus and consultation.  Bunreacht na hÉireann is unique in that it includes in the electoral process for the Seanad recognition of interest groups.  Over the years Fianna Fáil administrations have admitted themselves to consultation with the public or with the many members of the public the administration must deal with. However, more remains to be done with innovations aimed at improving the feedback in the public service.  The boards of public corporations could with benefit become perhaps even more representative than they are.  Watchdog councils in various administrative areas could be introduced with benefit.  Finally, there is no reason why the State should not make more extensive use of public opinion research or public inquiries to get a true measure of the citizen's reaction to the State and the State schemes.</P>
    <P>Under institutional matters, Ireland's public administration is desperately in need of improvement.  The most obvious area for improvement is the level of centralisation of service.  Since the sixties, Fianna Fáil have been committed to a policy of decentralisation and if we are the next Government, as we hope, this policy will be carried through to effect. Over the years decentralisation policies have been stymied by successive Coalitions and the result is that we have now one of the most highly centralised bureaucracies in the world.  Centralised bureaucracies mean that citizens have problems.  Decentralisation would be an institutional improvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2243" /> Fianna Fáil created the Ombudsman's office in 1980.  Our efforts to improve the systems available should not stop there. We would like to see improvements in in-house appeals systems and there is scope for extension of some of the existing appeals tribunals.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a radical area of improvement is innovation in the attempt to reverse the trend of the overgrown bureaucracy. The type of innovation we have in mind here is the devolution of responsibility to agencies at sub-national level.  There was much talk by the Government recently about the people's future and local government reform, and our document last year dealt with that.  Our spokesman for the Environment dealt with it in part when he suggested that the time was ripe to consider devolving more functions to local government.  Improvements need not stop there.  Some activities should be hived off to voluntary agencies, for example, who operate much more closely to the system than does the administration itself.  There is need under this heading also for a radical review of administrative procedures affecting business, particularly small business.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that bureaucracy is a huge millstone around the neck of enterprise.  It is to be hoped that Fianna Fáil's policy to lift that millstone will be implemented.  In Government Fianna Fáil attempted without success to run a campaign to take some of the bureaucracy from the present system.  I think both Government and Opposition are agreed that small business is the one area where we can change society.  It is regrettable that when a person tries to set up a small business probably his first contact with the State is not through the IDA or any of the small State agencies helping him out but through PRSI, social welfare, VAT returns, PAYE returns, planning officials and everything taking away the incentive he requires.

      <P>Let me ask the Minister if the talks with the UPTCS broke down yesterday.  Are those talks not taking place today?  My understanding was that talks were continuing on the conciliation and arbitration difficulties.  I did not intend to say anything about this if the negotiations were going on today, because I have always taken the view that, if negotiations are in progress, I do not comment.  Will the Minister confirm that talks are taking place today or that they have broken down?</P>

      <P>That is regrettable.  Last week when I met the leaders of the UPTCS, having raised the issue in the House, I said to them then, that I hoped they would not extend their action into the beef classification area because this would cause major difficulties for the economy.  I still hope they will not take any such action, but this is where the Government face a major difficulty.  They must make a clear decision in this area before a major strike occurs which will affect the agricultural economy.  Where do they stand on the issue of conciliation and arbitration?</P>
      <P>I will not go into the teachers issue as it is past tense, but the argument the Government put forward on that was&mdash; based, I presume, on their document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>&mdash; that free collective bargaining was still their means of debate with the trade union movement, that they were not getting into a <i>diktat</i> arrangement with the trade unions. Perhaps their argument on the teachers issue had some credibility because the sums of money involved were astronomical and the Government argued, rightly, that they should be paid over a period, as I said during that dispute, but we differed on the question of retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the UPTCS and in other areas a huge amount of money is not involved.  Perhaps it is £3 million, but effectively it will be something over £1 million.  Nine claims were outstanding <Col N="2245" /> with that union and three were paid in full, of those three cases one was a Civil Defence radiation officer's pay during difficulties which followed the Russian explosion and radiation fallout therefrom. Only one individual was involved there and that person was paid a few weeks ago.  There are also the people in this sensitive area of beef classification where there is now danger of a strike which would affect our exports.  I hope that that will not happen.  The small number of people in that area were paid. The third section were the navigation people at the airport.  They were taken out by the Minister and his Department on the basis that that was a sensitive area. It would not have been in the State's interest to have a dispute with them because of the possible catastrophic effects.</P>
    <P>Payment should be made in other areas where conciliation and arbitration awards apply.  There is no need to bring in a system of <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  When I spoke to the leaders of the unions concerned last week they were quite willing to have the arbitration award paid over a number of years and negotiated on that basis.  The difficulty was that the Minister was laying down pre-conditions following the meeting which took place a fortnight ago at the end of a long week of negotiations. I appreciate that the people involved in the Department had had a difficult week and it seemed ridiculous to have a meeting on the Saturday night of a cup final.</P>
    <P>The Minister, by laying down pre-conditions that negotiations would be based on the same arrangements as those applied to the teachers, is saying that the conciliation and arbitration methods practised for 35 years, which have kept peace and harmoney in the public service, are no longer applicable.  These awards have been modified to such an extent that they bear no resemblance to the formula as originally conceived.  The teachers' dispute is not over, both sides have agreed to differ for the moment.  The Department of the Public Service were ordered by the Government to postpone the dispute by awarding partial payment <Col N="2246" /> to keep the door open.  If conciliation and arbitration no longer exist, they will be playing a cat and mouse game in trying to postpone strikes by making partial payments which will keep people happy for 12 months or so.  That is an extremely dangerous and irresponsible policy.  It certainly has nothing to do with collective bargaining or respecting the conciliation and arbitration system which involves legislation passed by this House.</P>
    <P>Civil servants and others in public sector employment should be aware of the Government's policy in regard to conciliation and arbitration because the Government cannot claim that it is based on money.  Although Fianna Fáil delayed payments of arbitration awards they always paid them in full eventually.  The public service always accepted this because they knew it was a fair and reasonable system.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the White Paper was the highlight of the year in his Department.  He should know that the highlight of the year was that, for the first time in the history of the State, the whole public service went on strike.  The Minister should have faced up to that and commented on it, which would have been helpful.  Minister Boland and Minister Hussey treated all the sections very badly and teachers, civil servants, county council and corporation workers, road workers, hospital staff, officers of the court, prison staff and thousands of other grades went on strike to show what they thought of the Government.  Although the Estimate for the year is a review of the happenings in that year, the Minister did not refer to that historic day or to an assessment of what caused it.  That is regrettable because it cannot be swept under the carpet.  I am sure that great hardship was also caused to officials in the Department because of Government policy over the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>We all welcome short term, social employment schemes, AnCO training courses and so on because they provide employment.  However, the 1,000 jobs which were supplied for young people in the public service are in the clerical assistant grade and a way of using cheap <Col N="2247" /> labour.  Of course, they are a help in sections where the embargo on staff meant that they were grossly overworked. The Government should not claim credit in this regard as the staff involved cost much less than permanent staff.</P>
    <P>There is an all-party agreement in relation to the report of the Ombudsman but now there is another report.  I compliment the Ombudsman and his staff who do an extremely good job in highlighting anomalies in the system.  We had a debate on this last year and the Minister of State assured the House that he and the Minister would try to ensure that their colleagues would implement some of the proposals contained in the report for that year.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Public Service are responsible for the Ombudsman and I do not think that the reports of an officer established under legislation prepared by that Department should be just filed away.  I understand that legislation is required in regard to 15 different matters, mainly in regard to social welfare arising from reports of the Ombudsman.  What will happen if the Ombudsman, in the course of his report next year, complains again that legislation has not been introduced to deal with those problems?  He has suggested changes in regard to the 1953 Act, social welfare benefits, Department of the Environment schemes, univerity scholarships, invalidity pensions and dole payments for farmers. What is the point of the Ombudsman putting forward suggestions for changes if no action is taken.  Some Departments adopt the attitude that minor amendments should be left until the next comprehensive legislation is being prepared, but that is not good enough.  I am sure that, with agreement between the Whips, the Opposition spokespersons, and the Minister, such legislation could be put through the House without much difficulty. We must remember that those anomalies cause real hardship.  I am not referring to difficulties in regard to legal jargon but issues that are related to the 1953 Act.  People are getting reduced <Col N="2248" /> pensions and, in some cases, no allowance because of anomalies in that Act. The money has been voted by the House and the anomalies highlighted by an officer of the State, but nothing has been done.  I do not think we should treat the suggestions of the Ombudsman in that fashion.  I have no doubt that he is very frustrated about this.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of modern technology in Government Departments.  Officials from a number of Departments are examining different computers and I understand that some officials have gone abroad to examine very expensive equipment.  Is there a prospect that Departments will be changing from one eminent company to another?  Will the Minister explain the role of the Department of the Public Service in assessing the type of equipment to be purchased by the different Departments? Is there a co-ordinating committee in the Department?  Is an official responsible for deciding where the money is to be spent in regard to computers? The Minister will agree that these contracts are very costly and that modern technology advances annually.  What may be suitable this year will almost certainly be superseded by a new invention next year.</P>
    <P>It is important that an official in the Department should be responsible for co-ordinating all the information on computers. Is the Minister in a position to say if the officials from the Department who went on a fact finding mission to the United States were accompanied by an officer from the Department of the Public Service?  I am not criticising that trip because it is right that such officials should investigate systems operating in other countries, but I am concerned that the approach on computerisation is unco-ordinated and that Departments operate on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>The negotiations on the 25th round were regrettable.  The document, <i>Building on Reality</i>, did not help by insisting that there should not be any pay increase in 1986.  The Minister for the Public Service on 14 August last was foolish to say that there would not be an increase in <Col N="2249" /> 1986.  Later he tried to blame the unions, although at that stage the unions had not sought talks on the 25th round.  The unions had agreed beforehand to discuss the 25th round at talks in October.  I am not surprised that so many unions were slow to accept the Government's offer. What happened last August left a bad taste in the mouths of those involved. The new Minister would do well to try to mend the bridges broken at that time with the trade unions.  A lot of the trust and goodwill that has been built up over the years between the Government and trade unions took a severe battering in recent months.</P>
    <P>It is sad that we have had a national strike and that we are now involved in a major dispute with the UPTCS.  The new Minister, and his Minister of State, should try to reach agreement with the unions on the difficult areas referred to in the White Paper.  They should try to rebuild the bridges that were broken by their colleagues in Government.  There is a lesson to be learned from all this.  The rashness, sharpness and the hype of the last Minister for the Public Service proved to be a failure.  I have no doubt that in his three years in that post he worked hard, but he has not anything to show for it.  He has left a lot of work for other people to clean up.  I do not think that can be disputed.</P>
    <P>Recently the House discussed the group who are responsible for making top level appointments and, without reopening that debate, I should like to impress upon the Minister the need to appoint more females to senior posts. Some may say that there are not sufficient qualified females but that would have to be proved to me.  It is extraordinary that so few females have been appointed to the top posts.  I am sure those who make the appointments have their own reasons, but the matter is causing concern.</P>
    <P>Progress in the area of welfare has been very slow and the Minister of State should give it his personal attention in an effort to create goodwill throughout the service. In any large organisation in the private or semi-State sectors welfare officers do very good work.  Many employees <Col N="2250" /> have problems and they should be able to discuss them with such an official. There are many well-qualified social welfare workers available and we should try to attract them to the post.  If necessary the embargo should be lifted to appoint such a person.</P>
    <P>Minister Boland gave many assurances in regard to assessments that were taking place in Government Departments.  Is the Minister in a position to tell us if the embargo still remains?  Have some grades been hit harder than others?  Are the lower grades suffering?  It appears that the Government do not have a clear policy in regard to the embargo.  In some areas of the service hundreds of millions of pounds are outstanding and staff have to work on Saturdays and Sundays to try to collect it.  Some of the staff have had nervous breakdowns and that is not surprising. The system is in a mess and must be reviewed.  Will the Minister give us some information on the position in regard to the embargo?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister made a speech which was very vague on a number of issues.  He failed to address the major subject of industrial relations in the Department of the Public Service and made no policy statement.  I hope he will not evade telling us when we are to see the legislation to implement the Government's document, or is it just another historic document?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulty of the Opposition spokesman in speaking in this debate.  Through the rhetoric comes a grudging admiration for the work that has been done, the progress made, the solid achievements of the present administration.  At the same time, I understand that the nature of politics is such that he must try to nitpick here and there, to try to justify the position of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me tell him frankly that if he has <Col N="2251" /> any seriously researched and argued points of view as to how, in any specific areas of the public service, in the common interests of all of us and the people of the State improvements might be brought about, I am quite prepared and open to listening to such views.  I shall consider the implementation, after examination, of any such proposals which will appear capable of implementation. The Opposition will recognise that it is difficult to extend that offer into the area of vague generalities, which is so often the message we received from the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern spoke about the history of the effort to form the public service and what was done in 1969, or not done in 1973 or 1977.  Nothing is to be gained by rehashing old history here.  It is quite clear that in the last couple of years a solid, serious attempt has been made to cope with the problems, culminating in the publication of the White Paper and the decision of the Government to implement that White Paper, followed by the steps that have since been taken to put those decision into effect.  Those are the facts and, as I said in my opening speech, it is my intention to continue building on the progress which has been made since the publication of that document.  The Deputy referred to the position as regards the legislation.  That legislation has been drafted and is at present with the parliamentary draftsman.  There is quite an amount of pressure on that official at this stage because of the very heavy programme of the Government.  I am very anxious, indeed, that this legislation will be available for circulation as soon as possible, but I have to understand the situation of the parliamentary draftsman. I cannot say at this stage when the Bill will be ready for circulation, but can only reiterate that we are making every effort to ensure that it will be ready to be brought before this House at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>On the question of pay and numbers, again it is very difficult to understand the specific position of the Opposition.  This is highlighted to some degree by comments <Col N="2252" /> made by Deputy Ahern in relation to temporary clerk typists.  It would he helpful to the House and to the country to have a clear statement of the position of the Opposition on the question of numbers and pay generally.  Let us take the broader issues.  The public service increased by 40,000 under the Fianna Fáil administration of 1977 to 1981.  It is now recognised that that policy was a disaster. Is it their proposal in relation to members to implement that approach again in the future?  Or are the Opposition suggesting that the efforts the present Government are making to trim numbers in the public service and so relieve the taxpayers do not find favour with them?  Alternatively, is it their approach to again revert to the discredited policy implemented from 1977 on and inflate the numbers to such a degree as to cause an absolutely enormous additional burden to be placed on the taxpayer?</P>
    <P>With all due respect, the Opposition cannot have it both ways.  This House and, indeed, the country are entitled to an answer to these questions.  We have stated our position very clearly.  As I told the House, it is my intention to continue the efforts to reduce numbers in the public service while at the same time maintaining the effectiveness of that service to the public.  It is no advantage to the country to have additional permanent and pensionable jobs created in the public service as happened under the Fianna Fáil administration at enormous cost to the taxpayer.  This, by the way is a continuing cost and it will continue for decades ahead.  Of course, if there is a specific need demonstrated, jobs will be created.  As I pointed out also, that does not imply in any way that every effort is not being made by the Government to explore the possibilities of job creation despite this restrictive approach.  The success which we have had in some of these areas, with job sharing and career breaks, has shown that we have been able to create many additional jobs at little or no cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The same confusion must arise on the Opposition's stand in regard to pay.  Is it that there should be a totally flaithiúleach <Col N="2253" /> approach with regard to the taxpayers money, or are the Opposition aware of the position in relation to public finances which has become so obvious over the years?  Are they aware of the efforts that we have made to correct the extravagances of the past and restore order to the public finances?  Is the wink and nod approach now being adopted by the Opposition one which they will follow up to the end of this Dáil?  Are they in favour of an approach which involves corrective measures in relation to the public finances, balanced at the same time by an attempt to adopt a fair and reasonable approach to employees in the public service? I just do not understand the approach adopted by the Opposition in this regard.</P>
    <P>Our position is quite clear.  The basic approach to the 25th round negotiations was to reach agreement on a general round increase which would also incorporate an agreed framework for the implementation of special or grade increases.  The Government, like any other large employer, had to prepare their budget in the clear knowledge of the overall effects of pay increases, both special and general.  It followed that any agreement had to entail compromise and the attempt to arrive at a mix relating to the 25th round with special increases and other pay issues.  It was in this context that the eventual package emerged involving the general increase of 7 per cent and the phasing in of special increases.</P>
    <P>The package now on offer is much more attractive for the staff because of the major change in the outlook for inflation over the period of the agreement. Inflation is now projected to fall substantially this year and virtually disappear next year.  When account is taken of the carry over increase of 1.5 per cent this year which arises from the effects of the 24th round increase in the public service it will be seen that the package on offer will mean a significant real increase in living standards for public servants both this year and next.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> I must again emphasise that many significant groups of civil servants have elected to accept the pay deal on offer. It was learned yesterday that the Prison Officers Association have now indicated acceptance of the deal.  I would urge those other groups who have not yet done so, particularly those groups in the agriculture and local authority areas who have difficulty in accepting the deal, to consider the overall position of the public finances and the existing heavy burden on the taxpayer.  Above all, I plead to their undoubted sense of public spiritness which has been shown on many occasions in the past.</P>
    <P>This House will appreciate that Government policy in this area is constrained by cost factors.  The Government are providing the additional money of £70 million to apply the terms of the package throughout the public service. Any improvement in the package will have to be financed either through increased taxation or further borrowing. However, there is a general acceptance in society that neither of these options is available.  I would again ask those who have not accepted the deal to do so at this stage.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of other issues raised which I have had an opportunity only to touch on.  I find it difficult to understand the approach of the Opposition on the question of the Ombudsman. I have been in touch with my colleagues in the different Departments where specific points have been raised by the Ombudsman.  I will be getting a report back from them and we will have an opportunity in this House of discussing the 1985 report in the not too distant future.  To suggest that some of the proposals of the Ombudsman can be put through as minor amendments of no consequence and without proper consideration, with all due respects, is ludicrous. Let us take one of the primary areas touched on by the Ombudsman in both reports, the question of changes in the social welfare system, particularly contributory pensions.  The fact of the situation is that the implementation of that proposal &mdash; Deputy Ahern may have <Col N="2255" /> his own views on the perspective and scale &mdash; would cost £55 million in 1987.  I have asked my colleagues to look carefully not just on that proposal but on all other proposals of the Ombudsman.  It is ridiculous to suggest these can be put through as minor amendments.  That is, I suggest, a misleading approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern also referred to the strike on 15 October last.  It is far more proper to concentrate on the fact that my predecessor secured agreement with many public service unions on the terms of the pay deal.  It is more important to concentrate on the present positive situation not on what occured on 15 October last year.  I do not think anything is to be gained or served by harping back on that.  That is the reason I did not see any great point in making any reference to it in my speech.</P>
    <P>On the question of technology, I explained in my speech the approach being adopted by my Department.  The information management advisory service advises Departments on their computer plans.  The DPS are responsible for approving expenditure.</P>
    <P>On the question of the visit to the United States, I am not aware if any of my officials were involved.  The approach within the DPS is the sensible and responsible one.  I fully agree with Deputy Ahern that, if it is felt it is in the public interest to travel within or outside the country to acquire more information or inspect systems, that approach is justified.</P>
    <P>I have to conclude at this stage and, hopefully, we will have the opportunity of going into some of these items in more detail on another occasion.</P>

      <P>I asked a number of questions, when I spoke earlier on, to which I did not get many answers.  I would remind the Minister of State that he is the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service.  He and his officials have the job of stating policy on the embargo, on pay and on conciliation and arbitration.  That is what they are paid for.  It is not the Opposition's job to formulate policy and to try and correct the mess the Government are creating, particularly the appalling way that the Department of the Public Service have behaved over the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was from that Department that the <i>diktat</i> statements were issued last August telling people that they were to get no increases in 1985.  It was the statements of the Minister in that Department which led to the first national strike ever.  It is not good enough to say that that is all part of history and that it has all gone.  It has not gone.  We still have a major strike following the performance of the Minister <Col N="2258" /> for the Public Service.  The whole 35 year principle, an agreement which has served this country and public servants very well, has been broken, amended and almost ruined.  It is not good enough for the Minister to stand up and look across and say that the Opposition should have a clear policy.  The Opposition's job is to question and analyse Government policy. It is the fact that we have had a change of Government policy and change of Ministers and musical chairs which has led to these difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give his reply as to what is the policy on the embargo.  The Minister should answer the numerous questions which were not answered.  I accept the Minister's position that he is new in the job and does not know what has happened over the last few years because he had another portfolio. But the Minister's predecessor indicated that there were reviews at departmental level and a big survey going on which was going to give certain information.  We were to get the assessments, allocations and complements in this House.  Is that true or is it not true?  Have there been studies of the complements of various Departments?</P>
    <P>I presume that people who gave replies to these questions are the same people who are giving advice to the Minister. What is the position on the embargo? What are the results of the assessments which I was told are taking place by the Minister for the Public Service?  I am not in any way confused.  I am quoting from the information which I was given as to what was going on in the Department.  If that is confusing the Minister, then his difficulty does not lie on this side of the House.  I have raised a number of serious matters and the reply on about six occasions was that the Minister was confused with the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The office of the Ombudsman was set up to remove anomalies and to help citizens with difficulties.  If the office does not report and action is not taken it is no use to the citizens.  The Minister and the Government cannot have it both ways. These anomalies are clearly set down and <Col N="2259" /> action should be taken.  The figure of £55 million was mentioned but I did not know about it because it was not set out by the Government.  I do not understand the Government's policy.  Is it to look at the areas that have not got a great cost factor and look at the others some other day?</P>
    <P>The difficulties in the Department for the past 12 months were not created by officials.  They were created by the Minister's colleagues in Government and by their approach to the whole question of industrial relations.  They tried to walk over people.  That policy has clearly failed and that is why it is not included in the Minister's script.  He cannot stand over the appalling mess that was made of the 25th round negotiations, the conciliation and arbitration and the damage done not just for this year but for years to come. A sleight of hand approach was taken to try to postpone all the industrial chaos which has been caused by the activities of the Minister in the last year until after the next general election.  That is the real policy that is being adopted in the negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject completely the remarks of the Opposition spokesman in regard to the pay policy of the Government.  Let us be quite clear.  The basic agreement on the 25th round was secured in agreement with the public service unions.  It was not foisted on them by <i>diktat.</i> Admittedly, the results of certain arbitration awards are amended or revised as in the case of the teachers.  These are being amended in accordance with the framework agreed with the public service unions.  That is the clear position.  If the Opposition want to try to create confusion on this they may feel that is their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Government on the embargo is quite clear.  I answered questions in this House in this regard and I am surprised that the Deputy is not clear as to what the Government's policy <Col N="2260" /> is.  The embargo continues to run in the Civil Service but it is proposed to replace it by a staffing target approach.  Negotiations and discussions are continuing from the point of view of establishing that approach in 1986.  I can certainly confirm that detailed discussions are taking place in this regard and quite rightly.  How else could one fairly establish proper staffing targets unless the requirements of each of the Departments, some who need a little more staff and some a little less, were studied in great detail?  That has been going on at official and ministerial level to finalise these discussions.  I hope to be in a position to have that done in the near future.  Obviously it requires a little time.  Otherwise the job would not be done properly.  That is our policy.  As in the pay area is it fair for me to ask the Opposition; what is your policy?  Is it to increase the public service by 40,000 as they did between 1977 and 1981?  If so, the people of this country and of this House are entitled to know about it.</P>
    <P>We had a debate in this House on the first report of the Ombudsman and we will have a further opportunity for debate in relation to the 1985 report.  The Ombudsman is doing very fine work and the report bears that out.  In regard to individual problems which have been referred to him it is quite clear that the establishment of this office by the Government has been an entirely successful initiative.  It is also quite clear that the Ombudsman and his staff are making a major contribution to public administration. In regard to various proposals from the Ombudsman where he highlights anomalies and asks to have them considered, that is being done.  The point I made to Deputy Ahern is that some of the proposals have been implemented. Others require the most detailed consideration because they are not, as suggested by Deputy Ahern, matters of minor consequence.  Some of them have quite a substantial price tag.  With public finances in the position they are in that cannot be ignored.  I can confirm to this House that the Government are very happy with the initiative which they took <Col N="2261" /> in establishing the office of the Ombudsman. It has been an enormous success. The views of the Ombudsman are obviously taken into account and given full consideration.  We may have an opportunity to have further discussions on this and other areas in the future in which I will be glad to participate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very contradictory in the statements he made in the past ten to 15 minutes.  I want to refer to the question of the Ombudsman. We all recognise that the appointment of the Ombudsman was very welcome.  When this legislation was going through, the Government pointed out that at long last here was an opportunity where many anomalies could be corrected. One of the major anomalies which emerged from the Ombudsman's report in 1985, and the Minister referred briefly to it, is the question of the average of pension contributions which has disastrous effects on thousands of people over 66 years of age and who do not qualify for old aged pensions simply because they may be one contribution per year short.  This may be through no fault of their own.  Many of these people were not notified officially at the time of the discontinuance of their contributions of the rights they would lose.  This is one of the greatest scandals as far as this situation is concerned.  The Ombudsman reported very fully on this.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted a figure of £55 million.  I do not know where that figure came from.  I recall putting a question to the Minister some time ago and, as far as I can recall, the figure was in the region of £11 million to £12 million.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on how the £55 million is made up.  The public service has been in chaos engineered by the policy of the Government.  On the question of public service pay, it is obvious that the cause of the trouble was the confrontation beginning when the Government decided on a pay freeze.  The freeze was announced in a number of statement's by different Ministers who made it clear that there would be no compromise, that there would be a freeze, and that was it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2262" /> That was the beginning of the discontent among public service employees, and it has gone on since.  The Minister spoke about what Fianna Fáil did.  He should concentrate on what this Government have been doing in the past few months.  On the 25th round they started at zero; then it became 3 per cent; and then they offered all rates up to 7 per cent.  Then we had the £35 million, another turn around.  All these things have caused chaos.  This morning the Minister of State came in with a bureaucratic brief and later he did not answer questions put to him or tell the House what he intends to do about public service pay.  These are very important questions. In recent talks with the public service he has been budgeting what the next Government will do and that the door is not closed.  He is once more laying the foundations for further confrontation in the public service where people have given so much effort and loyalty over the years.</P>
    <P>I repeat that we should like to know where the £55 million will come from and the Minister's policies in regard to public service pay in future and if the Government will be going back on agreements entered into.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has been concentrating on one point in the Ombudsman's report. Obviously, this can be gone into in greater details when the Dáil will be discussing the next report.  I will deal with one of the Deputy's questions from recollection, the matter of the £55 million. It is estimated that 1,700 people are affected because they did not pay social welfare contributions between 1953 and 1974.  The estimated cost, at 1987 prices, is £55 million.  My recollection is that the amount can be broken down and that a price tag of £5 million could be put on it for 1987.  It will continue according to actuarial figures up to the year 2017 when the cost will tail off.  The actuarial calculation is that up to the year 2017 the total would be £55 million at 1987 prices.  I am <Col N="2263" /> not without sympathy for those involved in this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is important that the price tag should be looked at, and the Opposition should not simply say we should have it without any thought for the taxpayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">

      <P>I made the full figures available during the debate on the last Ombudsman's report and I will have no hesitation whatever in checking them to see that my recollection is accurate.  The Commission on Social Welfare have been sitting and this is one of the items they will have looked at.  Their deliberations are about to be completed and we will have an opportunity to look at their report at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>I find it impossible to understand the attitude of the Opposition in this respect. Deputy Brady spoke entirely of our position in regard to pay.  Would it not be more helpful if the Opposition were to recommend that the unions who have so far not agreed to accept the 25th round offer should do so?  Is it chaos the Opposition are looking for instead of acknowledging the significant achievement of the Government in securing agreement which many poblic service unions have endorsed?  There is no chaos in the Civil Service and there is a duty on public representatives to give every possible encouragement to the unions to approve the proposals and the agreement between the Government and the public service unions.</P>
      <P>Question put, and a division being demanded, it was postponed in accordance with Standing Order of the Dáil, No. 123, as modified by Order of the House, until 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 28 May 1986.</P>
