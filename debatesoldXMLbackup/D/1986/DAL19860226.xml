      <Col N="247" /> That for the purpose of any Act of the present session to provide for the transfer of the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal from Córas Iompair Éireann to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland and for other matters connected therewith, it is expedient to make provision for the charging and fixing by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland of fees, tolls and charges in respect of the use by boats of the canals (including the use of locks on the canals and mooring on the canals) and the taking of water from the canals under by-laws which may be made by the said Commissioners under any Act of the present session to provide as aforesaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to comment on this as it was this section 3 that attracted most attention from the people who were in the employ of the company and who are being transferred to the care of the OPW.  I know that when the Bill was initiated in the Seanad there was considerable worry on the part of the workers as to whether their rights and privileges would be preserved, and section 3 (2) (a) and (b) were brought in to meet the objections raised at that stage.  I would like the Minister to indicate to the House whether the unions representing the workers are satisfied that their transfer is covered adequately by the terms of section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides a guarantee in relation to the conditions of service of the canals staff after their transfer and ensures that <Col N="248" /> the prior pensionable service of that staff will be reckonable for Civil Service superannuation purposes, and makes provisions as the Deputy says, that were inserted following discussion in the Seanad.  Arising out of that and the worry expressed on behalf of members of the staff and to ensure that no-one would be any worse off after this transfer, section 3 (2) was inserted on Report Stage in the Seanad.  This provides for a reckoning of all the pluses and minuses of conditions of service of the canals staff in CIE compared with the OPW and for the giving of appropriate compensation where warranted, that is, separate from and in addition to any adjustment of pay or superannuation agreements between the two employments.  If a dispute arises as to whether such compensation is warranted in any particular case or as to the amount of compensation which should be given in a particular case, the Labour Court then will have power to settle the dispute by binding both sides to its decision as to the amount of compensation to be given.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked if all the people concerned were satisfied with this.  I am pleased to be able to report there is overall satisfaction.  The then Minister of State responsible for the OPW said he was delighted that at the recent discussions between representatives of his office, CIE and the unions involved, the union representatives welcomed the proposal. We understand now that there is satisfaction with this situation.  The detailed negotiations on individuals as such will be starting very shortly, but there is satisfaction all round and the arrangement appears to have met all the grievances that were expressed very vigorously by various people in the Seanad. I am delighted that satisfaction has been reached on this.  Between 70 and 80 employees are involved and naturally we are all anxious that the transition will be as smooth as possible and without any difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister of State has reached that happy kind of situation.  As he said, rightly, <Col N="249" /> particularly with regard to certain substantive privileges they had, the employees were considerably alarmed. I know there was a difficulty after the transfer in providing the exact type of privileged payments in some cases and payments in kind in other cases and transferring them exactly.</P>
      <P>I find one thing the Minister said very interesting.  He said the Labour Court would settle the amount and that it would be binding on both parties.  As a matter of legal nicety, I would like to know if this is the first time a recommendation of the Labour Court was made binding.  I remember at the establishment of the Labour Court many years ago hearing a lecturer say he was disappointed that there was not written into the law a power to bind both sides.  I would be interested to know whether this is the first instance of something in a statute which will compel both sides to accept the finding. Are we making history?</P>

      <P>I would like to be able to tell the Deputy that we are, but I am afraid our research into this does not enable me to make that unqualified statement. I hope we are to a certain extent making history.  Unfortunately, I have not the material here.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a point on Second Stage about the transfer of documents. One of the horrific things about our documentation and archival work is that there is a certain amount of carelessness at times, as I had evidence of when trying to do a little work in the Public Records Office on one occasion.  Naturally section 4 is to make provision that all documents, records, books etc. should be transferred. I would like to emphasise how important it is that the Minister who has obligations <Col N="250" /> in this field generally would see to it that proper provision is made for the keeping of these documents, maps and so on, and that they are preserved for researchers and so forth.  I am saying something here that really I should not have to say were it not for the fact that I know that historians and archivists generally are worried about our treatment of documentation. For that reason I would like the Minister to pay special attention to section 4 to see to it not merely for the ordinary business purposes of the Office of Public Works but also for the researchers and archivists, that these documents should be properly looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of my interest generally in that area and of my work on the National Archives Bill, I have a particular interest in this, apart from the ordinary interest that I would have as the Minister of State concerned.  Since Second Stage of the Canals Bill in the Dáil, archival experts from the Public Records Office have undertaken a comprehensive survey of the canals records in CIE care.  Those experts have confirmed what has just been said by Deputy Wilson &mdash; the enormous value of those records for a better appreciation of the social and economic conditions prevailing at that time.  I can confirm that from a recent experience of mine.  A friend picked up a simple payments book for the Sligo and North Counties Railways around the turn of the century.  There was very interesting material there, giving an insight in a simple way into the conditions at the time.  It is clear from the fact that some of these records pre-date the canals and deal with the setting up of them that they are over 200 years old.</P>
      <P>I do not think that one should quantify the value of documents in their cubic footage, but just to give the House an idea of what material is there, there are now some 300 cubic feet of canals records, just talking in volume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>In shipping terms, that is three gross registered tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indebted to the <Col N="251" /> Deputy for that information which I would not have been able to provide for the benefit of the House.  This means that considerable attention will have to be given to safe storage and access in the future, whether under the direct aegis of the proposed National Archives or otherwise. Also, some of the records will continue to be needed by the Commissioners of Public Works for administrative purposes, so the commissioners must have care of these particular records for some time to come.  As I indicated previously, I propose to discuss with CIE and the commissioners in due course how best to deal with the preservation and so forth of the canals records for the nation.  There is a storage question and there is the question of the movement of these records.  That is something to which we are giving particular attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot tell the Minister how pleased I am to hear what I have just heard.  I feel confident that he has a special interest in this and that the records will be looked after.  I know that the Old Dublin Society have been doing some research in that area at times.  I am intrigued by articles on the canals by members of that society, articles which were published in the proceedings of the Old Dublin Society, about fares, boiled mutton for meals and the hotel which was built for £10,000 at Portobello at the beginning of the last century.  It is important to preserve all that material.  I cannot tell the Minister how pleased I am with his reply and his assurance that this matter will be carefully looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that Deputy Wilson was given the reasons but, briefly, his amendment was ruled out of order because it involves a potential charge on the revenue and is irrelevant to the subject matter of the Bill as read a Second Time.  The Deputy might have something to say about the subject of the second ground, but the first ground on which the amendment was ruled out of order is that it involves a potential charge on the revenue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have hopes for the canals under the new regime.  The whole original purpose of the canals died, so to speak, and consequently they have been under the aegis of CIE.  That arrangement was not suitable and has not been suitable for <Col N="254" /> some time.  The Office of Public Works now have an opportunity in various fields which were mentioned by the Minister, myself and others on Second Stage.  I then made the point that, although the Royal and Grand Canals were the only two involved in this Bill, there were others which also were awaiting development. It was because of that that I put down the amendment which, I accept, has been ruled out of order for the reasons given &mdash; whether they are adequate or not is beside the point.  I am afraid that this potential which we see in the canals under the new regime may, from the very beginning, be killed unless there is something specific in the Bill to point the way to a development fund.  I know that the EC accept what is called a zero-rating as distinct from non-VAT. No VAT at all is distinguished in European law from zero-rating and even something as a zero rate put in &mdash; say, £10 token or zero-rating &mdash; would be a reminder each year as the Estimates come up that this is an area which should attract funding for development.  That is really the basis for my amendment.  If one had a zero subhead it would allow what Deputy Leonard mentioned as far as the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal was concerned &mdash; funding from Europe to be placed under that subhead in the future.  I urge the wisdom of that procedure on the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that proposal. We had hoped that on Second Stage consideration would be given to the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal.  That has been the subject of long discussions during the years by the Erne Catchment Study Committee.  There has been liaison between North and South in this regard for the past ten years in an effort to get a linkage between the two finest waterways in Europe, the Shannon and the Erne.  A survey was initiated by Fianna Fáil in the seventies and a viability and cost benefit study of the linkage was proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is serious disappointment at the present attitude towards those studies which were heavily funded by the EC. <Col N="255" /> Indeed I am surprised there has not been EC pressure to have something done about the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal earlier because the Social and Economic Committee of the EC visited the region and expressed concern at the severe economic handicaps in the area.</P>
    <P>Under the Hillsborough Agreement the local regional development organisation approached the Minister for Finance following a meeting of Dáil and Seanad Members here who endeavoured to formulate a plan to follow up strategy studies earlier on this subject.  We had a meeting with the Minister for Finance to discuss general development strategy for the northern region, including Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, on 10 February and in a letter we were told:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Mr Alan M. Dukes T.D. has noted the documents which your Organisation has produced on foot of a Development Strategy for the north eastern region and the priority requirements which you have identified in your Action Programme.  He is very sympathetic to the objectives which your Organisation has set out but considers that, if progress is to be made on these objectives, they must be advanced in a way which recognises the severe limitations on public funds.  In particular, he is concerned that, having allowed for the fact that the proposed Action Programme incorporates substantial infrastructural works which have already been approved, it nevertheless calls for significant additional public expenditure in the area.  Moreover little evidence is provided that there would be an adequate net return to economy as a whole and to the Exchequer on many of the expenditures proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We never believed that linkage with this canal would be <Col N="256" /> profit-making in the short term.  Our purpose was to improve tourist facilities in the area.  Now we have the Minister for Finance saying that because he cannot see money on the table immediately from development of this project the proposed linkage is not on.  As I have said, much work, including many surveys, has been done and we believe this would lead to marvellous tourist development, including water sport, in the general area.  I am disappointed at the rejection of the amendment which would allow the OPW to become involved in that canal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all very interested in the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal. Among the other amenities it offers is the important linkage it affords between the constituencies of Deputy Wilson, the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Leonard and my own.  However, this Bill deals only with the transfer of canals in the property of CIE to the OPW, and the canal being referred to does not fall under that heading. Indeed there is some difficulty about the ownership of that canal.  It was constructed in the mid-1800s and was in the control of a board of trustees.

    <P>Deputy Leonard put down a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the canal and the reply was that the feasibility study on the restoration of the canal would be ready in the next few months and it would then become possible to examine the possibility of restoring the canal.  There are serious complications in this matter.  It is not a clear-cut thing because the canal serves as drainage, but as an amenity it never worked very well &mdash; when it is right for an amenity such as boating it would be wrong for drainage. It would be difficult to get the right combination, and that is what the feasibility study is about.  The OPW have engaged consultants to draw up a plan for the development of the canal and an allocation of money for the development of the <Col N="257" /> Royal and Grand Canals will be considered after the transfer of the canals from CIE and a development programme has been drawn up.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider a zero subhead which would be a technical way of providing a lead of which people would take cognisance year after year?  It is a device that could have fruitful effects.  The Chair has indicated that the amendment is out of order but I suggest that the wisdom of the substance of my amendment will become apparent over the years.  I will write into the record of the House what I am looking for:</P>
      <P>A sum of money for the development of the canals shall be allocated annually and shown under a subhead in the Annual Estimate for the Department of Finance/OPW, such money to be allocated for the development of the Royal and Grand Canals, the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal and such other canals and waterways as the Commissioners may from time to time determine.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement about the survey and about the provision of money for development, but I urge him, if possible, to accept the idea of a zero subhead which could be filled in in better times by aids that are available from the EC.  In regard to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, seeing that a sweep of the Erne affected by a link-up between the Erne and the Shannon has tremendous tourist potential, people in County Fermanagh have told me they see it as we do.  There is an airport near Enniskillen which adds to the amenity value.</P>

      <P>Section 5 confers on the commissioners new powers &mdash; a greater level of protection over canal property, <Col N="258" /> the question of public amenity and fishing.  The River Barrow, which runs through my constituency, is part of the canal system.  Under section 5, perhaps even sections 6 and 7, new powers are being conferred on the commissioners that could take away rights which the people have enjoyed over a very long period of time, particularly fishing rights. The Barrow-Nore Tourism Association are particularly concerned that a certain association could now apply to the Fisheries Board for a licence to control a certain section of the River Barrow which, up to now, they could not have controlled.  If that is so, this is very serious and I would like the Minister to clarify it.  If I am not happy with his clarification, I will ask that an amendment be introduced to prevent this happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be for the Commissioners of Public Works to decide how the Barrow Navigation is to be used for fishing, boating or other recreational use at particular times.  While this Bill spells this out in more detail, it must be remembered that CIE also had these powers. Any interested body who are concerned about this can contact the commissioners, put their case to them and seek whatever facilities they desire.  The Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry will have the overall power to determine the types and times of fishing under the general regulations.  We have been very careful in this Bill to ensure that there will be consultation with the Minister responsible for fisheries.  That has been written into the Bill so that the rights of the people interested in that sport are catered for.  There must be control if there is to be an orderly use of the amenity.  As far as the Barrow is concerned, I believe this legislation will greatly ease the situation without taking away any rights.</P>

      <P>I am still concerned that the power to make the final decision should be retained by the Minister. Nobody objects to the regulation of fishing on the river.  The various organisations concerned would be in total agreement with the approach to protect certain <Col N="259" /> species, but they are worried about the wording of this section because we are conferring new powers on the commissioners. If an association I form want control over a certain section of that river, the commissioners can grant me that power.  If that is so, that is going against the practice which has been in existence for many years and could have serious adverse effects on tourism.  Many people visit this area because it is one of the most attractive inland tourist areas in the country.  One of the main attractions is fishing and we would not want anything to happen which would interfere with that.  We want the same level of freedom which has existed up to now to continue. The organisations concerned will cooperate and ensure that species are protected, but they do not want a powerful association to step in and interfere with a practice which has been in existence for the past 200 years.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the fears expressed by fishing interests we introduced on Report Stage in the Seanad an amendment to section 5 as follows:</P>
      <P>(2)  The Commissioners shall consult with the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in relation to any matters which affect or could affect fish, fish life, fish stocks or fishing in the canals.</P>
      <P>There has been liaison between the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry and the Office of Public Works to ensure that no difficulties will arise in that area.  This amendment was introduced to allay fears similar to those expressed by Deputy Dowling and it was regarded at that time as being satisfactory. Someone has to have overall control and it is appropriate that in this case the Commissioners of Public Works should have this control to ensure the smooth running of that amenity.

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it absolutely clear the Commissioners of Public Works will have power to draw water from the River Liffey and certain other sources for the canals.  CIE have such specific power already under Acts going back to 1771 and 1772.  Those Acts are being repealed by section 16 of the Bill because many of their provisions have been superseded by other canals legislation and the necessary new provisions for the canals are included in the Canals Bill.  This amendment is actually introduced in response to a doubt in the matter expressed by the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland and it is really to copperfasten the situation which we felt was there.

Examples of the works to be facilitated include the laying by local authorities of sewerage or water pipes, or the laying by Bord Gáis Éireann of gas pipelines along or under the bed of the canals, the maintenance, repair or development of private property adjoining the canals or canal property.  Such facilitation can only involve the temporary closure of any part of the canals to navigation or the temporary alteration of the water level of any part of the canals as specifically provided for in the text.  It is envisaged that the facilitation of local authorities and so on would involve only a short period of disruption to either navigation or other uses of the canals where such disruption could not be avoided altogether.  Obviously, the Commissioners of Public Works will see to it that any disruption is kept to the minimum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of this section give the commissioners power to make by-laws.  There are a number of by-laws already established under CIE; there is a string of by-laws pertaining to the canals.  There is what is known as by-law No. 51 which has been used by CIE and which has caused a lot of difficulty for Kildare County Council.  I do not know by-law No. 51 off by heart but it relates to roads alongside the canal. Kildare County Council have experienced difficulty in certain areas where there are a number of houses alongside the Grand Canal with roads leading to and from those houses, particularly in the Robertstown area of County Kildare. When Kildare County Council wanted to provide money to improve the roadways along the canal in order to render it possible for people to gain access to their houses, CIE presented the excuse that <Col N="267" /> they could not do so under by-law No. 51, that that by-law prevented a local authority doing anything with the road because it was the property of CIE.  CIE have used the provisions of by-law No. 51 to prevent the carrying out of much improvement works and so on.  I note that the provisions of this section give the commissioners power to make by-laws. What will happen to the existing by-laws under CIE pertaining to the canals?  Will they all be scrapped?  Will there be agreement reached with local authorities and so on?</P>
      <P>My interest in the canals is well known. My family have been at the fourteenth lock of the Grand Canal since the canal was opened in 1760.  My family have lived there in continuous succession.  Apparently, there is one other family only on the Grand Canal in continuous line as lock-keepers.  Will the CIE by-laws be continued under the provisions of this Bill or will the commissioners introduce a whole new series of by-laws?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am exceedingly interested in the power being conferred on the commissioners giving them the right to make by-laws.  Subsection (h) reads:</P>
      <P>the removal from the canals or other canal property of any boat or thing which is or may become a danger to life, navigation or fish stocks or would otherwise interfere with the proper use of the canals or other canal property;</P>
      <P>Then there is subsection (f), which reads:</P>
      <P>the regulation of fishing in the canals...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does &ldquo;the regulation of fishing&rdquo; mean?  Here again would the power being given to the commissioners be an exclusive power?  Will the Minister play a consultative role only in this matter?  Furthermore will the by-law which the commissioners are empowered to make under this section conflict in any way with the provisions of sections 5 or 6, which would appear to afford a measure of protection which people have already?  I am thinking <Col N="268" /> in particular of my own area.  If the commissioners could introduce a by-law that would give exclusive rights to fishing&mdash;to certain sections over others&mdash;that would have serious repercussions in my area and I am certain also in others.</P>
    <P>Therefore the provisions of these sections with regard to the power of the commissioners to make by-laws warrant considerable clarification.  The House needs to be assured that the existing privileges enjoyed by people on our canals and canals' road network will not be interfered with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The CIE canals by-laws, as they exist, derive from nineteenth century legislation.  They were devised to cater for the canals when they served as major arteries for commercial traffic as such.  On vesting day&mdash;here I refer to the point raised by Deputy McCreevy&mdash;they will cease to exist and the Commissioners of Public Works will introduce their own by-laws.  Consultations are already in progress.</P>
      <P>On the points raised by Deputy Dowling and others, I want to reassure the House that the whole idea is to make better use of the canals and to improve their amenities; and the provisions of the Bill will ensure sympathetic consideration by the Commissioners of Public Works.  They must have control, as such, in order to ensure that the whole system is operated in an orderly fashion, that best use is made of the amenity now being transferred to them.  I believe that no difficulty such as Deputy Dowling fears will arise, or indeed others mentioned by Deputy Wilson.  There is no provision for the laying of orders before the House, about which Deputy Wilson asked.  It was felt that it would not be wise to be unduly restrictive as far as the authority of the commissioners is concerned.  The commissioners have great experience in handling these kinds of things without any grave difficulties arising.  They are very benevolent so far as the control of shooting and fishing is concerned.  They are doing a very good job.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to their previous activity in regard to the canal which, as far as I was concerned, they did not handle very well.  A young man who erected a house on property owned by the canal company has been endeavouring over the past 11 years to obtain the title to it.  He has squatters title to it.  He has been paying a bridging loan for 11 years.  I hope when the Commissioners take this over they will be more efficient as far as the property is concerned.  In years to come if those canals went out of operation, as happened with the Ulster Canal, it would cause serious problems as far as pollution, drainage and bridges are concerned.  Monaghan County Council had serious problems in maintaining bridges and in the removal of bridges at a very high cost.  I am not satisfied that the Office of Public Works have lived up to their responsibilities over the past number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's reply to my question about control.  The House will recall that on the Free Ports Bill I was very worried about the powers which the Minister was given with regard to the management and control of the new free port.  Cork was the first one.  I was also worried that there was no appeal to the High Court arising from the Minister's decision on whether <Col N="270" /> or not to grant a licence.  I am now concerned that the commissioners are being given extensive powers here.  Apart from the natural justice plea mentioned when the Free Ports Bill was going through the House, there do not seem to be proper safeguards of citizens-groups' rights here. In section 7 (3) (a) we read that a person shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 and £100 a day after that.  Section 7 (3) (b) states:</P>
      <P>on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £5,000 (together with, in the case of a continuing contravention, a fine not exceeding £500 for every day on which the contravention is continued) or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years...</P>
      <P>These are very extensive judicial and legislative powers being put into the hands of the Commissioners without any restraint, without any brake.  This House should not let that pass without notice.  If there were provision for a review by the Houses of the Oireachtas there would be a safeguard for citizens.  In fact, there is no such provision.  I cannot understand how that was left out of the Bill.  I would like some assurance from the Minister that an attempt will be made on Report Stage to put in such a provision for a review by the Houses of the Oireachtas or a provision for an appeal to the High Court.</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Leonard he can approach the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works.  It does not come under the scope of this Bill.  With regard to section 10 which deals with local authorities and the section dealing with bridges on the Royal and Grand Canals, it will greatly facilitate matters.  Offaly County Council were the main people concerned with this and they were very satisfied with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point raised by Deputy Wilson, some of the penalties introduced follow along the lines of the previously existing legislation regarding water pollution.  He has made a strong case to which I am very sympathetic as regards placing the by-laws before the House in the ordinary <Col N="271" /> way.  I would be willing to introduce an amendment on the following lines:</P>
    <P>Every by-law made by the Commissioners under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution is passed by either House of the Oireachtas within the next twenty-one days on which such House has sat after the by-law is laid before it annulling such by-law, such by-law shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such by-law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am glad that the Minister is introducing such an amendment.  Section 7 is the most important section in the Bill.  It gives powers to the Commissioners to make by-laws which will regulate the operation of the canals.  When any changes in the by-laws are made they will be put before the House.  If we pass this section without the amendment then the Office of Public Works can do anything they like, just as CIE have done anything they liked over the years with regard to making by-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) (i) refers <i>inter alia</i> to the charging and fixing of fees, tolls and charges in respect of the use by boats of <Col N="272" /> the canals (including the use of locks on the canals and mooring on the canals) and the taking of water from the canals. There are a certain number of people, although not many, who have agreements with CIE regarding taking water from the canals at present.  Many times because people forced the situation CIE have more or less had to agree to this. Will those arrangements still stand with CIE?</P>

      <P>Section 7 states that after the vesting day the commissioners may make by-laws for the care and management of canals and canal property. What is the position regarding the tributaries that feed the canal?  The Grand Canal is fed by a number of waterways. The Morrell is a river that feeds the canal around the Sallins area.  The Milltown Feeder also feeds it.  At present there are different kinds of water courses which are the property of CIE whose job it is to maintain them.  There are very few people employed in doing that kind of work.  Some years ago it used to be a generator of social employment before the canals were closed down but they are still the property of CIE.  Notwithstanding the power of the commissioners to make by-laws, will that power extend to those rivers also?  I am not sure if this comes under this section but perhaps the Minister may answer it.  A number of people for donkeys years, including my own family, have had rights to rent along the banks of the Grand Canal on one side or the other.  Will their rental agreements continue under the Commissioners of Public Works or will they be done away with?</P>

It is very proper that all of these difficulties should be voiced.  I would like to re-emphasise <Col N="273" /> that this is an area in which there will be progress and a better handling and management of the canals.</P>

I understand that the rights of way and rights of entry that presently exist in regard to canal property under CIE will continue on into this legislation.  This has caused a lot of trouble in certain areas in County Kildare.  I take it that the existing rights of way and rights of entry which have been there for generations will continue when the Office of Public Works take over.  I am delighted that the OPW are taking over the canals from CIE.  It is a very positive step because since they closed the canals in 1959 CIE have ignored them and done nothing with them.  It could not be any worse.  It is a step in the right direction to preserve the waterways as they are.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to formally involve the Commissioners of Public Works in the statutory consultation and consent arrangements for any bridge works relating to the Grand Canal or the Royal Canal which a road authority might wish to undertake.  Those statutory arrangements are provided for in the Local Government Act, 1946.  The amendment copperfastens the assurance given by the then Minister of State, Deputy Bermingham, to the Dáil on 21 May 1985 on Second Stage of the Canals Bill, that the policy would be to ensure that no decisions are taken which would add to the obstacles already in the way of restoring the Royal Canal to navigation. The Minister for Communications, who has overall responsibility for navigation matters nationwide, will continue to be involved in those statutory consultation and consent arrangements in so far as the Royal Canal and Grand Canal and other waterways are concerned.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment but I do not think the metaphor about the horse and stable door is suitable. Some damage has already been done in the case of the Royal Canal which will leave it more difficult to open up stretches of it to navigation which are now closed.  In some instances, a kind of minor public vandalism was perpetrated by local authorities which will leave this whole thing difficult.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the exact details but apparently the main source of income is from the lock gates.  I do not know the intention of the commissioners in this respect.  I presume they hope to get more traffic passing through.  The overall cost is something in excess of £1 million per year for the upkeep of the canals. What we are talking about by way of income is very small.  Regrettably I do not have the exact manner in which this is quantified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will send it on to me.  I already mentioned some research that was done by the Old Dublin Society to give the charges for the beginning of the last century.  They seem substantial, taking everything into account for that time, even the cost of the meals on the barges and so on.  Perhaps the Minister would send on the costs to me.  It emphasises the importance of the OPW seeing themselves in a developmental role with regard to the canals.</P>
      <P>If the upkeep of the canals cost £1 million, the objective should at least be to break even because there will be other gains for the country if tourists are using the canals.  On Second Stage I mentioned that I was on the Norfolk Broads once, where the people thought they were enjoying themselves and it was so crowded that the prow of one boat was touching the stern of another.  We have the potential for the development of our canals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There is £1 million outlay and an income of £50,000 which is disgracefully low.  There is great potential in the canals.  While the canals might not be self-financing they should come near to it in the future.  In many areas we have room for development which would bring in finance.  The canals are a great amenity for fishing and boating and there is an <Col N="280" /> increased interest in this area in the field of tourism.  The State should not have to carry the can for the canals as time goes on.  The canals should become more self-financing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Leonard about making the canals self-financing even though I have a small reputation for considering that every arm of the State should pay for itself.  We should encourage more traffic on the canals: cruises, holidays, fishing and so on.  I hope the OPW will improve stretches of the canals to make them environmentally attractive so as to encourage more people, including tourists, to use the amenities of the canals. Kildare is not a noted tourist area but there is an example there of what a small community can do for their area.  In the area of Prosperous they now have the biggest percentage of tourist bed nights in the county, all stemming from the work they did in cleaning up a stretch of the Grand Canal to make it attractive for people to fish.  There must be at least 30 houses in that small area which are into the bed and breakfast scene in a big way. Throughout the year five or six groups come from England to fish on the Grand Canal.  These people, with the help of CIE, whom I congratulate, cleaned up an area of the canal and it is now almost the best coarse fishing area in the country.</P>

This is an amenity which should be cleaned up and made reasonably profitable, although as a nation we can afford to have a canal that would not have to pay for itself. The canal should be funded out of public funds as the spin off tourist element involved will pay in the long term.</P>

      <P>CIE annual accounts show at present that the income from the canals is £50,000 a year as compared with costs of £1.3 million.  I agree with Deputies that it has enormous potential.  The Commissioners of Public Works, with their experience on waterways, are the people who can develop this potential.  It would be a reward in itself to see this 200 year old man-made amenity used by people. However, I would never turn down income that would come from it.  I am trying to encourage income and to encourage a philosophy where that income would in turn be used to further develop the amenities of the area concerned. I am sure Deputy McCreevy would agree with that use of finance.</P>

    <P>The big one is the property at the railway side of a line to be drawn between the Royal Canal and the railway alongside for over 50 miles.  This is from Dublin to Mullingar.

      <P>This Schedule refers to lands that are not to be transferred under this Bill.  My concern is that there may be more property not being transferred by this Bill and I am trying to explain why.  CIE closed the Grand Canal in 1959 and some years after that they adopted a policy regarding the selling of houses and lock houses to the existing tenants.  The people, the grandfathers and fathers of lock keepers on the Grand Canal, had been there for many years &mdash; in my case since about 1771 &mdash; and succession was continued in that way, but the house was always the property of CIE or the old time Grand Canal Company before CIE took them over.  The canals were closed in 1959, and as then there would not be normal navigation on them except for cabin cruisers etc., CIE decided to amalgamate the control of locks.  For example, if three locks were close together one lock keeper was kept on in his job and looked after the three locks and the other lock keepers were let go and given a pension.  For the interest of the House, I remember people who had been for 45 years canal boatmen, as they were called, and in 1959 they thought they were getting a fortune when they got a pension of £6 per week for the rest of their lives.  We know what £6 is worth now and it goes <Col N="284" /> to show how times have changed.  As I have said, if, for example, three locks were close together, one lock keeper would continue as an employee of CIE, he was paid his normal wage etc. and his house was still property rented from CIE. In regard to the other houses where people dwelt who had been let go, CIE in some cases gave the people the option to purchase their houses.  Times were much harder than they are now, bad and all as they are, and many people did not take up that offer then.  However, some people did not for very small money as things turned out, and a bit of land went with the houses.  We were among the lucky people who availed of the offer at the time and we got half an acre or so. Ex-lock keepers were living in houses and paying a very nominal rent to CIE and they did not take up the offer at that time.  In the sixties CIE abandoned that policy.  All the lock houses were within ten yards of a lock, and CIE must have decided that to sell many of these houses and a little property with them would not be very good long term strategy.  If some new policy on the canals were evolved the property and houses would be privately owned and what could be done?  Therefore, they stopped offering the option to people to buy their houses.  As a result of that a number of people are living in lock houses right along the Grand Canal who are still paying rent to CIE, and their families have been there for perhaps 100 years in direct succession.  Generally, if your father was a lock keeper you got the job.  I do not know how many such houses are left now.  Probably there are some in the Barrow navigation.  I hope the people in those houses will be given the option of buying them out at a nominal price. I would like to see that property not transferred under this Bill but those people given the option of purchasing their own homes.</P>

I do not know the overall intention as regards the houses and perhaps the necessity of preserving them.  If, as we expect and hope, greater use will be made of the canal in the future under the regulations, anyone involved in the way in which the Deputy spoke about should not suffer as a result of the transfer that is taking place now.  I will pass his concern along to the OPW.</P>

      <P>I am pleased in general at having this Bill passed by the Oireachtas. I hope that the potential that we envisage will be realised.  It is important that the Office of Public Works look at the scene now with a developmental eye.  The matter can go into a backwater with people saying that the OPW are now responsible for it.  I am not one of those who have been criticising that office as being automatically incompetent.  Many stories go the rounds about the Office of Public Works.  They have a reservoir of talent, particularly with regard to preservation, whatever about development. I am a little worried about development and that is why I thought it would have been desirable to have had a subhead. That would point the way to a developmental attitude towards the canals.  The potential is great.  I hope there will be a small nucleus of people, led by the Minister of State, whose aim will be to develop the canals for the benefit of the economy of the country basically and for the improvement of our environment also.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill forward.  I am glad to see this legislation enacted. The Grand and Royal Canals are being transferred from being under the aegis of CIE to that of the Office of Public Works. Nothing but good can come from this. It was just a small part of CIE's total operation and since the closing down of the canals in the fifties CIE have not really had any interest in them.  I hope the Commissioners of Public Works will develop the canals.  This is a very important asset for the country and can attract more tourism.  The canals are an integral part of our tradition.  Certainly they are of the tradition of the area from which I <Col N="287" /> come.  I have operated canal boats, slept in them, canoed and had a lot of sport on the canals all my life and so had many generations before me.  I hope the Commissioners of Public Works will develop the canals and try to realise their full potential.  They can be a very important part of Irish life.  Amenities on the canal are a very short distance from Dublin and if developed to their proper potential will have a very beneficial effect on the economy. I hope the Commissioners take it as their very serious duty not to allow them to languish as happened since the canals closed in the fifties.</P>

    <Title>Courts (No. 2) Bill, 1986: Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a straightforward, although somewhat technical, Bill.  Its purpose is (i)  to designate Galway as a High Court appeal town for appeals from the Circuit Court sitting in the County Borough of Galway, and (ii)  to allow the Minister for Justice, after consultation with the President of the High Court, to alter the composition of a High Court Circuit by adding or removing counties and/or county boroughs.</P>
      <P>The need for the legislation arises from the fact that under the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, Galway is specified as the appeal town for the county of Galway only.  The county borough of Galway was established on 1 January 1986 under section 5 of the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985 and is not, therefore, comprehended by the 1936 Act. This legislation will cater for the new county borough.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation the counties and county boroughs &mdash; other than the county of Dublin and the county borough of Dublin &mdash; which existed at the time of the passing of the 1936 Act are divided into four High Court Circuits, namely, the eastern, western, southern and north-ern circuits.  The county of Galway only is included in the western circuit.  It will be necessary for me, as soon as this legislation is passed and after consultation with the President of the High Court, to make an order adding the county borough of Galway to the western circuit of the High Court.</P>
      <P>There is provision also in the Bill which will ensure that appeals lodged before the passing of this Act may be heard by the High Court on Circuit sitting in Galway.</P>
      <P>The Bill is necessary for the due administration of justice and I commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>We have no objection to <Col N="289" /> the Minister proposing this Courts (No. 2)  Bill.  It will have the support of this side of the House.

We happily give our full support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  The anomaly created by not having this amendment made would have meant that the Circuit Court could not have sat in Galway.  Whereas there might be some who would be very happy if that were so, there would be quite a number of others who would not be so happy. This arose as a result of a very historic and unique decision by the Government to give Galway a borough status. Although it was not seen at first that this would have to be done, a number of dramatic changes will be occurring in the next five years to give Galway its total independence.  This is only one of many, I am sure.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it will pass very briefly through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  In any event, we are prepared to go along with the Government on this measure in taking it in the rather unusual way in <Col N="290" /> which it is being taken, with all Stages being taken today, the Bill having been circulated last night.  I appreciate that the need for it has arisen quite suddenly. Why has the problem arisen now?  It is a consequence of changes made earlier in the administration of local authorities. An order was made for the County Borough of Galway under the 1985 Act, on 1 January this year.  If the order was made then, how is it that between 1 January and 25 February nothing was done and the matter arises here as late as today? When an order like that is made in the first instance, consequential changes are set out in the documentation accompanying the Bill.  Therefore, the need for this change must have been known on 1 January.</P>
      <P>Yet here we are faced with an emergency situation.  The High Court is due to sit in Galway next week and no provision has been made for the hearing of appeals to the High Court from the Circuit Court. There is no provision in the 1936 Act, so it has to be made in a hurry today, otherwise there would be great difficulty in Galway next week.  We appreciate the Government's difficulty and we are prepared to facilitate them, but why did the delay occur?  It was known last year that this would happen, yet an order was made on 1 January by the Minister for the Environment, and he must have known about the difficulties then.  Why did he not tell his colleague, the then Minister for Justice, about this difficulty?  Did he tell the Minister for Justice or did he neglect to do so?  When the order was made by the Minister for the Environment a brief would have been prepared. Instead we are forced to deal with this retrospective legislation and the whole thing has left citizens and the courts in a difficult position because of lack of attention to administrative details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the House will give the Minister leave to make the necessary rearrangements and the thing will be put back on an even keel, but this kind of thing should not be happening.  What would have happened if this arose when the House was not in session?  Some other means would have to be found to make <Col N="291" /> the rearrangement but that would mean a longer period of retrospection.</P>
    <P>Though the Opposition are prepared to be helpful to the Minister and the Government, it is not a good thing to allows things like this to happen.  This is dealing with legislation in a piecemeal way, making minor changes in the basic Act.  We know a great deal of work remains to be done in relation to the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  The administrative side needs to be brought up to date.</P>
    <P>Last weekend one of the Minister's colleagues, Deputy Gay Mitchell, spoke about the courts, and the Oireachtas Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism have been looking at the courts of justice.  Deputy Mitchell expressed the feeling that wigs and gowns should be got rid of from the courts. Perhaps I agree with him about the wigs, but I would be inclined to keep the gowns because we must retain some semblance of the seriousness of the work done in the courts.  We should not denigrate the importance of the work of the courts in any way.  Of course we all agree that the surroundings of the work of the courts leave a lot to be desired.  Most of them are out of date and need complete revision and modernisation.  One of the things that come to mind in this regard are on-the-spot fines, an extension of that system.  Of course there should be an appeal back to the courts from such fines and I would ask the Minister to consider this area of the administration of justice. There can be cases in regard to the absence of a tail light from a car, bald tyres and other such offences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This area of administration is in great need of re-examination.  I would prefer the Minister to bring in a Bill making real changes as regards the administration of the courts rather than making piecemeal changes in the 1936 Act.  I would like to see changes made in on-the-spot fines and in other areas.  The buildings in which the appeals will take place are also a matter of concern because they are out of date.  We must have a commitment to modernise many <Col N="293" /> of these buildings and to provide a system which will ensure that the administration of the courts is carried out in an efficient and business-like way.

      <P>We are amending the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, adding a county borough but we are also giving the Minister authority in the future to make any further additions he wants to make.  Section (aa) says that the Minister may in future, alter the composition of a High Court Circuit by adding to or removing from the Circuit a county or counties, a county borough or county boroughs or a county or counties and a county borough or county boroughs, and so on.  If he makes any of these changes in the future he will affect the administration of the courts.  This will also affect the place where the courts are held and how they are administered.  The Minister is not just adding to a Schedule, as Government Deputies are suggesting, he is also giving himself powers to add to and subtract from these courts as he pleases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very appreciative if the Chair allowed me to proceed to deal with this Bill and to examine the areas which are relevant.  The Minister could subsequently add any county borough or county he feels like and that will have serious implications for the courts.  If he makes these changes at some future date he should first deal with the administration of justice in the courts in a more comprehensive way, and improve the administration of the courts for all who seek justice.  I have already mentioned that the Minister could extend the scope of on-the-spot fines, driving licences and road taxes.  He should consider codifying the law in relation to this area, bringing in Schedules which would relate to sentencing policy.  People appeal the on-the-spot fines in court because it is so easy to <Col N="294" /> do so.  This too should be looked at and it should not be so easy to appeal.  Having delayed proceedings for a long time, having cost many people a lot of money and time, the people involved may end up with a reduced fine&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Or an increased fine as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not happen very often.  This is a point to which the Minister should give his attention.  He should see what is actually happening on the ground.  We have seen from recent court reports that the system is jammed because of appeals, the issue of licences and so on.  This is an area where computerisation would help.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Garda are not involved unnecessarily in court cases. They should be on the beat as far as possible, not tied up with appeals which are only making use of the system.  When the Minister examines the criminal legal aid scheme he will find that appeals can be used as a delaying device.  I cannot go into this in detail at the moment because I am only allowed make a passing reference to it but this is another area which should be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of cases for which the Minister needs this Bill through in a hurry, by 3 March, deal particularly with tax appeals.  The Minister might look at the way these appeals operate.  As a result of the 1985 Act which altered the boundaries, a number of things are happening. One of the effects of this Act has been that the Howth court closed and any provision of a court in Howth would be a matter for the county.  This means the county would have to make financial provision for this court whereas in the city of Dublin the courts come directly under the Department of Justice.  I would like the Minister to tell us the extent to which that occurs within the county.  Is it only to provide court facilities?  Does it happen in any of the other major towns like Galway or Waterford?  What does the Minister think of this arrangement?  I am very interested in this because Howth has just been shifted into the county and has <Col N="295" /> lost its court.  The reply I had from the former Minister was that it is up to the local authority if they want to provide a court there.  The situation in relation to Dublin is that the Department of Justice will provide a court.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in Galway?  As I understand it they come directly under the county.  This has implications for the provision of the facilities in that areas as, indeed, it does in other areas throughout the country.  Would the Minister let us know what is the position in relation to that aspect of the administration of the courts and what plans he has for future development in that area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the detail of the Bill, on the one hand it adds this extra section to the schedule covering Galway County Borough.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, would watch the deals he might make as carefully as we feel we have to watch the small Bills that go through here, then the deals made by Ministers might be a little safer in the long run. Let us not sneer at the Opposition for checking in detail what is happening in a Bill, however small the Bill may be or however hurriedly the Government may want to put it through the House.  Section 1 (1) (b) gives the Minister power in future to add or subtract, to alter the composition of a High Court circuit by adding to or removing from the circuit a county or counties.  Would the Minister tell us if he has any intention at this stage of adding or removing other counties or changing or altering any other counties because this provision gives him the power to do that, which he has not at the moment?</P>
    <P>I take it that the Act will require the Minister to put the regulations before the House in any event and that will also apply to paragraph (aa) of subsection (b) of this section and therefore any change he makes will have to come before the House to be dealt with.  The other sections of the Bill deal with the retrospective aspects of this legislation and they attempt to highlight the point I raised at the beginning, that is that it is retrospective legislation and the Government are <Col N="296" /> seeking to be covered in the Bill.  Subsection (2) (b) states:</P>
    <P>A notice of appeal served before such passing in respect of a judgment or order referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not be invalid by reason only of the fact that an appeal town, within the meaning aforesaid, for the County Borough of Galway did not stand specified or that paragraph (a) of this subsection was not in force, at the time of such service.</P>
    <P>This indicates quite clearly the retrospective problems the Government may have in relation to this Bill.  I mention it to emphasise the fact that it is preferable that these matters be dealt with at the time they arise in the first instance because they had to arise on two occasions previously.  The first occasion was when the Act was passed in 1985 and secondly, and probably more specifically, when the order for the County Borough of Galway under the 1985 Act was made by the Minister for the Environment on 1 January 1986.  It must have been abundantly clear at that time, even if it was in any way covered up by events in the previous more important Act.  The Minister for the Environment must have asked himself if he should be making an order in this area.  The Minister for Justice has not made any particular reference to that retrospective aspect of it.</P>

I was gratified to see the smiling countenance of Deputy Flynn obviously prepared to deal with the matter competently.</P>

      <P>The Minister said at the end of his speech:</P>
      <P>There is provision also in the Bill which will ensure that appeals lodged before the passing of this Act may be heard by the High Court on circuit sitting in Galway.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill because the Government have to provide that at this stage.  Provision should have been made at the time it occurred in the first instance.  I am not accusing the Minister in this respect.  I know he is only a short period in his present portfolio and I do not believe he would have been involved in the earlier situation except in collective Cabinet responsibility.  On 1 January there was a very definite situation when the Minister for the Environment made the order.  I am quite sure his officials told him at that time of the consequential changes because we all know the different Departments have to put their views to one another in relation to these matters.  I find it hard to understand why the Minister for the Environment did not consider making an order under that Act to adjust the situation, which would have been the less desirable approach or he might have gone away from that and said that it was a matter which should have been dealt with under the 1936 Courts of Justice Act and that he would pass it on to the Department of Justice.  Was it passed on at that time or was it passed over and the courts had to get into a difficulty before anything was done?  If that is the case I ask the Minister to ensure that that type of thing will not happen in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wanted to bring this in urgently to the House and he wanted to get all Stages passed today.  We told him <Col N="298" /> we were prepared to do that and that we would support the Bill.  The Minister should refrain from making petty criticism of the Opposition spokesman for the fact that the Bill came in earlier this morning than was anticipated by the Whips because I have to get the Act, read it to see what is in it to make sure there is nothing happening that the Minister and his Department have not noticed or that we would not notice on First Reading. I was in the process of finalising that when the business came on early. Otherwise I would have been sitting here waiting, as the Minister said, just like himself.  But given the circumstances it is the kind of comment that ill becomes a Minister.  I have told the Minister we are prepared to agree all Stages today.  We are happy to agree the Second Reading now.</P>

      <P>The House appreciates the difficulty of the Opposition spokesman in getting his act together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I shall not speak for more than a couple of minutes.  I would like to make a passing reference to one or two points made.  First, with regard to the comment Deputy Woods made regarding my comments on the wearing of wigs and gowns, I might point out that solicitors do not wear wigs and gowns but that does not take from the dignity of the court in any way.  In introducing this Bill I regret that we have not the time to go further in specifying certain matters which can take place not just in these courts but in others as well.  I hope the Minister, in his term of office, will take on board the need to reform the whole courts system which will affect these courts as it will others.  There is undoubted need for court reform.  Every Minister for Justice in recent times who has endeavoured to do so has met resistance on the part of the Bar, has been told by the Bar that they will not have change. I was confronted recently by the Bar Council contending that it was up to the Legislature to effect the change.  I now put it to the Legislature to take this on board.  It is absurd to continue to allow the restrictive practice of four lawyers <Col N="299" /> having to be engaged by anybody taking a case in order to brief senior counsel.  It is a restrictive practice, unfair, outmoded and one that should not be allowed continue.</P>
    <P>I note that The Workers' Party &mdash; who are very adept at making suggestions on all sorts of Bills, raising questions about all sorts of costs and pensions &mdash; have never seen fit to put down a question about the fees paid to certain free legal aid lawyers, presumably because that affects one of their members.  A system that allows certain members of the legal profession to claim more than the President, the Taoiseach and the Chief Justice put together in free legal aid fees is an absurd one.  I hope the Minister will avail of the opportunity to reform the entire courts system in his term of office.  I know it is a big but he is capable of it.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to affect a detailed reform of the courts system within his term of office.  I take this opportunity of wishing him well in his difficult task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to wish the Minister success in his new Department.  Indeed, we in Galway city were privileged to welcome him when, as his first official duty as Minister for Justice, he opened the new Garda station in Millstreet, a fine building which I am sure the Minister will agree will serve as a showpiece for the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>I should like to follow up on one of the points made by Deputy Woods, that in January 1985 the order for county borough status was made for Galway.  The intentions of the Government had been made clear six months previously.  I should like to know when the Department of the Environment established contact with the Department of Justice in relation to the order now before us.  Did they establish such contact or was it something discovered by the Department of Justice?  Why was there such delay in bringing it forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us wanted to make points <Col N="300" /> about the courts system, particularly those of us from Galway.  We wanted to state what we would like to see changed. In that regard, the present condition of Galway courthouse leaves a lot to be desired.  It is an old building in a very bad state of repair.  All of us feel it is either worthy of restoration or, if not, knocking it down and rebuilding it with the same kind of facade.  There is a tremendous lack of facilities there.  For example, there is lack of privacy for consultations between clients and their solicitors.  With the burden on the courts so great and being added to daily, we need these kinds of facilities.</P>
    <P>The general upkeep of courthouses at present is a matter of financial burden and strain on local authorities.  Heretofore, Galway County Council undertook the maintenance work on Galway courthouse, with the county borough, or the corporation, paying their proportion towards such costs.  Henceforth, the county borough will pay their proportion. In these times of general under-financing of local authorities &mdash; when it comes to Estimates time and pruning must be effected in certain areas &mdash; one item that has been consistently pruned within each local authority has been the amount of money expended on the upkeep of courthouses. As a result the courthouse in Galway missed out consistently.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister's predecessor sent officers of the Office of Public Works into Galway courthouse to carry out urgent repairs.  The Office of Public Works are now billing the local authority with those costs.  This year in our estimates &mdash; which have not been decided at all as yet &mdash; there is something in the region of less than £30,000 for the county borough proportion of the cost of the upkeep of Galway courthouse, representing 28 per cent of the cost only. When one adds in what Galway County Council pay one arrives at a figure of over £99,000.  That is not at all sufficient to bring the courthouse up to the necessary standard.  I suggest that the upkeep of courthouses in the future should be a matter for the Department of Justice. They are the people who receive the fines <Col N="301" /> which are collected.  If we want to have the level of service that is desirable then this kind of work should be carried out by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>As Deputy G. Mitchell suggested, I hope the Minister, will effect some reforms in the courts system during his term of office.  I might ask the Minister how many appeals are awaiting hearing at present.  For example, what is the time lapse before an appeal is heard?  We are told there are long delays involved.  Has the Minister any proposals now or in the near future to have such delays minimised? All of us feel that court appearances by members of the Garda take up an inordinate amount of their time which could more properly be devoted to crime detection.  As all of us know, they can spend days waiting in courthouses without having the case in which they are involved called for hearing.</P>
    <P>We are delighted to support the Bill. In replying, I hope the Minister will respond to some of the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for Justice on having come into the House the third time in two years with improvements in the courts area.  Here I might make particular reference to the Minister's comment that one of the purposes of this Bill is to allow the Minister for Justice, after consultation with the President of the High Court, to alter the composition of a High Court by adding or removing counties and/or county boroughs.  Because of the backlog of cases it has been the practice in the past in the High Court and Circuit Court system for solicitors to search around the country, to establish what is the backlog in, say, Galway, Naas, Cork, or wherever, and to take cases which have been held up for years, occasioning people terrible hardship, with unscrupulous insurance companies endeavouring to delay as long as possible severely injured accident victims from getting compensation through the courts.  In many cases where there were serious injuries sustained they operated in the hope that the victims would die, before their case came up for <Col N="302" /> hearing.  In others they tended to force victims to accept reduced compensation or less than that to which they were entitled. It is good to see that the Minister is taking a further hand in controlling this situation.  I do not agree with the abolition of the civil injuries.  It is a cave-in to the vested interest of the insurance companies who are not contributing anything to the State but are taking from it.</P>
      <P>Because the Minister is taking this power upon himself he will be able to improve the efficiency of the courts and to eliminate backlogs to a large extent. People who are desperately awaiting the solution of a case and who in the meantime are suffering terrible injuries are not getting the kind of care and attention they should be getting.  While they wait for the case to be settled they suffer the indignity of outrageously highly paid barristers coming together for consultations of half-an-hour on one or two occasions and taking fees of £20,000 to £25,000 each out of the unfortunate victim's compensation. This is an opportunity to cut back on that.  As a result of the good work done by my colleague, Deputy Allen, over the last number of years there seems to be highlighting of the enormous injustice and the enormous fees that are resulting from eight lawyers sitting together like carrion crows over an accident victim's&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Skelly is moving slightly away from the Bill.  He is dealing with section 2 which is to allow the Minister to consult with the President of the High Court.  It deals with the composition of the High Court.  There is no mention of excessive fees or legal affairs in that section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>You interrupted me in midstride. It allows the Minister to alter the composition of a High Court circuit by adding or removing counties and county <Col N="303" /> boroughs.  It is the practice for solicitors who are trying to get cases solved to look at the lists in Galway, Naas and Cork and to put cases in places like Mayo and Dublin on those lists.  If they do not get on the Galway list they put them on the Naas list.  These lawyers at their consultations are like carrion crows taking the best pickings from unfortunate victims, especially in injury cases.  The professions are becoming more aware that the public know about the enormous fees that cannot be justified and the extra heavy representation in the courts during certain cases.  I hope the Minister will make progress along the lines of his predecessor. He was unfairly ridiculed by Deputy Andrews when he brought in the first such Bill two years ago.  He said that it was a joke and that this was not reform. Since then he has brought in three reviews, one of which relates to Galway as a High Court appeal town for appeals from the Circuit Court.  The major portion of the cases take place in Dublin because it is the major population centre. We could end up honing in on the problems of backlogs, representation, inefficiency and costs.  Before this Government finish their term of office we might achieve a very great improvement in the courts system and, therefore, a very great improvement in justice for our population. I encourage the Minister to do that. By making the improvements at the top we will be able to highlight the high costs which are mostly unjustifiable.  We might get back to the very forward looking reforms which the Fianna Fáil Government tried to bring in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was very sad to see that they did not achieve their objective of fusing the professions and thereby cutting by half at least the <Col N="304" /> high cost of getting justice in Ireland.

If you have to pay fees in the order of £20,000 for 20 minute consultations with two bewigged professionals you have to ask questions about it.  Justice is not available to the majority of the people. The fusion of the professions was taken seriously by two former Ministers and I have always admired them for that.  They knew that this continuing injustice was going on.  Sixteen years later nothing has been done about it.

      <P>I would like to say that this is the first Bill the new Minister for Justice has introduced.  I hope this will be only the first minor step along the road to major reform in the system.  It is a very <Col N="306" /> localised, confined Bill but at the same time it is only right that I should put on record my concern that we are dealing only in a minor way with some of the problems in the court system.  The major defects in the court system at present are bringing the country to a standstill whether we like it or not.  We only have to look at the high cost of insurance which is totally related to the archaic system, over-representation and the mismanagement and presentation of cases in the court.  This Bill plus the Bill that is on the Order of Business at present in relation to juries are only minor steps towards the major reform that is required.  I am taking this opportunity in the House today to ask the Minister to bring about real reform in this area.  The Minister, by the nature of his job, is most of the time reacting to crises be they in the prisons or in other security areas but I appeal to him to put much of the time he has into serious reform of the legal system.</P>
      <P>I am not going to detain this House by spelling out the major defects but the people are of the opinion at present that our political parties are in the pockets of the legal profession &mdash; I am not alluding to any party be it on this side or the other side &mdash; and can be intimidated and bought by them.  The public believe there will be no reform because we are totally compromised. I would ask the Minister to nail that lie and prove it is wrong by bringing legislation into this House in the next few months which will deal with major court reform and the abuses that are being carried out against the people by solicitors. If the Minister does that in the year-and-a-half which he has, he will have done a very good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to indicate if he has any proposals at present to bring to this House in those areas within the next few months, as people like myself who have been highlighting these issues in recent times have been assured that legislation will be brought in.  It is as far away as ever and until such time as we are given guarantees that legislation will be presented to this House we cannot reassure people who have been hurt and been victims of grave injustice.  I can <Col N="307" /> recount many cases of very severe hardship because of what is happening in our courts and within the legal profession at present.  I would ask the Minister to give definite guarantees and indications to this House that real reform will be brought about in this area.</P>

      <P>I am not at all surprised at the importance attached to the city of Galway and to the equipment thereof, because the administration of justice should get the kind of attention that this Bill has got in the House today.  It is never possible to say that a Bill gets more attention than it deserves but this rather modest Bill has got in full the attention that it deserves. It is only proper because it is one that, after all, concerns the capital of the western part of our country.  I regret that Deputy Woods seems to feel a little as if I had been saying something out of place about him in remarks I made earlier on about keeping one's eye on the monitor. It has always been my practice since.  I came into the House, which is not all that long ago, to make sure that even if I were involved in something else that I would have a line to what was happening in the Chamber so that if a matter of interest for me came up I could be there.  I am not at all criticising Deputy Woods when I say that.</P>

Although Deputy Woods is a man I know for a long time in various different capacities and he is a grand fellow, there is a limit to the degree that one would hold his hand.  I can assure Deputy Woods that as far as I am concerned courtesy, analysis and questioning in the House will be met on my side by a corresponding courtesy, <Col N="308" /> openness and a willingness to reply.  I cannot guarantee that sanctimoniousness will not be met on my part with a degree of sarcasm.  That is the chance we take in the Chamber.</P>

      <P>There is no reason for experienced and thick skinned people to descend to the level of that kind of squabbling. Why so suddenly?  That is the main question that has been brought up on the other side of the House.  I accept that is a perfectly valid and reasonable question to ask.  The answer to it, quite frankly, is that it was not until quite recently, on legal advice, my Department and I became aware that the order setting up the County Borough of Galway had implications for the jurisdiction of the High Court.  Immediately we became aware of that we looked at what was required to be done in order to meet that situation.  The High Court, as has been pointed out, is due to sit in Galway on 3 March and without this measure no provision would be made for dealing with appeals that arise in the county borough area.  Had it not been possible to proceed quickly with this measure there would have been very little alternative but to postpone the High Court sitting with consequent delays to the people who are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment was not in any way neglectful in making his order.  I make the point and believe this quite sincerely that it would not have been appropriate for the Minister for the Environment under a local government reorganisation Act to make provisions for the administration of justice such as <Col N="309" /> the one contained in this Bill in relation to the courts.  It is far more appropriate that we should make provisions in relation to the courts under the Act which already provides for the business of the courts.  That is the reason why this Bill is being presented in the framework of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, rather than in any other framework.  Deputy Woods is worried about what he regards as a retrospective aspect of the legislation.  I would like to assure him that this is not retrospection in the sense in which we normally comprehend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>At a brief, informal meeting in London on 19 February, the Prime Minister and I reviewed the working of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to which we are both committed.  The Prime Minister expressed satisfaction at the decision of the Government to sign the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. I expressed the concern felt in Ireland about the Sellafield plant and the Prime Minister said that she would let me have a full report on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that his sudden announcement in London of the decision to sign the European Convention on Terrorism has caused a considerable amount of concern?  In deciding to sign did the Taoiseach and the Government give any consideration to entering reservations as did many other European countries, particularly in regard to extraditing our own nationals?  Could the Taoiseach indicate whether we signed with reservations or unreservedly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we will have an opportunity to consider that whole question further at another time.  In discussing Sellafield with the British Prime Minister, did the Taoiseach press for any specific action and did he indicate to the Prime Minister that the only thing that would really satisfy public opinion here is the closure of this serious menace? If the Taoiseach did not ask for the closure of Sellafield, what did he press the Prime Minister to do in regard to Sellafield?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I endeavoured to answer that question in the Dáil in reply to a Private Notice Question raised by Deputy Allen.  I have already given an answer in the Dáil on that.  I explained to the Prime Minister that the nature or our concern and the grounds for it which I set out in this House in reply to a question. Those grounds include the frequency with which in the recent past incidents have occurred, a much greater frequency than over the previous 30 years, and also the revelation that information in relation to the event that occurred 30 years ago proved incorrect by a factor of 40.  These are matters which I mentioned in this House as our concerns and I conveyed these concerns to the Prime Minister, indicating that we would wish to see a monitoring process carried out under international auspices so that we can be <Col N="311" /> assured as to whether the Sellafield plant can continue in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Expressing concern is of some value but what I am trying to ascertain is if in the course of discussions the Taoiseach pressed for some specific action, something that would reassure public opinion here and in Britain.  Am I correct in assuming from the Taoiseach's reply that he did not propose to the Prime Minister that this operation be closed down?  In his representations did the Taoiseach make any differentiation as to the two separate aspects of the Sellafield operation, the fact that one portion of this plant is concerned with military nuclear matters and another with civilian nuclear power?  Did the Taoiseach advert to the nuclear military side of this operation in these discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is with the possible dangers to this country arising from this station, its siting and its operation. These are the matters I raised. Before I met her the Prime Minister had announced an inquiry into recent events there.  I indicated that we were concerned that the whole matter should be reviewed at international level.  Our own monitoring of air and sea has indicated that the plant, even allowing for the recent incidents which have taken place, has not up to this point caused any worrying pollution problems of either air or sea in terms of radioactivity.  But the point I was making in the Dáil, and which I sought to convey to the Prime Minister, is that while that is the case, and there is no concern that need arise from what has happened, the frequency of the incidents and the revelation that previous information was incorrect raised doubts with regard to the furture of that plant and that with a view to establishing whether those doubts were justified and whether we can justify what action has been taken, we felt the matter should be reviewed internationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I would like to come in again on the Anglo Irish Agreement. The Taoiseach is not according this matter the urgency public opinion here would wish him to give it.  Did the Taoiseach, in talking to the British Prime Minister, advert to two aspects of the matter, one the constant leakages and emissions which are a cause of danger and concern and which are, more seriously, an indication of the faulty nature of this plant; and, secondly, the fact that these frequent occurrences there are a cause for worry as to whether or not there might not some day be a major explosion or failure at this plant?  Is the Taoiseach not aware of the widespread anxiety here, among experts as well as among ordinary members of the public, about the very existence of this plant apart from reassurances about its operation?</P>

      <P>It is precisely those concerns that I have referred to in my reply to this House to a question on the Adjournment.  Even though what has happened so far has not had any adverse effect here, the frequency of these incidents raised doubts about the operation of that plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In his discussion with the British Prime Minister did the Taoiseach form any view?  If so, will he convey to the House the resoluteness of the British Prime Minister at this stage in regard to the agreement?  In particular did he draw her attention to the statement she made on 17 December last to the effect that the people of Northern Ireland can get rid of the Inter-Governmental Conference by agreeing to devolved government? Also she said: &ldquo;if they do not want the conference the remedy is in their own hands&rdquo;.  Did the Taoiseach form any view in his discussions with the British Prime Minister on whether there is a weakening of will on her part or on the part of the <Col N="314" /> British Government about the implementation of the agreement at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement issued after the meeting referred to the fact that we are both committed to the agreement. Those words speak for themselves and they have been validated by the stance taken by the Prime Minister in discussions with the Unionist leaders yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach's attention been drawn to the fact that that statement of yesterday has words in it which could be interpreted in different ways and certainly at best are ambiguous? In particular I refer to the use of the word &ldquo;while&rdquo; in this statement.  Will the Taoiseach not agree that the introduction of this word &ldquo;while&rdquo; would qualify any reaffirmation of intention with regard to the agreement?  The words used were: &ldquo;While reaffirming the Government's commitment in regard to the implementation of the Anglo-Irish agreement it was understood that if after discussions with all concerned the ideas raised in our talks today bore fruit, we should consider what that meant for the work of the Inter-Governmental Conference&rdquo;.  Will the Taoiseach indicate his interpretation of those words and whether I am right in my interpretation of the introduction of the word &ldquo;while&rdquo; into the terms of that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The prefacing of those remarks by the word &ldquo;while&rdquo; committed to the agreement I would interpret as reassuring rather than otherwise.  With regard to the second half of the sentence the Deputy will note that the wording used corresponds closely with that of the agreement in relation to the work of the conference which, of course, will not operate in areas in respect of which governmental functions were devolved to an executive in Northern Ireland established on a basis of participation between the two communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the words, &ldquo;we should need to consider what that meant for the work of the Inter-Governmental Conference&rdquo;<Col N="315" /> introduces any element of doubt into the situation?  When he is replying perhaps he will indicate if a meeting of the conference which was to be held in February has been postponed or cancelled and whether we are to read any significance into that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those words I regard as adhering very closely to the wording of the agreement and I think the Prime Minister was pursuing exactly the same approach as we have pursued here in pointing out that to the extent that functions can be devolved on a participatory basis to that extent the conference would no longer have a function in the area in question, because in that area the different parties in Northern Ireland, particularly the constitutional parties representing the Nationalist minority, would have their role to play directly. The wording there is very exact and precise and I am perfectly satisfied with it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the meaning of the beneficial occupier situation; the way in which she can justify a figure of £2 daily as a base line means for the non-payment of unemployment benefits in particular situations, such as beneficial occupier and for landholder; and if she will make a statement on the serious situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a basic condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit that the claimant must be unemployed.  In general, a person is not regarded as unemployed on any day on which he is employed.  However, section 29 (5) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, empowers the Minister to make regulations as to the days which may or may not be treated as days of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Regulations have been made in accordance with this provision which allow a claimant, who is engaged in a subsidiary occupation, to be treated as unemployed providing he satisfies a special condition that the remuneration or profit from this occupation does not exceed £2 per day or that he has at least 78 reckonable employment contributions paid in the three years preceding the date of claim.  The purpose of the special condition is to measure the significance and extent of the subsidiary occupation in order to ensure that the claimant can be regarded as genuinely on the labour market.  A person who runs a farm would be regarded as following a subsidiary occupation whether or not he owns the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of unemployment benefit claims involving applicants who follow a subsidiary occupation are from landholders. A claimant who runs a holding but does not himself own it is generally <Col N="317" /> referred to as being in beneficial occupation and the question of his availability for work then arises.  It was to deal with such cases that the regulations were made.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances for which they were intended the regulations are considered to be reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House how long this base line of £2 per day has been in operation?  Will she accept that in modern times nobody, no single individual, could expect even to have breakfast for £2 per day?

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The present base line of £2 has been in operation since 1980, I understand.  While the limit is kept under continuous review, it is not proposed to revise the figure further for the present. It is important to point out that it is one of two alternatives provided by the regulations and the claimant has two opportunities of qualifying.  As I said in my earlier answer, the second condition is that the claimant has had not fewer than 78 pay contributions in the preceding three years.  The two conditions taken together are not considered unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that in the present economic climate there is very high unemployment? Many people are laid off and made redundant and many of these are married with families.  They live in their parents' homes, on farms owned by their parents, and have to help to run the farm out of duty to and respect for their parents, even though they get no benefit from their work.  Would the Minister accept that her Department officials are presuming that these applicants who may not have 78 stamps are getting income from the farms while in fact they are not?  Would she give any undertaking that she would review the situation and request her staff to ease up on their attitude in such cases?</P>

The answers which have been given to me show that, while trying to ensure that the limited resources of the State are directed as much as possible towards the most needy people, the officers in my Department are taking the correct elements into consideration in arriving at their decisions.</P>

      <P>I recognise the Minister's short duration in the Department and I wish her well in her new role.  However, it is vital that she should take a very realistic view of this situation.  Many are falling victims through no fault of their own.  Could the Minister give us any indication that she will investigate the matter and let us know the exact position? Has she any proposals to ease the pressure on applicants who are victims of this unfair system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the steps, if any, which will be taken by her Department to discourage people particularly those in the older age group, from hoarding cash in their homes; and the special consideration, if any, which will be given to these people who have some moneys in assessing them for eligibility for non-contributory old age pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In determining the amount of non-contributory pension to which a person is entitled, the value of savings must be taken into account under the legislation governing these pension schemes.  It is, however, possible to have a large amount of savings and still qualify for pension.  A single person can have savings of up to £2,987.50 and a married couple double that amount and still qualify for full old age pension.  Reduced rate pensions may be paid to persons with savings of up to £22,747.50 for a single person and double that amount for a married couple.</P>
      <P>Extensive publicity aimed at dissuading people from keeping money at home has already been given to the fact that non-contributory pensioners can have these substantial sums and still qualify for pensions.  This included the distribution of a leaflet through the post offices to every pensioner twice last year.  I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that people who keep money at home are exposing themselves to risks and in their own interest would be well advised not to keep their savings at home.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst accepting that considerable moneys can be held by people before they are deemed ineligible for non-contributory old age pension and notwithstanding that the Minister's predecessor on many occasions in the past encouraged old people, in particular, to invest their money in the banking institutes, would she not agree that in the most recent budget there has been inserted a particular disincentive to old people to invest their moneys in banks because of the 35 per cent retention tax on the interest? As a consequence, more and more old people will now begin to hoard their money at home rather than invest it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates directly to the problems of people claiming.  They have been encouraged by the Minister's predecessor and the Minister has reiterated <Col N="320" /> today that people should be encouraged to place their moneys in institutions and not keep them at home, under the bed or in the roof.  There is a disincentive and have the Minister and her colleagues in Government any intention of rectifying the position?</P>

In the original answer to the Deputy I mentioned the campaign launched last year and very widely circulated to pensioners and very many organisations throughout the country.  A special leaflet was also sent out specifically referring to saving schemes in the Post Office.  The Deputy is well aware that there are many such schemes which are very suitable for old people's savings.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate that the retention tax is the responsibility of another Minister, I would like to ask this Minister if she is aware that the retention tax will reduce the means of pensioners? What plans has she to ensure that pensioners' means will be reviewed automatically in the case of those who declare money in financial institutions?  What plans has she to have their pensions reviewed to ensure that they will be increased, as they must be, when the tax is deducted from their income?</P>

Deputy McCarthy wanted to know what special consideration would be given to these people who have moneys invested, in assessing them for eligibility.  I am asking what plans the Minister has to re-assess these people for eligibility, in view of the fact that their means will be reduced automatically as a result of the retention tax.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The present system of PRSI contributions which are collected by the Revenue Commissioners through the PAYE income tax system has been in operation since April 1979 and is much more equitable than the previous system of mainly flat rate contributions which was regressive for employees with low earnings including temporary employees. Contributions are paid by both employers and employees which entitle the insured population to a wide range of benefits and services.  The system has proved satisfactory over the years and there are no plans for any major changes.</P>
      <P>However, the Commission on Social Welfare were specifically requested to review and report on the system of pay-related social insurance and health contributions and their effects on the provision of social security and employment and the matter will be reviewed on receipt of the commissioner's report.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 1986 which will be circulated shortly will provide for the PRSI exemption scheme for employers announced by the Taoiseach in his statement to Dáil Éireann on tax reform and employment on 23 October 1985 and for the changes in PRSI contributions announced in the recent budget.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister decided to take the two questions together.  Although there is a relationship between the two, the motives behind them are different.  We have moved into a period when there is much short term and part time employment and we must ask whether, because of the volume of bureaucracy involved, there is not a very strong case to be made for a simplified system of collecting social insurance on behalf of such employees.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the existing system and the rates of PRSI contributions.  They are designed to enable the Exchequer to meet annual outgoings on the administration of the scheme.  The Exchequer subvention is £373.1 million.  Therefore, any changes in the system have to be considered carefully so that there will be no change that will affect ability to meet all outgoings.  I refer the Deputy to the part of my reply in which I said that the Commission on Social Welfare have been requested specifically to review and report on the system of pay-related social insurance and health contributions.  It may be that the commission will recommend change in this area.</P>

      <P>I am happy to know that the NESC are examining this.  Has particular emphasis been laid in a report to the NESC on the potential value to employment, particularly in labour intensive industries, if employers' contributions were to be reduced?  Even if this is not to be on a broad scale, would the Minister consider reducing the employer's contributions for a short term, for a <Col N="325" /> year or so, in labour intensive industries in particular?</P>

      <P>The proposal currently with the NESC is to examine the transfer of social insurance costs from labour intensive to capital intensive industries, the intent being to reduce employment costs in labour intensive sectors where there is the greatest potential for additional employment.  There are differing views on this among economists and statisticians as to how changes in PRSI might affect employment.  That is one of the reasons why we have to take as many expert views as possible in order to reach a conclusion on it.  The Deputy was right when he said that was the thrust of the submission to the NESC.  We now await the views of all the social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to satisfy everybody with this answer which is as full and as frank as I could make it.</P>
      <P>The special investigation unit of my Department carry out investigations into cases of suspected fraudulent claiming of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  These cases are brought to notice by members of the public, by other officers of the Department and through the regular investigations carried out by the unit.  In addition, special exercises are carried out from time to time where particular areas or categories of claimants are investigated in depth.  The officers involved prepare submissions to their superior officers on the results of these exercises as part of normal administrative procedures.</P>
      <P>A special exercise of the kind referred to was carried out between July 1983 and early 1984.  This is in fact the exercise which was the subject of recent articles in a Sunday newspaper.  Following this exercise, a submission was made by one of the social welfare officers to his supervisor on the results, in the course of which he speculated that if certain results were projected on a national basis, a sum of £25 million could be involved.  However, my Department have not endorsed this figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> The officer's submission stated that savings of nearly £400,000 had been achieved by the Dundalk exercise.  The figure of £25 million was apparently arrived at by the officer projecting on a nationwide basis what he assumed to be happening all along the Border, based on his experience in the Dundalk area.  However, the border poses special problems for fraud control and it would not be valid to apply the situation there to the whole country.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, much of the fraud detected in this particular operation arose because of the unusual situation which existed at the time arising from the fact that a large number of Northern Ireland residents had been previously working on the Alcan project at Aughinish and subsequently claimed unemployment benefit at the Dundalk employment exchange on foot of that employment.  In order to establish entitlement to benefit many of these claimants falsely declared that they were residing in the Dundalk area when in fact they were actually resident in the North.  When these false declarations of residence were detected, their claims were disallowed.</P>
    <P>This particular problem, which was peculiar to the situation at the time of the special exercise, led to a much higher number of claims being detected than would have been the case if it had been carried out at another time.  Indeed, it was because of reports of such false declarations that the special exercise took place.  That is the general position in regard to the Dundalk exercise.</P>
    <P>I will now deal briefly with the other points raised in the questions.  Firstly, in cases where a northern resident is found to be illegally claiming unemployment benefits he is prosecuted if apprehended. There is no extradition arrangement with the United Kingdom Government on such offences.</P>
    <P>Secondly, on the question of refunding payments received fraudulently, the practice is that in all cases of fraud the amounts overpaid are demanded from the claimants.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, on the question of whether the Government are aware of the extent of cross-Border fraud, I would refer the <Col N="329" /> Deputy to my earlier remark that the exercise in question took place in 1983. The submission on the results of that exercise was only one of many submissions made from time to time by officers of the special investigation unit on the results of their operations as part of standard administrative procedures and would not in the normal way be submitted to the Government.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to assure the House and the Deputies that both the Department and myself are at all times equally concerned at attempts to defraud the social welfare system and every effort is being made and will continue to be made to control abuses having regard to available resources.  In this latter connection I can say that the Department have obtained sanction for the recruitment of six additional officers for anti-fraud work and this will be a considerable strengthening of the investigation unit.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I feel that I should point out that thousands of claims are received each week in my Department.  I have no doubt that the majority of these are genuine, and that only a relatively small number of claimants attempt to defraud the system.  In addressing the question of combating fraud, a balance has to be struck between, on the one hand, trying to prevent fraud and, on the other, making sure that the procedures are not such that they cause undue delay in making payment to genuine cases.  The Department must ensure that proper regard is had to the needs and dignity of claimants generally and not make everyone suffer for the sins of the few.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her honesty in agreeing with the veracity of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> report, a copy of which I have here.  Is she happy with a situation in which £25 million escaped to Northern Ireland because northern nationals have taken this money out of the pockets of Irish PAYE workers? Is she happy that the Government have refused to implement many of the recommendations in this report?  Does she not agree that this practice must be stamped out immediately?  Does she not agree that <Col N="330" /> all claimants with Northern Ireland backgrounds should be asked for birth certificates, marriage certificates and children's birth certificates?  What efforts are being made to recoup this £25 million?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to answer all those supplementaries.  I thought I had explained that the figure of £25 million was a projection by that officer of what he assumed might be happening all along the Border and nationwide. If the particular case which was being investigated had a mirror image all along the Border and across the country, he would arrive at a figure of £25 million. I also mentioned that the Department, who receive many reports from special investigation units all over the country, take in the reports and decide whether to take on board that particular suggestion, or that they will accept that as being a factual case.  In this case that projection of a specific investigation in relation to the whole country, arriving at a figure of £25 million, was not endorsed by the Department as being an actual fact.  I am not disputing the veracity of the newspaper report but I think that newspaper report, which has concerned Deputy McGahon very much, in a certain style of presentation led the reader to believe that there was at this moment a £25 million fraud going on in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>I have tried in my very full answer to deal with the actual realities of the situation.  I do not really know how much fuller an explanation I can give than that. With regard to the final question the Deputy asked about the various measures that might be taken to deal with particular frauds, any reasonable measures that are put forward by the people working in these areas are very carefully considered by the Department because we are as concerned as the Deputy that this kind of fraud will not be allowed to proceed and will be dealt with quickly while, at the same time, ensuring that the needs of genuine claimants are met.</P>

Naturally, all means are taken because it is of great concern to all of us that the State should not be at the loss of any money from any fraudulent exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's original reply and her subsequent answer to Deputy McGahon's supplementary question, she has conceded that the special report of that investigation unit in the Dundalk area was in her Department and that in that report they stated that £400,000 would be saved in the year in a very tiny specific area which just relates to a length of Border of approximately ten miles and, as a result of that figure, their projection of the overall national figure was £25 million. Have the Minister's Department totally discounted the fact that £25 million nationally might be correct in view of the fact that the £400,000 relates to such a very small area of the Border and that it is most likely that what has been happening in the immediate Dundalk area is happening right across the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat what I said in my original reply.  I said that much of the fraud detected in this particular operation arose because of the unusual situation which existed at the time arising from the fact that a large number of Northern Ireland residents had been previously working on the Alcan project at Aughinish and they subsequently claimed unemployment benefit at the Dundalk Employment Exchange on foot of that <Col N="332" /> employment.  That was a particular circumstance at that time in that area and, therefore, I find it perfectly reasonable that the Department would not automatically extend those circumstances to the whole Border and to the whole country simultaneously and arrive at a figure of £25 million.  I can understand how the officer used a multiple of £400,000 and in an internal report to the Department stated a figure of £25 million.  I must accept from my Department that they cannot see the logic of that figure of £25 million considering the circumstances of the investigation at the time.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has conceded that her Department have this report and that she intends to employ the six special members of the task force. Is she aware that in that report various other recommendations were made?  The difficulty which appertained for the investigating units in the Dundalk and Border areas because of the huge number of members of subversive organisations there was stressed and the report actually stated that they were obliged to tread warily because of this.  Is she aware that in relation not alone to the cross Border situation but also to dual signing impersonation the report stated that major criminal elements within the State were involved, their origins were in Dublin and they were spreading out from there?  Has the Minister any information to confirm that in the report those criminal elements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In terms of the reports which my Department received from their officers in relation to particular areas I have to tell the Deputy that the submission made by that Dundalk officer was only one of many submissions which are made by investigating staff from time to time.  The Department naturally look at all of the suggestions, all the recommendations and all the information sent in by staff to combat the abuses of the system and where those are considered valuable they are implemented.  Some, but not all, of the recommendations made by the Dundalk officer in this instance were regarded as being of value. They have been taken into account by the Department, as they undertake their <Col N="334" /> ongoing review of the procedures necessary for fraud investigation.  I am sure Deputies, particularly Deputy McGahon will understand that when we talk about control measures and knowledge that is or is not available to the Department, it is important to be extremely circumspect because, if we are to be effective in dealing with these cases, it would hardly be useful to give an enormous amount of detail in this House.  Therefore, all information such as that to which the Deputy has referred, should be sent to my Department.  The Department should have it and they will then act on it, as they have done very successfully in the past.  Even in the last year there have been a great many notable successes in the special investigation unit in combating abuse.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the various replies given by the Minister and her acknowledgment that the report from this unit in the Dundalk area exists and was in her Department, I want to pose a number of brief questions.  First, that <Col N="335" /> report clearly stated that investigating officers in the Border area around Dundalk were finding it very difficult to investigate the problems because of the huge number of members of subversive organisations in the area.  They said they were obliged to tread warily.  Have the Department any plans at present to provide extra facilities for their investigating units in that area in order to deal with those members of subversive organisations who are illegally claiming social welfare payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that we are and would be very concerned about any reports we receive of any element which render it difficult or dangerous for our staff to carry out their work.  In this instance I would have to refer to my previous remark, that in talking about measures which we are determined to take I would have to be circumspect about their nature.  But I can assure the Deputy that we are concerned and are taking measures in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the same report might I ask the Minister &mdash; in relation to the criminal elements mentioned, who are alleged to be involved in dual signing and impersonation; the allegation that these criminal elements have their origins in Dublin and spreading out from there, and also the implication contained in the report that signing cards and P60 forms were being bought and sold and used in that type of abuse... have her Department taken any action with regard to curtailing the activities of these criminal elements in their fraudulent behaviour and in the buying and selling of signing cards and P60 forms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that any of the points raised with regard to the actual details of the way in which the fraud is being carried out have been brought to the attention of the Department and are being acted on in every possible case to ensure that there will be no recurrence of the fraud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a national basis is the Minister aware that fraudulent social welfare claims were being made by the itinerant community?  The Minister will be well aware that in 1980 the Department decided that all unsettled itinerants would have to sign on a certain day between 11 o'clock and 12 noon, usually a Thursday.  Is the Minister aware that while that decision did curtail the number of itinerants who were apparently claiming and receiving benefits at different employment exchanges, that regulation is no longer being rigidly enforced?  Furthermore, is the Minister and her Department aware that the specified times for signing, between 11 o'clock and 12 noon, meant that many itinerants chose employment exchanges in close proximity when they were able to circumvent the regulations by dashing at break-neck speed from one to another between 11 and 12 noon?  Has the Minister's Department any evidence to support that allegation?</P>

      <P>With regard to unsettled itinerants, is the Minister's Department aware of or have they taken any steps to investigate the extent of such abuse or to remedy the possibility of many of them claiming unemployment assistance?  It appears they are not too concerned about the amount of money they receive from such unemployment assistance except that they are interested in getting a qualification certificate which would further entitle them to visit community welfare officers in any part of the <Col N="337" /> country and receive supplementary welfare payments in addition to their unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the report and the various other investigations that have taken place &mdash; which the Minister has conceded exist &mdash; have her Department any plans for the compilation of a central register of itinerants and vagrants, or people of no fixed abode?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another suggestion on which I will seek the view of my Department.  In answer to some of the other points the Deputy has made and his constant use of the word &ldquo;conceded&rdquo; in regard to things I am supposed to have said &mdash; I want to make it quite clear that I thought I had answered very fully in my original reply the whole question of the newspaper report.  I want to make it quite clear what is the position regarding that report.  There are, in fact, two newspaper reports.  On Sunday, 16 February a reporter from RTE News requested a comment from the Government Information Services on the report referred to in the newspapers about the disclosure of cross-Border fraud regarding social welfare claims.  On that Sunday morning a check was made quickly with my Department officials but not with me.  I was in the Department only a couple of hours at that stage.  RTE were informed that the £25 million dole fraud story was &ldquo;wide speculation&rdquo;.  In the time available the Department had been unable to trace a reference to the figure of £25 million being mentioned in any formal report. As I have said, the problem was that the style and presentation of the newspaper report led the reader to believe that we have at present an enormous cross-Border fiddle amounting to £25 million. It was pointed out to the RTE reporter that over two years ago an exercise on unsuspected abuses in the Dundalk area was carried out.  It subsequently turned out that that is what the story was about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the days following the statement by the Government Information Services concerning the newspaper article several officers of the Department, whom it had not been possible to contact before the statement issued on Sunday, were contacted and a submission by one of the social welfare officers involved in the Dundalk exercise two years ago was traced.  In the course of the submission to his supervisor the officer concerned speculated that, if certain results were projected across the whole Border and on a national basis, then a sum of £25 million could be involved.  This figure was <Col N="339" /> not endorsed by his supervisor in headquarters or by the Department, which regards it as highly speculative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister replied to a supplementary question which I had not arrived at.  That is the reply by the Government Information Services on last Sunday week when Mr. Joseph Jennings, head of the Government Information Services, emphatically denied that such a report existed.  I suggest that a major cover-up was taking place in her Department.  She has a type of Watergate within her Department.  I would like to know who is trying to protect whom? There was a basic denial of the existence of the report.  Yet today she conceded that the report exists.  The head of the Government Information Services told a blatant lie to RTE.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister let me know why the Government Information Services denied the existence of the report of RTE?  Could she also let me know why, in a written reply which I obtained yesterday, she informed me that it was estimated that there were 4,000 cases of fraud involving social welfare payments, with overpayments in the region of £3 million, in 1985.  Yet she said there were only 187 prosecutions for social welfare fraudulent offences in 1984.  Can I interpret from those figures that there was an increase from 187 cases of fraudulent social welfare claims in 1984 to 4,000 in 1985?  Is that a fair assumption?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods seems to have some trouble with the seat in front of him.  It is not just the Minister he is kicking; it seems to be the furniture as well.  Before the sos, I was dealing with the concerns expressed by him about what he regarded as the retrospective nature of one of the provisions in this Bill which is designed to ensure that appeals lodged before the passing of the measure would be heard by the High Court on circuit sitting in Galway next week.  I was saying that the provision does not seem retrospective in the accepted definition of the word.  What we are doing is simply recognising the very reason why the Bill is in the House and making sure that appeals that were lodged before the passing of the measure, and in some cases before the declaration of the status of Galway as a county borough, could properly be heard by an appeal court in the designated town after the passage of this measure.  It is not retrospective legislation in that it does not look back.  I would contend that it is forward-looking in its nature because it provides for the closing of a loophole that might otherwise exist.  If we did not have this provision in the Bill it could be the case that a number of appeals would fall into a kind of limbo in which they could not properly be heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all convinced by Deputy Woods's contention that the situation that has pertained since 1 January last has left citizens on any side scale in a state of uncertainty.  As I mentioned, the <Col N="390" /> situation which the Bill is intended to cope with was brought to my notice by legal advice, by people who saw the emergence of the problem some time after the conditions for the problem's existence had come about.  I do not think there is any great degree of uncertainty about it.  The passage of this measure will remove any uncertainty that might exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods, and indeed other Members of the House, take issue with the Bill not in terms of its substance but in terms of what it is doing because they believe that this is an example of piecemeal legislation.  I would have to say that that kind of comment elevates the Bill to a status which it does not deserve.  It is not piecemeal legislation in that it does not address any of the more fundamental issues of the administration of justice which have been mentioned by various Deputies on both sides of the House. It deals only with one very particular situation that has arisen and provides that the administration of justice, as we now know it, can continue uninterruptedly as far as people who have litigation in the city of Galway are concerned.</P>
    <P>The other concerns which Deputies have mentioned are in most cases valid, even though the language used by one or two Members has been a shade picturesque. The concerns underlying their remarks are valid and would need to be addressed.  I can assure the House that Members of this House will find in me a ready listener to those concerns.  I would be anxious in so far as possible to make progress along the general lines they have set out.  I am not a great ornithologist and I am not sure if I would know the difference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods asked the question if I had any intention of adding or removing other counties or other county boroughs or in any other way adjusting the circuits in question here.  At present I can say that I have no such intention, but the provision is included in the Bill so that in the event that this situation arises again we will not have to pass another Bill.  The legislation will therefore give the Minister for Justice, long may he reign, the means of dealing with it without having to put the House, and Deputy Woods in particular, to the inconvenience to which they have been put.</P>

      <P>It provides that particular provision for the making of orders.  That is already covered under the 1936 Act. The orders, as Deputy Woods pointed out, are made after consultation with the Judiciary in the manner prescribed.</P>
      <P>A number of other questions were raised, particularly by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, about the condition of courthouses in general and the condition of the courthouse in Galway in particular. The situation is that the maintenance of court buildings throughout the country generally is a matter for the local authorities. As Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has recalled to me the fact that Galway County Council &mdash; I am not sure of the situation in Galway Borough Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Deputy Geoghegan Quinn Deputy Geoghegan Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;are shortly coming to the point where they will fix an estimate for the year.  I am quite sure that, given <Col N="392" /> the concerns voiced by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn here, Galway County Council will take all of the measures available to them to ensure that they have the revenue from all the various sources that are open to them to make their contribution to the maintenance of courthouses and to the other concerns which fall within their remit.</P>
      <P>There is a difference in relation to Dublin in that the Office of Public Works are responsible for courts in Dublin with two minor exceptions.  Elsewhere, as I have said, the local authorities are responsible under the Courthouses Provision and Maintenance Act, 1935.</P>
      <P>Many of the other issues which were raised in passing, although in some cases they were very slow in passing, seem to me to be outside the scope of this Bill.  We probably would find a more appropriate opportunity for discussing those in the House in the near future.</P>
      <P>The matter in relation to delays was raised.  I want to deal with it very briefly, as it appears to be germane to the issue we are discussing.  There does not seem to be a particular problem of delay with appeals.  What we are doing is taking a measure that will facilitate the hearing of appeals in the circumstances addressed by this Bill.  The more general question of delays is not affected by this measure, although I would have to make the point that the delays in general are not as serious as Deputies seem to believe.  I can assure the House that, in so far as it is within my power to take measures which will expedite the administration of justice, I will be happy to do that.</P>
      <P>I cannot answer Deputy GeogheganQuinn's specific question as to how many appeals are waiting to be heard in Galway which will be affected by this measure.  I would repeat the point that delays in the hearing of appeals do not constitute a substantial problem.  The more general problem of delays is outside the scope of the measure we are taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That covers most of the points that have been raised.  If there are points that I have not adverted to, it is because I do not believe that in the context of this debate it would be appropriate for me, <Col N="393" /> for example, to make any comments about wigs and gowns although I will admit that in relation both to our legal system and on the religious side personally I find that there is a certain value in ceremony.</P>

      <P>That concludes the remarks I wish to make on Second Stage.  I want to thank the House again for facilitating me in the processing of this measure.  Given the very restricted scope of the measure it has proved possible to give it a thorough ventilation and to examine all of the issues that arise and at least to wipe the dust off a number of the issues that do not arise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Minister's speech and the non-Galway Borough Council part of it referred to powers as regards the High Court.  In view of the fact that the Cavan town courthouse is in a dangerous condition, that the courts are no longer being held there and that the alternative Bailieboro courthouse also has been found wanting, is there any power in the Bill that the Minister may take to remove courts from County Cavan?  We would look on this with some apprehension.</P>

      <P>On the issue of courthouses in particular places, the maintenance of courthouses is a matter for the local authorities.  There is nothing in this Bill that would affect that.  Indirectly there is a provision in this Bill, section 1(b), which could confer on the Minister for Justice the power to alter the composition of a High Court circuit by adding to or removing from the circuit a county or counties.</P>

      <P>We have a lovely 19th century courthouse with a Doric facade, but what is behind the facade is in a very serious condition.  It has gone a little further than just the fact that the courts are not being held there.  There has been a law case about it.  Will the Minister address himself to this as the citizens are suffering severely because of the lack of courthouse accommodation?  It is a difficult problem and I know it is a very expensive reconstruction job, but it is a beautiful classic building and we are worried about the future.</P>

      <P>I join with other members in congratulating Galway on the status which it has achieved in becoming a county borough.  This has been recognised in the legislation in relation to the administration of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> The Minister said he did not receive advice about this until quite recently. Section 1 adds Galway County Borough to the list which is in the schedule of the 1936 Act.  Indeed, Deputy Wilson pointed to some of the other possible changes in this schedule which could occur as a result of later sections in this Bill.  I recognise that the Minister has not got any intention to do anything like that at the moment.  Could the Minister say when this lacuna was brought to the Miniter's attention and by whom?  The Minister said in general terms that it was not brought to his attention until quite recently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>My answer will not lead to the points which the Deputy expects because, as he knows, the normal procedure for the drafting of Bills includes draft documents from the sponsoring Department which have to go through the Parliamentary Draftsman's office.

      <P>Section 1 (1)(a) contains the intention to insert in the Second Schedule of the 1936 Act, the Galway County Borough.  Section 1 (1)(b) inserts in section 33 of the main Act the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(aa) alter the composition of a High Court Circuit by adding to or removing from the Circuit a county or counties, a county borough or county boroughs or a county or counties and a county borough or county boroughs, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This must be seen in the context of section 33 to see exactly what is happening here.  Section 33(2) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> At any time after the commencement of this Part of this Act, the Minister for Justice may by order, made after consultation with the President of the High Court, either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) alter the number of High Court Circuits and make such redistribution of the several counties and county boroughs (other than the county of Dublin and the county borough of Dublin) amongst the several High Court Circuits as he shall think proper having regard to such alteration of the number of such circuits,</P>
    <P>That gives power to alter the number of High Court circuits and to redistribute counties or county boroughs among those High Court circuits.  It appears from that that the Minister already has power to alter the number and make a redistribution. Paragraph (b) reads:</P>
    <P>Without altering the number of the High Court Circuits, make such variation as he thinks proper of the distribution of the several counties and county boroughs (other than the county of Dublin and the county borough of Dublin) amongst such circuits.</P>
    <P>He already has power to alter the number and, without altering the number, to make under section 33 (2) (b) such variations as he thinks proper in the distribution of several counties and county boroughs.  He has those two powers at present and he is seeking in this subsection to alter the composition of existing circuits by adding or removing a county or county borough.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us why he feels it is necessary to have this amendment here.  First, he said that at the moment he had no further additions or deletions in mind other than this, and we take that to be a fact, although going back a week or a month, obviously the Minister had no intention then of making even this change.  Within the next few weeks he could have another intention. Secondly, what about adding non-contiguous counties?  I presume that under the power that is there at the moment, and certainly with the added power which the <Col N="398" /> Minister has here, the Minister could add in non-contiguous counties.</P>
    <P>This is getting back to what Deputy Wilson was concerned about, that Cavan would lose its status and position, but where might it be added to if it was added somewhere else?  I presume that, under the Act as it is and as it will be when amended, we are dependent on the Minister and his consultations with the President of the High Court in relation to any changes he will propose to make and there is nothing in the Act to ensure that the contiguous nature of these areas will be borne in mind.  There appears to be no control other than the kind of control which arises from the common sense of the Minister and the President of the High Court in coming to these decisions.</P>
    <P>The other point that strikes me about this section is that Dublin is an exception under section 33 (2) (a) and (b) of the 1936 Act.  It is not an exception under section 1 (1) (b) (aa) of the Bill, the new one the Minister is putting in.  Does this in effect mean that the exceptional position of Dublin is wiped out by the change being made by the Minister?  Section 1 (1) (b) (aa) seems to be fairly comprehensive in that it allows the Minister to alter the composition of existing circuits by adding or removing a county or county borough.  He could do this in certain respects already as the 1936 Act stands but always in both of those cases, under section 33 (2) (a) and (b) of that Act he was restricted in relation to the county of Dublin.  Those paragraphs state: &ldquo;(other than the county of Dublin and the county borough of Dublin)&rdquo;.  Does the effect of section 1 (1) (b) (aa) remove that restriction?  Can the Minister tell us his views on that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the issues Deputy Woods has spoken of in order. Section 33 of the 1936 Act enables the Minister for Justice, after consultation with the President of the High Court &mdash; we should not forget the role of the President of the High Court in the matter &mdash; to make an order altering or varying High Court circuits other than Dublin, <Col N="399" /> by reference to counties and county boroughs which existed at the time of the passing of the 1936 Act.  Dublin is not included in any one of the four circuits either in the 1936 Act or by the measure that we are discussing today.  Therefore, without changing the 1936 Act it would not be possible to make a change that had any connection with or reference to the County Borough of Galway because that did not exist at the time of the passing of the 1936 Act.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed here in this section 1 (1) (b) (aa) of this Bill ensures that the power originally set out in the 1936 Act will extend to any new county or county borough that might be set up after the passing of this measure.  Of course, the measure we are taking today is designed to deal with the situation that arises from the setting up of a new County Borough in Galway.  The effect of this addition to section 33 (2) of the 1936 Act is to ensure that the power already provided for in the Act can apply to any new county or county borough that might be set up.  On the passage of this Bill an order will be made, again after consultation with the President of the High Court, to include the new County Borough of Galway in the western circuit of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question was raised first by Deputy Wilson on Second Stage and it is about Cavan.  I must emphasise that this is purely a hypothetical question.  I think Deputy Woods raised it now purely for the purposes of illustration.  The House can take it that, if it were proposed to put the county of Cavan into a different circuit from that in which it finds itself now, we would not, for example, think for a moment of including it in the southern circuit.  The Minister for Justice of the day and the President of the High Court of the day certainly would have regard to the practicality of any arrangement that they would propose.  Therefore, my contention is that the passage of this measure and the amendments we are speaking about here should be seen in the context of the dictates of normal, <Col N="400" /> common sense application of administrative arrangements.  There is no danger in the provisions of this Bill that we will see the bizarre results Deputy Woods seems to fear.</P>
    <P>A change or variation in a circuit is not a matter that is subject to no control. Under the provisions of the 1936 Act continued by this measure, any variation would be carried out by the Minister for Justice, after consultation with the President of the High Court, and the matter would have to be the subject of an order laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and confirmed by the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, it is not a matter that would be capable of variation at the irrational whim of a Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>As far as the present incumbent is concerned the House can take it that he is not subject to irrational whims of that kind.  There is a controlled procedure there.  The Minister must propose and must consult with the President of the High Court and the matter must be the subject of an order of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, an adequate system of control and inspection by the Legislature of what might be proposed is provided in any case.</P>
    <P>Dublin is an exception, as Deputy Woods has pointed out.  It was made an exception by the 1936 Act.  It is not included in any one of the four circuits and the provisions of this Bill will not in any was affect the exceptional position of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question of Dublin, I take it that the last point the Minister made clarifies the situation and that he has taken advice on that and is quite certain of it.  Subsection (2) (a)  will read as it has, that the number of High Court circuits can be redistributed and such redistribution can be made by the Minister, excluding the county of Dublin and paragraph (b) will still say that, without altering the number of High Court circuits he may make such variations as he thinks proper.  That again excludes Dublin.  In between, will come paragraph (aa) which makes no reference to this exclusion of Dublin but will allow <Col N="401" /> the Minister power to alter the composition of a High Court circuit by adding to or removing from the circuit a county or counties, a county borough or county boroughs, etc.  I take it that the Minister has been advised correctly and that this will not affect the position of Dublin.</P>
      <P>As far as Cavan is concerned, the Minister says we are talking about hypothetical situations.  In a debate on this or any other Bill one does not normally have any option but to look for the hypothetical situation which might occur if certain things happen.  The practical examples come out subsequently.  As far as Cavan was concerned, I raised that general question on Second Stage.  Deputy Wilson came in of his own accord, being concerned about Cavan because he knows the circumstances there very well. I accept that I was dealing with the matter hypothetically, but I had no other option. Much of the legislation, in justice, will have to be teased out in that way.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that Cavan would not be inserted, for example, in the southern circuit and I accept that, but according to the schedules which we are discussing here, Cavan is mentioned as the appeal town for Cavan county.  Could the Minister tell us what is happening in Cavan at the moment?  Where are the appeals for Cavan county being held at present?  I know that the main building is in a bad way, from what we have heard Deputy Wilson say.  It seems that some alternative place is being used as a stopgap measure.  I take it that under the schedule Cavan would still have to be the appeal town as stated in the Act.  The onus presumably would be on the local authority in that case to find a suitable alternative venue within Cavan town and that the appeal town aspect of this schedule would assure this.  Am I right in thinking that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy is correct in drawing that conclusion.  From the information here, the appeals in Cavan are being held in Cavan town at an alternative venue.  As long as the 1936 Act, as amended, keeps its present form, <Col N="402" /> appeals in Cavan will have to be heard in Cavan town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To alter that composition would require altering the schedule, I take it.  In effect, Deputy Wilson need not be worried about that, while he is naturally concerned about the condition of the courthouse, its improvement and refurbishment.  Cavan will remain the appeal town for Cavan County.  Paragraph (aa) gives the Minister power to add or subtract particular counties but the Minister cannot change the fact that Cavan is still the appeal town, I take it, while that is in the schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make the point clear.  The Minister is not taking powers here.  The Minister is extending the power that already is given to him by the 1936 Act, which must be exercised in consultation with the President of the High Court and subject to the procedure of making orders in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Any action that the Minister would take under subsection (2) (a) or now subsection (2) (aa) or subsection (2) (b) of the 1936 Act would have to eventuate in the laying of an order before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is no means by which, without reference to the President of the High Court or the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister could vary either the position of Cavan or any other appeal town as envisaged by Deputy Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister appreciates that it is the wording of the extension of the powers that is under discussion.  Taken on their own, they do not mention the Dublin exception and they give the Minister additional powers, of course in consultation, because that is what the whole of the section is about. The Minister has clarified the position well enough to leave people's minds at rest in that area.  I am relying on what he says in relation to the question of the exclusion of Dublin referring also to paragraphs (aa) and (b).  I take the Minister's word for that for the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect is that under section <Col N="403" /> 33 (3) of the 1936 Courts of Justice Act, &ldquo;Every order made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if either such House shall, within the next twenty-one days on which such House sits after such order is laid before it, pass a resolution annulling such an order, such order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that respect, as I pointed out on Second Stage, that section covers this new paragraph (aa) so that Members of the House who read this section should recognise that the regulations will still have to be placed on the table and can be annulled after 21 days if Members are dissatisfied with what is planned.  The control, as the Minister says, is there. Notice of such regulation would be circulated to each Member of the House, I take it.  There is some difficulty with those regulations and with orders made in that quite often they do not say what is happening, except in technical terms.  They say that the Minister has made an order under a certain subsection of a certain Act.  As the Minister knows, Deputies receive a great deal of post of all sorts all the time.  Unless one is fairly assiduous, such information will not advise one properly on what is happening.  If you have the time and the opportunity you will look for further explanations, but I suggest that when such regulations are being circulated, in all cases, not just a few, the Minister should consider issuing an accompanying note which would explain briefly the implications of the order being made by the Minister at the time.  The 21 days limit is tight enough even if the Oireachtas is sitting.  A note setting out the principal implications of the order would be helpful.  Otherwise there is a danger that Members of the Oireachtas would not realise what is happening because of the technical nature of such orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the force of the points being made.  I do not want to <Col N="404" /> be offensive, but the points are a little blunted because of the fact that the Deputy has the 1936 Act in front of him. Notice of the order is usually circulated and the order is accompanied by an explanation that the note does not form part of the order.  In some cases the extra information given in the note is ambiguous, just a paraphrase of what the parliamentary draftsman has put into the order.  I undertake to ensure that when I am laying such orders I will consider whether the accompanying explanation is of sufficient use to Members.</P>
      <P>The 21 days referred to in this and other legislation are 21 sitting days.  That would be a period of seven weeks in the lifetime of the Dáil, except when we have extended sittings, when it would be between five and seven weeks.  This gives Members sufficient opportunity to find out what is going on and, if they are moved to do so, they could put down a motion to allow the order to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, there is a sort of flagging system.  My concern is that Members would be made aware clearly in layman's terms of what is happening.  Of course, we can go back and read the Act and see what is being done.  For instance, Deputy Wilson is not involved in this matter but he has to discover what the effects of such an order would be on his constituency.  The same applies to other Members on both sides.  Therefore, the notes should make the position crystal clear to Members on a continuing basis. Systems elsewhere give more detailed information than is given here at the moment.  Subsection (2) (a) provides:</P>
      <P>Galway is hereby deemed to be the appeal town, within the meaning of Part IV of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, for the purposes of appeals from judgments or order of the Circuit Court given or made in actions or matters heard and determined before the passing of this Act in the County Borough of Galway or before the 1st day of January, 1986, in the area that, upon the date, constituted the said County Borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> The Minister did not say how many appeals or judgments are involved and what will be the effect on them.  Does he have this information available and can he tell us about possible delays in those judgments or orders?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I did not know how many.  I made the point that there will be no undue delays in hearing appeals.  The Hight Court sits in each appeal town twice in a year and that seems to ensure the necessary expedition of business.  The insertion which section 1 makes in the Second Schedule of the 1936 Act designates Galway as the appeal town for the County Borough of Galway.  That clarifies the position from 1 January 1986. Subsection (2) (a) designates Galway as the appeal town for decisions of the Circuit Court made in the County Borough of Galway before the passing of this Act and for decisions of the Circuit Court made before 1 January 1986 in that area. This is to ensure that none of the business arising before 1 January 1986 will fall into a limbo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) (b) states:</P>
      <P>A notice of appeal served before such passing in respect of a judgment or order referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not be invalid by reason only of the fact that an appeal town, within the meaning aforesaid, for the County Borough of Galway did not stand specified, or that paragraph (a) of this subsection was not in force, at the time of such service.</P>
      <P>Is this not inserted particularly to cover those cases in which appeals might be regarded as invalid by reason of the delay from 1 January to the date of the passing of this Act?  Is the Minister aware of cases in which people saw no way to appeal since January 1 and therefore did not appeal and had run out of time?  Notice of appeal must be within 14 days of the making of an order by Circuit Court. Such people do not appear to be covered in the Bill and the Minister presumably would not be aware of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says he does not know <Col N="406" /> how many appeals there are and therefore it is unlikely that he would know the nature of those appeals or if people refrained from appealing because there was no process available.  If these people now decide to appeal, will another Bill be needed?  What advice has the Minister been given on this point?  What will he do if people come forward now and say they did not appeal for the reasons I have given?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation Deputy Woods envisages could not arise because the High Court is sitting on circuit in Galway in March for the first time this year.  We have covered the eventualities by the measures in this Bill, assuming we pass it, which I hope will be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, a person has to give notice at the time of the making of the order by the Circuit Court, but that has nothing to do with when the High Court sits.  Let us look at the practicalities. An order is made by the Circuit Court on 1 January and there are 14 days within which to lodge an appeal.  It does not matter when the High Court sits because the 14 days would count from the date of the making of the order.  It is unlikely that someone decided not to appeal simply because the procedure was not there, but it could have happened.  If someone comes forward now and says he did not appeal within 14 days because this legislation was not in existence but that he now wants his appeal recognised, I do not believe this Bill covers such a claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation mentioned by Deputy Woods is hypothetical.  I am not informed of any case where following a judgment or an order of the court a person came to the conclusion that he could not appeal because we had not passed this measure.  I suppose that, even if such a hypothetical situation were to arise, I would not know about it.  If on foot of orders made by courts up to now people have acted in a way that would debar them from making an appeal, they would have to live with that.  I do not think it likely that such a situation would <Col N="407" /> have arisen or that people would have taken that course of action because this measure was not passed.  Apart from anything else, they did not know that this legislation was being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue the point further but a person would have a reasonable argument for saying he did not appeal because the appeal procedure was not there at the time.  The Minister knows how barristers can successfully argue such points.  If people claim that they would have made an appeal if they had known this legislation was being introduced, it is very hard to see why they should be prevented from appealing now. Admittedly, it could be argued that they should have looked for an extension of leave to appeal but the reasons these extensions are given do not normally include a lacuna in the law.  That is a matter the courts could decide.  I am pointing out that this is one aspect which is not covered in this Bill.  I appreciate that the Minister has made provision for each circumstance he could foresee, especially given the fact that he did not know the number or nature of the appeals when he was preparing this measure.  This is a point of law from which a good barrister could create an embarrassing situation for the Minister.  He could claim that this lacuna was ground for getting an extension.  We do not seem to be able to do very much about this now because there is not scope to deal with amendments.</P>

It would take a great deal of verbal agility, if not a good deal more than that, to make the case <i>post factum</i> that had things been otherwise an appeal might have been made and that, since legislation has been introduced, an appeal is being made now.

      <P>Time will tell but, at the end of the day, the Bill makes provision for appeals that came up at a time when there was no designated appeal town for Galway County Borough.  It also provides that appeals from now on will have, so to speak, a home to go to.  In my view, that covers the situation as completely as it needs to be.</P>

      <P>I want to confirm, finally, the question about the banks, insurance companies and the financial institutions. There seems to be a notion abroad that they are somehow being excluded from the terms of this Bill, but that is not the case.  I wish the Minister to put the record straight that they have to publish accounts but that there will be separate directives to deal with their particular circumstances at a later date.  They have to comply with a certain amount of publishing and provision of accounts.  Would the Minister clarify that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Separate directives are under discussion within the EC in relation to these institutions. It is quite clear, and I know the Deputy is well aware of it, that in relation to the insurance companies they are already under stringent surveillance and make returns annually to what we all know as the blue book.  The private and public financial institutions will have to publish accounts and file them with the Registrar of Companies.  All that they are being excluded from is the exact format as in this directive which is more normal to the commercial companies to which the directive is relevant and to which this Bill is relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying that the formats of this legislation are not designed for application to <Col N="410" /> the banks and financial institutions.  It is fair to say that the banks voluntarily have not taken the advantage available to them in Part III of the Schedule of the 1963 Act which they could have if they wished.  Since the late seventies they have been publishing quite extensive figures so far as their operations are concerned. Would the Minister be kind enough to indicate the difference he has in subsection (2) which states that sections 3 to 6, 8 to 12, 7 to 19 and 23 do not apply in relation to certain banks with licences under the Central Bank Act and other named institutions?</P>
      <P>There seems to be a difference so far as the non-life insurers and life assurance companies are concerned in that the Minister omits section 7 so far as the regulations attached to the banks and the named institutions are concerned but includes it in so far as the life insurance companies and assurance companies are concerned.  While section 7 deals with the documents to be annexed to the annual returns, it would seem natural to believe that all these sections would apply equally to the banking and financial institutions as well as to life insurance companies and assurance companies as named under the European Communities regulations.  Perhaps the Minister might explain the reason for the variation in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is merely a technical matter.  It is one where they file their accounts via the Insurance Acts rather than via the Companies Act directly.  It is merely technical and it does not give them any more freedom not to file accounts.  As the Deputy knows, their accounts are well published.  I should add also for the clarification of Deputies that we are strengthening the position in relation to private limited companies involved in the financial sector.  They will now have to file accounts where they did not have to before.  The only thing we are doing is we are not requiring them to do so in accordance with the Schedules to this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Part III of the Schedule to the 1963 Act is the one which excludes <Col N="411" /> banking or discount companies from being obliged to comply with certain aspects.  One would have thought, seeing that we are talking about disclosure in one form or another, that the whole question of disclosure and the documents that would be annexed to the returns would apply equally to both.  If the Minister feels it is necessary to amend it on Report Stage perhaps he might consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept Deputy Flynn's argument about banks being very generous in relation to information. They have taken full advantage of the 1963 Act in relation to the disclosure of information.  I believe the reason for that is that because of public pressure over the years to disclose more information they recognised that public opinion would have forced new legislation on them to force them to disclose information. That is the only reason they disclosed more information than they were required to under the 1963 Act.  In fact, the position is that the disclosure of information by banks in this country is far less than in the UK, much less than in the USA and certainly much less than in western European countries.  Therefore, ample information is not given.  There are plenty of analyses, reports and all sorts of things given by the banks, but information regarding their own accounts and their investments are certainly not given. Who would have known, but for Gallaghers going bust, the amount of investment by the banks in a property development company?  On the whole question of reserves and so on, there is a total lack of information disclosed in the accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a bit late getting into the House. I was not clear whether the Minister had indicated whether, if my amendments are not successful in removing this exemption, he expected it would be likely that legislation would be introduced in regard to banks and financial institutions <Col N="412" /> on similar lines.  If he is not including them in this Bill I understand that similar legislation will be required by way of a separate Bill.</P>

It would be fair to say that the voluntary arrangements made by many of these institutions far outpace those which exist in other jurisdictions.  Indeed some of the banking institutions must be complimented for having taken on board voluntarily the decision to publish their accounts in very great detail on a regular basis in the public press, not just leaving them in the filing office at the Companies Registration Office for those sufficiently interested to find out at their own expense.</P>

      <P>They have given a great breakdown of their business interests and the general public have been given that information in a decipherable way which is more than can be said of some other countries where institutions of that kind operate.  It is only right that we should place on record that the general public recognise that that has been done voluntarily and that the provisions of this Bill will in no way prevent the public from getting any information they might require with regard to those institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> I have no doubt at all that the new directive dealing with insurance companies, banks and financial institutions will take quite some time before being introduced in this House.  The Minister was being generous when he said perhaps a year, perhaps three years.  It may take a lot longer.  But let it be put on record that it will not be held up because of ambivalence in this House.  Perhaps Deputy Mac Giolla would direct his remarks to the members of parliament in some other jurisdictions who have not yet implemented into their national legislation this Fourth Directive with which we are now complying.</P>
    <P>While I do not disregard the fact that we had to go before the European Court in the matter, that we were threatened on more than one occasion by various bodies for not having done so earlier, it must be put on the record that there are other countries in the EC, more developed administrations than ours, that have not yet seen fit to incorporate and implement this directive in their Legislatures. Indeed some of them with Socialist Governments have sought ways out of implementing some of the terms of the Fourth Directive.  The Federal Republic of Germany&mdash;not satisfied because this legislation was a catch-all as far as their companies were concerned &mdash; are seeking special arrangements for their limited partnerships and corporations.  They are having devised a special directive to accommodate the type of company with the largest number of subsidiary companies registered with them in their jurisdiction, so that they will not be involved in the publication and presentation of provisions outlined in this Bill.  We should not be berating ourselves for not complying with the wishes of our European partners. We are certainly doing as good a job as they are.  I am not taking the Minister's role in protecting the Government.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether or not a company has to file accounts, it will be ineffective if the Companies Registration Office are not given the necessary support, back-up and computerised systems to deal with the matter.  If you do not file <Col N="416" /> an account at present in the Companies Registration Office, nothing happens. Nobody bothers about whether or not you file it.  We may be making a lot of noise that will mean nothing.  The Minister will be hard pressed by me to indicate exactly what arrangements he proposes to make in that office.  At present very often files are not available when you require them, particularly controversial ones.  Irrespective of the scope of the legislation and the companies that might be caught in the net in which this legislation sets out to catch them, it will be ineffective unless the Companies Registration Office are given the back-up, the personnel, the money and the sophisticated computerisation necessary to deal with the filing of the necessary documents.</P>

      <P>I am pleased with the progress which has already been made in the Companies Registration Office in relation to computerisation, cleaning up the records and getting rid of all the dead companies.  I would like to congratulate the registrar on his efforts in modernising and computerising.  To put it in perspective the directive which we are translating into national law was passed in Europe in 1978.  At present Germany has not implemented the directive.  It has however enacted legislation.  I understand that it will become compulsory after 31 December 1986.  In December 1984 the Commission referred Germany, Ireland and Italy to the Court of Justice for nonimplementation of the Fourth Directive. We have not yet implemented it.  Neither has Italy nor indeed Greece.  We are in the process of passing a law and the Commission are anxious that we should do this.</P>

      <P>We have been trying to be very good boys in the outfit while the other countries will dodge and duck when it suits them.  We have to take into account the welfare of our country and, above all, the welfare of our people.  Our companies and our employees are all inter-linked in this.  The last time I spoke on this matter I dealt at some length with the insurance companies and the banks.  I will not go back over that ground now.  I want to make it clear that both of them, especially the banks, give very detailed information to the public.  The shareholders are demanding very comprehensive information in regard to accounts.  The insurance companies are a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They have very farreaching powers and they keep a close watch on the insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with the Companies Registration Office.  I have been told by many people that there has been a falling-down in that area, that registration of new companies is rather slow and that there is a back-log.  If you are looking for detailed information, you are rather slow to get it.  I presume the necessary personnel is not available to keep the accounts up to date.  It has also been brought to my notice that some companies who are not trading are still on the books.  It is only after some years that they realise what the position is.  The Minister mentioned that he intends to computerise the office.  If that is so, it will be very welcome.  I would like to know when that will take place.  Will it be in the immediate future or is it some years away?  Even if computerisation comes <Col N="418" /> about in the near future, we will still need the back-up and personnel to deal quickly with the situation where a new company is being formed.  Three weeks would be a reasonable time but I am led to believe it takes much longer, due to a shortage of personnel.</P>

I am not aware that there are any difficulties in registering companies with the Companies Registration Office. I understand that the computerisation programme is well under way and that quite an amount of information has already been put on the computer.  I understand the registrar is chasing up the old and defunct companies and also chasing returns and intends to prosecute where necessary.  Excellent progress has been made.</P>

      <P>Section 2 outlines what the scope of this Bill will be.  As I said before, this Bill is the result of a directive of the EC.  We are obliged to bring in this Companies (Amendment) Bill in order to comply with that directive.  We are complying with our obligations under European law.  The scope of this Bill is far too wide and the effect will be that every limited company, from the smallest to the biggest, will now have to publish some form of accounts or balance sheet in the Companies Registration Office. There are certain exemptions in regard to subsidiary companies but in general the supposedly 70,000 limited companies in Ireland will have to publish some kind of information.  The ramifications of this are not fully understood by many people in the community.  This type of Bill, to have in the Companies Registration Office the accounts and other information of limited companies, is a grand notion in principle.  It is useful in that people setting up a limited company enjoy limited liability and have self protection in the law.  Their accounts should be open to examination by the public.  It is a socialist principle that we should all see everybody else's affairs.  I do not <Col N="419" /> agree with that.  The scope of this Bill is not in tune with Irish conditions.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, one Deputy pointed out that there is only a small number of large public companies in Ireland and another small number of large companies which are not publicly quoted on the stock exchange.  The majority of the 70,000 limited companies are very small. They may be, for instance, a company of a husband and wife running a small shop down the country having been advised years ago to set up a limited company, as that would be the best possible way to do it, or they are a few guys who got together, either blocklayers or bricklayers to do general building work.  I am quite <i>au fait</i> with people in that situation. Theoretically, these are classed as company directors and pay tax, etc.  In speeches in the House these are supposed to be the people who are self-employed, making fortunes and evading their tax. Nothing could be further from the truth. They probably have smaller incomes than most of the people who are giving out about them.  They are doing their very best to do something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take a small limited company which has been set up, say, in the Minister's constituency where there are many small businesses which are, in effect, limited companies.  Their turnover might be very small in a particular year.  The assets and liabilities of the company may be very small yet these people will have to file their private financial information in the Companies Registration Office.  They will qualify for the small companies relief but they will still have to provide a balance sheet.  The assets and liabilities of the smallest limited company anywhere in Ireland will have to be detailed. Some consideration should be given by the Government not to have that kind of limited liability company included in this legislation.  There is an amendment in the name of Deputy Mac Giolla which effectively reduces the exemption limits to classify what are now going to be termed small and medium sized companies. There is a class of company that would not come near the turnover or <Col N="420" /> gross asset limits in the Bill.  I do not know what the figure would be but there must be thousands of these companies at present operating which are small companies. There has been talk about the turnover of a small company being £1.25 million.  I am talking about a husband and wife operation whose turnover might be £100,000 per year or less.  They are going to be caught under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the Minister but I do not think this Bill is right for Irish circumstances.  The financial information of these people should not be there for public inspection in the Companies Registration Office.  We have to enact laws in this House which will do something for the Irish economy.  For instance, a few lads, they are probably unemployed at present, have an idea and want to start a small company.  I can tell the Minister that in the last year people have been encouraged to come off the dole and form limited companies.  The best advice available to them is to keep the company separate from their own financial affairs in case anything goes wrong.  These are not multi-millionaires or anything like that.  They are going to end up having their detailed financial information filed in the Companies Registration Office.  That is a load of codology in that those people will be caught under the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an amendment to this Bill as soon as possible to classify &mdash; we have small, medium and large &mdash; that type of company so that they will not have to do that.  When explaining to those people that in the future their accounts are going to be published in the Companies Registration Office where any Tom, Dick or Harry can come in off the street and inspect them, they will be frightened off.  Furthermore, it is going to frighten off many more people who are thinking of going into business in a small way, employing themselves for a start, with one of their family, or a few others.  This is where economic growth is going to come from.  We are not going to have economic growth by having multinational firms.  It is the small operation which employs two or three people which <Col N="421" /> we must look to for economic growth in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister on Report Stage, within the ambit of the Fourth Directive, to bring in that type of exemption.  The Minister being a man who spent most of his life in ordinary business before he came into the House well appreciates the kind of person and company I am talking about.  I would like to see that being done as the scope of this Bill is not applicable to Irish circumstances. There are certain Irish companies that should be made to do this. With the level of our economic and industrial development I am not against this for many reasons.  We will come to sections where we will be able to point out, particularly later in the Bill, how things will be itemised.  These are going to provide much detailed information and people do not want that.  This may be classed as a &ldquo;right wingism&rdquo; or &ldquo;free enterpriseism&rdquo; but whatever it is, it is right.  We keep putting obstacles in the way of development of business.  Yes, we will all be equal.  We will all be equal at nought, that is a certainty.  We have to decide what we are going to do.</P>
      <P>The purpose of section 2 (3) is to avoid having the scope of the Bill apply to companies who are the holders of authorisation licences under the European Communities' non-life insurance regulations. The way it is phrased here means that most sections will not apply to those companies.  Sections 3 to 12 will not apply.  Section 19 and section 23 do not apply.  What sections of this Bill will apply to these type of companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scope of this Bill is far too wide. How does anyone think this will be policed?  The Companies Registration Office have at least done something about computerisation but, during the past few years, they have been up to their ears in work.  They have to look after company registrations, changes of names, file directors forms and everything else and they are unable to keep up with the work.  How can they also police <Col N="422" /> this legislation?  How can they ensure that companies get in their accounts when this will involve a whole lot of new form filling and so on?  This section brings in all limited companies and by definition brings in companies which have been dormant for a number of years, companies who have stopped trading but who still have a file in the Companies Registration Office although they have no intention of trading again.  Some of these companies have not traded for ten or 12 years but have not been followed up and been struck off the Companies Register as people might consider that they might use a company again to trade in certain business.  We are putting these people to the expense of producing an account.  There is nothing in the balance sheet and they will have to go through all this rigmarole.  Another section should be inserted to get dormant companies out of the field.  At the moment the Companies Registration Office cannot follow up companies which have ceased trading.</P>
    <P>In the past when one went to the Companies Registration Office to get a file, one paid 5p or 10p, perhaps the file had not been taken out for the previous six years.  Before it was put back in its place the staff would have a look at it to see were the annual returns up to date, and they would then write to the secretary of the company to do something about it. That is the system that operated until quite recently.  If no one came to look at the file companies, for which there were no annual returns, could be in existence for ten or 12 years.  Now we will have a system which will produce more work, when the Companies Registration Office cannot handle the old system.</P>
    <P>I hope computerisation will help but if we cannot have proper policing this legislation will be of no benefit.  The efficient companies, the public companies and the larger companies generally get their accounts done on time and they will comply with the legislation but the majority of companies will not do anything about it at all.  Before Report Stage I would like the Minister to limit the scope of this Bill to eliminate companies about which I have spoken, the <Col N="423" /> very small private limited companies and dormant companies.</P>

      <P>While Deputy McCreevy was speaking I was reminded of a recommendation I made to the Minister on Second Stage when I asked him to consider a new form of incorporation for small firms, particularly proprietary companies of the type Deputy McCreevy talked about, the family owned concern, the sweet shop or the newsagency on the corner.  It is ridiculous that they should have to comply with a legislative structure which applies to a company such as the Smurfit organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider my suggestion.  Our aim was to get all companies registered in the Companies Registration Office.  A new form of incorporation for shareholder managed companies might be considered appropriate to our circumstances.  It would reduce the burden on existing companies in that bracket.  While registration would convey limited liability status on them, one always had the penalty that if they did not register their proprietary company, limited liability status could be withdrawn.  That status confers very great advantages on business, so one could be sure that they would comply.  It is much easier to comply with a limited form of registration in that way to accommodate a very small turnover and asset base, than to have companies dodging it by not filing their accounts or even registering, or making an initial registration and then carrying on without complying with the regulations.  I felt at that time that all that was needed at the end of the year was a simple auditors certificate saying that the company was solvent for the accounting period about which they were concerned, without providing all this paraphernalia of figures which a small business has not got the time or the administrative skill or the money to assemble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred in his Second Stage response to the suggestions I made <Col N="424" /> and took note of the fact that I paid some attention to the UK study of some years ago where this was recommended while the Fourth Directive legislation was making its way through the House of Commons.  The Minister said it seemed to have died for lack of interest there.  In support of Deputy McCreevy I would point out that the similarities between our business scene and the UK business scene are few.  While there are hundreds of thousands of medium and large concerns in the UK, of the 67,000 companies we have registered here, the vast majority would be in the small and tiny bracket. While tiny might not be the proper terminology to use in so far as the Fourth Directive does not allow one to think in those terms, it is interesting to note that before we introduced the implementing legislation to bring the Fourth Directive into our national legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the reasons why the Minister in his reply on Second Stage felt that it might not be worth while at this time.  He drew a comparison with the situation in the UK, and I recognise that there was a very great difference.  He said that a balance must be struck in these matters and that the <Col N="425" /> reason he said that a balance had to be struck was that he did not want to make the classification of companies, in so far as registration was concerned, so simple that interlopers and cowboys would abuse such provisions.  Interlopers and cowboys, as he called them, can operate only when the law of the land is not being applied.  It is not for us here but for another day and a different Minister to decide how to go about that.  However, we may take the decision here to allow this type of simple classification and simple company registration to be put in place and afterwards give the proper policy directions to the registrar and then it is up to somebody else to see to it that that is complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was making the point that in the 1983 Companies (Amendment) Act before we allowed this legislation into the House we took the opportunity of bringing about a situation where you could convert from limited liability status to unlimited status, thereby allowing the really big operators to get out from under the net that this legislation involves.  We made very sure to do that in advance of this legislation so that the big operators &mdash; they might not be many but they are obviously very influential &mdash; were accommodated.  They have had time to change their status, to have their incorporations put in unlimited status or to make themselves branches or whatever.  They have the opportunities available to them.  It is a pity that just in accommodating the very large concerns we did not introduce a Bill before this one saying that we were creating a new form of incorporation for small, tiny companies, the proprietary companies I have referred to, and then we could have excluded them from the scope of section 2.  I would have regarded that as much more satisfactory and more in keeping with the size, classification and type of business we have.  Even at this late stage the Minister of State might convey to his Minister that he give an indication that before the implementation date of this legislation arrives &mdash; it is to be hoped in 18 months &mdash; he might introduce another limited Bill to allow the type of company <Col N="426" /> I am talking about to be exempt from the scope of section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Flynn for their thoughts on the scope of the Bill.  I thought theirs were somewhat Second Stage speeches rather than Committee Stage.  When we entered the EC on 1 January 1973 there was already in existence the Council's First Directive on Company Law and we were quite well aware at that stage that we were going to have to bring into our national legislation the publication of accounts.  That directive has been superseded now by this directive which we are transposing into national law.  We have brought in what I consider a very balanced Bill in respect of small companies, medium companies and large companies and especially in relation to small limited companies and the minimum of requirements from them in respect of the information which they will have to file with the Companies Registration Office.  I believe that we have achieved a fair balance.  When you register to be a limited company you take on obligations and when you are trading you are obliged to trade and to make any returns, etc., and traders are entitled to know the state of the company.  That is what we are achieving in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to a request from Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Flynn that we should have some new form of small company or whatever, I am afraid it is not possible.  The directive is quite specific and ties my hands in relation to what I can or cannot do regarding limited companies. Deputy Flynn referred to the fact that in the 1983 Act a limited company could become an unlimited company and thereby escape this directive.  That option is open to all limited companies, of course, so we have not been prejudiced in favour of a special few as he seemed to indicate in his speech.  All limited companies can become unlimited companies but, of course, there is an amazing difference. When you are unlimited it means that your liability is unlimited and creditors can come after you in law to a far greater extent than they can if you are a limited <Col N="427" /> company.  Therefore, we were not favouring the elite or the few by allowing limited companies to become unlimited. All companies can become unlimited.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking about limited companies. We have divided them into small, medium and large.  In relation to small companies, the amount of information required to be filed is small but it is necessary if we are to abide by the directive.  I cannot escape enforcing the directive and I am transposing that directive into national law.</P>
    <P>The small family businesses of which the Deputy spoke do not have to form limited companies to trade.  They may trade as single traders, as partnership traders or as unlimited companies and they will not be affected by the Bill before the House.  Therefore I cannot hold out any hope for an amendment on Report Stage in relation to these small companies or family businesses.  They have obligations under company law and in respect of filing; they have obligations already in existence under the 1963 Act.  These new obligations are a direct result of the company law directive which we are transposing into national law, and my hands are, in effect, tied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's hands being tied in that he has to introduce the Bill as a result of the Fourth Directive, but would it be possible that &mdash; maybe not under this Bill &mdash; under the new Companies Bill, which was to be introduced by successive Governments over the last five or six years, legislation of the type that Deputy Flynn and I have been talking about will be introduced?  I can appreciate that to restructure the 1963 Act must be an enormous undertaking, but perhaps in this long heralded new Companies Bill, which presumably will come before the House at some stage maybe in the lifetime of this Government or the next, a Minister could see his way to introduce legislation regarding limited liability of the type we have been talking about.  I am referring to the tiny family limited company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me point out some anomalies that <Col N="428" /> will occur as a result of the legislation before us.  Take a very small sweet shop down the country that has limited liability. The reasons for making it a limited liability company are not relevant.  That company will have to publish their financial information and have it filed in the Companies Registration Office.  On the other hand, take a large co-operative, Cork Marts Ltd., for instance.  They will not have to publish any information at all in the Companies Registration Office regarding their costs.  Whether they publish their accounts is up to them.  A large co-operative owned just by farmers do not have to publish anything in the Companies Registration Office regarding their financial information and their turnover may be millions of pounds.  The reason is that co-operatives are covered under different legislation and they have to furnish their accounts to the Registrar of Friendly Societies, etc. but the general public will not have the opportunity of studying their accounts in the same detail as they will have of studying those of a very small family company operating maybe for years.</P>
    <P>Building societies have to furnish their accounts etc. to the Minister for Industry and Commerce with details.  Here again, however, the public will not be able to go to the office to extrapolate the information they require on how the company is doing.  It is up to each credit union whether they publish information and people cannot find out what information is there.  On the one hand, the small family owned company will come within the scope of section 2, having to publish everything, and the co-operatives and businesses with multi-million pound turnovers will not be subject to the same scrutiny by the general public.  Some of them publish information for their own shareholders which may be published in the press but they are not obliged by law to do what the very small limited liability companies will have to do under this Bill. That is an imbalanced situation.  I appreciate that under the EC directive the Minister may not be able to exempt the limited companies about which we are talking, but I urge upon him, that in <Col N="429" /> the formation of the new Companies Bill, that type of company which is peculiar to Irish circumstances should be recognised.</P>

Some of these are managed through excluded companies which are referred to in the section.</P>

      <P>Of course, a Ceann Comhairle. I am talking about companies that perhaps will have a subsidiary set up to run their pension fund and thereby escape the necessity to disclose their accounts through the Companies Registration Office or, alternatively, some financial companies, the saving banks or other such, might be used to run these pension funds for firms.  Many workers are finding, even under the present conditions, that they are paying money into pension funds, in many cases involuntarily having the money withdrawn from their wages, and are losing their contributions. These are going astray and when the time comes for the need of a pension, the money is not there.  In those circumstances it is essential that there be the fullest possible disclosure so that workers whose money is paid into these pension funds would have the fullest information that it is being invested for them and that it will be there when they come to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister clarify that in this section giving additional exclusions from the necessity to submit accounts to the Companies Registration Office we are not going to make things worse in this regard.  Large numbers of workers have found themselves in the tragic situation of losing the money paid in by them over many years.  Over the years, many have made attempts to find out what is being done with the money, where it is invested <Col N="430" /> and how much is there and they cannot get that information.  Is this going to be an additional blanket on top of that? Should we not have a special provision increasing the disclosing liabilities of any firms that take these funds, to ensure that it is a fully open book and that we are not giving any further get-out to people in that category?</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy McCreevy, I cannot hold out prospects in this legislation for special treatment of small companies.  I repeat that if one forms a small company one is forming a limited company with limited liability and it brings upon that person certain legal responsibilities.  I cannot change that situation in the context of the directive.  In doing so, I would be going outside the scope of the directive.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor is worried about pension funds and I understand his concern. It is always a problem when a company is in difficulties, closes down and the pension fund is found to be wanting.  This Bill does not deal with pension funds <i>per se;</i> it is not intended to do so.  Other legislation is probably more appropriate for what the Deputy intends.  In relation to companies set up specifically in the manner that Deputy Taylor suggests, to avoid disclosure, that is not possible under this Bill.  Every company, whether private or public, must make returns to the Companies Registration Office.  They must have notes attaching to these accounts.  I cannot quite understand Deputy Taylor's problem here.  All companies which are not excepted as outlined in section 22 must make returns to the companies office.  The only exceptions I have specified relate to the format of the returns.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to section 36 (5) in Information Required by way of Notes to Accounts:</P>
      <P>The following information shall also be given:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the nature of every pension <Col N="431" /> scheme operated by or on behalf of the company including information as to whether or not each scheme is a defined benefit scheme or a defined contribution scheme,</P>
    <P>(b)  whether each such scheme is externally funded or internally financed,</P>
    <P>(c)  whether any pension costs and liabilities are assessed in accordance with the advice of a professionally qualified actuary and, if so, the date of the most recent relevant actuarial valuation,</P>
    <P>(d)  whether and, if so, where any such actuarial valuation is available for public inspection.</P>

      <P>Trade unions representing employees should also take great care in their discussions with employers to ensure that the pension fund is secure and take whatever steps are necessary to safeguard their members' rights.  There is a trade union-employer relationship which is ongoing and, by and large, employers are anxious to protect the pension fund.  This can be done through ordinary negotiations.  This matter is referred to in the Bill and the mechanism suggested by Deputy Taylor of having <i>sub rosa</i> companies would not remove the need to file returns under this Bill in the companies office.</P>

      <P>We would be grateful on this side if some help could be given to the 67,000 small companies throughout the country.  It is hard enough for them in existing economic circumstances without having to submit themselves to all these paraphernalia.  I am talking about small family concerns who employ between five and 20 people.  Under existing company law they have to put up not only themselves but their wives and <Col N="432" /> children as guarantees to the financial institutions.

I suggest that we should ask them for only the minimum amount of information.  Further reams of paper work will only worry them.  I know that is not the Minister's intention, but this should be made clear while we are debating this complex Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), to delete lines 6 to 10 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and, accordingly, in the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1982, and the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983, in relation to a company to which this Act applies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>(ii)  references to the said Sixth Schedule shall be construed as references to the corresponding provisions of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is purely a technical drafting change which the draftsman has advised is necessary.  The purpose of lines 6 and 10 on page 6 of the Bill in section 3 is to ensure that references in earlier Companies Acts to section 149 and the Sixth Schedule &mdash; the accounts requirements &mdash; will now, in so far as limited companies covered by this Bill are concerned, be construed as references to the corresponding provisions of this Bill. However, lines 6 to 10 as drafted neglected the fact that subsections (5) and (7) of section 149 still apply to limited companies covered by this Bill by virtue of an oversight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said his amendment simply ties up the references to the Sixth Schedule of the 1963 Act and to section 149 of that Act.  I suggest that it is much more important than that.  It is a fundamental part of this legislation because this section is a substitute for the Sixth Schedule in regard to detailed accounting requirements.  Section 149 of the Act dealt with the treatment of accounts.  It is obvious from the Minister's statement that he wishes to maintain the effect of the Sixth Schedule and have it incorporated in this legislation. The only difference is that it will be done in a new way, the way of the Fourth Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major changes in this legislation fundamentally alter the thrust of the Sixth Schedule but I do not see why the Minister could not have drafted and inserted here a completely new schedule. That would have been the wise thing to have done and it would have made reference more easy and obviated the necessity for cross-referring to the Sixth <Col N="434" /> Schedule in regard to annual accounts, balance sheets, profit and loss accounts and so forth.  The primacy of the principle of the true and fair view is incorporated in both.  We welcome that.  The annual accounts of all these companies must give a true and fair view of the companies' assets and liabilities, their financial position and profit and loss accounts, but where the new format does not comply to the true and fair view, it is open to companies to depart.  I would like the Minister to explain in what way companies can depart from the principle of the true and fair view which was an essential ingredient of the Sixth Schedule.  Perhaps he would indicate where companies can do their filing without taking cognisance of the true and fair view.  This would give us an indication of what he has in mind by this cross-reference.</P>

As I said, we are ensuring in the amendment that references in the earlier Companies Act, section 149 and the Sixth Schedule, will, so far as limited companies covered by this Bill are concerned, be construed as references to the corresponding provisions in this Bill.  This is a technical amendment, nothing else.</P>

      <P>The true and fair view principle is the central point here, and that principle has to be adhered to so far as the profit and loss of any company for any particular financial year is concerned. If the balance sheet and the profit and loss account cannot adhere to the true and fair view principle, then additional information has to be given and provided in the notes to the account.  Subsection (i) (d) reads &ldquo;...the directors of the company shall depart from the requirements of the Schedule to this Act in preparing those accounts in so far as is necessary in order to comply with that paragraph&rdquo;.  I take it that the relationship in paragraph (a) refers to sections 4 and 5 of this legislation.  That appears to be double-talk and requires clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under paragraph (e) where the directors of a company depart from the true and fair view principle they will have to attach a note to the accounts of the company giving details of the effects of <Col N="436" /> those departures on the accounts.  How will they be in a position to give credit to that requirement in advance of the outturn from the changes?

      <P>This section substitutes the accounting requirements laid out in the Sixth Schedule of the 1963 Act, subject to the overriding principle of the true and fair view.  The effect of section 3 is not alone to ensure that sections 4 and 5 are brought into play but that a fixed format will have to be filed not alone <Col N="437" /> in the companies office with the annual returns but it will have to be the format of the accounts laid before the annual general meeting of the company.  Section 3 (1) says &ldquo;Subject to subsection (2) ... every balance sheet and profit and loss account of a company, laid before the annual general meeting of the company, pursuant to section 148 of the Principal Act...&rdquo;.  It is a good idea to have the same format of accounts laid before the annual general meeting of the company and filed in the companies office.</P>
      <P>Section 3 introduces the idea of a fixed format.  The Schedule to the Bill gives the kind of format that may be adopted regarding the balance sheet, profit and loss account etc.  I am not saying it is a good idea or a bad idea but, for the first time ever, there will be fixed formats which will have to be applied regarding the preparation of accounts.  This is a major amendment to the 1963 Act which had its own way how things had to be reported on, the general preamble as to what was to be included in the Sixth Schedule regarding the accounts of a limited company and the kind of things which had to be stated in them.  This section changes the whole game altogether so now there will be fixed formats for the balance sheet, the profit and loss account etc.  It is a major change in companies legislation.  The positive advantage is that, in the preparation of accounts in the future, there will be a fixed way in which things will have to be done and laid out.  It should make it simpler for anybody trying to interpret accounts.  On the other hand, there will be disadvantages.  It is tying the hands of the accountants regarding the way things have to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the Bill one would nearly have to go back to study accountancy again and learn all the angles to it.  This is a very important section which lays down the general provisions relating to the accounts.  Every balance sheet and profit and loss account will have to comply with sections 4 and 5 as a result of section 3 which sets out the general rules as to what will have to be done.  The <Col N="438" /> section makes it quite clear that the over-riding principle of the true and fair view is the one which dominates.  Even though there are fixed formats for certain statements it is the old accountancy principle: do the accounts give a true and fair view? Under the 1963 Act the auditors report is the main thing which says or does not say if the accounts give a true and fair view.  Even though there are a lot of rules in this section and in subsequent sections, I am glad to note that this Bill is dominated by the idea that accounts must give a true and fair view.  That is very important to recognise.</P>
    <P>Subsection 1 (d) says where, owing to special circumstances, the preparation of accounts of a company in compliance with previous paragraphs would deviate from the true and fair view idea and where the strict format might possibly not give the idea of the true and fair view, they are bound to put it into the notes of the accounts or some other part of the balance sheet in order to really copperfasten the idea of the true and fair view. It makes a major change in the 1963 Act in that it really sets down in a very strict formula now the format of the presentation of a profit and loss account and a balance sheet and the way they must be presented to the annual general meeting of the company and the shareholders. The exact same type of format must also be filed in the Companies Registration Office.  I am neither for nor against it having said what I did on section 2.  It should be emphasised that the over-riding principle of the true and fair view holds over everything else regarding formats. That is still the major principle in the preparation of the accounts and has been there since the 1963 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. In this Bill we have tried to set down in section 3 the philosophy of the Bill in relation to the returns to the Companies Registration Office.  The central core of it is that a true and fair picture of the state of affairs of the company is the criteria which are central to everything that is done subsequently in the Bill.  That is as it should be.  We are trying to ensure <Col N="439" /> that we get a true and fair picture of the company's profits and loss account and balance sheet and that the balance sheet of small companies is lodged in the Companies Registration Office and that the profit and loss account balance sheet and notes etc. are lodged in the office.  We are doing that in order to make the companies more transparent to their traders and creditors to enable them to see that they are dealing with companies which are upright and trustworthy.  We have seen too often many creditors hurt when companies go under.  We are trying to make our companies more transparent, more open, in their dealings.  In producing this Bill we have done so in a very balanced way which will ensure that the people who work under this companies law which gives them limited liability are obliged to make certain returns to the Companies Registration Office.  I believe we are doing a very equitable and fair thing by producing this.</P>

      <P>As an ordinary layman I am rather baffled by paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1).  I am not a legally minded person but I am a bit afraid that the legal people, with all due respect, could have a field day in teasing out those paragraphs in relation to what should be taken out and put into the accounts.  I am getting very technical on this because we know that all Bills going through the House are being very severely scrutinised by the legal profession.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (e) is rather vague in relation to what one can put in and take out. This paragraph states:</P>
      <P>where the directors of a company depart from the requirements of this section, they shall attach a note to the accounts of the company giving details of the particular departures made, the reasons therefore and the effect of those departures on the accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to me to be in conflict with paragraph (a).  It is a departure from the 1963 Act in that regard.  I would like to have spelled out in more detail what is meant by &ldquo;departures made&rdquo;.  I accept <Col N="440" /> that departures can be made with an addendum and so on.  I am afraid that the legal people would make a major legal attack on this.  If it needs to be tidied up or some alternations made, it should be done in the House, not in the Supreme Court, although I am not saying that that will happen.  I have reservations in regard to paragraphs (a), (d) and (e), especially (e) and the way in which it is drafted.  I should like to get the Minister's views because I do not understand it sufficiently. It was brought to my notice outside the House by other interested parties. There could be a severe scrutiny carried out as to what is right and what is wrong in the preparation of accounts.  In my opinion paragraph (e) leaves much room for manoeuvre.</P>

      <P>Under subsection 3 (1) (a), which is subsequently covered by sections 4 and 5, the departures are in order to give a true and fair picture of the company's affairs.  Subsection (1) (d) requires the directors of a company to depart from the accounting rules and format in the Bill if, in the special circumstances, it is necessary to do so to comply with the basic requirement set out in subsection (1) (b), so that the accounts give a true and fair picture.  Subsection (1) (e) provides that where the directors of a company have decided to depart from the requirements of the Bill and the Schedule thereto, in order to provide a true and fair view of the company's affairs in the accounts, they shall attach a note to the accounts giving details of the departures involved, the reasons for them and their effects on the economics of the company. The departures are to allow a company <Col N="441" /> to give a true and fair picture which is what is required under the provisions of subsection (1) (a) and (b).  They are not departures to subvert the Bill, they are departures to strengthen the Bill and they must be fully explained by the directors in the notes to the accounts.  It is quite clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand quite well what the Minister is trying to achieve here.  There is only one question that occurs to me about it.  Companies will prepare their annual accounts, they will have a balance sheet, profit and loss account and notes.  That is all right.  This balance sheet and the profit and loss account will be in the prescribed format and will also comply with the accounting principles specified in section 5, with which we will deal when we come to it. It will be done under those two headings. Both of those will have to comply with the provisions of subsection (1) (b) in so far as a true and fair view is concerned.</P>
      <P>I quite understand that if the true and fair view is not inherent in what they have done, then they must provide extra information and a note must be put on the accounts to that effect.  That is fair enough under paragraph (c).  But it is (d) that causes most concern.  Its provisions are quite explicit in that it says that where, owing to special circumstances, in the preparation of accounts of a company in compliance with the new format and under the accounting principles, they could not comply with the true and fair view, the directors are entitled to depart from the requirements of the Schedule to the Bill.  In other words, they do not have to make out their accounts in either of the formats or options available under the Schedule.  They do not have to comply with the accounting principles as specified in section 5.  Then it says, &ldquo;in preparing those accounts, insofar as is necessary in order to comply, with the paragraph, ...&rdquo; With what paragraph?  Is it paragraph (a), (b) or (c), because all three are mentioned in the subsection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they are allowed to change their format entirely, because it will not comply, is it because it will not comply <Col N="442" /> with the true and fair view?  If it is, fair enough but it should so state, that they are entitled to move away from the formats in the Schedule only if they cannot within those formats comply with the true and fair view.  It is very important that that be clarified.  If the paragraph is not to be inserted at the end of subsection (d) to which the Minister referred, then it makes no sense.  It is then definitely somewhat convoluted and, as Deputy Connolly said, could cause quite a bit of hassle over the reasons why one was allowed to move away and, when one did move away, with what was one complying? Is the overall principle the true and fair view or is it that the formats take precedence on occasion?  Paragraph (e) follows, that they must attach notes to the accounts.  That is reasonable.</P>
    <P>If one were to take this Bill as a whole and read through it, as I have done, one will find there are more things that will have to be referred to in the notes.  What a set of notes one will have if all the things referred to can be complied with through the notes.  It means there will be very limited information given in certain of the formats.  One will be referred back to the notes, where one will discover a whole book of explanations as to why certain things were done.  I understand it is important that, if one moves away from the provisions of any section, one should at least indicate to the reader that one had and the reason for doing so.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about paragraph (d), that it would be clearly indicated that when the formats or the principles cannot be complied with, or when the true and fair view cannot be complied with, one can adopt another format to suit oneself, insert a note at the back and comply with nothing.</P>

      <P>The concept and principle of a true and fair view of the state of affairs of a company is maintained in subsection (1) (d), where the words used:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... the directors of the company shall <Col N="443" /> depart from the requirements of the Schedule to this Act in preparing those accounts in so far as is necessary in order to comply with that paragraph,</P>
    <P>&mdash;which is paragraph (b).  It must be that paragraph and that is the paragraph that states that one must give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company. That is the central concept in this Bill and does not move away from it.  It allows a different presentation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more complex than it need be.  These sections could be worked out in a more simplified way.  If we look at the Minister's amendment which is now part of the section it would take a fair bit of working out and many lawyers would have a job with working it out.  For example: References to the said section <Col N="444" /> 149 shall be construed as references to subsection (5).  It does not say subsection (5) of what &mdash; and in so far as it relates to the same subsection (5), subsection (7) of the said section 149 and to the provisions of this Act corresponding to the other provisions of the said section 149.  Most people would regard that as meaningless gibberish.  It certainly could be a good deal simpler.  It seems as though the draftsman was in a bit of a contradiction with himself.  He did not succeed in clearing his mind on what he wanted.  He took two thrusts, not necessarily opposing &mdash; one is the true and fair view and the other is the format.  He is trying to say that you have to comply with the format but on the other hand there must be the true and fair view.  He says this one is overriding and the other is subjected to that one.  One could go to the Supreme Court many times over on which is over-riding.</P>
      <P>I take a simplistic approach, maybe over simplistic, to these things.  Sections 4 and 5 and the Schedule referred to set out formats for balance sheets and for profit and loss accounts and give all the things that must be specified in the valuation of a company's property.  The directors of the company know the company's affairs and have the benefit of the guidance and advice of the company's auditors. I cannot understand why the company's accounts and documents, the balance sheet, profit and loss account, and all the details that have to be given cannot be so prepared that they give a fair and true view of the state of affairs of that company.  I do not see that that should be entirely impossible, perhaps with the aid of a few explanatory notes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be difficult to put a true and fair valuation on a particular piece of property.  It could be a matter of opinion and depend on the state of the market which changes day by day.  Nonetheless, between the directors, the valuers and the auditors, they should be able to give a true and fair view of their valuation.  I do not see why the directors should be given a let out from complying with the format by saying: &ldquo;We are not complying with the format because to do so might <Col N="445" /> mean that it would not give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company.  In this section we are told that to give a true and fair view of the state of the company is paramount.  Therefore, we are licensed to depart from the format because we are told that the over-riding factor is that it has to be a true and fair view&rdquo;.  Let them follow the format as it is.  Is there any reason why that should not give a true and fair view?  On what basis can anybody suggest that they should be entitled to put forward a format that does not give a true and fair view? That is giving them an opportunity for a cop out and why should they have that escape clause?  They should be obliged to give all the information &mdash; and it is minimal enough &mdash; under sections 4 and 5 and in the Schedule in such a way that it represents a true and fair view.</P>

      <P>As stated by Deputy Flynn, when going through the layout of this Bill there will be so many notes to accounts that it will be hard to know what accounts are.  Until 15 years ago in public companies you got your accounts and they were in the newspapers.  In the seventies notes to the accounts were required.  In the accounts of some companies there are pages and pages of notes. All accountancy firms know they should give cryptic messages and explain things <i>ad nauseam.</i> The notes now are far greater than the accounts.  I agree with Deputy Taylor in regard to the true and fair view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person drafting the Bill was caught between two stools.  He wanted to have an exact format in which accounts would be presented at the annual general meeting and field in the Companies Registration Office.  Extreme detail has been gone into in the Schedule of this Bill, which has not happened before, as to how things are to be categorised.  That was not included in the 1963 Act.  It was left to the over-riding principle of the true and fair view.  This Bill is an attempt to put things into boxes and categories.  I never thought I would see an accountancy-type Bill in the House with a list of things that must be included such as turnover and <Col N="446" /> many other headings in ferocious detail Part of the Schedule tells you how these things will have to be valued, broken down and calculated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 4 and 5 define the accounting principles which the accountancy bodies have had for years about going concerns, prudence and so on.  We have the person trying to bring in a Bill to satisfy the Fourth Directive saying: &ldquo;We must have a particular format of accounts.&rdquo;  Somebody else said: &ldquo;We will have to define what must be under each heading in the balance sheet and define how these figures should be arrived at.&rdquo;  It was agreed that the over-riding principle of the presentation of accounts must be the true and fair view. That principle was included in the 1963 Act.  Accounts of a limited company should do nothing other than present a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of its profits or losses in the preceding year.  In trying to emphasise the idea of the true and fair view, the draftsman has gone to extreme lengths to keep inserting it.  Section 3 (1) (c) states:</P>
      <P>where a balance sheet or profit and loss account drawn up in accordance with paragraph (a) of this subsection would not provide sufficient information to comply with paragraph (b) ...</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is about the true and fair view:</P>
      <P>... any necessary additional information shall be provided in that balance sheet or profit and loss account or in a note to the accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, paragraph (b) goes into further detail to ensure that if the directors do not give the fair and true view they must put a note in the accounts. Paragraphs (a) and (b) refer to sections 4 and 5 of this Bill which are about the format of accounts and accounting principles. Section 3 gives power to do that.  In order to make sure that a true and fair <Col N="447" /> view over-rides everything else, subsection (4) has the effect of saying that subsection (1) (b) of this section over-rides the requirements of sections 4 and 5.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (b) states that every such balance sheet of a company shall give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company.  Therefore, in order to re-emphasise that the true and fair view is the big factor in all this the section may have gone overboard.  It may negative the whole idea of having regularised formats.  When accounts are being prepared by the majority of companies the true and fair view would be the over-riding principle.  Even if the Minister did not mention the accounting principles in section 5, they would be the ones that would be taken into account anyway. There have been for a number of years that SSAPs, statements of standards of accounting practice issued by the institute. This Bill is bringing in for the first time those accountancy concepts.  The Bill incorporates too much information because if you take the 1963 Act with its fair and true view over-riding everything, it is up to an accountant to take that as his over-riding principle and he will also be guided by the SSAPs of the institute. The reason they are there is to help the accountants to arrive at a true and fair view.  Therefore, there was none of this detail in the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>What has happened since the 1963 Act is that in the preparation of accounts more and more private companies have many notes, without having any legislation, because it has become good accountancy practice.  This Bill is trying to formalise in a legal way what has been good accountancy practice for a long number of years.  A danger I would see is that by putting it into legal language the Minister may make himself a hostage to fortune because some director will say: &ldquo;This is what it says in the Act.  This is all we have to do and this is the way to get around it&rdquo;.  I recognise what the Minister has been trying to do in this section but I fear that by trying to copperfasten the true and fair view, he might have given an out.  It is not relevant as <Col N="448" /> most accountants would prepare accounts in a proper way.  In trying to copperfasten the idea under subsection (4) it may have given a way out and you will not have to comply with the format.</P>

      <P>If Deputies read section 1 of the general provisions of the directive, Article 2, they would see that is the basis upon which we base this Bill. There was no conflict in our minds in doing so.  We have established the central principle of true and fair concept which runs through section 3.  The only reason for any departure would be to restrengthen the concept.  We are satisfied that 99.9 per cent of companies, advised as they will be by their auditors, will conform to the Schedule in the Bill and conform to sections 4 and 5 and will cause no difficulty.  I do not look upon this as a let-out or a let-off.  Auditors will advise the directors very straightforwardly about what is right and what is wrong.  The format of accounts in section 4 and the accounting principles in particular will direct auditors to advise directors as to their position.</P>
      <P>I would point out, briefly, in relation to a possible example which Deputy Mac Giolla gave that under the statements and standards of accounting practice, SSAP 19 in particular, certain investment properties are not required to be depreciated. Under the ordinary handling by auditors of property it should be depreciated over the life of the building.  In order to give a true and fair picture these investment properties will have to be presented in a different manner in the accounts.  That is a brief example where there might be a reason for a departure from the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to point out that section 3 (1) (d) is covered also by (e) where it is quite clearly stated that &ldquo;where the directors of a company depart from the requirements of this section, they shall attach a note to the accounts of the company giving details of the particular departures made, the reasons therefore and the effect of those departures on the accounts.&rdquo;  There is nothing in section 3 which reduces in value the <Col N="449" /> requirement to follow the accounting principles in section 5.  There is nothing in section 3 to undermine the elements and principles involved in section 5.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of section 3 states that subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to the profit and loss account of the company if the company has subsidiaries.  That means that subsection (1) is not going to apply to subsidiaries of a company where there is a consolidated profit and loss account. The profit and loss account of a subsidiary will not have to be published or filed in the Companies Registration Office.  Does that mean that the balance sheet of a subsidiary will have to be filed in the Companies Registration Office?  Take a big building company which has a subsidary company called XY2 Limited to look after a site in Galway and ABC Limited to look after a site in Dublin.  In order to be able to quantify at year end what the profits are, the accounts are kept separate for legal business and tax reasons.</P>
      <P>I can well appreciate and understand why the profit and loss account of a subsidiary would not be relevant if a consolidated profit and loss account of the group is going to be published.  But does that mean that the balance sheet of that subsidiary company has to be published whereas the profit and loss account would not have to be published?  Surely the section should say that the profit and loss account and/or balance sheet should not have to be published.</P>

      <P>I welcomed the opportunity to speak on this Bill and to contribute further to the wider debate which is taking place on this issue.  This debate started in a uniquely Irish style in the early seventies with the introduction of the deserted wife's allowance.  That was our first formal recognition that marriages break down in Ireland.  The debate on this issue did not progress publicly for a number of years after that.  Although we were acutely aware that more and more people were suffering from marriage breakdown, the debate did not have a public face.  In 1978 a motion calling for a referendeum to remove the constitutional ban on divorce was put down at a Fine Gael Ard-Fheis.  That opened up the public debate not only at a political level but in the wider public arena.  We were accused of trying to bring about a reform of the law so as to introduce quickie divorces and bring about a complete breakdown of marriage as we know it. That was not the motive behind that motion.  That motion was an effort to try to open the window, to open the shutters and allow for a sane mature debate on marriage breakdown and to find methods of how best to deal with it in justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate, under the enlightened reforming guidance of Deputy FitzGerald, progressed towards the point where we saw the setting up of an all-party <Col N="451" /> Oireachtas committee to examine marriage breakdown.  Five years ago none of us would have expected that committee to exist.  The debate has come forward in leaps and bounds in recent years.  I refute the comment by Deputy O'Malley earlier in this debate that those who have postured longest and shouted longest on this issue are now anxious to postpone it. This is not an issue that could have been hurried or to which easy solutions could have been found.  It must be dealt with sensitively and carefully and it involved the education of the legislators and the people as to the need for change.  The way the debate has progressed in recent years has shown that the public and the legislators can no longer accept an ostrich-like stance on contentious issues. The time has come when both the legislators and the public expect action.  We cannot continue to put off facing up to this issue by commissioning other reports and having other lengthy debates so that perhaps in five, ten or 15 years we might take action.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made of the fact that we do not know the exact numbers suffering in this limbo of broken marriages. There are enough people for us to take action.  It would be said if we got to the point in our democracy where we could only deal with problems and sensitive issues if a magic number of people were affected and we could not touch the issue if that magic figure was not affected. Would anybody in this House dare to suggest that because we only have thousands of people receiving blind pensions we should abolish them?  Would anybody suggest that because there are only a few thousand travelling families we should not touch that issue?  We should not get hung up on the numbers of people affected.  It is enough that we know there is a problem which needs to be tackled sensitively and carefully by the Legislature.</P>
    <P>Our democracy allows for special legislation for minority groups.  Our democracy should be able to deal with people experiencing marriage breakdown and we should not fall apart because of it.  We <Col N="452" /> should not pretend that it is like some contagious disease to be avoided at all costs lest we become contaminated.  We are insulting the people to suggest that by dealing with this issue which will probably entail a limited form of divorce being available, everybody will want divorce. Many thousands of people have not the slightest intention of seeking divorce. Just because with the introduction of divorce some undeserving people will seek the facility it does not mean that we should put this issue off indefinitely.</P>
    <P>While this Bill may not be the ideal way to tackle this issue, it is adding further to the wider debate.  Many Deputies on this side will not vote for this Bill and some will vote for it, including myself.  This party in maturity and consideration have agreed to allow their members a free vote.  There is no covert Whip.  Nobody has tried to insist that I change my mind since it became known that I intended to vote for this Bill.  Nobody has used strong arm tactics.  Many Deputies will not vote for this Bill, not because they do not see the need for a referendum and a change in the divorce law but because they have decided that they can reconcile themselves to waiting a little longer until the debate with the Churches is completed and until the Government introduce their own Bill.  I respect their view.  Neither backbenchers nor Cabinet members who decide not to vote for this Bill should be pilloried because they have changed their stance or liberal views on this issue.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will not vote for this Bill but will certainly vote when a Government Bill comes into the House. Therefore, I hope that in the same way as I will respect their views in sitting and not voting for this Bill, they will respect that, in all logic, if I am going to vote in a few months' time for a Bill to bring in a referendum, then I cannot decide logically in my mind that there is any sense in not voting for this Bill.  The time has come to stop asking who is bringing this Bill in, whether we like him or do not like him, or whom will it damage.  We should start to ask what we are doing, why we are doing it, whether it is right and just that we take action.  We should <Col N="453" /> not be caught up in tactics and strategy. We should be talking about the justice of what we are doing and the rightness, the correctness, the need and the timing for doing it.  The woman who finds herself having a stable relationship with a second person and her children who cannot understand why that man is not referred to as their father do not care who Deputy Mervyn Taylor is, whether he is Labour, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  All they know is that their situation is untenable and they are seeking from us, the legislators, some relief from that situation.</P>
    <P>As many people want to speak on this, I will conclude by saying that I respect and understand why the Taoiseach is going to have discussions with the Churches.  Let me say that, having sat on the Forum for a full year and having listened to the Episcopal Conference when they came to the Forum, I am certain that they will deal with the discussions with the Taoiseach with the compassion and understanding they exhibited at the Forum.  I want to put on record some things that three bishops at that Forum said.</P>
    <P>Dr. Cahal Daly, speaking about the Catholic Church and questions of public morality, said:</P>
    <P>We have repeatedly declared that we in no way seek to have the moral teaching of the Catholic Church become the criterion of constitutional change or to have the principles of Catholic faith enshrined in civil law.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that of course they had a duty and were bound to alert people who were Catholics to the consequences of any legislation &ldquo;while leaving to the legislators and to the electorate their freedom to act in accordance with their consciences.&rdquo;  Talking about their duty as Catholic priests to instruct their flock, he said:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we have never suggested that the moral considerations we advance are the only relevant considerations in respect of any proposed piece of legislation and we have consistently <Col N="454" /> stressed the rights and the responsibility of conscience.</P>
    <P>Later during that submission by the Episcopal Conference Dr. Joseph Cassidy, talking in a very compassionate manner about people finding themselves in a marital vacuum and consigned to a life of loneliness and incompletion, said:</P>
    <P>The crucial core question has to be faced ultimately by the legislators and the people because it is they who must decide.  We ask that what we have to say, our teachings, our convictions in these matters be given serious weight and consideration.</P>
    <P>I suggest to this House that the discussions which the Taoiseach has opened up with the Churches is giving the Churches a chance to have their points of view considered and perhaps included in legislation.</P>
    <P>Later at the same conference in that same submission, Dr. O'Mahony, Auxiliary Bishop of Dublin, talked, again in a very compassionate way, about people who find themselves in marriage breakdown. He said:</P>
    <P>So we accept that of those who are advocating divorce, many of them do so for caring, humanitarian reasons; also we accept that many of those who advocate divorce are aware of the social evils that result from divorce.</P>
    <P>Those three quotations from three bishops reveal a compassion and understanding which I have no doubt will be mirrored and reflected in the discussions which our Taoiseach is to have.  This House will be given an opportunity if this Bill does not pass here tonight &mdash; it is likely that it will not &mdash; to debate properly a Government Bill.  I have pleasure tonight in supporting this Bill, as I feel it is the only logical step that I can take.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to speak in this debate. I thought that when the debate on the report ended the next occasion on which we would be debating this issue would be on the basis of a Government Bill before <Col N="455" /> the House.  It was fairly clear that there was strong feeling among the Deputies who spoke to the report that the time had come for action and the time for talking about this issue in a general sense was over.  That is the message I have been getting, virtually on a daily basis, from my constituents, from people who are trapped in marriages that have ended in everything but in name and who are denied the remedy because of the Article in the Constitution and the absence of divorce laws in this State.</P>
      <P>Since coming into this House as a Deputy in 1982 I have been disappointed with the way the question of marriage breakdown has been avoided by successive Governments, not just by the present Coalition.  An all-party committee on the Constitution discussed the issue in the sixties, yet 20 years later we appear to be not much nearer a resolution of the problems that many thousands of people face daily.  While it could be said that the public expected little enough in terms of economic progress from the present Coalition, if the newspapers at the time were to be examined it would be seen that expectations were high that social issues, particularly marriage breakdown, would be dealt with and the present Government were elected to office on the basis of a firm commitment in their joint programme that, first of all, a committee to study the problem of marriage breakdown would be established within a very short time.  However, the Government's record on the question of social issues and of marriage breakdown in particular has been abysmal in the way they have dodged and avoided them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government were elected on a programme which included the commitment that a joint committee would be established to report on the problem of marriage breakdown by the end of 1983. We were told that no action could be taken to deal with the problem of marriage breakdown until that committee had reported.  The committee were not established until the middle of 1983 and were then asked to report within 12 months, but the deadline for the report <Col N="456" /> by that committee was subsequently extended on four separate occasions. When eventually they reported last spring we were told that no action could be taken until the Dáil had discussed the report.  The Dáil debate was delayed for, as far as I could see, as long as it possibly could be, but now that this has been concluded the debate has again been delayed and we are told that no action can be taken until the Taoiseach has consulted with the Churches.</P>
    <P>We have had an all-party committee of the Dáil &mdash; by the way, they were not an all-party committee because, apart from the exclusion of The Workers' Party from that committee, other Independent Deputies were excluded also &mdash; sitting for a considerable time and inviting the views of everyone who had something to say on the question of marriage breakdown. A number of Churches made contributions to that committee and quite a large number of Church sub-organisations, so to speak, made contributions also.  The Roman Catholic position in relation to divorce was well presented to the committee by a wide range of groups who hold the Roman Catholic position on divorce.  Therefore, for the Taoiseach to come along at this point and say that we must wait until consultations have taken place with the Churches is a little hard to swallow.  I wonder what excuse will be found at the end of March to say that it must be delayed for a further six or 12 months.  Perhaps the weather will be bad, or there will be a bad harvest, or some other reasons will be found to ensure that the people will be denied an opportunity to express their opinion on whether divorce should or should not be legislated for by this House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's attitude, in particular, to this problem has been quite extraordinary. He has been quoted as saying that while he personally favours the removal of the ban on divorce he does not believe that a constitutional referendum to this effect would succeed at the present time. Incidentally, this is despite the fact that opinion polls have shown a distinct trend in the opposite direction.  Recent opinion polls have shown that there is a growing <Col N="457" /> demand for divorce to be provided under certain circumstances.  To say that a referendum would not be successful at this time is a classic case of leading from behind.  Is it simply that the Taoiseach has no confidence in his own ability or the ability of his party to convince the electorate that this major social reform is necessary?  It seems more likely that he knows that he cannot rely on the support of his own party on this issue and therefore is not prepared to risk his political career, irrespective of the misery of those trapped in broken marriages.  It will be interesting to see tonight to what extent the Fine Gael party support the Labour Party Bill.  It will indicate to what extent the Taoiseach can expect to win through on this issue within his own party, Fine Gael.  If the debate on this Private Members' Bill serves no other purpose than that, it will have been well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>This is the fourth attempt in the lifetime of this Dáil to initiate action to deal with this problem.  Bills were tabled by the Labour Party in February 1982 and again in May 1984.  However, we were not supported by Members of any of the other parties in the Dáil.  Despite that, it must be acknowledged as progress that the Labour Party &mdash; and indeed some Fine Gael TDs &mdash; have come to accept that action is urgently needed and that it should not be postponed any longer.  The Workers' Party will be voting for the Bill at the end of the debate on this Stage.  It may be that if it does succeed in getting through to Committee Stage there may be some amendments to be proposed then.  In order to have this debate progress, this Bill should be supported, not just by ourselves and the Labour Party and a number of Fine Gael Deputies, but by every Deputy.  It is an issue which should be supported at this stage, regardless of the personal views of Deputies.</P>
    <P>I was very much struck by the contribution made by Deputy McGahon in this House during the debate on the report of the committee.  He quite clearly indicated that he was not all that keen on the idea of divorce but accepted the reality of marriage breakdown and accepted that <Col N="458" /> there was a need for legislators to deal with it and that we could not continue to avoid dealing with it.  If other Deputies &mdash; and I address myself in particular to the Fianna Fáil Deputies &mdash; would take the same honest approach on this issue we would go a long way towards providing real political leadership to the people on this issue.</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown is a real factor of life in Ireland as in other countries.  It has been with us as long as marriage itself has been with us, although that has not been openly admitted in Ireland until quite recently.  The problem of marital breakdown has been aggravated to an enormous extent by the pressures caused by large scale unemployment, inadequate housing, inadequate family support and a number of similar economic and social pressures.</P>
    <P>It has been reliably estimated by the Divorce Action Group that up to 70,000 people in Ireland are involved directly in broken marriages.  That figure has been interpreted by some to mean that it is 70,000 marriages that have broken down, but to my knowledge it is the figure quoting the number of people &mdash; men, women and children &mdash; who are affected by this problem.  Recent statistics tell us that there are up to 9,000 women in receipt of the deserted wife's allowance and that they have approximately 15,000 dependants living with them.  It must be assumed that a fairly large majority of those, if not all, had marriages which have irretrievably broken down.  I know that there are cases where wives have been deserted and within 12 or 18 months or two years there has been a reconciliation, but in the majority of cases we must assume that where wives have applied for the deserted wife's allowance there is irretrievable breakdown.  Refusing to recognise that reality does no service to those who are trapped in these broken marriage.  It certainly does nothing to protect the well-being of the children who, through no fault of their own, find themselves with parents who, for whatever reason, cannot continue to live together as husband and wife or mother and father.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> Action is required by the State on two fronts, I would argue.  First, there is a need to deal with the basic contributory causes of marriage breakdown.  The State has responsibility in this regard in so far as it has the capacity to deal with the social and economic causes.  Clearly it is not possible for the State to prevent marriage breakdown where this is as a result of personality clashes or some other personal reason.  Very definitely, the State has a responsibility &mdash; and it has that responsibility under the Constitution &mdash; to ensure that, in so far as it is humanly possible, the services needed to protect family life are in place and that there should never be any reason for a marriage to break down because of economic or social pressures.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are measures necessary to deal with the reality of marriage breakdown itself.  The partial remedies available, the Irish divorce style of barring orders, civil nullity and, indeed, Roman Catholic nullity and desertion, are highly unsatisfactory.  They offer no protection at all to the parties involved. They offer no protection, in particular, to the children involved.  Legislation is required which will allow divorce and which will also allow the civil right to re-marry and to provide for conciliation services to assist those involved to reach amicable settlements in the interest of all parties concerned.</P>
    <P>I have argued a number of times in this House that when you strip away all the different arguments about divorce it boils down to whether the parties who separate should have the right to re-marry.  There is no law that requires couples to remain together.  Indeed, there are provisions in our law to enable couples to separate, to support wives who have been deserted by husbands, to provide that wives can be protected from husbands who are violent or in other ways unsatisfactory to live with &mdash; for instance, through barring orders.</P>
    <P>When we are dealing with divorce we are not talking about the right to separate or of preventing marriage breakdown by refusing to introduce divorce.  We are <Col N="460" /> talking about whether the State will provide for its citizens the right to remarry when marriage has broken down irretrievably. Divorce is not offered as a cure for marriage breakdown.  No one I have spoken to who argues in favour of divorce has ever said divorce will stop marriage breakdown &mdash; it would be nonsense so to argue.</P>
    <P>Nor can a sustainable argument be made that divorce causes marriage breakdown. We do not have divorce and still there are relatively many marriages that have broken down.  Good divorce laws can only regulate the aftermath of a broken marriage in such a way as to minimise the distress and the trauma for all the parties involved &mdash; husbands, wives and particularly children.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party argue that effective divorce legislation must be based on a few basic principles.  First of all, there must be the availability of mediation and conciliation procedures and families must be backed up by comprehensive family support services.  We argue that irretrievable breakdown should be one of the basic grounds for divorce and that the legal process in divorce proceedings should be non-adversarial and that they should be carried out in family courts. We submit that proceedings should not apportion blame or penalise the parties involved but should be aimed at reaching as broad an agreement as possible on the issues outstanding between the parties. Most fundamentally, the interests of the children involved must be fully protected and take precedence over all other interests in such cases.</P>
    <P>Earlier today there were references to courts, court costs and solicitors' fees.  In divorce, the cost of the proceedings must not be such that ordinary people cannot avail of them.  Indeed, legal aid should be available to those who cannot afford the services of solicitors.</P>
    <P>All of the evidence from opinion polls shows that only a minority of people here are opposed to divorce in all circumstances. The most recent opinion poll strengthens this view and indicates that a significant majority are in favour of removing the constitutional ban on <Col N="461" /> divorce.  Not for the first time, the majority of our people are ahead of most Deputies in their recognition of the urgent need for action to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>It is probably true to say that the issue of divorce has been so widely debated on the report of the joint committee and on this Bill that it is difficult to find any new arguments in relation to it.  It is quite possible that many Deputies who have contributed to the debate have repeated a number of the arguments they had made previously, but people outside the House face the reality of marriage breakdown every day of the week and they have to suffer the misery of being trapped because either they cannot afford to get out of it or they have separated and formed new second relationships which in the eyes of the State are illegitimate. The children of such relationships are illegitimate and the partners in them are not treated as equal.  All these problems exist because this House has failed to tackle marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>I will repeat a point I made earlier. Unless we are prepared to face the reality that when we are talking about marriage breakdown and the right to divorce we are talking about giving people the right, if they so choose, to remarry, I would say to people who do not think we should pass a law on divorce that they do so because they believe it would be a denial of their own religious beliefs or the belief of the majority of the people of the State.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that this House does not exist to put into law the religious beliefs of any Church or to enforce the law of divorce on anyone who does not believe that he or she should avail of it. We have a responsibility, however, to make it available to the people who want it, those who have no objections, religious or otherwise, to using the procedure of divorce.  Those who do not think they can go through divorce proceedings will still have the right to avail of separation or barring orders or any other type of separation procedure available to them.  The House is not in the business of forcing religious views on our citizens; but neither should we by default force <Col N="462" /> citizens to live in a regime which directly mirrors the views of the majority Church.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with Article 41 of the Constitution, or a section of it which relates to divorce and the right to remarry.  There are many other sections of the Constitution which require amendment. They were referred to during the debate on the joint committee report. Those sections effectively treat the women of the country as second class citizens, effectively deny women the right to have a full working say in the life of a State, which treat them only as the begetters of children and nothing else, place a huge burden on them for the rearing of their children almost exclusively. In discussing this issue of divorce we are touching on part of our Constitution which in the long run should go much deeper than we have referred to in the debate on this Bill&mdash;the place of women in our society, their right to full equality not only on questions of social welfare and on labour laws but on their right to participate fully in the life of the State, their right to have the burden of rearing children shared by their spouses.  The Constitution as at present formulated does not meet that requirement.  The divorce debate should be seen as a prelude to a debate to formulate a totally new Constitution which would be relevant to the eighties.</P>

      <P>I will make my contribution as briefly and as succinctly as I can and I will structure it in the following manner.  I want to talk about the role and relevance of the Oireachtas. I will then look at the question of marital breakdown, then turn to the issue of Church and State, look at the question of social change and opinion polls and finally look at the role of my party in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This week many of us celebrated the re-emergence of democracy in the Philippines because we believe a society which is not democratic runs the risk of ultimately becoming tyrannical.  This week many of us felt that another nation had joined the family of nations which can resolve their problems by discussion, <Col N="463" /> debate and persuasion, not by aggression. This week many young people heard leaders in this and other countries praise the return of democracy to the Philippines as something positive and good.</P>
    <P>We believe a democratic State has the right and the capacity to solve problems in a humanitarian and caring way.  Many of the problems facing this country at the moment are not easily solved.  Many of the solutions to the problems which we as a Government face lie outside the territory of this State, outside the control of the Oireachtas but within the control of the cartels of international capitalism, whether it be the control of energy or other factors which a small open economy like ours cannot significantly control. But this is not one of those problems. We cannot say the EC is preventing us, that the price of oil is such that we cannot do anything to solve this problem.  We cannot turn to anybody else and say we would if we could but we are being prevented by a strong external force.</P>
    <P>I am asking Deputies &mdash; and I am glad to see that there are more and more of them &mdash; who are saying maybe, but not just yet, to recognise that the relevance of this House to the people outside this Chamber, and to the young people whom we implore not to follow the men of violence, will be enhanced only if it is seen that this House has the courage to take up this problem and try to resolve it.</P>
    <P>I have always described myself politically as a Republican Socialist and I take great pride in the struggle for independence which successive generations, including members of my own family, put into the effort to achieve independence for this state.  This generation has to earn that independence by exercising the independence which this sovereign State has and by resolving a problem which is real, which affects many people and which is totally within the power of the Oireachtas to resolve.  In line with what Deputy De Rossa has just said, I suggest that so far we have tragically failed to do that.  Thus we not only continue the difficulties and <Col N="464" /> the miseries for the many people who are caught in the problems of marital breakdown, but we are also weakening and undermining the credibility of this democratic institution.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to get elected to Leinster House and it is even more difficult to stay in it and one does not stay here unless one does clinic work.  Every Deputy and Senator will recognise that marital breakdown is not something that may nor may not occur in Ireland; marital breakdown is a reality and politically we deal with that reality every day.  This debate has gone beyond the point of asking if it is relevant.  There is not one Deputy in this House who can say that this is not a problem, whether in dealing with local authority housing, maintenance for deserted wives, and all the other work which makes up part of the daily workload of every TD.</P>
    <P>There are legal complications which get in the way of people trying to put their lives together again after the tragedy of a marital breakdown.  These legal complications continuously and effectively remind them of the tragedy they have experienced and in many cases prevent them from trying to rebuild a life for themselves and their children.  We have power in the Oireachtas to remove those legal complications.  We make the laws and we can unmake them, but in this instance we have to ask the people, through a referendum, to decide whether they will give us the freedom to deal with the reality of marital breakdown and the legal complications.  That is all we are being asked to do this evening &mdash; to vote in principle that this issue should go to the people so that the constitutional barrier to divorce legislation can be removed. We talk a lot about the rights of democracies and the great liberties that democracy confers on people, but I find it extraordinary that we do not have the collective will or the collective courage to take that small, short step.</P>
    <P>There have been numerous studies carried out since the mid-seventies, starting with the report prepared by an Attorney General, now Justice Declan Costello, <Col N="465" /> which looked at the legal problems relating to the question of marriage and marriage breakdown.  There is now a clear consensus that, in order legally to bring to an end a marriage which is long since dead, divorce is the only legal mechanism that will meet all the rational and logical requirements that a modern State requires of its citizens.  Therefore, the removal of the prohibition in the Constitution is absolutely essential.  Any suggestion that there should be recognition of the annulments of some Churches means, in effect, the Roman Catholic Church because my understanding is that none of the other major Churches in the State, the Church of Ireland, the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Baptist Church and the Jewish congregation, has provision for annulments.</P>
    <P>This has been put forward as a compromise solution which would provide a legal framework to deal with some of the problems which arise consequent on marital breakdown while at the same time not introducing divorce.  I leave it to more qualified people with legal experience to argue that case at length, but their conclusion is that it is not practicable and could not be enacted within the framework of law in this Republic.  There is a need, undoubtedly, to introduce divorce legislation so that people whose marriages have broken down and who have no desire, because of personal religious convictions to enter into a new contract, can end the contract they originally entered into in their first and perhaps only marriage.  We are preventing them from doing that at this moment.  The Catholic Church in other states, where divorce is open and available, recommend to many of their people who find themselves in a breakdown situation where they are seeking annulment, that for purposes of legal tidiness and clarity as well as easement, they should obtain a civil divorce, the rights they get and the anomalies they remove are so essential.</P>
    <P>Let me give one example that I recently had experience of.  A woman who had been deserted approximately five years previously and after struggling to rear two children, now had the opportunity <Col N="466" />&mdash; she did not go into details &mdash; of going away on a fortnight's continental holiday. In order to do so she needed a passport for herself and for her children who were under the age of majority.  In order to get the passport she had to get the consent of the father who could not be contacted. The difficulty of trying to get permission to get this passport is very hard to imagine.  Deputy Andrews, who was a former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, will be aware of the legal complexities in relation to the rights of parents and passports because he would have dealt with many such cases.  It is another nightmare that is imposed.  Just when a bit of happiness was about to arrive the tragedy of the broken marriage was again superimposed on a family who had started again.</P>
    <P>We have gone on making the case for so long in relation to the need to deal with the problem that is real and, as Deputy De Rossa said, affects 70,000 people and probably more in the State and there is no need to go any further. The figures are well known and have been well publicised by a very responsible and reasoned lobby group, The Divorce Action Group.</P>
    <P>I want to move from the question of marital breakdown to the relationship of Church and State.  The Taoiseach indicated that he wishes to consult with the Churches about this matter.  The Churches have a major role in relation to marriage laws in our society.  In effect, they administer an aspect of civil law in so far as they conduct marriage ceremonies and record marriages in whatever church or synagogue they take place, so it is proper that they should be consulted because they have a role in that sense. The Churches are perfectly entitled to put forward any views they like in relation to this matter as this is a free and open society.  As long as I have a role in public life it will be my primary responsibility to maintain it so.  Irrespective of what view any Church group may put forward on behalf of their members or as an observation of how they think society should be, I do not think that view will in any way alter the absolute logic of the position of <Col N="467" /> the necessity of getting rid of the barrier within our Constitution by having a referendum whereby the people decide if they want to enable us to deal with that problem by removing the barrier.</P>
    <P>There is an absolute necessity to make a reality, in perception terms as distinct from legal terms, of the separation of Church and State in this country for two reasons.  We need to make the dream of an Irish Republic, which sustained so many generations of unfree Irishmen and women, a reality before the end of this century.  We need to do it soon but we will only do it when we can clearly and effectively demonstrate to all the citizens of this State that this is the place where laws are made or unmade and churches are places where people go to pray and to conduct their religious beliefs with freedoms guaranteed by the Republican resolve of this assembly.  We will not be able to do it until there is a clear distinction, not in the small print, not in the appendices to the reports, but in the reality of the perception of the ordinary man and woman in the work place, in the home or in the pub, that there is a separation between the two.  That is not a very dangerous thing to be looking for and it is not putting any Irish citizen in mortal danger of whatever peril or fear worries them.  It happens in France and people are not exactly in danger there.  It happens in the United States and, if we are to believe what we read in some of the papers, half the Irish population want to go to the United States and they do not seem to be particularly worried about that there.  It happens in most of the countries which we regard as being of a standard and of a level of social and economic development that we would like to aspire to.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that what is proposed should in any way cause people to be afraid, whether they be young, old or members of religious orders.  I know there are many people throughout the country, some young but many old, who are frightened and bemused by the social change that is occurring on this island. They find many of the things that now <Col N="468" /> happen difficult to comprehend, repugnant to their set of values and something that is alien, that is coming from other places and is not part of what was good, clear and decent in the Ireland they grew up in, whose construction they contributed towards and which they would now like to retire to with a degree of comfort and ease.  I meet those people who are elderly or people who cannot understand how Dublin, which was once a safe city, is now unsafe, why there are things on television explicitly and openly that people did not even talk about ten, 15 or 20 years ago, and there is a reaction to try to block out all of this by saying: &ldquo;It should go away, we should not have any of it, we are not like that, we are different, this is a separate State and we can keep that kind of thing away.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The 70,000 Irish men, women and children we have been talking about are not aliens, they do not come in on the airwaves.  They belong here, their roots are here, they will grow up here, they will work here and they will die here. They are citizens who are proud of the independence of this Republic, anxious to make a contribution legally, with dignity and with honour.  Their numbers are not getting smaller, their pain is not getting any less and their dependence is totally in the hands of this House tonight. The Deputies will not do anything dramatic, radical or extraordinary because it will be a long road but they can send a positive signal, one they have not yet got loud enough or clear enough to make them feel that this democratic Republic might live up to its name, that this democratic State with elected politicians, whose power comes out of the ballot box and not out of the gun, can recognise problems, can discuss them, can take them in their hands, can look at them and say: &ldquo;We can solve this.  It will be difficult, it will offend, it may hurt, it will cause controversy but if it is a problem which exists within the State and affects so many people it is one that should be resolved.  We will take the first step to try to resolve it by voting in the Oireachtas for a referendum to enable divorce legislation to be enacted.&rdquo;  The <Col N="469" /> fears of all the people who are worried about change who are worried about what will happen to the family, are very legitimate and very righteous fears but I believe they can be properly and competently accommodated.</P>
    <P>The House might ask why it is that a party which is part of the Government &mdash; a Government which has a Joint Programme for Government which, as Deputy Nora Owen said, contained a commitment to establish the Committee on Marriage Breakdown &mdash; are in a position this evening, at the end of nearly six hours of Private Members' debating time, to move a Bill of this kind.  This question has been asked and should be answered.  There are two parties to this Government, both with their distinctive identities, with their own sets of policies, with freedom to take action outside the joint agreement for Government which both sides have honoured.  The Labour Party were the first party to propose reform in this area; I recall being in this House between 1977 and 1981 when we had a debate on this very same topic within this very same time slot.  We have consistently proposed reform in this area, and we will get more votes this evening than we got on that former occasion.  I welcome that slow but steady advance.  I should like to think there would be more.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that there is still plenty of time for those numbers to be increased. But the Labour Party role, of which I am proud, is as it has always been, to be in the forefront of advocating social change on logical grounds, because the necessity for that change is self-evident as far as we are concerned, in terms of the ordinary rank and file members who make up our party, or of the specialist groups within it, such as the Labour Women's National Council, the Labour Lawyers' Group, or any of the other component parts of the party which together have developed, from listening on the ground, a response that meets the requirements of a rational and adult national republican Parliament like this.</P>
    <P>We decided to bring forward this Bill <Col N="470" /> at this stage because we feel that this issue should be advanced as quickly as possible.  As Deputy Taylor said in his opening remarks, there is no contradiction in having consultations.  It should be remembered that consultations form the bedrock of any democracy.  There is no contradiction between, on the one hand, having consultations and, on the other, making progress, bearing in mind the procedural steps involved between voting positively in favour of this Bill this evening, going through the mechanics of a referendum and finally enacting divorce legislation on to our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I know there are other Deputies who wish to contribute to this debate.  The last point I want to make is for those people who are genuinely worried that the fabric of Irish society will collapse should legal change be effected.  I would remind them that such Catholic and cultural traditions, such Catholic societies as those in Spain, Portugal and Italy, with whom we have many connections and affinities, did not experience such an overall collapse in the fabric of their societies that many people predicted when they introduced the necessary legislation after a long debate and similar arguments.</P>
    <P>I would address my last remark to that constituency which perhaps is so large that it inhibits the political freedom of many Deputies in this House, that that constituency can be reassured by what has happened in other neighbouring European states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in this debate this evening albeit for a few short minutes. There is no point in any of us here congratulating ourselves in regard to the courage we have shown on this and other social matters.  On all sides of this House we have shirked our responsibilities and swept this and other difficult social issues under the carpet.  I have no doubt that if there were a secret vote in this House this evening this Bill would be carried by an overwhelming majority of perhaps up to 70 per cent.  Unfortunately we will not have a vote of that kind.  Instead, we will have what one party described as <Col N="471" /> a genuinely free vote, to which Deputy Owen referred earlier.  If it is a genuinely free vote within the Fine Gael Party, am I to believe that there will be no more than a mere dozen Fine Gael Deputies who will vote in favour of this Bill this evening?  Surely a party who for quite some time have had as a matter of policy the introduction of divorce legislation in this country can come up with a higher figure than 12?  Equally, in relation to the major Opposition party, are we to hear that all the Deputies in that party are to be whipped into abstention?  I know that in the Fianna Fáil Party in this House there are many Deputies who believe that divorce is necessary and that a referendum should be held.  I would have wished that we could have had a genuinely free vote so that those Deputies could express their wishes this evening in a formal way.</P>
      <P>Last week when speaking on this issue their Front Bench spokesman, Deputy Woods, said that the Fianna Fáil Party were not against the holding of a referendum. If they are not, then the only way we can have a referendum is by their supporting this Bill this evening.  One of Deputy Woods' reservations in relation to this Bill was that he felt that if it went through foreign divorces, as we know them here, would no longer be recognised. For some people in Ireland it is all right to have a divorce once it takes place abroad but we must never touch it here.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the kind of politics that have been engaged in in this country, particularly in this House in recent years on these difficult social issues, does no credit to any of us.  I had the privilege to sit for 18 months on the all-party Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  With the exception of the two Labour Party members and an Independent Senator, Senator Catherine McGuinness, none of the other members was in favour of that committee taking a decision in principle in favour of divorce.  We fudged the issue, we put it back again.  This evening it looks as if we, the politicians, will fudge it one more time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I came into this House this evening <Col N="472" /> I saw people outside with placards urging us to cop on to ourselves, to handle this difficult social issue.  There is no Deputy on any side of this House who is not aware that marriage breakdown constitutes the major social problem in Ireland today. Divorce is not pleasant but it is necessary. If we want to fulfil our responsibilities, to show leadership, if we want to build a real Republic, if we want to convince those people in Northern Ireland to whom we preach so often about joining us, then we are afforded an opportunity this evening to show them that we really mean what we say.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have maintained that legislation affects the quality of marriage and so on.  Divorce is freely available in Northern Ireland.  Can anybody suggest that the quality of marriage in the North of Ireland is any less than the quality of marriage in the South?  In so far as there are statistics available the indications are that there is a lesser degree of marriage breakdown north of the Border than there is in the South.</P>
    <P>I believe that the consultations which the Taoiseach announced he wishes to engage in are no bad thing in themselves. Consultation is always a good thing.  But I might remind the Taoiseach that the all-party committee consulted with all the Churches in this country.  With the exception of one of the minority Churches and the majority Church, the Catholic Church, the other Churches were in favour of us proceeding along the road and introducing divorce legislation here as a civil right.  When the Taoiseach talks about consultation he talks about consultation with the majority Church.  That is no bad thing.  I do not want to see a repeat of the bitter and divisive debate we have had in recent years.  Those consultations can well take place side by side with this House endeavouring to come to terms with a formula to put before the people so that we can have divorce legislation some time in the next 18 months, or whenever.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is beaten this evening I doubt very much if this Dáil will be given an opportunity within the next couple of years of voting on the issue again.  We <Col N="473" /> are using it as a delaying tactic.  We are copping out, we are failing to honour our responsibilities, to show that we have the leadership and courage required to tackle this difficult social issue.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay much longer.  I know I had only seven minutes or so.  I see my constituency colleague, Deputy M. O'Leary waiting.  I should like to congratulate him in that he introduced a Bill on his own some time before Christmas. Indeed had he not done so we might not have had the opportunity here this evening of discussing this matter.  In our law we recognise that marriages break down.  We have barring orders, provision for deserted wives, maintenance clauses by way of court procedures and so on.  In all aspect of Irish law we recognise the fact, the reality that marriages are breaking down.  Surely we can go one step further.  We can be honest with ourselves and allow the people of this country an opportunity to vote on this matter in the next few weeks so that we as politicians can frame the necessary legislation that will ensure that the people, as a civil right, have this tragedy recognised.  They should be allowed to live within the law and not be asked to continue to live in a legal limbo.</P>

      <P>My intervention will be brief.  Obviously one cannot go into the merits of the case. I put my views on record in the discussion on the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I take this opportunity to deal with one net point arising from a question which the proposer of the Bill, Deputy Taylor, put to me.  He said, &ldquo;Why will you not support this Bill? Did you not say that you were in favour of an early referendum?&rdquo; I did, but I said I was in favour of an early referendum in the context of legislation on this subject. It is no longer a question of asking the people to say yes or no to the removal of <Col N="474" /> a constitutional ban.  What is involved is asking the people to say yes or no to the introduction of divorce legislation. Everyone knows that the removal of the constitutional ban will lead to the introduction of divorce.  Consequently, if the people are to give a balanced judgment on this question they must know in advance of the referendum what type of legislation will follow on the removal of the ban.  Anything short of that would be to perpetrate not quite a confidence trick on the people but could seriously mislead and misrepresent the final result of that referendum.  I am in favour of an early referendum provided it is made very clear to the people what sort of legislation would follow if the constitutional ban were removed.  The type of legislation proposed, and this is where we would have difficulty in agreeing on a formula, would obviously be of immense relevance to the electorate in deciding whether or not to remove the constitutional ban. That is why I feel I have to intervene in order to indicate why I am not supporting this measure, because it is merely asking for the removal of the constitutional ban without telling the people what legislation will follow.</P>

      <P>I support this measure but not on the basis that I agree with the drafting of it because there are defects in the drafting.  We have a safer majority and it would be more satisfactory to have a permanent veto through a referendum for any further changes that might be contemplated in this area in the future. In other words the legislation which I drafted in October and the legislation which I hope comes about if this Bill survives tonight will give back to the people their right to live as they choose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is having consultations with the various Churches, which is a good thing.  I ask my Fine Gael colleagues not to refrain in their vote tonight for this measure simply because these consultations are taking place.  Nobody expects the Taoiseach to reverse the decision of the Council of Trent.  We think it is perfectly correct that he should consult with the Churches.  We are all aware that the <Col N="475" /> church to which most of us belong has a settled view on the matter of divorce.  To be fair to them, it is umambiguously set forth in the New Testament.  We can all say, after the Vatican Council reports, that the position of a legislator who happens to be a Catholic is at last established. It was confirmed in the Forum Report, and legislators do not have to wait for the say so of any set of bishops before they set forth in good conscience to make legislation.  I say to those Fine Gael Deputies who are refraining from voting for this measure tonight that they should not hesitate to vote for it.  We can change this Bill at a later stage.  There is much more support for this measure tonight than there was for my measure last October.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to begin these remarks with an appeal directed at all Members of this House, irrespective of their political affiliation.  I want to appeal to those who believe that there are antiquated provisions in our Constitution, under a number of headings.  I want to appeal to those who believe the time for changing these provisions is now and who have said so many times.  I want to appeal to all who have encountered marital breakdown and its effects, in their own families, among their friends, and among the constituents they try to help on a daily basis.  I want to appeal to all Members who have witnessed family violence or who have tried to help its victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe also that I should appeal to all the Members of this House who believe in the sanctity of marriage and to all those who believe that the efforts of <Col N="476" /> the State should be directed at supporting the family.</P>
    <P>What I am appealing for is support, support for a measure that will have the effect of offering the Irish people the right to make the final choice on this question.  This is not a Bill to provide divorce in Ireland.  It goes no further than specifying a number of parameters, all of which it is proposed to write into the Constitution, within which the Oireachtas would have the power to legislate as it thought necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Woods, in replying to the opening speech in this debate of Deputy Mervyn Taylor, described the Bill as a vehicle for the introduction of divorce on demand.  Such a statement proves only that Deputy Woods has not read the Bill.  The safeguards written into our Bill are more than adequate to ensure that this will never be a jurisdiction in which divorce on demand is possible.  It would not even be possible for the Oireachtas to legislate for divorce on demand if the changes we propose to the Constitution are adopted.  Such a suggestion amounts to little more than a silly slur on our courts.  But it also misses the whole point of the position the Labour Party have adopted in this debate.  We have said, again and again, that there may be Deputies in this House who have anxieties and reservations about the number and validity of the safeguards we have provided.  For such Deputies, there could be no better opportunity to improve the choice offered to the people than the special committee which would be established if this Bill were to pass Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I would particularly appeal to those Fianna Fáil Deputies who must be becoming increasingly concerned at the posturing of their party in relation to social issues.  It is not a legitimate position to adopt, whenever the happiness and welfare of people is at stake, to seek always to be on the winning side, to seek always opportunities of creating political embarrassment for others.  Yet that seems to be the only position that Fianna Fáil are capable of and it has resulted in <Col N="477" /> an appalling history of fence-sitting and inactivity in these critical areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, speaking in support of the Bill, stressed that the committee referred to should be a committee of the whole House.  We would welcome such a decision and would co-operate fully in the work of that committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes, speaking in his capacity as Minister for Justice, made the point that the Bill was not timely.  I should perhaps mention that although Deputy Dukes may have been putting forward a view on behalf of his Department, he was not putting forward the settled view of the Government, since, as is well known, the Government have not taken any decision on this matter.</P>
    <P>I find it baffling that anyone can seriously argue that this Bill is untimely, either in terms of the merits of the Bill, or in terms of the need to carry out any consultations with interested parties.  We have made it plain that it is not our intention or wish to pre-empt any such consultations. Rather, it is our view that those consultations, especially if they were carried out in the full light of day, would make a beneficial contribution to the debate one would expect in a committee. A decision in principle by this House on Second Stage, which would be tantamount to a decision that legislation was necessary would, in turn, enable any external consultation to take place against a concrete, rather than an abstract, background.</P>
    <P>It is possible to get the impression sometimes that the argument about timeliness can be a recipe for paralysis.  We have a number of social issues in this country, all of them serious, and around which there appears to be the same sort of consensus &mdash; a consensus which can be summed up by saying: &ldquo;We are all in favour of change, but not just yet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For instance, where the question of capital punishment is concerned, nobody has been hanged in this country for 30 years.  There is a political consensus that we should not use this barbarous form of punishment, and still we retain a law providing for hanging sentences.  The only consequence is that once, maybe <Col N="478" /> twice, in the lifetime of a Government, the 15 members of the Cabinet have to engage in the incongruous exercise of deciding whether or not to recommend to the President that somebody should be hanged.  The only reason this law has survived so long is that no one ever seems to be able to suggest a right time to change it.  How long more should we listen to that argument?</P>
    <P>In regard to another issue, the question of racial hatred, it is a fact that there are organisations in this country which produce material, mostly for export to Britain, which has contributed in its own way to racial and anti-semitic hatred in that country.  You would imagine that a country like ours, which has suffered its share of persecution over the years, would be moved to put a stop to such filth.  Again the argument about timeliness raises its head &mdash; in a society which retains the right to ban books on sex education, this argument surely becomes more grotesque by the day.</P>
    <P>I said earlier I found it difficult to understand this question of timeliness, in so far as it referred to the merits of the Labour Party Bill.  We all know &mdash; everyone in this House knows &mdash; about the thousands of women who live in fear of violence in the home, and about the thousands of children who have been brutalised in situations of extreme family tension.</P>
    <P>The report of the Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown, a report which has been debated extensively in this House and elsewhere, is quite clear on this point.  They accepted, in chapter 5, that:</P>
    <P>... the social and emotional costs of broken marriages are high...increasingly associated with physical and psychiatric disorders, of which depression is the most commonly cited...long term effects for children of broken marriages include increased risk of delinquency and of disruption in their own marriage.</P>
    <P>Expert submissions such as the one I have quoted really only validate our own <Col N="479" /> experience, both as legislators and as constituency representatives.  That experience shows us, in a way that none of us can deny, that marital breakdown is neither a middle-class nor a working-class phenomenon; it is not confined to urban or rural areas; its causes are not simple or easily addressed.  That experience shows us too that marital breakdown is not any longer the problem of a small minority &mdash; it is a real, growing and urgent problem.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of the present situation, and everyone here has had experience of it, is the huge and growing number of relationships being formed which are in many cases long, loving, and stable relationships, but are nevertheless outside the law.</P>
    <P>This has a number of effects; it gives rise to enormous problems for the children of such relationships; it generates extreme difficulty for dependent spouses, particularly in the case of the death of the other spouse.  The laws relating to illegitimacy, property rights, and succession all bear heavily on such relationships.</P>
    <P>Above all, the number of such relationships, the difficulties they encounter, and the fact that the number continues to grow despite these difficulties &mdash; all of these factors contribute to a widespread feeling that our present laws are in disrepute, and that this Oireachtas ought to be capable of legislating for reality.  We would all like to think that we can legislate to maintain things as we like them but the world is changing around us, and if we lose the ability to face that fact, we will lose our relevance.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the remarks of the Archbishop of Dublin in relation to this issue in his recent Lenten pastoral. Nobody in this House would disagree with the emphasis he places on proper preparation for marriage.  Nobody would disagree with the list of factors he adduces which lead, almost certainly, to subsequent marital stress, including heavy drinking or gambling, drug addiction, crime, violence, infidelity, tantrums, jealousy, and psychiatric history. <Col N="480" /> Nobody would disagree with his recognition of the economic pressures that can impose an intolerable strain, including unemployment, low income, and inadequate housing.</P>
    <P>It is a fact, though, that there are thousands of marriages where a variety of these stresses exist.  It is a fact that our capacity to learn from the mistakes of the past &mdash; and there are many recommendations in the Oireachtas report that suggest we have that capacity &mdash; will not be of any relief to those who are trapped now. Yes, we do need action to ensure that people are not marrying too young.  We need change to facilitate and encourage the task of proper preparation.  We need proper counselling, advice and help for those who are under stress.  But we must also face the reality that the only help we can offer to many is the possibility of a fresh start.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that in our present laws we can offer virtually everything else, albeit at a price.  It is possible, in a variety of ways, to declare a marriage legally dead.  But our laws stop short of the next logical step.  The Church of Ireland put this well in their submission to the Oireachtas committee.  They said:</P>
    <P>The existing machinery suffers from the defect that it deals only with matters which, important and vital though they may be, are only ancillary to the root problem, that of status.  Persons whose marriages have broken down and who have struggled through the complex legal machinery find themselves substantially poorer but without the one remedy which they really want, namely the freedom to remarry.</P>
    <P>This view is reinforced by the submission of the Presbyterian Church, who said:</P>
    <P>... we hold that blanket prohibition of divorce is also the cause of serious abuse, much personal suffering, and grave social injustice. Attempts to suppress recognition of this situation do nothing to promote well-ordered marriage and family life.</P>
    <P>Thus, the nub of the issue &mdash; the real issue in this debate &mdash; is the right to <Col N="481" /> remarry.  There is a real, pressing, and entirely legitimate demand for this right. It exists in most of the world, and it exists in societies where the family is valued, and where religious practice and belief are deeply rooted.</P>
    <P>There will no doubt be a temptation to mollify this demand rather than to meet it.  Such an approach would bring forward legislation on a wide front &mdash; to provide counselling and mediation services, to rationalise the position in relation to foreign divorces, to improve the law as it relates to nullity, to address the issues of illegitimacy and joint property rights.</P>
    <P>All of this is necessary, but there is a real danger that it could be seen as an adequate substitute for addressing the most important issue.  We do not want, and cannot afford, a situation where by manipulating the existing legal framework, we end up effectively with divorce for the rich.  Neither can we afford the accusation that we have shirked the issue.</P>
    <P>The Religious Society of Friends, in their submission to the Oireachtas committee, made the point that while they would welcome a change in the constitutional position, they felt strongly that divorce must always be seen as the last resort.</P>
    <P>I feel the same way.  Again and again since the first time I made a lengthy public statement on this issue I have emphasised the view of the Labour Party that any divorce law must be based on the concept of irretrievable breakdown.  In 1983 I said:</P>
    <P>In different societies, consideration of the question of irretrievable breakdown has given rise to examination of <Col N="482" /> the grounds which constitute such a breakdown.  One common thread lies in the question of separation.  Depending on the country, periods of separation ranging from one year to six or seven years, are recognised as establishing adequate grounds for claiming irretrievable breakdown.</P>
    <P>One of the attractions of an approach such as this is that it removes from contention the issue of who is at fault.  Like many of the organisations which made submissions to the Oireachtas committee I consider this of extreme importance.</P>
    <P>The view is best summed up by the Law Centre Solicitors, in their submission:</P>
    <P>A matrimonial breakdown is the failure of a relationship between spouses. Both spouses are responsible to various degrees.  The law should reflect this and not try to assign fault and make orders as rewards for good behaviour.</P>
    <P>It is important that we all understand what the consequences of a referendum would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Annual Report of the Ombudsman for the year ended 31 December 1984.</P>
      <P>When the Office of the Ombudsman was established it was widely regarded as a major development in Irish public administration.  A cheap and effective appeals mechanism was made available to citizens which they could turn to in their dealings with the bureaucracy.  It is particularly interesting, therefore, to have the opportunity to examine and discuss the outcome of the first year of operation of this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service I welcome the publication of this, the first annual report of the Ombudsman.  The report indicates that the office has made a big impact in the relatively short period since it was established.  During the first 12 months over 2,000 complaints were received <Col N="485" /> from all over the country.  This high volume of complaints alone clearly underlines the need for the office.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if the House had had an opportunity of discussing this report for the year 1984 before now, even though I am aware that it was debated in the Seanad some months ago.  Regrettably, pressures of other legislative business in the House precluded an earlier debate.  However, every effort will be made to ensure that, in future years, the Ombudsman's reports can be debated within a reasonable time after their publication.</P>
    <P>The report raises many issues both of a general and specific nature.  It would be impossible, in the limited time available, to comment on all aspects.  I would, however, like to address some of the main issues contained in it.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has highlighted a number of areas where he feels it is desirable that legislation should be reviewed. This must be a prime concern to all of us in this House in our capacity as legislators.</P>
    <P>The All-Party Informal Committee on Administrative Justice felt that one of the main functions of the Ombudsman should be to review, through the examination of complaints, the operation and execution of the legislative provisions enacted by the Oireachtas.  Furthermore, the all-party committee envisaged that the Ombudsman, in the discharge of his functions, would bring to the attention of the Oireachtas those areas in which the rights of the citizen could be safeguarded by the amendment of legislation.  Therefore, the identification in the report of areas of legislation which might be reviewed will be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on these anomalies.  The comments of the Ombudsman on these matters have been brought to the attention of the Government, who have agreed that each Minister concerned should examine carefully the cost of removing the anomalies and, in so far as it is possible to do so within the resources available, take appropriate action to remove them.</P>
    <P>Remedial action has already been <Col N="486" /> taken in some cases.  Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1985 has removed the tax anomaly referred to by the Ombudsman. The recommendations for changes in certain statutory dates affecting the valuation of property have been implemented and the rating authorities have been requested to ensure that all persons affected by proposed revisions in valuation are notified individually.  They will also be informed of their right to appeal against the revised valuation.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has also expressed concern at what he calls &ldquo;antiquated law&rdquo;.  The particular matter at issue refers to a situation where a private householder can be liable for repairing part of a water pipe serving his house which is outside his property, even though damage may have been caused by factors outside his control such as heavy traffic on a road.  The Minister for the Environment intends to include provision in forthcoming legislation to confer a new general power on local authorities to assume responsibility for repairs in such cases.</P>
    <P>Possible remedies to some of the remaining anomalies will require serious examination.  This is illustrated by a number of cases in the social welfare area to which the Ombudsman has drawn attention.</P>
    <P>On the question of social insurance, the Ombudsman considers that the conditions to qualify for the old age contributory pension are inequitable whereby persons who had paid more for social insurance stamps should get fewer benefits than those who paid less.  This anomaly raises many complex issues, not the least of which relates to the Exchequer financing involved, which has been estimated at £50 million in 1987 terms. There is also the case of deserted husbands who may get substantially less by way of social welfare assistance than deserted wives in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>The problems regarding old age contributory pension and the deserted husband are being examined by the Commission on Social Welfare and the position will be reviewed in the light of the commission's recommendations.  I know that Deputies will readily agree <Col N="487" /> that any attempt to sort out these problems must avoid the creation of new anomalies or further inconsistencies for other groups.</P>
    <P>The whole question of payment of unemployment benefit during trade disputes and the role of the Social Welfare Tribunal is under consideration by the Department of Social Welfare at present.  Any legislative changes necessary will be made when this examination is completed.</P>
    <P>The law of domicile can affect claims for widows' pensions under the Social Welfare Acts.  The Ombudsman has suggested that the rule of law under which a married woman takes the domicile of her husband should be changed.  The recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on the question of domicile have been examined by the Minister for Justice and he has recently introduced legislation to abolish the domicile of dependency of married women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have produced a Bill which I understand is far more technically correct to deal with the problem.  The Ombudsman received several complaints that delayed payments of money by Government Departments were less than the current value on the date the money was due.  This situation is of particular concern to the more needy members in our society.  This question of delayed payments was raised by many of the speakers in the other House during the debate on the Ombudsman's report. The Government are concerned about all the anomalies highlighted by the Ombudsman in his report.  They are particularly concerned about unnecessary delay on the part of various Government Departments, particularly when such delay results in real hardship for members of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the question of introducing legislation to provide for the payment of interest by the State has wider implications than just the social welfare <Col N="488" /> area.  I am taking the matter up with the Departments involved but I would have to say that any solution will have to be found within the present financial constraints. Personally, for the future, I am even more committed to the ideal solution, which is to ensure that there are no avoidable delays which could give rise to this kind of hardship.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in the White Paper, <i>Serving the Country Better,</i> will, I am sure, lead to an improved delivery of services to the public.  In particular, improved use of technology and modern management techniques must be key elements in any sustained programme aimed at tackling reduction in delays.  A reduced work-load for the Ombudsman will be the real testament to the success of these reforms.</P>
    <P>Turning then to other aspects of the report, it was very interesting to note that the complaints came from every county and from people in all walks of life.  This clearly indicates that people in general are fully aware of the existence of the office and of the confidence of the people in the office.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the Seanad, one Senator suggested that were he to conduct a poll of his neighbours and constituents he felt that a large number of them would not be aware of the role or functions of the Ombudsman and that some of them might not be sure of his existence.  I do not believe that there is such a low level of awareness of the existence of the Ombudsman's office.</P>
    <P>There was quite a lot of publicity attached to the establishment of the office. I know that the Ombudsman regularly avails of invitations to speak at various public functions in different parts of the country and to speak on radio and television.</P>
    <P>Since the extension of his remit on 1 April last there has been an increased level of publicity associated with the office.  The Ombudsman has begun a series of visits to towns in various parts of Ireland.  It is intended that these visits will be a regular feature.  On these occasions members of the public, who have an unresolved complaint against certain <Col N="489" /> public bodies, are able to meet with the staff of the Ombudsman's office to have their complaints examined.</P>
    <P>As part of the arrangements for these visits, temporary offices for the Ombudsman's staff are established in local hotels.  Posters advertising the visits are displayed in post offices, libraries, community welfare offices, tax offices, employment offices and other public offices.  Advertisements are placed in the local papers.  Where possible, interviews are held with local journalists to ensure adequate advance coverage of the visit. Members of the public are invited to call to the hotel to meet the Ombudsman's staff.</P>
    <P>To date, the Ombudsman's staff have visited Navan, Monaghan, Dundalk, Limerick, Ennis, Longford, Mullingar, Cork city, Carrick-on-Shannon and Cavan town.  Other areas will be visited in the near future.</P>
    <P>Experience to date has shown that these visits are well worthwhile and beneficial to all concerned.  First, there has been a steady stream of callers to each of the centres indicating a clear demand for this service.  Secondly, it has been found to date that few, if any, of the complainants interviewed would have been prepared to go to Dublin.  They would not have put their complaint on paper, generally because they felt that their complaint was too complex and that they were unable to commit all the details to paper.  I should say, of course, that expenses of those required to travel distances in connection with investigations by the Ombudsman may be recouped.</P>
    <P>There is one further feature of the report which is of particular concern.  The Ombudsman reported that some senior civil servants resented his intrusion, particularly when their decisions were under scrutiny.  He also reported that there were legal challenges to his authority which seemed to be more concerned with preventing an investigation into particular complaints than the question of whether the complaints were justified. As Deputies will be aware, the Ombudsman's role is purely to investigate and report.  His importance lies in <Col N="490" /> his power to investigate the actions of administrators and to report on those to the Oireachtas.  Therefore, the efficient discharge of the Ombudsman's role depends, to a large extent, on the co-operation he receives from public servants.</P>
    <P>My Department issued guidelines to all Departments before the office of the Ombudsman was established.  These guidelines set out the procedures to be followed during the investigation of complaints by the Ombudsman and his staff. Therefore, every civil servant must have been aware of the fact that he or she was expected to co-operate fully with the Ombudsman and his staff.</P>
    <P>Without the co-operation of civil servants, the Ombudsman would not have been able to function as effectively as he did in his first year.  Like the Ombudsman, I would take a very serious view of any deliberate reluctance to co-operate with the scrutineer of the Oireachtas.  I imagine it was inevitable that, when a new institution such as the office of the Ombudsman was established, there would be a period of tentativeness, even defensiveness and a testing of legal positions. The initial learning period is over and I would hope and expect to be able to report to this House on future occasions that the Ombudsman is satisfied with the level of co-operation he is getting.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that some Deputies experienced delays in getting replies from Bord Telecom Éireann through the Ombudsman's office.  I am glad to say that the company were in touch with the Ombudsman some time ago and the board took special measures to recover the situation.  The Ombudsman considers that these measures have improved the situation significantly.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I mentioned the high volume of complaints received by the Ombudsman during his first year in office.  The vast majority of these complaints were dealt with during the year. This reflects great credit on the Ombudsman and his staff for the efficient manner in which they have discharged their duties.  It also provides us with optimism <Col N="491" /> for the future of the office.  I am confident that the future of the office will be successful both for the Ombudsman and his staff and, most of all, for the ordinary man in the street whom it was primarily established to assist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service.  I have no doubt that his term of office will be a little less difficult than his last job because then he had to go to all ends of the world. Now he will be sent all over Ireland but he will be at home, and I am sure he will be glad of that.</P>
      <P>Since the Ombudsman Bill first came before the House there has been all-party agreement in regard to the establishment of the post.  All Members for a number of years saw the need for this post.  Fianna Fáil took the initiative in this matter and tried extremely hard to get it through the House, particularly Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and Deputy Calleary, when they held the offices now held by Deputies Quinn and O'Keeffe: they spent much of their time with departmental officers trying to structure this very important post and to make it meaningful for the people.  Though it is late to be debating the 1984 Ombudsman's report, it is well that we have it before us.  In recent times we have had three or four debates on the Ombudsman's office, particularly during the passage of the Bill last April to extend his remit.</P>
      <P>We on this side greatly appreciate what the Ombudsman and his staff have been doing in highlighting so many anomalies in Irish law.  If the report does nothing more that highlight for legislators the many anomalies that exist in our laws, and have existed for decades, it will have served a useful purpose.  Many of these anomalies tended to remain in the different Departments until the next piece of comprehensive legislation was enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Minister's statement tonight, and the highlighting of the many anomalies that exist, the Departments have been put on notice that these things <Col N="492" /> must be looked at.  It is the job of the Opposition from now on to force Ministers to take action on certain matters referred to by the Ombudsman.  There would be no point in having an Ombudsman with an increased staff and having his reports debated here if his conclusions were not acted on.  I ask the Minister of State to take this matter extremely seriously.  His colleagues in the Cabinet must be forced to take this matter seriously, and I am sure the Minister for the Public Service will be anxious to co-operate. Unless all Ministers take the contents of the report seriously, it will become just another annual report like those of various committees and commissions which will find its way into the libraries of various Departments.  We have too many such reports and commissions and studies.</P>
    <P>In his relatively short time before the next general election, the Minister would do well to try to ensure that the contents of the 1984 and 1985 reports will be implemented by way of legislation.  There is no reason on earth why a small Bill making the suggested amendments could not be brought before the House.  Whoever is in Opposition will be glad to agree with legislation that would remedy clear anomalies in law which have been causing hardship to people.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a social welfare consolidation committee in 1981.  We tried to correct anomalies that arose before I was born in the forties because no comprehensive piece of legislation in this field had been brought in.  Various anomalies in social welfare law had been changed, but not properly.  Recommendations on budgets over 30 years were never followed through.  Mr. Mills and his staff will be coming up continually with recommendations and it will be well if they are highlighted.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to some of them on which action has been taken, like the law of domicile and the tax anomalies, delayed payments, the valuation of property and antiquated laws.  Some of the remedies suggested have not yet taken place.  In regard to antiquated law, local <Col N="493" /> authorities are still taking the line they took before the matter was highlighted. I am sure a circular from the Department of the Environment would help.</P>
    <P>I had one case about water pipes which I submitted to the Ombudsman, and to which he referred in his report last year. Water pipes and sewerage pipes throughout this and other cities are continuously damaged by people engaged in road works and laying telephone cables and new Dublin Gas pipes.  Old people are being intimidated by water work departments and others to pay substantial costs because some ancient law states that there is a responsibility on the householder to fix everything from the main pipe to the stopcock.  This continually arises in the older parts of Dublin, and I was delighted that the Ombudsman pointed it out.  Unfortunately, it is not being treated urgently, has not been dealt with in the Housing Bill before the Dáil or referred to in speeches by the Minister for the Environment.  Perhaps Deputy Boland who was responsible for introducing the Ombudsman legislation will have the same concern as the Minister for the Environment, in regard to implementing some of the suggestions in the report.</P>
    <P>One of the major recommendations of the Ombudsman is in regard to social insurance.  He has made a number of speeches throughout the country referring to the law which prevents people who had contributed to insurance stamps from getting contributory old age pensions. The report points out the inequity of people who had paid more in social insurance contributions getting less benefit than those who had paid less, because the deciding factor was the number of years from 1953.  I knew that once that was highlighted the answer from the Social Welfare Commission would be scarcity of money.  Here is a clear anomaly in our social legislation. Thousands of citizens are being victimised and being treated unfairly because of bad information given to them in 1953 when they did not become voluntary insurers or were in employments that did not encourage it.  They are now in a worse position than if they had only started <Col N="494" /> work in 1960.  The Government must be seen to amend that unjust, inequitable situation which has created hardship for many of our senior citizens.</P>
    <P>There is not a Deputy here who has not come across it, or a group dealing with the elderly who have not pointed it out.  It is more than a year since the Ombudsman referred to this.  There has been a Social Welfare Bill in the meantime and there will be another soon, but I gather from what the Minister said tonight that this anomaly will not be remedied in it.  The job of the Social Welfare Commission is to streamline and rationalise other things. It is not necessary to have a commission to deal with this.  I will raise this on the Social Welfare Bill.  If this anomaly is costing people £50 million, why is it necessary to raise it here?</P>
    <P>Nine months ago I asked the Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring, about this and he said action would be taken in the next Social Welfare Bill.  Is it a question of the Government making a U-turn so far as the Ombudsman's report is concerned, ignoring what the Minister, Deputy Boland, said and not implementing any of these recommendations? Everytime the Ombudsman highlights something we are told nothing can be done because it might upset somebody, it might create problems for the computer or it might cost money and so on.  If no account is taken of any of these recommendations, there is no point in having an Ombudsman.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment tonight that action will be taken on the Ombudsman's recommendations because unless some action is taken the Government will lose credibility and I will have to reconsider the co-operation I have been giving over the past 18 months.  I ask the Minister not to give a silly answer but to take my comments seriously.</P>
    <P>When the Ombudsman was appointed I met him and the Minister, Deputy Boland, and we discussed a number of matters which I thought his office could deal with, but which are still outstanding. Very few proposals in the White Paper will be implemented in the foreseeable <Col N="495" /> future.  As regards information and communications I believe this is an area where the Ombudsman could make some contribution.  I have been speaking about this for some time but the Minister did not then have responsibility for that area. I believe that in every city, be it Dublin, Cork, Limerick or anywhere else, every person should be able to go to a Government office and to senior civil servants &mdash; dressed in a manner proper to a receptionist and not as many of these people are dressed nowadays, in rag order &mdash; for advice.  If he has a letter full of legalistic jargon these senior civil servants should be able to explain it to him, tell him if he is in the right Department, what the letter means and what action needs to be taken. Sometimes a phone call would solve the problem.  If a person has a social welfare problem, he can go to Oisin House.  He may then be sent to Pearse Street, then O'Connell Street and then he is told he has to go to Lord Edward Street because of a tax problem.  Old people are harassed and harangued by people who are not over paid but who are well paid by the State.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why we cannot have a proper information centre staffed by senior people.  I have the greatest regard for civil servants.  I think they are great.  Their loyalty and commitment to the State and to different Governments is unbelievable, but it must be said that some of these people drive old people mad, send them from Billy to Jack, because they do not care a damn if it is raining or snowing and they are not committed to trying to help people.  I have said this many times before.  There is a very high proportion of people serving on these counters who are completely disinterested in helping others.  If they were trying to sell a service, the company would be in liquidation, but because they are in safe jobs they do not seem to have any interest in helping others.  Most of these offices are in my constituency and I usually drop in for information, but once you meet a knowledgeable, helpful and efficient person, he or she is transferred and a young person is put in their <Col N="496" /> place who does not understand the problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister will make himself a hero and will go down in history if he establishes one information office, staffed by senior civil servants, which would open through lunch hour and would not close at 5 p.m.  These senior people could be a great help to old people and those who are not as knowledgeable as they are. The Ombudsman has pointed this out on numerous occasions.  The Minister, Deputy Boland, spoke about this <i>ad nauseam</i> but left office before he did anything. I am sure it will not be easy to do what I am asking.  The Minister will be told there is no difficulty because anyone who calls in with a problem will be helped.  It is not easy to talk to somebody serving behind a hatch which often looks like a cage in the zoo.  About a year ago some of my colleagues and I went to have a look at some Government Departments and found that this was so, although some improvements have been made since. Having named rather than nameless people dealing with the public is a great help because it makes these civil servants take responsibility for their actions in case people have complaints.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there are some people in the Departments who are bored to tears with their jobs but who would be excellent in dealing with the public. Perhaps the Minister would call on his able officials in the Department of the Public Service and tell them to set up a centrally located information office dealing with tax and social welfare problems. This would be a great boon.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the lobby for deserted wives but there is an organisation lobbying very hard to get rid of the anomalies in the social welfare system as it affects deserted husbands.  These people are worthy of help.  I am also very interested in trade disputes.  I assume they come under the reform of industrial relations, the right to strike, immunity and so on.  These are ongoing issues and do not necessarily have to be handled immediately but they are extremely important.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have an opportunity to <Col N="497" /> debate this report.  I appreciate that the Whips were not able to have it discussed earlier, but there is still time for the major social welfare anomalies to be corrected. Hopefully the next Ombudsman report will not be just a litany of his achievements. I commend the Department and those responsible for the changes which have been taking place.  I know they will admit that by having a Bill on the law of domicile we in Opposition have highlighted these matters and helped in this area.</P>
    <P>The role of the Ombudsman is to help people in the less privileged sections of the community, people who do not have recourse to solicitors and lawyers or who do not have organisations and advertising agencies highlighting their cases or going to court to argue constitutional law. There are things which affect the ordinary public which they consider to be unfair.  They normally put these points to the Ombudsman and make representations to him.</P>
    <P>We seem to be speaking regularly in the House in regard to the relationship between ourselves and the Ombudsman. At one stage people believed that when the office of the Ombudsman was set up we could do away with TDs making representations, but the longer I am in this House the more I see the need for making representations in regard to certain things, though there are many other things we should be involved in.  There are clearly points which we can usefully put forward and try to have changed but there are other things in regard to which we are codding ourselves and those we represent.</P>
    <P>We see in the Ombudsman's report areas where we have the total power as legislators to make changes.  It is the job of the Government, in relation to the finances of the State, to move money in whatever way is appropriate to handle the State and to see that there are areas where there are inequalities and inequities which are unfair to the ordinary people, particularly those who are unable to handle their own arguments.  That is what the Ombudsman's office is about and that is what the Minister's role is.  He <Col N="498" /> has a fairly large and strong Department which has recourse to all other Departments and could force them into doing these things.  His Department has good relations with all the Departments.  I ask the Minister to take this job seriously.</P>
    <P>Some people feel that to discuss this late at night and to have the debate 15 or 20 months after the Ombudsman sends in his report is not the way to do it.  I know the Minister does not see it that way and that other Members of the House do not see it that way.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the conclusions and recommendations in the report are acted on and if that is done he will be seen to be doing an effective and efficient job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with the welcome for the publication of the first annual report of the Ombudsman.  The success of the office is due in large measure to the foresight of the former Minister for the Public Service, who moved very rapidly to establish the office and give the holder a wide remit which he has shown in the first report to have been effective.  He has dealt with many areas.  The Minister tonight outlined where some reforms had taken place.  The public have welcomed these changes.</P>
      <P>Some people have expressed doubt about the Ombudsman and his communication with people in the country but, as a Deputy representing County Clare, I can say that the Ombudsman came to Ennis and his visit was well advertised and was well attended.  The Ombudsman, Mr. Mills, has done the office justice in seeing that there was a certain amount of decentralisation.  The visit was welcomed by older people who were not able to travel to Dublin.  They were very happy with the visit.  The office of Ombudsman has worked well even though there were teething problems with the officers of the various Departments but that was to be expected.  This has been a good step to bring the human face of the public service more to the fore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ahern's proposal about the Department's public relations is a fair <Col N="499" /> comment.  The Departments seem to be afraid to open out.  The Ombudsman is there to protect the public service as much as the public.  Would the Departments have confidence enough in the Ombudsman to see that progress is made for the sake of the public at least?</P>
    <P>I have received many representations about the old age contributory pension and I have spoken on many occasions about the post 1953 applicants for contributory pensions.  I am amazed at the figure of £50 million which has been computed as outstanding.  That seems to give great scope to applicants.  Would the Minister consider in the Social Welfare Bill or would the Ombudsman recommend limited qualification for those old age pensioners who, because of this anomaly, are being denied pension rights?  I suppose in the long run the people will pass away.  It is regrettable that a scheme which was intended to be compassionate should not be made effective now by introducing at least a small scheme which would allow a number of those old people to qualify.</P>
    <P>I receive numerous complaints about the Valuation Office.  The public are not aware of the continuing valuation and how the scheme works.  Many of them are not aware of the appeals system.  The law needs to be changed with regard to notices about valuation and how it is effected.  Some people feel let down when the officer arrives and comes to his final calculation.  They dispute those figures. A lot of the blame should be addressed towards the legal advisers.  The Ombudsman should consult with the Law Society and ask solicitors to brief clients better about the Valuation Office.</P>
    <P>I am very happy with the work of the Ombudsman and the courteous way his officers have investigated the claims that have been made.  I am impressed by the way they receive people in their office in St. Stephen's Green.  I hope that when the second annual report comes before the House more progress will have been made.  I am happy that much progress has been made in the first report.</P>
    <Col N="500" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like my colleagues, Deputy Ahern and Deputy Carey, would like to give a very warm welcome to this report particularly since it is the result of legislation that I, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, had the privilege of putting through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I welcome it also because it is a vindication of a general feeling that while the majority of civil and public servants are civil and public there are others who are not.  Like Deputy Ahern I am afraid I, too, have had the experience of a very small band of public servants who thought and continue to think of themselves as the sole judges and arbiters of matters, answerable to nobody.  To quote from the report they were: &ldquo;suspicious about the new institution and resented its intrusion particularly when their decisions were under scrutiny&rdquo;.  Like Deputy Ahern I should stress that my experience with the vast bulk of public servants has been satisfactory and I could make complimentary remarks about them only.  Unfortunately a few give the general public service a bad name.  All of us have had such experiences. I remember once coming on a deputation to this city with people who had given up their day to travel on that deputation with regard to a special project. The deputation were told by a lady public servant that if people like them did not come up and waste her time, perhaps action could be taken.  Only later did she discover that I was a TD.  I am certain that the Minister's confidence as expressed in the course of his remarks, will be fully justified, and that those public servants who resisted the change will have seen that there is no danger to them from the office of the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>Three years after the establishment of the office it will have been fully accepted that the public have the right of a final appeal through his office.  Indeed the number of complaints received by him in the first year, over 2,200, is an indication of the need there was and is for its establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that all Departments have been involved.  However, from the results the Ombudsman has catalogued, it will be seen that the very high number <Col N="501" /> of complaints received about social welfare matters points to the complexity of the social welfare legislation and the need to bring some degree of realism into that minefield.  I suppose it is natural that the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; whom all of us feel are out to extract the last few pence from us &mdash; should be second in the league of complaints and that Bord Telecom should be number three.</P>
    <P>In another section of the report one wonders about the relevance of the fact that two of the three complaint leaders were Departments who challenged the authority of the Ombudsman in the early stages.  Apart from listing various complaints and giving excellent examples &mdash; on which I will not elaborate &mdash; the main thrust of this report is to bring to the notice of the Government the very many anomalies and contradictions that exist in our law.  I am glad to note from the Minister's speech that some of these anomalies have been receiving consideration.</P>
    <P>I might point out to him that the Government refused to accept a Fianna Fáil Bill which would have taken into account the question of the law on domicile which the Ombudsman has brought to their attention.  Successive Governments have been somewhat remiss in not taking on legislation suggested by the Opposition.  I have no doubt that the Bill I brought through the House was all the better for the many amendments the Opposition suggested and which I was pleased to take on board at the time.</P>
    <P>The Government now have a duty to be faithful to the Ombudsman, to take on board the many points he has raised even if only to prevent those points being raised continuously and maintaining his workload.  It would help if the anomalies he has pointed out were removed from legislation.  Here I fully endorse Deputy Ahern's remarks.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman points out that the decision to extend his writ to local authorities and health boards, of necessity, will lead to a larger number of complaints which he will have to investigate.  I was glad to be able to give a commitment <Col N="502" /> to have enshrined in the legislation the provision that, once the office had got off the ground, the health boards and local authorities would be considered for inclusion. The ordinary citizen will be better helped by the decision to include health boards and local authorities within his writ.  Very many people now experience problems in relation to local authorities.</P>
    <P>One might ask the Ombudsman to examine the laws in relation to the Department of the Environment which enable them to have the best of both worlds.  For example, as the House knows, in housing the height from floor to ceiling has to be of a certain measurement to qualify for a grant.  However a person, having built a house and having decided, before the Department inspector arrives, to use the attic space and have a ceiling height of, say, seven feet when it should be eight feet, has led to departmental inspectors refusing to allocate grants in many cases, maintaining that the floor area was over and above the statutory limit.  This, despite the fact that the rooms upstairs were less than the adequate height.  Therefore, it is a question of the Department having the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>I welcome this historic report.  I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State to his new Department.  Like Deputy Ahern I feel he should benefit from the additional time he will be able to spend at home.  I hope that the 1985 report will come to hand very shortly. However, the first official report of this office clearly identifies the tremendous need there was for the establishment of the office.  One might well wonder what happened the many people who used this office, who had their complaints investigated, who benefited from that investigation, in the years before that office was available to them.  Many people have benefited according to this report and many people will benefit in the future from the establishment of this office.  I welcome the report.  I congratulate the Ombudsman and his office on the tremendous work they have done and also for the manner in which they deal with <Col N="503" /> people.  The general public service could take an example from them in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to wish the Minister every success in his new position.  Many of our people seem to be anxious to keep him at home.  I do not know why that is.  The general feeling among the public is that the setting up of the office of Ombudsman was worthwhile and has proved to be very successful.  The work being done by the Ombudsman and his staff is appreciated by politicians and by the general public.  I welcome this report, even though it is a bit late.  Like my colleagues, I hope the Minister will act upon this report and enact the legislation necessary to correct the anomalies in the different Departments as outlined in the report.  Unless this is done, the Ombudsman will become bogged down by recurring problems.  I know that the Minister is concerned about this and it is important that he should move to correct the imbalances stated.</P>
      <P>Bureaucracy is one of the major problems which all public representatives and the public in general come up against. While the majority of civil servants are excellent in their field, a minority of them see themselves as little gods who have the right to decide upon everything.  Their decisions are not always in the best interest of the general public.  There were over 2,000 complaints within the first 12 months of the establishment of this office. That proves that there was a need for the Ombudsman.  People are now confident that they can get a fair hearing.  They feel happier that they have recourse to fair play.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the cost of removing the anomalies involved.  It is suggested that much time is being wasted by politicians.  We hear constant criticism that they are doing the wrong job and not acting as legislators, that we spend most of our time as messenger boys for the public.  If we were to correct most of those imbalances, while it would cost a lot of money, it would be very worthwhile in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the changes in section 4 of <Col N="504" /> the Finance Act and also the recommendations for change in certain statutory dates affecting the valuation of property. This is one major bone of contention among the people.  Their property is revalued for many different reasons. Deputy Carey pointed out that the legal people do not advise their clients as they should.  They do not seem to appeal within the specified date and, as a result, they have to wait for another year before they can make a new appeal.  This causes severe problems for people who have renovated their premises and where there are proposed revisions in the valuation. I would welcome any change that would make it more beneficial to the people whose valuations are being revised.</P>
    <P>The most antiquated law is where people are responsible for the water pipe outside their door which has been broken by circumstances beyond the control of the houseowner.  I would like to see the local authorities assuming more responsibility in that area.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem arises with regard to social welfare.  Problems have existed here for years.  I am glad the Ombudsman and his office recognise this.  Serious delays in the payment of social welfare benefit are causing severe problems to families.  It is the one area which we come up against constantly in our clinics.  In some cases people go to the clinic or to the local social welfare office and this causes more problems because by the time we notify the Department extra delays occur.  People suffer severe hardships in this area.</P>
    <P>Deserted husbands and widowers are not getting a fair deal.  In the case of a widower he has to claim unemployment assistance which goes nowhere towards meeting the same criteria as apply in the case of a widow.  A deserted husband is not in the same league financially as a deserted wife.  I would welcome changes in that area.  I hope the Minister will tackle the serious anomalies that exist in this area.  We hear much talk about equality but in this case there is no equality on the man's side.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report.  I know it is not the Minister's fault that it was not made <Col N="505" /> available earlier.  I compliment the Ombudsman and his staff for the excellent job they are doing.  They are satisfying the political arena and, more importantly, they are making a major contribution towards solving the problems of the ordinary public who feel frustrated and disillusioned with bureaucracy and red tape.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Jim O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  I appreciate the congratulatory remarks which were made in relation to myself and my new appointment.  I will attempt to pick up some of the points raised during the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>I will start with the historical background of the Ombudsman which goes back quite a long time.  I understand that the idea was first introduced by Richie Ryan during his term as Minister for Finance and the Public Service.  Following on that there was the setting up of an all-party committee by the Minister for Justice which reported in 1977.  We then had the Bill which was introduced in 1980 by Deputy Calleary.  Finally, we had the appointment by the Minister, Deputy Boland, of the Ombudsman in 1983. Thereafter there was an extension of the writ of the Ombudsman to cover local authorities, health boards, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann in 1985.  This history confirms that, over that period of time, different impulses, as it were, to the office were given from different sides of the House.</P>

    <P>What has emerged over that period of time is that there has been almost total all-party support for the office of the Ombudsman.  I am very conscious of this. In my term of office in the Public Service and in this House I would be very keen to see that that all-party support for the office continues.  Deputy Ahern raised a number of aspects of the report and I appreciate his interest in it.  His interest in the office of the Ombudsman goes back a long time.  He raised the question of the antiquated law which is referred to by the Ombudsman in his report.  I felt his tone might have been a little accusatory as far <Col N="506" /> as the local authorities are concerned.  I did refer to the position in my opening remarks and it is important to note that the Minister for the Environment has included provisions in the forthcoming Local Government Bill to eliminate the specific anomaly identified by the Ombudsman.  In the meantime, it must be recognised that local authorities are creatures of the law and to act otherwise would be <i>ultra vires</i> and could lead to other problems.  That fact has to be borne in mind when one considers the present actions of the local authorities.  At the same time, I would hope that in the light of the specific issue highlighted by the Ombudsman local authorities would take as sympathetic a view as they can within the limits and constraints that are on them so that any hard luck or hardship cases which had been identified by the report could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern also referred to the question of follow-up action.  As I outlined in my opening remarks, and Deputies might be happy to note this, there have been a number of actions which have dealt with anomalies and other points raised by the Ombudsman.  We will continue to ensure that every point raised by the Ombudsman is looked at very seriously not just by myself but my colleagues in Government.  From the point of view of the House, there will be, of course, a further opportunity, when the Whips can come to an arrangement, when we will be able to debate the 1985 report.  This will provide Deputies with a further opportunity to examine and discuss the situation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies commented on what is referred to as the social insurance anomaly.  From my own experience in my constituency this problem, highlighted by the Ombudsman, has caused difficulty for a number of individuals.  I gather from the figures available there may be a considerable number of people in the country affected by it.  On the other hand, it is important that we have the full facts and that we do not rush into a judgment either from the point of view of misunderstanding the background or from the danger of creating further anomalies by precipitate <Col N="507" /> action.  There is also, as I mentioned earlier, the question of costs.  The background relates to the changes made in the remuneration limits for social insurance purposes in the fifties and sixties.  In 1953 non-manual workers earning more than £600 a year ceased to be compulsorily insurable.  That limit was raised in subsequent years.  In 1974 compulsory insurance was again introduced for all workers irrespective of income.  Let us be clear on one thing, the Ombudsman has made it clear that he is satisfied that there is no question of maladministration on the part of the Department of Social Welfare and that the refusal of claims arising under the broken period of insurance is fully correct within the existing terms of social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern also raised the point that the anomaly arose because people were given the wrong advice in the fifties. I am advised that at that time every effort was made by the Department of Social Welfare to bring people's attention to the advantages of voluntary contributions which were permissible in the post-1953 period.  While some people may not have been fully aware of the situation there must have been quite a number of other people who decided that voluntary contributions were not worth the cost.  That is a factor that also has to be borne in mind.  The question is a complex one. One also has to consider the situation, if there were to be a change, of the person who did pay his insurance either on a compulsory or voluntary basis, particularly the latter, during that period.  If we were now to extend the pension provision to those who did not pay, what would be the position of those who had paid? Would they be entitled to a refund?</P>
    <P>These are some of the questions that arise in connection with a possible change.  I have to say, overall, that the overriding issue is one of cost.  Figures which have been mentioned to me are substantial.  One has to bear in mind that even if money of that order &mdash; the figure I quoted was £50 million in 1987 terms &mdash; were available for an improvement of the social welfare provisions, would this be <Col N="508" /> the top priority for Deputies or are there other areas of greater hardship where this money might be better devoted?  I raise these points to indicate that while I take on board the points raised by the Ombudsman the solution is not as simple as it might first appear.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat taken aback by Deputy Ahern's suggestion that the White Paper will not be implemented.  Perhaps he did not put it in such blunt terms but he seemed to suggest that a substantial portion of it would not be implemented.  I must say that there is total commitment to the implementation of the White Paper.  On that point, legislation will be necessary.  I can tell the House that this legislation is in the course of preparation at this time and I would hope to present it in the near future.  The measures which do not require legislation are, in many instances, already being implemented.  My Department and myself will continue to make every effort to ensure that all such measures are fully implemented.  I am sure that the Minister, Deputy Boland, will be very happy to know that the excellent work he put into this area will continue when he has moved on to other fields.  The whole thrust of the White Paper is to put good service, good management and value for taxpayers' money at the top of the priority list.  That approach commends itself fully to all Deputies.  I look forward to full co-operation from the House when I come back to them with legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>The question of the Civil Service being both civil and public was raised by a number of Deputies.  The vast majority of civil servants are very civil and are doing a very good job although I would be the first to admit that there are occasional examples of people who do not come up to that very high standard.  As in relation to any other profession, those who are giving dedicated service should not be tarred with the brush that could perhaps be applied to the very few.  From the point of view of service to the public, the White Paper addressed this problem in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> Reference was made to the Department of Social Welfare where arrangements are being made to have offices open at times suitable to the public.  The Department of Social Welfare were the first to set up an executive office as described in the White Paper and a director has been appointed.  This is probably the biggest single step in the direction of single-minded concentration on service to the public.  Giving a good service to the public will be its only mission and there will also be a programme of training for public office staff.  While we have not reached the optimum situation, much has already been done to implement the provisions in the White Paper in this regard from the point of view of training, the presentation and lay-out of Civil Service forms and other aspects such as the personalisation of the Civil Service.  The idea to remove the anonymity behind which it was suggested civil servants wanted to hide was an outstanding idea of Minister Boland.  With few exceptions there was no hesitation among civil servants to deal with the public on a one-to-one basis.  There are several proposals in the White Paper bearing on this area.  I assure the House that proposals about the removal of hatches will certainly have my attention and every effort will be made to ensure that these proposals will come into effect in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey referred to certain legal aspects.  Only complaints against administrative actions by Departments, local authorities, An Post and An Bord Telecom Éireann can be investigated.  There is not an entitlement to investigate actions by solicitors in the private sector. Legal decisions by Departments' legal advisers would also not normally be the subject of complaint to the Ombudsman. These have to be borne in mind when considering the report of the Ombudsman. Following on that there would seem to be an implied criticism of the legal profession.  I am here on behalf of the public service but as a person who was a practising member of the legal profession I would point out that there are the good and the bad in the legal profession just <Col N="510" /> as in the Civil Service and in every other profession.</P>
    <P>Deputy Calleary pointed out that this is an historic report as it is the first report of the Ombudsman.  In concluding, it is appropriate for me to indicate my appreciation of the contributions made to this debate.  It is clear that we share a strong concern that the public service should give a caring and sensitive service to all citizens and especially to the most needy.  We also share a belief and determination that the Ombudsman will be successful in drawing attention to defects in the administration and having them remedied.  To an extent the existence of an Ombudsman is an indication that there is room for improvement and there must always be room for improvement in the quality of our administration. This office has been in existence in other countries for a long time.  In Finland it goes back to 1919, and in other European countries it is an office with a long and proud history.  In trying to trace the country where it all began I inadvertently overlooked Sweden where the office has been established since 1809.  I am glad to say that to that proud history and tradition our Ombudsman has already made his contribution and established his mark.</P>
    <P>I expect that as the services of the Ombudsman become well known there will be a greater demand for the service. Hand in hand with this will go the determined efforts which we are now making to improve enormously the service given by Departments and other public bodies. I hope these efforts &mdash; their direction is clearly spelled out in the White Paper &mdash; will gradually reduce the Ombudsman's workload simply because the extent of dissatisfaction with public services will be reduced.  I am sure all Deputies in this House will share my feelings in that regard.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.12 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 February 1986.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for employment. When the person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 25 November 1985 she did not produce any evidence of having sought employment and her claim was, accordingly, disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for employment.  She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral appeal hearing on 12 February 1986 where she had an opportunity to present her case.  The appeals officer on the basis of the evidence available to him also decided that the person concerned was not available for employment.  She continues to sign the unemployed register and further inquiries are being made at present to establish her availability for employment from the date following the appeals officer's decision.  When these inquiries are completed her entitlement to unemployment benefit from 13 February 1986 will be determined.</P>

      <P>The prescribed relative allowance is an increase in pension payable to certain categories of pensioners under very specific conditions.  To qualify for the allowance the pensioner must be so incapacitated as to require full time care and attention and have a prescribed relative living with him solely for the purpose of providing that full time care and attention. Apart from the prescribed relative the pensioner must be living alone or only with a child or an incapacitated person.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the allowance is a limited one, providing income-maintenance support to a pensioner where a prescribed relative is devoting his-her energies to providing full time care and attention to the exclusion of gainful activity.  The conditions applying to this scheme effectively restrict payment to cases where the relative providing the care and attention has no independent means of support.</P>
      <P>An extension of the scheme along the lines proposed by the Deputy would radically alter the scope of the scheme and would have very costly implications. In present circumstances it is regretted that an extension of the scheme on the lines suggested is not possible.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance depends on the means of the applicant and individual investigations must be made in each case by a social welfare officer.  The decisions in individual cases are made by deciding officers appointed under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>The time taken to carry out a means investigation and reach a decision in any particular case depends to a large extent on the individual circumstances of the case.  The general applications for unemployment assistance in County Kerry are processed within two months but the time involved in some cases is longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuing rise in numbers claiming unemployment assistance combined with the need for individual investigation of cases by a social welfare officer has resulted in lengthening of the time taken in processing applications.  In addition many of the unemployment assistance applications made in County Kerry are from smallholders and these cases are generally more difficult to investigate and <Col N="350" /> take more time to process than the ordinary run of unemployment assistance applications because of the necessity to obtain detailed information on the income and expenditure of holdings. Every effort however is made to ensure that unemployment assistance claims are processed as quickly and efficiently as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 32 together.  The number of families receiving family income supplement at 21 February 1986 was 4,773.  The average payment to each family was £7.66 per week.  In view of the budgetary changes the number of claims in payment are expected to rise to approximately 6,500 families by the end of 1986.</P>
      <P>The number of applications received for the family income supplement at 31 December 1985 was 11,532.  The total amount paid out since the introduction of the scheme to 31 December 1985, the latest date for which figures are available, is £2,378,000.  The number of families in receipt of the family income supplement at 31 December 1985 was 4,562.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvements announced in the <Col N="351" /> budget will result in increases in the supplements being paid to present beneficiaries and will enable families not at present eligible to qualify for supplement. While the numbers participating in the scheme so far have proved disappointing, the Government are showing their continuing intention to provide effective assistance for low-paid working parents with children.  It is proposed to advertise the improvements nationally when the necessary legislation has been passed to bring the scheme to the attention of all families for whom the scheme is designed.</P>

      <P>The numbers of appeal cases under consideration at my Department for unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and disability benefit are 82, 282 and 295 respectively.  These numbers are based on the position at 31 December 1985 which is the latest date for which figures are available.  In addition there were 390 cases in which applicants appealed against the amount of means assessed against them for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>
      <P>Following the appointment of two additional appeals officers in 1984 and the assignment of a number of temporary appeals officers in mid-1985 progress is being achieved in clearing the backlog of cases.  In the past 12 months arrears of appeal cases for unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, disability benefit and means assessments for unemployment assistance have been reduced by some 38 per cent and it is expected that this rate of reduction will be maintained.</P>

      <P>In determining pension entitlement in cases where farms are transferred, the deciding officer must satisfy himself, on the merits of each case, whether the transfer was effected for pension purposes.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Social Welfare legislation provides for a means test for unemployment assistance.  The means test is designed to ensure that all applicants for unemployment assistance are treated in an equitable manner having regard to the resources available to them.  Payment of unemployment assistance is made to those who are in genuine need and is directly related to the financial circumstances in each individual case.  It is considered that the best means of ensuring that the objectives of the means test are met is by carrying out an individual investigation in the case of each applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept, however, that the need for individual investigation of cases and assessment of means by a social welfare officer, combined with the continuing rise <Col N="354" /> in numbers claiming unemployment assistance has given rise to delays in many cases.  Despite reorganisation and redeployment of staff within the Department and the streamlining of working methods and systems, the overall numbers of staff available to the Department has not matched fully the huge additional workload placed on it in recent years.</P>
    <P>While there may be delays in processing claims of persons coming straight on to unemployment assistance there should not be similar delays in the cases of applicants coming from unemployment benefit.  Persons claiming unemployment benefit are advised of the need to apply for a qualification certificate about three months before exhaustion of their benefit.  If they apply when advised to do so they should be able to go on to unemployment assistance without experiencing any delay.</P>
    <P>I understand that the general question of means assessment and the administration of the means test is one of the matters on which the Commission on Social Welfare will be reporting shortly.  In these circumstances I consider that it would not be appropriate to make any change to the existing method of assessment until such time as the benefits of the commission's deliberations and recommendations on the matter are available. However, I would like to emphasise that every effort will continue to be made within the available resources to ensure that employment assistance applications and reviews are processed as quickly and efficiently as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in County Galway has received three different replies from her Department in connection with her claim for an old age contributory pension, telling her firstly, that she was not entitled to an old age pension following this with a letter and a hand written apology stating that she was entitled to her pension, and finally a letter on 31 January stating that she did not fulfil the conditions, and, therefore, would not be awarded a pension; if she feels that there is any justification for the conflicting information from her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to qualify for an old age contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts a claimant must: (i) have entered into insurance before reaching a prescribed age; (ii) have contributions paid in respect of at least 156 weeks of <Col N="356" /> insurable employment and (iii) have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, paid or credited, over the period from the beginning of the 1953-54 contribution year or from her year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before she reaches pension age.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed an old age contributory pension in September 1985.  At that time the Department's records showed that she had 120 paid contributions and 121 credited contributions, a total of 241 reckonable contributions in all, since her entry into insurance. Her claim was disallowed because she failed to satisfy both the condition requiring at least 156 paid contributions and the condition requiring a minimum average of 20 contributions.  The total of 241 contributions was equal to an average of only 12 over the relevant period.</P>
      <P>She was notified of the number of contributions shown on her record and of the fact that her claim was disallowed because the numbers of contributions failed to reach the statutory requirements. She replied stating that she felt that the record was incomplete and following a review additional credits were awarded.  These additional credits enabled her to satisfy the minimum yearly average requirement but not the condition requiring her to have contributions paid in respect of at least 156 weeks of insurable employment.  Unfortunately, at that point the deciding officer overlooked the later requirement and awarded the pension to her.  The deciding officer also sent a notification of the award to her together with an apology for the previous non-award.  The error was discovered, however, before a pension book was issued and the decision to award the pension was revoked.  A letter of explanation regretting the error was then sent to her.  A copy of the claimant's revised insurance record was also sent to her and she has been advised of her right to appeal.  She has also been asked to supply details of her employments, together with the names and addresses of her employers, if she is not satisfied that the revised record is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> Her entitlement to a non-contributory old age pension was investigated in November 1985.  She did not qualify for this pension, however, because her means exceeded the statutory limit.  This limit is £48 a week at present for a person without dependants.</P>
    <P>I wish to add my own expression of regret also to the error which occurred in this case as I fully appreciate the inconvenience and worry to the claimant.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that such an error is extremely rare.</P>

      <P>The road grant allocations for 1986 notified to Monaghan County Council total £2.718 million, which represents an increase of 10 per cent relative to the level of grant payments made to the local authority in 1985.</P>
      <P>The current year's allocations were notified to the local authority under the following headings: (a) Major improvement works, £930,000; (b) Other specific improvement works, £990,000; (c) Maintenance works on national roads, £379,000; (d) Block grant, £419,000.</P>
      <P>While, in the case of Monaghan County Council, the allocation for major improvement works relates solely to works on national primary roads, each of the other allocations refers to more than one road classification.  Accordingly, information in the form requested by the Deputy will only be available when the grant payments for 1986 have been finalised in December next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will instruct Dublin County Council and the other county councils throughout the country to urgently examine the signposting of accident black spots and potentially dangerous areas particularly where new dual carriageways join with narrower roads, with particular reference to the dual carriageway at St. Edmonsbury, Lucan, County Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>In conjunction with the making of road grant allocations for 1986, local authorities generally have been requested to pay particular attention to the need to monitor and deal with accident black spots.</P>
      <P>One of the main aims of the 1985 road plan is the improvement of road safety. The programme of major improvement projects listed in the plan took into account the findings of An Foras Forbartha black spots and area wide safety studies. Some £500 million has been allocated for road development in the period 1985-87 and the accelerated programme permitted by this level of funding will remove a large proportion of black spots, particularly on major routes.</P>
      <P>It is for the individual road authority to identify high accident locations, having regard, among other things, to accident information supplied by An Foras Forbartha. The implementation of remedial measures at such locations or at locations where potential road hazards may exist, including the provision of appropriate traffic signs and markings, is also a matter for the road authority.</P>
      <P>Regarding the dual carriageway at St. Edmonsbury, Lucan, County Dublin, I understand that Dublin County Council have provided warnings to drivers by means of traffic signs and markings of the transition from the present dual carriageway to the single carriageway.  I have asked my Department to take up with the council the adequacy of these signs in view of the Deputy's question and other representations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Traffic Acts and regulations made thereunder provide for the issue of certificates of fitness by my Department.  Such certificates are issued at the Department's offices in O'Connell Bridge House, Dublin 2.  It is not necessary, however, for an applicant for a certificate of fitness to present himself in person, since the application may be made by post.  Once the certificate has been issued, it can be presented at, or forwarded by post to, the applicant's local motor tax office with his application for a licence.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Government announced that the possibility of devolving to local authorities the function of issuing certificates of fitness would be examined.  This aspect is receiving full consideration in the context of a Road Traffic Bill which I hope to bring before the Dáil in the latter half of 1986.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated to the Deputy in reply to Questions Nos. 16 and 17 on 4 December 1985, Cavan County Council used their powers under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, to serve notices on producers prohibiting slurry spreading within the catchment between 15 November 1985, and 15 February 1986.  The notices also specified that for the periods 25 October to 15 November 1985, and 16 February to 31 March 1986 <Col N="365" /> slurry should only be spread in such quantities and in such conditions as will not cause or be likely to cause pollution.</P>
    <P>Cavan County Council are satisfied that the pig producers generally have been acting responsibly and have to date complied with the notices issued.  In the case of one producer who is alleged to have acted in breach of the terms of the notice, the local authority has initiated legal proceedings.</P>

      <P>There has been no avoidable delay in this case.  Inadequate documentation in respect of the proposed scheme was submitted to the Department in July 1984 and a revised layout, together with house and cost plans, was received in June 1985.  The site for the scheme poses a number of difficulties because of the steep gradient and the proposals have been subject to alteration in the interests of achieving a satisfactory and cost-effective design.  The council have also revised the proposed housing mix in the light of current housing needs in the area.  The proposals were recently discussed with the council by my Department's inspector and a formal submission incorporating agreed alterations is expected in the near future.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, for residential property tax purposes, the person is an assessable person who has been exempted from the tax arising on the valuation dates in 1983 and 1984 on the grounds that the household income exemption limit relating to those years was not exceeded.  A reminder was recently sent to the person asking her to complete a return for the valuation date in 1985.  She may also claim exemption from the tax on this return if the household income for the year ended 5 April 1985, did not exceed the household income exemption limit of £23,395 applying on that date.  Residential property tax is an annual tax on the net market value of relevant residential property, and the question of liability has to be considered each year in respect of the ownership of such property.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the allowance referred to in the question is the additional allowance for widows and other single parents which is granted under section 138A of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The proviso to the section precludes the allowance being granted for any year of assessment in the case of a man and woman who are living together as man and wife.  I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, on the basis of information supplied to the inspector of taxes, the allowance was withdrawn from the taxpayer for the year 1985-86 on the grounds that she did not fulfil the relevant statutory requirements which apply to the granting of the allowance.</P>

      <P>When the free electricity allowance scheme was introduced it was recognised that the electricity bill could be a source of worry for old age pensions with limited resources and the scheme was designed to remove this expense or to reduce it substantially.</P>
      <P>The scheme now meets the cost of the normal standing charge on the ESB's domestic consumer tariff and up to 200 or 300 units of electricity per two-monthly billing period in summer or winter respectively. Pensioners who use more than their allowance in any billing period must pay for the excess; those who use less do not receive a bill but are supplied with a statement showing the number of units consumed in the billing period and how to make further use of their allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate, and to obtain a qualification certificate an applicant must satisfy certain conditions, including an assessment of means.  When the person concerned claimed unemployment assistance the case was referred to a social welfare officer.  Following the completion of the social welfare officer's inquiries, a deciding officer assessed the person concerned with means of £67.30 weekly derived from self-employment.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £6.55 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £73.85 less means of £67.30. Arrangements have been made with his local office to put the claim into payment this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to the issue of the applicant's qualification certificate further information came to light regarding his self-employment which may have a bearing on the means assessed against him and consequently the papers were returned to the social welfare officer for further <Col N="376" /> inquiries.  Every effort is being made to have the inquiries completed with the minimum possible delay.  When these inquiries are completed his means will be reassessed and the rate of unemployment assistance payable to him will be reviewed accordingly.</P>

If the person concerned wishes to have his entitlement to unemployment assistance reviewed and if he is willing to co-operate in the disclosure of his means it is open to him to inform his local employment office accordingly.  His case would then be investigated by a social welfare officer and his entitlement to unemployment assistance determined accordingly.

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The prescribed relative allowance is an increase of pension payable to certain categories of pensioners under specific conditions.  To qualify for the allowance the pensioner must be so incapacitated as to require full time care and attention and have a prescribed relative living with her for the purpose of providing that care and attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is a limited one designed to meet the income maintenance needs of the pensioner and the prescribed relative. Relatives with other means of support, <Col N="378" /> including married persons who are being wholly or mainly supported by their spouses, are not covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>Extension of the scheme in the manner suggested by the Deputy would radically alter its nature and scope and would have far reaching and costly implications. There are no proposals to extend the scheme in this way.  The person concerned is a married person wholly or mainly maintained by her husband and she is not therefore entitled to prescribed relative allowance.  She has been notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>Regulation (EEC) No. 797/85 provides that, to qualify for an installation premium, a young farmer must have been installed on a holding with a minimum labour requirement of one man work unit.  As this is an EC requirement, I have no discretion in the matter.  The minimum labour requirement is not a condition of the extra investment aid available to young farmers under the farm improvement programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>The financial provision for TB and brucellosis eradication in 1986 must be viewed in the context of the exceptionally difficult budgetary situation which has necessitated economies in many sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is not envisaged that all herds will be tested for bovine tuberculosis this year, any meaningful evaluation of the testing programme in 1986 must have regard to the exceptional level of activity since the beginning of the current round in June 1985 and which is continuing until the round ends on 23 March next.  In that time the national herd will have been tested on average one and a half times and in many badly infected areas herds <Col N="383" /> will have been tested at least twice.  Following on this intensive programme activity over the remainder of 1986 will be mainly concentrated on the high-risk areas identified during the current round. This approach can be expected to yield the greatest return in terms of identifying reactors and controlling the spread of disease.</P>
    <P>The national herd will continue to be monitored for brucellosis through a combination of blood tests and milk ring tests.</P>

    <P>My Department keeps under constant review the factors which determine the supply and demand for fully qualified primary teachers.  When it became evident that the wastage from the profession was declining and that there was a reduction in the actual number of births the Department reduced the intake to the colleges of education firstly by discontinuing the one year graduate course and secondly by reducing gradually the <Col N="388" /> number of students accepted for the B.Ed. course.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the foregoing measures which have also taken into account the need for substitute teachers to replace teachers absent through illness, maternity leave or study leave and for temporary teachers to replace teachers availing themselves of the recently introduced career breaks scheme, will result in a position whereby all graduates will have prospects of employment within a reasonable period following graduation.</P>
