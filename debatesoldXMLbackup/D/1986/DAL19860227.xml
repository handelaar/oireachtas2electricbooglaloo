    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment last week, I was mentioning the various tax changes which had been made in respect of income tax, first in relation to the tax bands, the reduction of the top rate of tax from 60 per cent to 58 per cent and the increase in the PAYE allowance, all of which in a full year will amount to approximately £200 million. This will result in extra money in people's pockets after 5 April next.  Obviously, it will depend on what salary one has, but this will not be an inconsiderable sum.  It is to be welcomed that we are moving in the direction of ensuring that people have more in their take home pay so that the discretion is theirs as to how to spend that money.</P>
      <P>I hope the policy introduced on the tax changes can be continued and that we can work towards a more realistic, a more reduced level, giving a greater incentive to work and to work harder.  We have all received complaints about the financial difference at times between working and not working, and that it is not in people's interests to work having regard to the high levels of taxation going back over quite a number of years.  These tax reductions must be paid for by looking for areas where extra revenue can be raised. We must also identify areas where reductions in tax can be made.  We must look more closely at the areas which require the greatest expenditure in order to try to ensure that the taxation measures we have taken in this budget will be put in proper perspective.  We have imposed a new tax on the financial institutions in order to bring them more into uniformity with the general tax pattern and we have taken steps to ensure that payments of this tax will be received quickly and regularly. However, I question whether other measures have been sufficiently thought out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, what was in the mind of the economic wizard who came up with <Col N="514" /> taxes on charities, on pensioners, on others with low incomes, on the so-called piggy-banks of young people?  I hope the Finance Bill will contain provision to ease the position of such groups and individuals. Many people have been happy to contribute to their favourite charities, like St. Vincent de Paul, Simon, those who run services for the handicapped. Up to now those charities have paid taxes through an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners.  Now they have been brought in at 35 per cent.  This should be eased, particularly when we consider the assistance those societies have given voluntarily not only to the ill and the needy but to the State.</P>
    <P>Many of our senior citizens who had relied on small bank deposits to supplement their pensions are now to be taxed on these deposits at the 35 per cent rate. I am sure other Deputies, like myself, have had representations from old age pensioners, those on non-contributory pensions or those applying for such pensions. Some of them may have up to £8,000 on deposit which they saved up over the years.  They will now be penalised, because of those deposits, by up to £4 a week.  They have served their country well by their hard work over the years and they deserve better from the State in their latter days.  It should be possible to ease this tax burden by an arrangement between the banks and the Revenue Commissioners.  They were told to get their few pounds from under the mattress and put the money into the bank.  Are they now to be discouraged from doing so and will they be forced again to hoard their small savings under their mattresses? I hope that in the preparation of the Finance Bill something can be done for such people, and that young people with small savings will not be penalised.</P>
    <P>One of the excellent features of the budget was the significant reduction in VAT from 23 per cent to 10 per cent in respect of restaurant meals.  This has been clearly welcomed and I have no doubt the country will benefit from the point of view of tourism.  More people will be able to afford to eat in restaurants. I hope that the restaurants will improve <Col N="515" /> their services.  Some such places were inclined to be sloppy in regard to service. Unfortunately, stories get out of the country and have tended to stop visitors coming here.  Therefore, I hope there will be an emphasis on improving service and giving better value for money in regard to meals at realistic rates.</P>
    <P>Labour intensive services will also benefit from the reduction in VAT.  This benefit will be somewhat offset by an increase from 23 per cent to 25 per cent on VAT on certain items.  However, taking this year's budget with last year's we seem to be gradually seeking uniformity in the different VAT rates and making efforts to get the 20 per cent rate down to 10 per cent.  However, there are two items I would refer to in this regard.  The first is the VAT rate on magazines.  Many magazines are still liable to the 25 per cent VAT rate.  The move to reduce the VAT on newspapers was welcomed but many people read magazines and consideration might be given to reducing the VAT rate on magazines to bring them more in line with newpapers.</P>
    <P>Another area which will cause concern is the proposed increase in legal fees but it must be remembered that a 23 per cent VAT rate is imposed on these fees. I hope that more items will be brought into the 10 per cent VAT rate.  These taxes help provide State services, pay salaries and help to pay the exorbitant debt service charges.  We must look very critically at State expenditure, particularly in the semi-State sector.  Vast amounts of taxpayers' money are being spent in these areas and we must ask ourselves if we are getting value for money.</P>
    <P>Some time ago there was a change over from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to Bord Telecom Éireann. While there have been some improvements in the telephone system, there are areas which are causing grave concern, particularly in regard to the time it takes to have a telephone repaired and the apparently excessive telephone bills. While many of us would not know exactly how much our telephone account will <Col N="516" /> be, it must be acknowledged that we are getting too many complaints about them. Everybody cannot be wrong.  We have to take a critical look at this semi-State body and ensure that we are getting the best service possible.  When we hear of the service provided in other countries we realise that there is great room for improvement in our telephone service.</P>
    <P>I welcome the grant of £250,000 to national hunt racing and the grant to the greyhound industry.  These sports are enjoyed by many and the knock-on effect in racing circles and in the bloodstock industry is to be welcomed.  These industries employ approximately 25,000 people.  These grants are the Government's recognition of these industries and will ensure that interest and employment are maintained.  We hope this active industry will continue to improve.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see the betting tax at the same level as last year.  A great deal of money is collected off course, most of it going into general revenue, but there would be greater spin-off for the industry if even a fraction of that money was spent improving facilities for punters and those involved in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy comment on the personnel appointed to the Racing Board on Christmas Eve as a panic measure and the harm they will do to the industry because of their inability to contribute anything positive to that industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Time with tell. I welcome the increased grant for the assistance of Irish emigrants in London. I and other Deputies went over there before Christmas and saw the difficulties being experienced by our people.  There are Irish people in Britain who are in very difficult circumstances and this grant is this Government's reconginition of the work being done by the Irish community in Britain.  I also welcome the grants towards the national youth policy to help prepare athletes for the next Olympics. Sport plays a major part in many people's lives.  Very few people do not have any <Col N="517" /> interest in some aspect of sport.  Money for sport is money well spent because the enjoyment derived from sport is very apparent.</P>
      <P>I want to mention also the incentives announced last autumn for the construction and building industry.  I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment which will get more people working and will encourage people to have work carried out by registered builders rather than those engaged in the black economy.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the proposed development of the inner city.  I would urge that the boundary announced should not be sacrosanct.  There are many areas within the boundary which do not need major development while there are areas along the boundary, or slightly outside it, which should be developed.  We should encourage greater activity in the inner city and there should be more people employed in the construction industry.  I hope the Minister will have another look at the present boundary to see what can be done to extend it.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, there is a problem as regards the collection of taxes and tax enforcement.  This is one reason for the fact that taxes are overdue.  There should be a review of the present measures so that money is collected more quickly and so avoid the long drawn out battles which take place with the Revenue Commissioners from time to time and avoid long drawn out correspondence which sometimes can be brought to an end by one or two phone calls.  A review of the working of tax officials should be undertaken.  This would ensure that they were not snowed under with bureaucracy, correspondence and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the amnesty announced and the various provisos which have to be complied with, but it could lead to a very complicated situation.  We have to be realistic and to ask what we want to see achieved.  I believe we want to get in the money which is owed but asking people, who have not been paying in time or who have been evading paying tax too many questions will defeat the thought behind <Col N="518" /> the amnesty.  The Minister mentioned several provisos which have to be complied with, such as disclosing to the Revenue Commissioners the fact that they have engaged in tax evasion, detailing the manner and extent of their evasions, producing details of their assets, deposits and other holdings, making substantive payment on account of tax evaded and agreeing to a schedule of payments over a limited period to clear the full amount due to the Revenue Commissioners.  The intention behind the amnesty should be to get in the money.  Too many questions and too much correspondence will defeat the purpose of the amnesty.</P>
    <P>I am not approving the non-payment of tax.  There are sections of the population who have not been paying their full share of tax.  In order to get in the greatest amount in the shortest space of time, we have to be realistic enough to realise that the main thing is to get in the money so that other taxpayers can benefit by a reduction in their tax.  I hope another look can be taken at this.  The idea behind the amnesty is very good.  It will be welcomed by everybody if a fair amount of money is got in from those people evading tax but I believe as it stands it will face further bureaucratic difficulties.</P>
    <P>The National Lottery was referred to in the Budget Statement.  I welcome the idea of extra money being raised which will benefit sports and other things.  It has been allocated to An Post so it will hit the most prominent lottery we have had up to this, the Hospitals Trust Sweepstakes. A large number of jobs with the Hospitals Trust have been lost because of this decision.  I hope their work over the years can be recognised with the fact that hospitals and other bodies have benefited for many years. We hope the proposed lottery will be a success but we must try to ensure that it does not wipe out other charities so that the end result will not be that other groups and individuals will have to curtail the work they are doing and ultimately have to go to the State for assistance. Perhaps some of the people who have worked in the Hospitals Trust for many years can be involved in the National <Col N="519" /> Lottery.  If it is a success it will probably benefit the arts as well as sport and areas which up to now have not received any money at all.</P>
    <P>I hope some of the matters I have mentioned can be taken on board in relation to the Finance Bill or in framing future measures and incentives.  I am well aware that we have many difficult problems ahead and that we will not get over them by simple rhetoric.  It is important that we face up to the problem of ensuring that we find jobs for the thousands of young people who need them and that we create the climate in which businesses can flourish, in which they are not hit by higher taxation and that we do not regard profit as a dirty word.  We must ensure that we get in the investment and that we give the incentive to people to take risk and ensure they create the extra jobs needed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government can get on with the task of making further reductions in taxation, create further jobs and avoid going down the road on side shows.  We should govern with the interests of people at heart and ensure that we can say to parents who have children who left school last year, or who will leave this year or next year, that the Government are working towards providing jobs for them. We have a good educational system which possibly needs review but the basis is there for ensuring that as Ireland heads into the nineties and the next century it can be a good place to live in.  It is important that we face up to our problems because rhetoric about simple solutions did not wash as far back as 1977 and it will not wash in 1986 or 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget makes it abundantly clear that the Government have abandoned all commitment to any stated objective and instead are committed to self-preservation for as long as possible.  They abandoned the objectives stated in their agreed programme for Government and <i>Building on Reality.</i> The economic targets about which they piously preached before the last election <Col N="520" /> are now conveniently forgotten.  All the righteous rhetoric is now of no consequence with their determined selfishness to hold on to office in the face of people's rejection of their budget, rejection of their leadership and rejection of their policies of closure, contraction and confrontation.</P>
      <P>We have the unique situation in which the Taoiseach has dissociated himself from the budget by demoting the Minister who presented it within two weeks of its presentation.  It must be noted&mdash;and I hope public attention is drawn to the fact&mdash;that even though the budget has been with us for the past four weeks the Taoiseach has not come into this House and contributed to the debate.  In a pathetic performance last week the Taoiseach, in a supreme act of faith in the gullibility of the people, sought to keep intact his image by moving those Ministers who were most antagonistic, Ministers Dukes, Desmond, Hussey and Noonan.  One must ask did the Taoiseach, in his inimical bungling and blustering way, believe that he could be spared the people's rejection of his Ministers and their works?  He must be asked did he naively believe that the carefully nurtured image of statesmanship and competence which has consumed him over the past three years could be preserved by distancing himself from those responsible for this cynical budget and the recent cavalier closure of hospitals and schools, the provocative, unnecessary confrontation with teachers, the total breakdown in law in order and total demoralisation of the agricultural industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have lost all credibility, all moral authority to govern.  They have deprived the old, demoralised the young and depressed the remainder. They have broken too many promises. Their policies have failed.  They have lost the confidence of the people.  They owe it to the country to go now rather than later and make way for a Government to tackle the job they have failed to do. Every organised interest group that has offered comment on this budget has denounced it as a cynical exercise in extending <Col N="521" /> the exorbitant taxes which is the hallmark of this Government.  People are depressed and despondent.  This budget does not provide any light, or even a glimmer of hope that we are nearing the end of the tunnel of darkness this Government have brought us into.</P>
    <P>The Government must stand condemned in their failure to achieve any progress toward their stated objectives. Instead of achieving anything positive all we have to record in their tenure of office is a depressing catalogue of negative achievements, such as higher unemployment, higher emigration, higher taxes, higher national debt, cutbacks in essential services and, above all, a pervasive gloom and depression which has choked enterprise, killed incentive and shattered the confidence of our people.</P>
    <P>It is a well known fact that this Government have no concern for the spirit of people, for the development of confidence, industriousness and initiative. Since taking office their exclusive priority has been the balancing of the books.  The false assumption was made that books could be balanced simply by imposing more severe taxes.  With typical insensitivity to human and social considerations it escaped their calculations that excessive taxation, particularly personal taxation, frustrates people, weakens their morale and kills their adventurous and entrepreneurial spirit.  This has very definitely dealt a very severe blow to the economy, not only in terms of reduced investment and development but in tax avoidance and evasion and in the movement of capital from the economy.  I would also suggest that it has caused increasing absenteeism among workers. It is no secret that to make ends meet many workers are going on sick leave to avoid paying income tax especially when it comes to the time of the year that they move on to higher taxes.  We have a very serious crisis in the level of unemployment. If we were to bring our living standards up to the average European levels and provide jobs for young people we would have to double the size of our industrial sector.  If we are to make any progress towards that objective we must <Col N="522" /> provide the conditions which will stimulate higher investment, leading to increased output.</P>
    <P>This budget does not augur well for the future development of industry.  Indeed, it does not augur well for the future viability of our existing industries.  The climate for investment has not been improved by this budget, quite the opposite, it has deteriorated.  It has increased tax on manufacturing industry by £24 million because of changes in the tax treatment of investment in plant and machinery. The introduction of a special duty on section 84 loans pushes interest rates up further for firms availing of these facilities. IDA grants are reduced by £3 million. Of course the most fundamental deterrent to investment in manufacturing industry is the maintenance in this budget of much more favourable treatment of risk-free investment in Government stocks over productive risk-taking investment. It is very significant that last year £1,000 million was invested by individuals and institutions in new Government gilts and less than £50 million was invested in new manufacturing industry.  This budget does nothing to redress that serious anomaly.</P>
    <P>The vital importance of the individual worker's role in increasing competitiveness and output is given scant recognition in the budget.  Industry has difficulty in persuading people to work overtime, even to fill urgent export orders, and to accept more responsibility at higher salaries because the increase in net pay is so insignificant due to the high level of personal taxation.  The adjustments in the rates of income tax announced in the budget are seen as cynical by workers who naturally measure them against increases in VAT and the abolition of the £100 per child tax free allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing this budget and subsequently selling it on the media, bore testimony to the widely held belief that this Government are more interested in the image than the reality. With scarcely concealed contempt for everyone except himself, the Minister tried to dupe the county into believing that this budget brought some relief to <Col N="523" /> the taxpayer.  The undeniable reality is that the personal tax burden will increase considerably this year.  The tax taken from personal income and personal spending will increase rather than fall.  Its implications are extremely serious.  We know from the bitter experience of this Government that increased rates of taxation do not necessarily bring increased revenue.  I say with regret that I have no doubt that this budget will drive more people into the black economy.  It will also promote cross-Border shopping and increase unemployment.  With all the economic &ldquo;whizz-kiddery&rdquo; of the Minister, the Taoiseach and his colleagues in Government, they do not seem to grasp the reality of diminishing returns.  They do not seem to realise that if one pushes up, say, the price of petrol it becomes self-financing for more and more people to go into Northern Ireland to do their shopping.  At this moment petrol is £1 per gallon dearer here than it is in Northern Ireland.  If a Dubliner drives to Newry the cost of petrol for the round trip would be in the region of £12.  If the driver maximises the advantage of cheaper petrol in the North £12 will be saved on one tank-fill of petrol for the average car.  Therefore, the trip becomes selffinancing.</P>
    <P>If that is the case for a trip from Dublin, then surely there is a very positive incentive for people from the Border counties to cross the Border in order to buy their petrol.  It is bad enough to lose the revenue from petrol sales, but it is obvious that lots of other shopping will be done across the Border also.  I am in favour of increased contact between the people North and South, but contact and commerce that deprive us disproportionately of revenue and wipe out small businesses on this side of the Border are not beneficial to the advancement of good neighbourliness and not to our mutual benefit.  As tax on petroleum products has been sharply increased under the Government, sales have declined by about 30 per cent.  It is reasonable to assume that consumption has not dropped <Col N="524" /> by 30 per cent but that there is a huge increase in invisible imports and diesel sales from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Since this Government increased value-added tax on new houses from 3 per cent to 10 per cent, the building of private houses has dropped by about 4,000 per annum.  The construction industry has been devastated with its workforce cut by half in three years.  In last year's budget the value-added tax on new houses was doubled and this brought a decline of 15 per cent in new work in 1985.  The Construction Industry Federation pleaded in their pre-budget submission for a reversal of last years increase in VAT on new houses but to no avail. To add to their hardship those involved in the industry must now face the impact of a £25 million reduction in the public capital programme.  This will mean direct cuts in sanitary services of £4 million, schools £3 million, house purchase and improvement loans £2 million, farm modernisation scheme £3.2 million and IDA grants £3 million.  The construction industry is the most immediate industry to react to economic stimulation.  In face of spiralling unemployment that grew in 1985 at a rate of about nine times the average EC rate, one would expect the budget to at least undo the damage done in last year's budget, but that did not happen.</P>
    <P>The current administration is hell bent on a policy that has failed totally.  Any possible advantage to the economy is sacrificed for the possible expedient of a quick tax acquisition.  For instance, the new retention tax on the abolition of the disclosure requirements on bank deposits will likely result in an outflow of funds from building societies to the detriment of funds available for new house mortgages. Information released this morning by the building societies proves without any doubt that this fear, which was expressed on this side of the House at and from the time the announcement was made, has been realised.</P>
    <P>This is a further disadvantage for the construction industry.  It will lead inevitably to more unemployment.  This new withholding tax is just another weapon in <Col N="525" /> the armoury of the Government for the collection of further tax from Europe's already most overtaxed people.  As a tax it might have some merits, but its negative potentials are both unfair and damaging. The financial institutes are not to be taxed.  It is the savers who will be taxed irrespective of whether income tax on interest is within the tax free allowances. It is the saver who pays.  This is a dreadful state of affairs and the Government stand condemned for it now that the people recognise the content of the budget as presented four weeks ago by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The pensioner whose pension does not reach taxable levels will now be taxed on whatever interest he or she might earn on the few shillings that might be put aside for the rainy day or, in many instances, for a decent burial.  The child whose thrift is encouraged by prudent parents, who opens a bank account or building society account, becomes a taxpayer under this budget.  One would think that the Minister for Finance would want to promote savings and thrift rather than discourage them.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have had the deplorable experience of elderly people being robbed of their savings by wanton thugs who preyed on vulnerable people who were afraid to bank their money lest their pensions be cut on the basis of their savings.  Following a campaign to alleviate fears of pension cuts and encourage old people to entrust their savings to the financial institutions, the Minister shows an absence of compassion that is difficult to imagine and grabs a share of whatever interest might be earned without the slightest reference to the person's tax free allowance.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the new Finance Minister to look again with compassion at this tax and its implementation.  I should like to appeal to the members of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party who will support this Minister when the Finance Act comes before us for consideration to try to encourage their new Minister to be a bit more humane than his predecessor and to have regard to the situation which I have outlined which <Col N="526" /> cannot be denied by anybody.  If one were to pay any heed to the rhetoric of some members of this Government one might expect some generous gesture to the poor.</P>
    <P>By the Minister's own reckoning our inflation for the year will be 4.5 per cent. However, our social welfare recipients cannot even hope to maintain their current standard of living, poor as it might be.  They are to get only a 4 per cent increase which will not be implemented until the third week in July.  Therefore it is not a 4 per cent increase and those representatives of the Government who try to say on radio and television that it is should be seen as deliberately misleading the public at large.  The increase in July will not improve the lot of social welfare recipients.  In April they face a reduction in food subsidies.  Before they get the 4 per cent they face the immediate effects of increases in VAT and other charges. The hardship thus imposed on social welfare recipients is cruel and uncaring and most unbecoming of a Government who claim to have a rump of socialists in their composition.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that people have to turn more and more to charity for the essentials of life.  The St. Vincent de Paul Society have indicated a huge increase in the number of people to whom they give direct financial aid.  While the work of such charities is to be lauded, the growing need for their work is to be deplored. This budget pushes people, who are marginally making ends meet, into dependence on charity.  That is a fierce indictment of this budget.</P>
    <P>In the Adjournment debate last December I said I had no hope to convey to those engaged in agriculture and I have no hope to convey to them after this budget.  The only reference to agriculture in the budget relates to farmer taxation. There is absolutely no indication of support for the industry.  It is deplorable that an industry which employs one in every six members of the national workforce does not get any support or even an appraisal in the budget.  We may well face an EC imposed beef production quota within a matter of two to three years.  Are <Col N="527" /> we to start negotiating, as we did with milk and fish quotas, from a disadvantaged position with our herd halved in the past ten years?  One would have thought that the budget would have given some incentive for the enlargement of the national herd.</P>
    <P>The budget reflects an indifference towards people and an obsession with new tricks to broaden the scope of the tax collecting machinery.  There is an absence of attention to the creation of an economic climate that would stimulate economic activity and job creation. There is a failure to recognise that planning for the future must be comprehensive and ongoing.  Our EC quotas in milk production and fish catches underline the need for such plans.  The fact that we own 26 per cent of the territorial waters of the EC, but that we have only 4.6 per cent of the fish quota of the whole EC, underlines our responsibilities towards future generations in every area of endeavour and production that are likely to be controlled centrally by EC quotas.</P>
    <P>Our economic standing is one of depression.  Our people are despondent and dispirited.  We have a duty to provide them with leadership which will inspire in them confidence in the future, reward them for their efforts and give them pride in what they do and produce.  We have many assets that could facilitate economic recovery, This sterile budget will do nothing towards activating those assets.  It is another milestone in the sterile administration of a Coalition Government whose monetarist policy has left us with a catalogue of closures, rampantly growing unemployment and a national debt that is rising by £2,000 million each year.  We have the most heavily taxed workers in Europe and a dispirited people.  Economic recovery is and should be the major national priority.  It seems to be the policy of the current administration that nothing can happen until the tide of international commerce raises all boats.  We have a Government who lack the imagination, the enthusiasm and determination to spearhead an economic revival.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> The Government are circumscribed in every regard by their own narrow and blinkered perceptions.  Their policies have brought about a pervasive defeatism which threatens to kill national pride and enterprise.  The Government have failed to provide the stimulus for economic growth and recovery.  They will continue to fail because they are imprisoned by their own obsession with inventing new ways of collecting more and more tax from a people who are taxed to the point of exasperation.</P>
    <P>According to this budget, they will collect an additional £217 million in income tax in the coming year.  The budget deficit last year stood at £1.284 million, an alltime high.  We have an 18 per cent unemployment rate, the highest in the EC.  We have emigration running at an estimated 30,000 and rising.  Mortgage rates are rising and bank interest rates have been increased.  Increases in social welfare payments fall short of inflation rates. That is the context of the budget.  There is nothing positive in it.  It is just more of the same medicine we have been getting for over three years and our malaise is getting worse.  The prescription and treatment of the current doctor are not improving the economic health of the country.  It is high time that we had a replacement in our doctors and that the treatment was changed.  The monetarist experiment has failed.</P>

      <P>The experience for the country has been disastrous.  This country needs an opportunity to break free from the stranglehold of the Coalition.  Under a Fianna Fáil administration we would enjoy a creative and imaginative restoration of our economic vitality and social confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth budget of this Coalition Government must be set in the context of the dismal performance of the Taoiseach and the Government over the past three years.  This period in office has brought the country near to a state of economic and social collapse.  There is a hopelessness <Col N="529" /> and a lack of confidence that have never been there before.  Pride in their country has been taken from the people. The Taoiseach has given no leadership and no inspiration.  The Government have let unemployment rise to 240,000 people and up to 30,000 young people are emigrating on a yearly basis.  There is no sign that the Government have any idea how to tackle the problem.  Taxation has risen to exorbitant levels and the burden of public debt and cumulative budget deficits has soared.  There are few families who do not face difficulties in trying to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>It is our view that the Taoiseach is personally responsible in large measure for the present disastrous state of the Irish economy.  It is now openly admitted that he has successfully pushed his own half baked economic analyses and theories. He seriously misjudged the state of the economy when he first came into office and gave total priority, to the exclusion of all other economic objectives, to balancing the books through the imposition of higher taxes.  As the failure of this approach became increasingly evident, instead of changing it, as he should have, he persisted blindly in piling tax upon tax in every single year until we had reached the present deep-seated financial crisis which made it impossible for the Government to produce a credible budget this year.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy is in a state of diminishing returns.  The influence of the Taoiseach on the economic life of this country has been almost uniformly disastrous. In the 1973 General Election a Coalition programme, largely put together by the present Taoiseach, offered a free spending bonanza for the first time ever to the Irish electorate, including the abolition of VAT on food, the phased abolition of rates, the abolition of estate duties, old age pensions without means test, and other beautiful carrots for the people to take up.</P>
    <P>The first major effort in the politics of promise was largely the work of the Taoiseach.  As the record shows, he used his influence on the 1973-77 Coalition Government to encourage the running <Col N="530" /> up of a large current budget deficit and heavy foreign borrowing.  As a result, 1974 was the turning point, the year when Ireland first ceased to be a creditor nation.  He was the prime mover in starting the modern financial difficulties of this State.  In the 1981 election we had another false and deceptive programme offered to the electorate by the present Taoiseach.  He falsely promised housewives a weekly payment of £9.60 per week and a reduction in the standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent.  We had full page advertisements in the national newspapers at that time offering housewives £9.60 per week.  Shortly after, when the Taoiseach took office, we had full page advertisements telling people to apply for it, that the money was there and all they had to do was to apply. During the 1981 election campaign and afterwards in office the Taoiseach engaged in an immensely damaging political campaign to undermine confidence in the solvency of the economy from which, four years later, this country has not recovered.  That campaign had the sole objective of gaining short term political advantage by blackening his political opponents and proclaiming his own virtue.</P>
    <P>One must now look at the long list of failed initiatives introduced by the Taoiseach and the Government in that short period.  We were promised tax credits to introduce equity into the tax system and they have never been introduced.  It is now admitted that they are inequitable in their effects.  We were promised a committee on costs and competitiveness to determine wage norms.  This exercise turned out to be a complete non-event. The family income supplement was another device promoted by the Taoiseach to prove his social conscience.  Its implementation was long delayed and no sooner had it been introduced than it's abolition was forecast in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  In the event, the uptake has been poor and the impact minimal.</P>
    <P>Then we had a Cabinet employment task force which has neither been seen nor heard of for a long time now.  We are not sure if it still exists.  If it does, its <Col N="531" /> work surely can only be regarded as being useless.  This is the Government who introduced the residential property tax which brings in minimal revenue and costs the maximum to administer and has no positive impact on finances.  Up to the fourth year in office of this Government the NDC have created not one single job, but have displaced a reasonably useful and successful agency purely for political purposes.</P>
    <P>Another political expedient introduced by this Government was the land tax from which the little lamented former Minister for Finance could not enter a single penny of assured revenue in his budget calculations this year.  Another fiasco is the child benefit scheme which was to be taxable and which was to provide a big boost to low income families.  When it came to the point it was impossible to administer and it has been scrapped.  It is obvious that the Government and the Taoiseach have wasted time, energy and taxpayers' money on a series of half baked ideas and proposals which were never properly thought out, while the real problems had not been tackled.</P>
    <P>We should look at the Government's principle failure documents.  The joint programme for Government has long ago been discarded, its main provisions having been breached within a few months. <i>Building on Reality</i> missed its main targets on employment, on public service pay and the budget deficit long ago.  The new industrial policy to date has not even succeeded in halting the decline in industrial employment and the cold reality is that we have a live register figure of 240,000 unemployed.  We have massive emigration, though good care is taken to ensure that reliable statistics are not given.  In one small parish in the western part of County Limerick local people did a survey and found that in the past three years 40 young people had left the parish and had emigrated to England and the US.  The Government have not got an employment policy.  The construction industry has been completely devastated with employment virtually halved since <Col N="532" /> 1981.  Growth has been negligible, with investment down to the level of 20 years ago.  Agriculture faces a bleak future.</P>
    <P>When we had responsibility in Government from 1977 to 1981 we created 80,000 jobs.  Regrettably, under this administration we have succeeded only in losing jobs.  Even though the national debt has soared from £12 billion to £20.4 billion, public capital investment has been cut by over one-third in real terms and the current budget deficit of 8.2 per cent is at a record level.  Since 1982, an extra £2 billion has been extracted in tax from the public and over £0.5 billion extra is to be collected in taxes this year, a rise of almost 10 per cent.  These are the facts. This budget was heralded by Government spokespersons and the Minister for Finance, who was fired, as reducing income tax, whereas we will be collecting an extra £217 million in income tax.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government have approved and defended the introduction of a grossly unfair and inequitable provision this year whereby the income of old age pensioners, charities and the savings of children will be taxed. The Taoiseach and the Government cannot point to one success in economic management and, even though the people will look back on the ghastly years of this Government with something close to revulsion, it would appear that the Taoiseach is already scheming to prolong the agony of this nation with another of his disastrous Coalitions.</P>
    <P>In the difficult and dangerous circumstances of today people would wish to feel that this Government would now recognise the real extent of the damage they have done.  The Government have lost their nerve under pressure.  People see that they cannot be sure of the leadership of their Government and they are not satisfied that they have a leader in Government who can stand up to the pressures of Government, a person who will not collapse in a crisis.</P>
    <P>I say to this Government and their leader that no matter how they or he try to shuffle off responsibility for the political crisis which has overtaken them, no matter how they or he try to shuffle <Col N="533" /> off responsibility for the economic crisis confronting the country, no matter how the Leader of the Government in particular tries to apportion blame to other Ministers, no matter what punishment he metes out to those Ministers for their acts of commission or omission, he is the person who appointed them and he must carry responsibility for their actions and deeds.  No matter what kind of juggling or balancing act the Taoiseach engages in, the people will rightly hold him accountable for the present unacceptable state of affairs.  The years of this Coalition Government, 1983-86, have been the wasted years when the country went steadily downhill, difficulties mounted and national morale sank lower and lower, and it is not possible to dissociate this collapse from the ineffective and bumbling leadership of the Government and their leader.  The time has now come for them to move over.  They owe it to the country to go now rather than later and to make way for a Government to tackle the job which they have failed to do.  This Government have shown clearly that their policies have failed.  They have lost the confidence of the people, demoralised the young, depressed the remainder and deprived the old.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the hamfisted and brutal manner in which the proposed closure of hospitals was announced by Deputy Barry Desmond, then Minister for Health and Social Welfare, on behalf of the Taoiseach and the Government. This announcement surely typifies the uncaring, insensitive and arrogant approach of this Government to the implementation of their policies.  I would like to think that we have in any Government people who show care and understanding for ill people and a sensitive approach to them and to their plight.</P>
    <P>There can be little dissension as to whether hospitals should close.  We must recognise the level of dependence on hospital care for the treatment and support of mentally ill people particularly. The only justification for deinstitutionalisation and its accompanying upheaval must be that the potential and quality of life enjoyed by mentally ill persons is <Col N="534" /> improved significantly by moving out of hospital and into a local community where care services are provided for them.  Rigorous and continual evaluation of the achievement of this ultimate objective is essential.</P>
    <P>We accept that the predominant policy for mental health services in the future lies in a move away from institutionally dominated mental health care towards services provided in a range of easily accessible, locally based services.  The development of alternatives to hospital services is not a cheaper form of care.  If the process it to be achieved effectively then sufficient moneys must be forthcoming from Government in order to ensure continuity of service both during the transition and following hospital closures. Unfortunately, the Minister for Health has made no effort to address himself clearly to these points.</P>
    <P>The process of successful transition will be achieved only by co-operation with hospital staff who are optimistic about their role in their patients' future and who are supportive of patients and their relatives in their uncertainty, yet the manner in which this announcement was made has alienated staff and is leading quickly to major confrontation.  Community services must be planned and developed on principles concerned with the enhancement of citizenship rather than the promotion of dependence and with reducing the inequalities caused by the experience of mental illness in institutionalisation. Community services must ensure that mental illness is not seen as a badge of alienation, and these objectives must permeate planning and development of locally based services.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no provision whatsoever to cater for the people who are being told to vacate these hospitals. This is a brutal and callous decision.  I would like to appeal to the many decent minded people in both parties making up this Coalition Government for God's sake to have a talk with their members of Government and particularly with their leader and with the Minister for Health and ask them to reverse this decision. They would surely make this appeal <Col N="535" /> unanimously if they could only understand the problems there for these people who are going to be ejected from these institutions.  I would like to add my voice to those who have already appealed to the Minister and to the Taoiseach to do something about this inhuman and brutal decision of theirs.</P>
    <P>I would like to say one or two words about tourism because it is an especially important area that needs encouragement and investment.  It continues to be a growth industry in this country and its long term prospects with its employment potential are good.  I fear that this Government have not really recognised this tourist potential.  True, they have decreased the VAT rate to 10 per cent for restaurants but we must now make sure that this decrease will be passed on to the customer.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what the plans are, in conjunction with State agencies, to maximise the potential of this country for tourism.  What incentives have the Government given to the industry to increase accommodation and provide more efficient services?  There is fantastic potential here, and while I recognise that Bord Fáilte are doing an excellent job they must be given more backing and support.  There is need for somebody who would have specific responsibility at the Government table for ensuring that we develop tourism as it should be developed.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one small comment, if I may, on something said by Deputy Liam Cosgrave.  I share his concern about the question of the introduction of the new National Lottery, this national raffle that obviously the Government are now falling back on in an effort to finance a number of areas.  If my memory is correct, the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement said that among other things he hoped to finance hospitals from a national lottery.  We are now going to provide moneys for the hospitals from this lottery and also money for the arts, sports and the like.  I welcome all the help that can be given in these areas but I want to voice a word of caution.  I share Deputy Cosgrave's view <Col N="536" /> that a number of voluntary charities are doing tremendous work as a result of moneys they raise through non-stop draws, weekly collections, raffles and the like, and we must make full sure that these groups are not put out of action.  In particular I name one &mdash; Gael Linn.  They have been doing tremendous work over the years.  There are many others I could name, but I name that organisation in particular.  I should like to think that all these people would be able to maintain their incomes through their organisations.</P>
    <P>The old Irish Sweepstakes lottery for many years was a great success and for some reason or other best known to the Government those involved were not included but I hope the Irish Sweepstakes will be incorporated into the running of this lottery.  It is pretty sad that in a budget debate we have to talk of such things as national lotteries.  It is a sad reflection on the Government and the economy that we have to depend on lotteries to do the job for us.  This Government should never be allowed to forget that there are 240,000 people unemployed and that number is growing.  It would be far greater if a proper record were kept of those out of jobs and if those emigrating on a yearly basis were taken into account.  We have a taxation burden that is crippling and is encouraging more and more people into the black economy.</P>
    <P>The Government feel that they must cling on to office for their own petty, party, selfish reasons.  They are aware that the general public have rejected them.  The polls show that only one in four or thereabouts now supports the two Government parties.  For whatever length of time they feel brazen and barefaced enough to hang on in Government, would they please do something about the real problems that face the nation?  If not, would they please move out of the way, go to the country, have an election and let the people sort it out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to correct an impression Deputy Collins may have given to the House when he spoke about the need for some encouragement to increase the national herd.  He seemed to indicate that there were no moneys in the budget directed towards this very worthy cause. Of course, that is not the case.  The budget provides an extra £11.4 million specifically for increasing the national herd and does that by way of increasing the headage payments for beef cows in disadvantaged areas from £32 to £70 per head.  That will involve 45,000 farmers, so one can see the significance of that.  It is a very large sum of money.  It is a very generous inducement to people to increase the number of cattle they rear. In that context, I might also mention that we are now financing an additional 1¼ million acres of disadvantaged areas embracing a further 12,500 farmers entitled to the headage increase to which I have just referred.  It would be entirely inaccurate to say that we are not doing anything about increasing the national herd.  We are doing a great deal under very difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer in particular to the great difficulty which the European Community are at present experiencing in agriculture, the effects of which are felt <Col N="538" /> everywhere in the Community.  Because of the enormous surpluses, the Community's budgetary situation is anything but healthy.  As a result, the Agricultural Commissioner, Mr. Andriessen, has proposed some pretty drastic and draconian measures which, if implemented, would affect farming in this country in a very alarming manner.</P>
    <P>I can see the Commissioner's difficulties. They come from the production of enormous surpluses which amount approximately to the following: 15 million tonnes of grain in storage &mdash; it is almost impossible to visualise such a quantity &mdash; in excess of one million tonnes of butter; 690,000 tonnes of beef; together with considerable surpluses of wine, skim milk powder and a whole variety of other products.  The value of surpluses in Europe today is five times greater than it was four years ago.  That statistic alone is very sobering.  The magnitude of the surpluses illustrates the magnitude of the problem.</P>
    <P>We cannot run away from it and pretend there is no problem.  We cannot pretend we can escape the results of the difficult decisions that will have to be made in the coming years, particularly if the Commission does not succeed in getting rid of those surpluses.  Getting rid of them will be a very difficult matter because of the amount of money needed to do so.  Those surpluses generally are sold off at approximately half price &mdash; about half what the Commission and the Community originally paid for them.</P>
    <P>With that background, one can see the particular difficulty agriculture faces immediately and in the years ahead in the Community.  When we take other factors into consideration the position is even more difficult.  Some of the other considerations are as follows.  A recent American farm Bill helps American farmers to sell their produce off in the world markets, and gives them a better support system.  That makes it more difficult for the Community to sell off their surpluses.  The Americans have allowed the increased production of milk to continue and so have the New Zealanders. This creates difficulties for us on world <Col N="539" /> markets.  The Americans, by their support system, are encouraging the production of more cereals.  Again with the enormous surplus and intervention which I mentioned, it creates tremendous problems for us on the world market.</P>
    <P>Probably the proposal which creates the major difficulty for us at the moment is that which would virtually end intervention for beef in the Community.  The beef trade is the backbone of Irish agriculture and, if intervention were abolished or were even seriously curtailed it would have a very depressing effect on the price of cattle and hence on our beef trade generally.  That is what the Commissioner proposed &mdash; virtually to abolish intervention.  We in this country put about 17 per cent of all beef produced into intervention.  Depending on the amount of production from year to year, that approximates to 80,000 to 90,000 tonnes of beef.  For all practical purposes, the abolition of intervention would mean that we would be left with 80,000 to 90,000 tonnes of beef on hand.</P>
    <P>Comparatively speaking, when one considers the size of the agricultural output here in comparision with that of the other countries in the Community, we produce and export more beef than any other country, so the implications of the Commissioner's proposals would affect us far more than any of the other countries.</P>
    <P>The other element is an unfortunate one and we are partially, if not largely, to blame ourselves in that we put more of our beef into intervention proportionately than any other country.  We have to face up to the fact that we should not be so dependent on intervention.  We should be able to sell virtually everything we produce.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair of me to make a blanket criticism of beef processors or traders here because some of them have done Herculean work in recent years. They are probably the most progressive and aggressive businessmen in our society.  They can go to almost any country in the world and sell Irish beef.  Unfortunately, not everybody has been up to <Col N="540" /> that standard &mdash; hence our reliance on intervention.  I do not want to be taken as being facetious, but one company several years ago advertised for a salesman with experience in selling beef into intervention. The stupidity of that may not dawn on people, but of course you do not sell beef into intervention &mdash; you put it into intervention.  That is the way some Irish processors in the past looked upon intervention: it was the place to get rid of your beef, and they made no attempt to go out to sell it on the open market.</P>
    <P>We have a tremendous band of processors and traders who can compete with anybody, whether in South America, East Europe, Australia or New Zealand. Unfortunately, we have not got enough to them.  Things are improving and we should be in a position when we will not be dependent on intervention or storage at all.</P>
    <P>We sell much of our beef to third countries, the Middle East and North Africa, for instance.  But there is a tremendous market in Europe, much of it still untapped. In the past, 40 per cent of our beef went to Britain, 30 per cent to third countries, we consumed 20 per cent at home and 10 per cent went to mainland Europe, our EC partner nations.  We can improve our market share in other EC countries with a more positive and aggressive marketing policy.  There are now 320 million people in the EC, the single largest economic unit in the world. If we have people with marketing ability we should not have any problems about selling our produce because our beef and lamb are recognised as the best in the world.  All we need are marketing skills and abilities.  If we have stuff to sell we should be able to sell it because the market-place is beside our doorstep.</P>
    <P>One factor that will cause some difficulty, but it may also give us some opportunities, is the recent decision by the Community to ban the use of hormones or growth promoters.  That ban will be implemented from 1 January 1988.  We have two years in which to put matters in order, a time in which growth promoters should not be used.  Shortly, I will be bringing in regulations prohibiting the <Col N="541" /> use of hormones or growth promoters completely, other than for therapeutic or animal health reasons.  The weight of animals, of course, will be affected by the non-use of hormones or growth promoters but we will be able to go abroad into any markets and say that we have the purest and best quality beef in the world.  We can use it to our advantage.</P>
    <P>Our neighbours in Britain and Northern Ireland will have an exemption for a further year, up to January 1989.  Though they will have an advantage in regard to weight, we will have a greater advantage by being able to say that our meat is hormone free and their's is not, something which our traders and processors will be able to take advantage of.  Up to now, we have not been able to sell beef in Italy or Greece, because they contend that their consumers will not accept meat which has been treated with hormones &mdash; their standards are so much higher than ours.  That bargaining will go out the window with the ban on hormones, so we will be opening up a market which was closed to us of approximately 70 million additional people.  With the accession of Spain and Portugal we will have a further 60 million people.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we are good enough, if we can market properly, we should be able to overcome many of the difficulties which would be created if intervention for beef is removed.  I have opposed the removal of intervention and I will continue to do so.  If it is to take place we hope it will be many years hence.  The effect of removing intervention from December 1987 would be drastic as far as our beef trade is concerned.  That is one Commission proposal which we are opposing strongly.</P>
    <P>A second proposal by the Commission is that the price paid for cereals in certain circumstances should be reduced considerably. The growing of cereals here at the best of times is a marginal farm activity from the point of view of profits, and when we have a year like 1985 it is not just marginal but is a serious loss for farmers.  What the Commission are proposing immediately is that there will be a co-responsibility levy of 3 per cent to <Col N="542" /> help to pay for the cost of getting rid of surpluses.  Quality standards are to be introduced which would penalise poorer quality grain, grain which is not millable. Unfortunately because of our climate, the moisture content of grain here is quite high and in certain years, like 1985, it is exceptionally high.  The penalty clause attached to quality standards would mean a further serious reduction for grain growers here.  In general, the proposals would have serious repercussions for cereal growers.</P>
    <P>The background to this proposal is interesting and, perhaps, somewhat logical. The French feel they can sell grain on world markets at a lower price than the Americans and the Canadians. People are stunned when they hear that, but it is a fact.  The French are a major cereal growing nation, the quality of their grain is exceptionally good and their production methods exceptionally efficient. They are now at a stage where they feel they can out-sell the Americans and the Canadians on the world market and to do that they want to get the price down to at least American and Canadian levels. They are fully behind the Commission's proposals to introduce quality standards which will reduce the price of inferior grain.  The Commission are delighted that somebody should suggest that the price of grain, or any commodity, should be reduced.  The British usually advocate that but on this occasion the French are doing it.  That is unusual because, like ourselves, they are generally looking for price increases for just about every agricultural commodity that can be produced.</P>
    <P>Here we have a situation where it suits one of the major nations to have a price reduction so that they can out-sell their competitors on the world market.  They are being supported not just by the Commission but by the British and a few other countries.  Countries such as Germany and ourselves will oppose that and it will be a fairly long drawn out discussion. I expect the price proposal talks this year, which embrace these proposals, to go on until at least May, and possibly June, because of the magnitude and <Col N="543" /> seriousness of the proposals being put forward.  We have the curtailment of beef intervention, this quality penalty on grain, which would mean a considerable price reduction, and the proposal to have a milk cessation scheme which would effectively reduce the amount of milk produced in the Community by 3 per cent in each member state &mdash; that would be an actual cutback in production of 3 per cent.  This has certain similarities with the super-levy but it is not as draconian. Nevertheless, it is a very serious and potentially damaging proposal, if implemented, for this country.</P>
    <P>The Commission is also suggesting that each country should have its own national cessation scheme of 3 per cent.  This means that there would be a redistribution of milk within a country and we are in favour of that idea.  It would mean that people who had difficulties, whether through disease, or a young farmer coming into milk production, would have some hope of getting a quota, and a person who wanted to retire from milk production could get a reasonable amount of money for giving it up.  That type of national redistribution of milk is something we are in favour of.  The umbrella organisation for agricultural cooperatives, the ICOS, are endeavouring to formulate a scheme which will be acceptable to farmers, the Government and the EC alike.  I wish them success in their efforts and we will be only too glad to support them in the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>The EC cessation scheme is not acceptable to us because it would breach not just the spirit but the wording of the March 1984 super-levy agreement which specifically states that the amount of milk produced in Ireland cannot be reduced during the five year period of the super-levy regime.  Other countries will contend that this is a new situation and everybody will have to take a 3 per cent cutback. This is one of the issues which will be hotly debated in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Here we have in one year three proposals which, if any one of them is implemented, <Col N="544" /> will affect agriculture to an enormous degree.  The 1986 price package discussions assume an importance which we have never seen before.  One could say they are of greater magnitude than the super-levy proposal two years ago, which caused all sorts of ripples in the dairy industry in Ireland and throughout Europe.  These three major proposals are zoned to reduce prices and production in the Community.  This means we have an exceptionally important price negotiations schedule over the next few months.  In conjunction with those proposals the Commission proposes a price freeze for all agricultural commodities. We find that unacceptable because to keep in line with the spirit of Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome farm incomes must be protected.  If we have a price freeze in conjunction with an inflation rate of something like 4 per cent to 5 per cent, farm incomes will not be protected, they will be reduced.  We want to see increases which at least compensate for inflation and increased costs.</P>
    <P>We are supported in that, initially, by the Germans but unfortunately I cannot tell the House that we have had support from any other member country.  There seems to be a general acceptance by other countries, with the exception of Germany, that there will be a price freeze in the current year.  Given the state of the Community's budget people are prepared to suffer a price freeze.  That is unfortunate but it is the line which I saw promoted at this week's meeting of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of inconsistency in the Community's attitude towards agricultural production and imports of agricultural products.  I want to refer specifically to agricultural products which are produced within the Community.  The Community is a trading bloc and in order to sell consumer goods it has to have reciprocal trading relations with virtually every country in the world.  Some of these countries produce only commodities which are also produced in the Community. In order to generate trade with these countries the Community allows imports into the Twelve of commodities it produces, <Col N="545" /> for instance beef, cereal and even milk products.  These are generally referred to as concessionary imports.</P>
    <P>These concessionary imports are causing us an immense amount of difficulty. It seems illogical that when we have surpluses of the magnitude to which I have referred we should import those same commodities into the Community.  When you have 15 million tonnes of wheat and other cereals in storage, it seems illogical to import cereals or cereal substitutes into the Community but unfortunately that is the case.  We have constantly objected to this and we have been supported by one or two countries but, unfortunately, we do not have a majority of countries supporting us in our demand that these concessionary imports should be stopped, or at least curtailed.</P>
    <P>It is very aggravating to allow commodities into the Community when there is already a very large surplus of them.  I will illustrate the point by saying that the Community are importing 175,000 head of live cattle despite the fact that we have 690,000 tonnes of beef in intervention. A fortnight ago at a special agricultural commitee meeting the Community voted to allow in 4,000 tonnes of beef from Austria.  We did not have that importation before this year.  They suddenly decided to allow this importation despite the fact that we have 690,000 tonnes in intervention and we will find immense difficulty in getting rid of it.  One can see the contradiction and the difficulty created for all of us when they allow in commodities which are in over-supply. The reason they are allowing them in is to retain their trading relationship with those countries.</P>
    <P>We import a massive amount of cereal substitutes, in particular corn gluten from the United States and tapioca and manioc from the Far East, despite the fact that we have 15 million tonnes of cereals in intervention.  I cannot see the consistency in doing this.  We will have to insist that there is a reduction in these imports.  I hope we will get more support in the future from the other member states.  We have support from the French where the cereal substitutes are concerned, and we have support from some countries where <Col N="546" /> the beef imports are concerned but the support is not sufficiently strong and it is not a position where one can stop them on one's own.  One must have a majority to do it.  It would be better to use the word &ldquo;curtail&rdquo; rather than use the word &ldquo;stop&rdquo; because it is not a reasonable proposition that you can stop them completely. A lot of the imports come in under GATT arrangements which are internationally binding legally and you cannot stop them.  The only way they can be stopped is by bilateral agreements between the Community and the countries involved.</P>
    <P>These concessionary imports are causing us great problems and it is necessary that they be curtailed if the problems in the three major commodity areas of milk, beef and cereals are to be solved or the intensity of them reduced.  Those overhanging surpluses are causing such problems that I feel the Community in general &mdash; I mean the overall Commission and the Governments of the 12 member states &mdash; should seriously consider providing funds specifically to get rid of those surpluses because agriculture in the Community will be in dire straits for years to come if those surpluses are allowed to remain.  The value of those surpluses is five times as much as it was four years ago and it will cost the Community five times as much to get rid of them.</P>
    <P>The sensible thing is for the Community to make a special effort to get rid of those surpluses and to operate the CAP in the future in such a way that surpluses do not arise.  By prudent management of agricultural production within the Community together with a curtailment of concessionary imports, that can be done. It will cost a lot of money and will take a good deal of will power and political skill to do it.  If it is not done, there is no simple or easy solution for any farmers within the Community.  It is very important that it should be done because of the dependence of our economy on agriculture. When we have an unhealthy situation such as we have with those surpluses it must give all of us serious cause for concern.  It is a problem which will remain with us for many years unless it is tackled <Col N="547" /> with great resolve very soon.  I believe the public in general understand the problem we have with those surpluses and that we will not get major price increases and we will not be allowed to expand production as much as we would like to until the Community get rid of those surpluses.</P>
    <P>We must examine alternative methods of agricultural production.  Some of us are already looking at this very seriously. Because of climatic and soil conditions we are limited to a relatively small range of agricultural activities.  We are primarily involved in the production of beef, milk, sheep, pigs, cereals and sugar beet. We also produce some vegetables.  The major commodities we produce are giving rise to problems in the Community. Over 70 per cent of our agricultural production is devoted to beef and milk production and 8 per cent of our agricultural production is devoted to cereals. Over 80 per cent of the agricultural production involves commodities which are in huge surplus and because of that there will be difficulties in those areas for years to come.</P>
    <P>It is important that people consider other types of agricultural production. There is no place where the ingenuity of the Irish farmer is seen to greater effect than in the Ceann Comhairle's and Deputy Leonard's constituency.  Those people have not got the best land in the country but they make very good use of it.  We need activities like intensive pig, poultry and egg production.  Mushroom growing has been a fantastic success in recent years.  The value of our exports of that commodity is now running at £20 million a year.  This has been largely due to the industry of farmers in the Border counties.  Those industries seem to be concentrated more in the Border areas than in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>We must get our farmers to think in terms of alternative systems of production. There is an infinite number of them. We keep saying we cannot do it, that we have not got the right climate or the right soil.  Our climate does not militate against the production of a wide variety of products. We will have to study those various <Col N="548" /> alternative systems.  I have asked the Community for help in this matter and I will continue to press for assistance during the current price negotiations for this type of alternative agricultural activity.  I have set up a committee within my Department to examine the various types of alternative activities which they feel can be engaged in.  I have enlisted the aid of semi-State bodies, such as ACOT and An Foras Talúntais, at the highest level, and will continue to do so. We need alternative systems.  If there is pressure on major commodities we will have to take that pressure off by diversifying or spreading our energies around into other activities.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins spoke about an impending quota on beef production here.  I would not like to give rise to scaremongering of that nature.  There is no immediate threat or mention of quotas on beef production.  I should like to make that quite clear to the House.  While the Community produces approximately 110 per cent of its beef needs, the fact that we export so much enables us to expand that production.  Our third country markets are considerable.  There is no question of a quota system being implemented in the beef sector.  The only commodity which we produce to any degree here which is not in surplus in the Community is sheep and sheepmeat.  The Community is 75 per cent only sufficient in sheepmeat. Therefore, there is enormous scope for expansion in the sheep industry.</P>
    <P>The sheep population of this country has increased by 20 per cent in the past five years.  That is quite a considerable increase and the quality of the sheep is continuously improving as are sheep breeding methods and techniques.  But we have a long way to go.  I might give the House a simple illustration of the type of competition we face in the sheepmeat industry.  The lambing rate in Britain per ewe is approximately 1.7 to 1.8 whereas the lambing rate here per ewe is 1.1 only, a very low figure in comparison when one considers that the conditions are somewhat similar.  By improving our breeding techniques we should be able to attain something like 1.7 or 1.8.  That is what <Col N="549" /> we need to do to make these enterprises highly profitable.  There is an enormous market for Irish sheepmeat, or Irish lamb, on the Continent, particularly in France. There is unlimited potential there.  Our production is a fraction only of what it should be.</P>
    <P>I might point out that our beef production methods are not the best either.  The number of calf mortalities here annually runs at 200,000.  Just think of the value to our economy of 200,000 calves were they brought to maturity.  If one uses a conservative figures of £500 per annum, multiplying 200,000 by 500, one arrives at a figure of approximately £100 million per annum being lost to our economy, at least £100 million.  Calf mortalities can be reduced enormously by improved techniques and farm management, as can the level of sheep production.</P>
    <P>A matter that is causing quite a deal of concern in the farming community at present is disease eradication and the cutbacks that were effected in this area in the Book of Estimates.  This is one subject about which I feel particularly sore or bad because we are on the brink of making a major breakthrough in disease eradication.  One of the famous myths according to some people is that it goes on for ever.  Some people want to perpetuate its existence for their own purposes.  I do not believe that; it is a myth.  Following a fairly lengthy dispute, at the end of 1984 and the beginning of 1985 I reached agreement with the Irish Veterinary Union on a new system of operation of disease eradication.  That new system has worked wonderfully well because of the co-operation of vets, farmers and departmental officials.  Anybody involved in farming will tell you that they can visibly see the results of the new scheme.  The changes mean that the Minister of the day controls the scheme. He actually tells vets when and where to test whereas, previously, it was a hit and miss operation.</P>
    <P>We have had 30 years in which, by present-day standards, approximately £1 billion was spent without any major advance being effected in eradicating disease. When we began the very intensive testing last April and May obviously we <Col N="550" /> detected quite a large number of affected herds because it was the first full round that had been carried out over a number of years.  With continued and sustained testing we can see already the benefits of such intensive methods.  For example, in October last there were 7,100 restricted herds in this country.  Those are very graphic statistics &mdash; 7,100 restricted herds.  Within the last few weeks that number has been reduced to 5,700.  If we can sustain the intensity of testing being carried out over the past ten months, the elimination of bovine TB will no longer be a pious platitude.  It will be a reality.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that we will have the money necessary to sustain that intensive testing programme.  I am very concerned and anxious that we sustain that rate of testing because then, within two years, I can foresee that bovine TB will be virtually eliminated in this country.  It will never be eliminated completely but we will have it down to the levels pertaining generally in Western Europe.  That is rather important.  Some time ago I spoke about the need to promote Irish beef as being freshly produced on grass, being of the highest quality and free from hormones.  It is very important also that we should be able to say it is free from all types of disease and contamination, all types.  Therefore, it is very important from this country's point of view that bovine TB be eliminated as far as possible.  Of course, it will recur in pockets here and there, as it does in Britain, western France and so on.  It will never be totally eliminated but we must bring it down to an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to tell the House that, for all practical purposes, brucellosis has been virtually eliminated.  There are at present 490 herds only in the country affected by the disease.  In coming months we expect to reduce that figure by 50 per cent, such is the degree of control we have over it at present.</P>
    <P>I must do my party piece here and mention some other achievements we have brought about in recent months. I might refer to the farm improvement scheme which replaced the old farm modernisation scheme.  The scheme has <Col N="551" /> been welcomed generally.  It has proved to be better than people had hoped.  The rates of grant are at least as good as those obtaining under the old farm modernisation scheme.  It has the added value that it applies to all farmers.  One does not have to be in the category of development, transitional or commercial; it applies to everybody.  Whether or not a farmer benefited under the old farm modernisation scheme, he can still benefit under the new one.  The new scheme has three main thrusts.  One is the housing of livestock, cattle and sheep, the second is land drainage and the third is the encouragement of silage making. We all know the necessity for the encouragement of silage making after a summer such as we had in 1985.  The days of making hay for winter fodder should be numbered.  We are providing generous grants for silage making in the new farm improvement scheme.  We are also providing an installation aid scheme for young farmers.  This will mean that a young farmer taking over from his parents will automatically get a grant of £5,600.  He will also get a further grant of £5,600 if he carries out improvement works.  In all he will get as much as £11,200, a very generous sum.  In order to qualify for that grant he must have an ACOT certificate in farming but I do not think that is an unreasonable requirement.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the cuts in the budget for ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  That is unfortunate but every Department has had to suffer cuts. The Minister for Health, the Minister for Education, the Arts Council and even the Minister for Labour have had to cut back.  ACOT and An Foras Talúntais should be able to cope even with the cuts which have been imposed.  We are currently spending over £50 million on advice, research and education in farming. Of that, 75 per cent comes from the taxpayer.  We must ask those people who provide a service to charge for it and make it pay to a certain degree.  We do not expect them to be self-financing. ACOT are expecting an extra £2 million <Col N="552" /> this year from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>I referred to the necessity for more silage making in this country.  I want now to refer to the success of the scheme which we brought in last August for first-time silage makers.  We anticipated that there would be £8,000 applicants and that it would cost £1.5 million.  In fact the scheme was so successful that there were 30,000 applicants and the cost was £6 million.  Some people complain that we did not do enough for people who had difficulties with the weather last summer. We do not control the weather but we made a lot of money available when it was not too freely available in any Department.  I am annoyed at the criticism from certain people in the farming organisations that the Department of Agriculture handed back £27 million to the Exchequer at the end of 1985.  Every Department at some stage hands money back to the Exchequer.  If country councils or local authorities do not spend their allocation on road works or housing it goes back to the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>If a Department does not spend what it got in the Estimates, it goes back to central funds.  In 1985 there were two Departments other than Agriculture which underspent by £20 million.  That money automatically went back to central funds.  At the end of 1984 one Department, and it was not the Department of Agriculture, had £43 million left over which went back to central funds.  Of the £27 million underspent by the Department of Agriculture in 1985 I used £20 million to finance relief schemes.  To be accused of handing it back after having to fight very hard to get it is very annoying.  I do not think very well of people who know what happened but who do not admit to knowing and who do not appreciate what happened. First-time silage makers received £6 million. Over £13 million went on the feed voucher scheme which has been tremendously successful, so much so that all I <Col N="553" /> have been getting for the past two months, as Deputy Leonard and Deputy Conaghan know, are requests to accept late applications.  Some people misled farmers into believing that that scheme was not worth applying for, that it was going to be useless.  I remember Opposition spokesmen saying that the scheme was farcical.  Farmers' spokesmen say that the scheme was a mickey mouse scheme.  My experience is that farmers generally are delighted with the money they got from the scheme.  Some farmers got up to £400 for feeding stuffs for their livestock.</P>
      <P>I brought forward the payment of headage grants and by doing that spent an extra £20 million.  We spent £2 million on an interest subsidy for tillage farmers. I would like to have had more but times are tough.  We got 125,000 tonnes of grain from the EC at a reduced price.  I mentioned the fact that from 1 January about 1,250,000 additional acres are included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  In the current year that will cost £6.7 million. An additional 12,500 farmers will benefit from the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Headage payment for beef cows was increased from £32 to £70, the maximum allowed under EC regulations.  In the current year that will cost an estimated £11.4 million.  It will be a tremendous incentive to the growth of the national herd.  We are increasing the headage payment for first-time owners of cows in the seriously disadvantaged areas.  Up until now cows were rated at only 80 per cent of the livestock unit.  We increased that to 100 per cent.  Previously a farmer in a seriously disadvantaged area was paid at a maximum of up to eight cows but he will now be paid for up to ten cows.  Those farmers will receive an additional £1.1 million in 1986.  Taking all those things into account we are dealing with a very large sum of money, about £50 million or £60 million.  I extended the headage payments to include Connemara ponies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>All in all, spending on agriculture has increased, between Exchequer and EC funds, from £218 million in 1975 to £1,222 million in 1985.  Over ten years the amount spent on support for agriculture has been multiplied sixfold. About two-thirds comes from the EC.  It has been won by hard graft.  They just do not give it to you, you have to fight for it.  I will conclude by saying that where we are falling down most of all is in the price we are getting for our product.</P>
      <P>If there is one way in which farmers can get a considerably increased income it is by getting a better price for their commodity.  I will illustrate that by saying that a farmer in Ireland gets an average 75p for a gallon of milk, in Denmark a farmer gets 97p.  The same pertains to beef prices.  We are not getting the maximum value for our product.  That is something all of us in agriculture, be it the Minister, the officials in the Department, the farming organisations and the farmers themselves, should look at and ask themselves have they got the most efficient processing systems.  Why are the Danes getting 97p a gallon for milk and why are we getting only 75p?  That is a major problem and it takes a bit of answering.  Everybody involved in agriculture should pay particular attention to the fact that he is not getting the best value for money as regards his products.  That is where the greatest possibilities lie for Irish agriculture in the immediate future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been a very interesting defence by the Minister for Agriculture.  To one not an agriculturist, much of what the Minister has said sounded very much like a poor defence <Col N="555" /> of what he has been trying to do over the past 12 months.  The budget debate at this time is probably irrelevant on a number of counts.  Firstly, within a matter of days it was dismissed by the public as being a very poor budgetary exercise which would leave everybody worse off than he or she was prior to budget day.  Secondly, the Taoiseach decided that it was time to kill off the 1986 budget when he decided to dismiss its architect, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, only two weeks later.  At that time, the opinion polls had also told the Taoiseach that the budget had been rejected by over 90 per cent of the people and that they saw it as a total failure which did nothing to meet the very serious needs of the present economic climate.  It was quite rightly rejected by the people in the same way that the Government abandoned their own policy document, <i>Building on Reality,</i> which was introduced in late 1984 with great acclaim.</P>
      <P>This Government also conveniently buried other economic targets which they had set themselves on coming into office only three and a half years ago.  The 1986 budget represented a continuation of the Government's policies which have brought such gloom and doom to the many thousands of families all over the country.  It has been the major cause of the vast and very serious explosive unemployment situation that exists at present. The budget also ensured that there will be continuing mass unemployment, continuing massive personal taxation, a continuing increase in the national debt and further cutbacks in essential services. Only 24 hours after the Minister had introduced the budget the Minister for Health came into the House and announced savage cutbacks in hospitalisation which will result in the closure of eight hospitals.  The Minister for Health in turn was followed by the Minister for Education who dropped the now infamous bombshell on Carysfort College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister for Health successfully challenged and defeated the <Col N="556" /> Taoiseach in the recent Government reshuffle he has bounced back again and promised us further cuts in medical and hospital expenditure as well as promising to close down nurse training centres which he sees as being totally unnecessary and uneconomical.  The budget offered no hope whatever to a population who are disillusioned and depressed with the position in which this country now finds itself.  During 1985 unemployment continued its upward spiral as hundreds of companies closed down.  To make the situation even more depressing is the reality that this Government are not being seen as doing anything to alleviate that situation or to bring about a climate that would attract the vital investment that is necessary if we are to create the employment which is required.</P>
    <P>Disillusionment with this Government is rife particularly as they came into office over three years ago heralding good news that everything in the garden would be rosy within their term of office.  We were told at the time that they would rescue the country from what was then, they alleged, very serious difficulties where the world bankers were waiting outside the door to push their way in to take over.  We were told that the country under Fianna Fáil had borrowed too much and our creditworthiness abroad was under serious question and examination. We were told that the Coalition Government would eliminate the need for borrowing and that the deficit would be phased out over a four to five year period.  We were told that the Government would halt unemployment and that jobs would be created for all our young people and those not so young.  However, the opposite has been the case.  Our young people leaving school have not found those hopes realised.  They were given those hopes at the time by the Government.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that there is such massive disillusionment with this Government as never in the history of this State has such a huge list of promises been made which have not been fulfilled?  It would appear that the Government have gone out of their way to create disincentives for those willing <Col N="557" /> to invest and have killed off many old established firms which in the past not only created first-class employment but also contributed in a major way to the economy and to their local areas.</P>
    <P>The national debt has soared by £8 billion to £20 billion.  That has happened despite the firm pledge and undertakings given in 1982 that the Government would not need to borrow further and not only that, they would clear the national debt within a matter of a few years.  Official unemployment figures have soared by over 90,000 to a frightening figure of 250,000.  We also have, and this must be taken into consideration, at all times approximately 60,000 more involved in short term training schemes who will find themselves out of a job after they have completed their training schemes.  A further top up in the figure is the fact that emigration is a serious problem.  It is estimated that something in the region of 40,000 to 50,000 are leaving this country to find employment in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>This combination of factors shows a really frightening situation.  Unless something is done quickly to reduce the figures out of work, we could have serious political difficulties in the not too distant future.  Young people without hopes of secure employment at home have been very patient with the Government and, in return, they have got only apparent disinterest and a complacent attitude from the Government who do not appear unduly concerned about the terrible problem.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figures announced month after month are accompanied with a four line statement from the Government referring to the figures and in most cases expressing satisfaction that the increase in unemployment has been merely 2,000 or 3,000.  That is a very negative attitude and gives the impression that the Government are not seriously concerned about creating jobs, and attracting investment to create jobs so as to reduce the unemployment figures.  This disastrous unemployment situation must be contrasted with a completely <Col N="558" /> different situation in the rest of the EC.  In most other EC countries unemployment has almost stopped rising since the end of 1983.  The average rise in unemployment in the EC was 1 per cent in the past 12 months by comparison to a rise of 8.5 per cent here.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Government pinpointing world-wide recession as being responsible for our high unemployment figures.  At 18 per cent, our unemployment rate is the highest in the EC and responsibility for it must rest squarely on the shoulders of this totally discredited and ineffective Government.  If the position were not so serious one could smile at the Taoiseach's recent assertion that we have the healtiest economy in the whole of the EC.  Is it any wonder that a Minister for Finance produced such a negative budget from a Cabinet presided over by the Taoiseach who appears to be totally out of touch with reality?</P>
    <P>In his speech last week on the no confidence motion, the Taoiseach said he had contemplated for some time the reshuffle which he announced in such disorder last week.  Nobody accepts that statement.  It is a pity the Taoiseach did not elaborate further and say why he allowed the former Minister for Finance to introduce a budget only two weeks before he was due to be sacked from that ministry.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government have made a series of dreadful blunders since coming to office.  It is difficult to know the thinking behind a decision to allow a Minister for Finance to prepare a budget for a full year, knowing that he would be fired within two weeks, and that he would not be in this House to reply to the budget debate and would not have to stand over the budget.  The biggest sinner in this extraordinary exercise is not the former Minister for Finance but the Taoiseach. Not only has this House lost confidence in Deputy FitzGerald as Taoiseach but it has been shouted from the rooftops that his own party have lost confidence to such an extent that plans are at present under way to depose him as Leader between now and the summer recess.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister, Deputy Dukes, referred to the commitment <Col N="559" /> in the national plan to adjust tax bands and allowances for personal taxation so that the overall tax burden would not be increased.  The Minister announced that there would be a substantial improvement for all taxpayers and that they would save something in the region of £121 million in 1986 and £205 million in a full year.  The real effect of the Minister's budget is that the personal tax burden will increase significantly during the year as taxes on both personal income and personal spending will rise rather than fall as a result of this budget.  Taxes on personal income will rise more than twice as rapidly as inflation this year.  As a result, direct taxes on personal incomes will account for a higher proportion of GNP than ever before.</P>
    <P>The Minister expects to raise an additional £217 million in income tax this year and that represents a 9.6 per cent increase on the figure raised by the Government last year.  Since the Government anticipate that the inflation rate will rise by only 4.5 per cent this year the increase in the personal tax burden will run at more than twice the anticipated inflation rate. As a result of the Government's expectation of an increased yield from direct taxes on personal incomes, personal tax will be equivalent to 14.7 per cent of GNP in 1986 which will be the highest level ever recorded.  Since 1982, direct personal taxes as a proportion of GNP have risen from 12.2 per cent to 14.7 per cent which is a rise of 2.5 per cent in the lifetime of this Government, or a rise of almost 20 per cent from the base of 12.2 per cent which it was in 1982.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget that has not been highlighted is the extension of the limits at which employees' PRSI and health contributions are levied.  This will ensure that the Government will collect much larger revenues from this source during 1986.  The maximum income on which health contributions are levied has been increased from £13,000 to £14,000 while PRSI at 5.5 per cent will now be charged on £14,700 of income rather than on £13,800 last year.  These increases will hit most middle income earners.  It must <Col N="560" /> be remembered that employees' PRSI contributions have raised more than £1 billion for the Exchequer over the past three years.  The Minister has tried once more to con the taxpayers as he tried last year.  Following the 1985 budget, it took the PAYE taxpayer some three months to realise that he was worse off.  The taxpayer this year realises from the beginning that he will be paying more tax and not less as the Minister said.</P>
    <P>A principal new feature of this year's budget was the introduction of the retention tax on interest paid on deposits in banks and other financial institutions. This tax has now been named the DIRT tax, which is an appropriate name for it. The Minister has given the impression that this is a tax on banks and financial institutions which will benefit the income tax payer.  That is a misleading impression as it will have a very serious effect on the whole community, from the seven year old child lodging his First Communion money to the old age pensioner putting his or her money away for safety reasons. The new tax is a severe blow in particular to older people, as banks and building societies have substantial numbers of older investors, and older people have been marketing targets in recent years for these institutions.  For example, the Bank of Ireland launched a &ldquo;golden years&rdquo; programme for older people.  In 1985 the Minister went out of his way very much to encourage old people to bank their savings.  He encouraged our older citizens to put their money in safe keeping.  This move came after a wave of savage attacks and robberies of old people in rural communities.  Those people who acted on the Minister's encouragement and advice now find that tax at 35 per cent will be withheld from interest on their savings which for many retired people is the main source of income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy said it was not lodged before that.  They were getting no interest on it beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This is particularly wrong since many older people would <Col N="561" /> normally not be liable for tax at all.  Companies can reclaim the deposit tax against their corporation tax bills but there is no such provision for the unfortunate individual, for the older people.  This will be a major blow to people who were retired and living on fixed incomes and it will hit hard people who are being squeezed all the time in other areas.  It is simply a means of collecting more income tax from the public and the general body of income tax payers.  The financial institutions concerned will not pay even one extra £.  It is very objectionable in so far as its mechanism is directed in a very positive, discriminatory way against the small saver and those on low incomes.</P>
      <P>I might add that it has caused consternation along the Churches and charitable institutions as the traditional tax exemption extended to charities has been cancelled out by one stroke of the pen by the Minister.  For example, Sunday Church collections when lodged will be taxable as will be charitable donations and contributions to many deserving charities including the foreign missions.  The Minister of State previously had a very active interest in the Third World and in contributions and donations going out to the Third World.  Those contributions will be taxed when lodged here before being redistributed.  That is the type of area I am talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the DIRT tax which is deposit interest retention tax. That should make it quite clear.  It is a very unjust and inequitable form of taxation because it will hit the very small saver, the pensioner, the old and, indeed, the children.  Many children have been encouraged by their parents to save.  It is good training for children and, of course, the incentive was the small interest they would obtain on their savings.  That will be taxed.  The Minister of State cannot deny that, and that applies to a seven year old child.</P>
      <P>The new child benefit scheme announced by the Minister has been described, rightly, as a confidence trick as it will replace existing child allowances schemes.  The value of children's allowances has declined considerably over recent years and the former Minister, Deputy Dukes, in his budgets in 1985 and 1984 consistently reduced the children's allowance right down to the existing £100 child tax allowance per year.  The reality of this change is that the vast majority of families will get no increase in support for further children.  Families with children are finding it more difficult over the years to meet the rising cost of living and the many demands made on them to provide adequately for their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child allowance should have been increased substantially each year rather than reduced as it was, finally this year being eliminated altogether in the budget.  Parents are now being taxed for having children whereas in other countries, particularly France, the opposite is the case.  There additional tax allowances and grants are being given to parents, increasing in accordance with the number of children.  Here in Ireland, a so-called Christian country, parents are being penalised financially for having children. Therefore, it is not surprising that this <Col N="563" /> budget has been described by many people as anti-family and anti-child.</P>
    <P>The 4 per cent increase in social welfare benefit is totally meaningless.  It is absolutely disgraceful that this miserable increase will not even be implemented until the third week in July.  The increase is totally inadequate as the Minister for Finance admitted that the budget would raise the rate of inflation to at least 4.5 per cent.  A reduction in food subsidies in April will increase further the pressures on social welfare recipients and families.  It is morally unjust that such hardships will arise from the fact that, while the additional costs and charges imposed in the budget on pensioners, lower income families and the unemployed will have an immediate effect on household budgets, the small increase in social welfare will not come into effect until the third week in July, which is the latest date ever for that.</P>
    <P>Due to the massive unemployment we are experiencing it is recognised that serious hardship and deprivation exist among those who depend on unemployment benefit and assistance and social welfare in general for their standard of living.  For well over one third of our population life is a constant daily struggle to make ends meet.  Thousands of families have no idea where their next substantial meal will come from.  Every Deputy in this House will know from experience that the health centres are absolutely packed as never before with people seeking financial assistance to meet their bills, pay for their electricity, rents, fuel, clothing and even their food. In such a situation a 4 per cent increase in social welfare is completely meaningless and will bring no improvement whatever to the circumstances of those depending on social welfare for assistance.  The Government have a moral obligation to protect the living standards of the weakest section of the community, and this Government are simply not doing that.  Instead they have made clinically a cold, mathematical decision for budgetary reasons.</P>
    <P>The situation in farmer taxation is one <Col N="564" /> of total confusion.  We were assured positively last year that in 1986 farmers would be brought into the tax net on the basis of a land tax.  However, the Minister announced in his Budget Statement that the land tax would not become operable this year.  At the time the Minister introduced the proposed land tax, Fianna Fáil opposed the system on the basis that it was not equitable, would not work and was grossly unfair to the PAYE sector who were taxed on every single penny of their income.  We maintained at the time that farmers should be taxed on income in the same way as every other section of our community.</P>
    <P>The last Fianna Fáil Government introduced an income tax system for farmers but on coming into office this Government abolished it on the premise that they would be introducing a new system.  Unfortunately, that has not happened. There is no machinery whatever at present for taxing farmers in a positive, efficient manner, despite many claims and statements to the contrary.  This Government obviously have no policy for taxation and their actions and statements in the area of farmer taxation over the past three years have been ones of contradictions and inconsistencies and have added greater fury to the feelings of the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>An extraordinary feature of this budget is its failure to refer in a positive way to the building and construction industry.  In the budgets of 1984 and 1985 various measures were introduced which aggravated seriously the impact of the recession on that industry.  These included the reduction of mortgage interest relief, the increase in VAT and higher PRSI charges on employers and employees which hit this labour intensive industry particularly hard.  We also had increased planning charges and the introduction of residential property tax.</P>
    <P>It would appear that, during the past few years, the Government were at pains to think of measures that would stifle the building and construction industry completely. Obviously, no Government would set out deliberately to do that, but to those outside Government it would <Col N="565" /> appear from the lack of any action whatever, or of any positive steps to create employment in that industry, that the Government went out of their way to stop investment and development in that industry which has always been one of the highest employment oriented industries. It is extraordinary that in this particularly bad era of massive unemployment some efforts were not made to give an injection to this industry which would, in turn, stimulate increased activity in many other ancillary sectors with a beneficial result for employment. In October last, the Taoiseach announced that the Government were implementing tax incentives for the development of the Custom House dock site and other inner city projects and for developments in Cork and Limerick.  Full details were expected to be announced in the budget, but this was not the case.</P>
    <P>Very recently the Property Investment Manager of Irish Life, Mr. Michael Lucey, told a conference that if the present building decline continues the business will be stone dead.  He said:</P>
    <P>The technical and managerial skills will disappear and the competence to design and build will not be there whenever a recovery does take place.</P>
    <P>The announcement by the Taoiseach in October last of the house improvement grants has not yet brought any upward trend in the industry.  It is true that up to 55,000 applications have been received for grants but unfortunately, prior to the announcement and due to shortage of staff, which again showed extraordinarily bad planning on the part of the Government, there was a massive backlog in the Department of the Environment.  It was anticipated that this would take about 12 to 15 weeks to clear.  The Minister for the Environment has since made a decision in that area which will be welcomed by many.  However, many of the applications are being rejected for very flimsy reasons.  It is very obvious, once again, that the introduction of this scheme was more of a cosmetic exercise on the part of the Government than a genuine desire to instil some life into the <Col N="566" /> industry which has suffered more than any other during the past few years.</P>
    <P>The demand for increased investment on roads has grown substantially in the last number of years and will continue to grow in the future.  In the Dublin area alone, over £120 million worth of major road improvement work was required to be carried out but at the end of 1983 expenditure in that area was only £19 million.  With a total level of investment in road improvement work by the Government at only £98 million this year for the country as a whole, alternative methods of financing should be introduced. They must be found as a matter of urgency.  The CIF have called for the setting up of a roads finance agency.  This is clearly an area in which private sector funds can be used and significant savings made on the demand for public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The increase in VAT announced in last year's budget from 3 per cent to 5 per cent was a calamity for the building and construction industry.  This measure adds greatly to the difficulties in the industry at a time when companies are trading on a margin.  Coupled with the various other taxes and levies on construction work approximately 40 per cent of the final price of a new house now goes to the Exchequer.  This is one of the primary reasons for the growth of the black economy in that industry.  The increased taxation on the industry over the last few years, along with the withdrawal of various incentives, particularly the residence-related tax incentive scheme, is pushing more and more of building and construction industry output into the black economy.  There is no measure for the extent of the black economy in the construction industry, but it is accurate to say that it is very significant and has been growing dramatically over the last number of years.  High taxation on the industry obviously has been a major contributing factor.</P>
    <P>Private house building also has been on the decline since 1982 and according to figures it is expected to decline further in 1986.  The projections made for the private housing sector in 1983 and 1984 <Col N="567" /> did not materialise and the likely trend for completions in the next few years will continue to be on the negative side if some positive action is not taken.  It is clear also that with housing needs at something in the region of 26,000 to 32,000 units per annum and the likelihood that the private sector demand will continue to decline, that will obviously put a greater pressure on the local authorities to increase the supply of rented accommodation.  The Government must take urgent steps to boost the demand for private housing.  They should consider encouraging, for example, building societies and other mortgage lending institutions to introduce a range of mortgage packages designed to reduce the real cost for borrowers in the earlier years.  Those are the most difficult years for the new borrowers.  This could be financed by a reduction in the excess liquidity held by the building societies.  The societies should also consider financing a greater proportion of the total house purchase price which would reduce the short term financing burden for the purchasers.</P>
    <P>The building and construction industry is one area that we on this side of the House have been preaching for years has been allowed to run down, with a consequent loss of thousands of jobs.  It is reckoned that unemployment in that industry is at present running at about 60 per cent.  When one takes into consideration the many other ancillary services related to that industry, it is absolutely amazing that the Government since coming into office have not made any genuine effort to stimulate the industry and to encourage greater activity.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects in this budget to which I would like to refer. The House has been debating the budget for the best part of four weeks and, as I said at the outset, the 1986 budget is now history and has passed into the records as a miserable failure.  Within two weeks this was admitted by the Taoiseach when he took the drastic measures that he took last week in the so-called Cabinet reshuffle and when he decided to sack, or fire, or whatever word you like to <Col N="568" /> use, the Minister for Finance who had introduced this budget only two weeks earlier.</P>
    <P>There are three key areas which remain, unemployment, taxation and investment.  Social welfare has become a very important area because of the ever-increasing numbers who are unemployed and have no alternative but to depend on the State for social welfare hand-outs in order to survive.  Survival is the key word because this budget has done nothing to give the weaker sections of our community a decent or reasonable standard of living for themselves or for their children. Worst of all, it has given very little hope to them for the future.</P>
    <P>The Government came to office on a bookkeeping exercise which obviously not only has not worked but has brought the country to its knees.  Economic recovery is essential if we are to regain our former position as a viable economic unit. However, the Government do not appear to have the will or the ability to introduce suitable plans for such a recovery, and one can only be pessimistic and expect things to deteriorate even further in 1986.</P>
    <P>Unemployment seems to have been accepted as a permanent feature of life here.  Of course, higher taxes will be needed to pay more unemployment benefit and this will cause deep resentment and disillusionment and will damage the morale of those who are fortunate enough to be at work.  Strong, proper leadership is required if we are to bring about the economic reversal needed.  Nobody has any doubt that the Taoiseach is not the man to lead that recovery.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed miserably. They are walking away from solemn commitments and undertakings.  They are walking out on the unemployed and those being excessively taxed.  They are walking out on those who have money to invest in our economy but who need some incentive to do so.  The Government have lost all credibility and I do not think the people will ever have confidence in them again to perform even the most menial tasks.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget to give <Col N="569" /> encouragement to our hard pressed people.  That is why they are so frustrated and angry.  In the past three years the people accepted massive falls in their standards of living.  They have had to make all sorts of sacrifices in the interest of book balancing.  Despite all those sacrifices the books have not been balanced. Indeed, they are in a worse state than ever before.  If those books belonged to a private company the board of directors and management would be dismissed instantly.</P>
    <P>What is needed now is new direction, new management.  This requirement will not be provided by this Government, so I suggest that rather than hang on to office for a further 18 months or a year, the Government should do the decent and honourable thing, resign and go to the people, the shareholders in Ireland Limited and ask them if they have confidence in the Government.  I have no doubt what the people will say.  After the misery of the past three and a half years the people are entitled to have a say and to make a decision.  In the interests of the country and of all the people I urge the Government to go now and give the electorate the chance to return to the Dáil a Government who will do what is necessary who will have proper planning and restore confidence to the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition Chief Whip asked for an immediate election.  I think we would all agree that the weather is far too cold for an election now.  We should leave it until the weather improves, and perhaps by then we will see an improvement in the economy as well.  I agree with one point Deputy Brady made.  He spoke of the reconstruction grants.  There is no doubt the scheme would have been a huge success if there had been provision for proper staffing.  Perhaps the level of demand for the scheme was not anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though on behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the decision to allow work to commence on those applications received after 25 January, the position is that we are putting off the evil day because when the work has been completed &mdash; it will <Col N="570" /> now go ahead much more quickly &mdash; applicants can only be paid out after inspection.  If more staff and inspectors are not recruited, we are only putting off the evil day because there will be thousands of applications and jobs completed but inspections will not be possible without staff.  Of course Deputies will be the ones who will have to bear the brunt of this, particularly on the Government side.  This scheme will have to get prior consideration if it is not to present a major problem later.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the last three budgets and their provision for public service pay.  No budget of recent origin that I can remember provided adequately for public service pay.  This is highly dangerous and will succeed only in generating massive public protest within the public service.  We spend much time here and at parliamentary party level discussing the ramifications of decisions taken affecting public service pay, particularly in the last two rounds.  The Government decided that only certain levels of pay increases would be acceptable to them and we found that as time went on there had to be reconsideration. On the last occasion, with Labour Party assistance, the public service eventually got their 6 per cent and they will probably get the 7 per cent, or whatever it is, on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to the large percentage of the public service who do not have any say and are only indirectly represented on the ICTU Public Services Committee.  I refer to the Garda and the Army who are charged with the responsibility for upholding our democratic system.  In the past few days we saw on television that in Egypt, when only a rumour leaked out that the police would not get a pay increase, they rioted and people lost their lives in a mini rebellion. We are glad the Garda and the Army here have always supported the democratic institutions.  However, we must appreciate that though they are a very important part of society they have no real, effective voice at the negotiating table.  The Government, therefore, at budget time should spell out what they <Col N="571" /> propose to do for those important sectors of our community and avoid the uncertainty that has been with us for so long.</P>
    <P>I do not see any definitive statement in this budget spelling out what the position is in this regard.  It will be interesting to see if the imminent Finance Bill will make provision for this matter.  We must accept that the public service will have to get a pay increase.  Therefore, it must be provided for in the budget framework.  If we do not do that, we will be faced with more and more controversy and with more parliamentary time taken up on the subject.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that the Government have not been able to concentrate on what is the most important problem facing this country, that is, employment.  Everything in this budget is based on employment. There is no way one can have an effective budget if unemployment continues at the present rate.  The trade unions have been hammering this message home and the ICTU have been in the forefront in this regard.  The employers' organisations agree with the trade unions, and I have not seen that happen for many years. Everybody is saying the same thing&mdash;the Government, the Ministers, the Opposition and so on.  We spend weeks talking about the budget but there is still no clear, precise policy, nothing new which will give any hope that the problem of unemployment will be resolved, or even tackled.  There is not much point in having the books balanced if, next year, there are an extra 60,000 people unemployed, and that is what will happen.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Agriculture talking about the farmers.  We were virtually dragged into the EC by a combination of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Parties.  The only opposition to our entry to the EC came from the Labour Party and ICTU.  We held a referendum which resulted in our entry to the EC.  There was a feeling of euphoria in the farming community about what would happen when we joined the Community.  Things did improve for the farmers for the first few years, but now they are paying the <Col N="572" /> price.  Almost every day we hear the farmers' leaders moaning and groaning about the farming situation, about cuts here and cuts there, but the farming community are partly, if not substantially, responsible for the present situation because they were the leading lobby for our entry to the EC.  The Minister spoke about huge mountains of surplus meat, grain, vegetables, fruit, wine and so on, while at the same time we are raising millions of pounds to try to feed the starving millions in the Third World.</P>
    <P>I have said many times that many, if not all, of our problems are the result of our decision to enter the EC.  If one looks at the countries which did not join one will see that their levels of unemployment are substantially lower than the countries which entered the Community, and in some countries unemployment is almost non-existent.  Admittedly in the short term our farmers gained from our entry, but in the long term they will not gain because Ireland does not have any real muscle in the Community.  As a leading trade union colleague of mine said, we are a very small fish in a very large pond, and that is a fact which the Minister admitted.  The farming community is a very important sector of the Irish economy because if farmers are not earning money that is reflected throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the export of beef and lamb.  It would be better if that beef and lamb were processed here because we could create jobs at home rather than exporting this lamb and beef on the hoof and creating employment elsewhere. When I was general secretary of the Shoe and Leather Workers' Union we had the infamous closure of the Gorey tannery, which led to the downfall of the tanning industry in Ireland.  I pointed out to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce the importance that should be placed on the tanning industry, but what happened?  There has been a virtual elimination of that industry and of the footwear industry, as I forecast.  This happened because no Government had a policy to develop agriculturally based industries.  We have the best hides in the <Col N="573" /> world but they are being exported and processed abroad, and the Irish footwear and leather goods manufacturers have to import leather at substantially higher costs.</P>
    <P>In my view, our entry to the EC has not been of any benefit to our native industries.  These are the industries which had the highest concentration of employment. Many of them have gone to the wall, being replaced by high technology industries which call for the investment of huge capital sums but create very little employment.  That is why we get a very false figure when we talk about the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>We have to face up to the fact that we are no longer masters of our own destiny. This House is almost irrelevant.  It has slightly more powers than a county council. It simply gets the money and decides how to spend it, but it has very little control over how the money is earned because EC policy will dictate more and more what our future is going to be. Those stupid people who were led by the nose by the two main parties are beginning to see what our entry to the EC means for them.  Yet, what do they do?  They continue to elect the two main parties.  The Labour Party were the only party, backed by the trade union movement, who spelled out that situation. There is no point in crying now.  It does not matter a cuss which Government are in power &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Coalition, Fine Gael and the Labour Party or the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael.  We have to get people back into employment. It is only when you get people back into employment that a Government can get money to spend.  It is only when people are employed that the amount of taxes to be paid will increase, because when more people are working there is more money going into the Exchequer. This means the rate of taxation can be reduced and hopefully people will have more money in their pockets.  This in turn will create employment.</P>
    <P>If we did nothing else in this House, apart from enacting a divorce Bill, constitutional amendments and so on &mdash; I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would agree <Col N="574" /> with me &mdash; but spend time dealing with unemployment and getting people back to work, we would be doing something positive.  Otherwise, we are simply wasting time.  We would be better off to go to local authority meetings and forget about this place.  As a trade unionist I must ask where are we going.</P>
    <P>I met a young girl named Gretchen S. Fairley, a student from Philadelphia, and I said to her: &ldquo;Gretchen, why do you not have a look at our budget, see what you think of it and write me a little memo giving your impressions as somebody looking in from outside&rdquo;.  She is a Democrat, the equivalent of a slightly more right wing Labour Party representative in America.  She said:</P>
    <P>The 1986 budget proposal could probably best be described as neutral. Many changes that were made were offset by other changes that, in effect, cancel each other out.  At a time when the Irish economy is plagued by a dole queue of nearly a quarter of a million people and a £20 billion debt overhang, prospects are very slim for a 1986 move towards the Government's plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  The changes proposed attempt to ameliorate some of the most severe and immediate anomalies in the areas of taxation and Government expenditures.  However, sufficient changes are not made for long-term investments or real tax reforms to get the Irish economy firmly back on its feet again.  There has been consensus in Irish Government on the measures which must be taken in order to begin reducing unemployment and the national debt.  Yet in the second year of the <i>Building on Reality</i> plan, these measures are once again simply not taken.  The 1986 budget proposal will keep social welfare provisions at a relatively constant level.  More importantly, the budget's failure to introduce dynamic action towards recovery merely sustains the stagnation and decline of Ireland's economy.</P>
    <P>This is from an 18-year-old American girl looking in on us.  If she had been reading <Col N="575" /> my mind she could not have put it better because she reflects almost exactly my thoughts on the subject.  I would like to thank this girl from Philadelphia for what she said.  Maybe we might find a spot for her in Dublin and get her into the Government and laugh at them all.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at the economic background to the budget.  The 1985 situation, out of which the 1986 budget proposals were devised was as follows.  I am trying to piece it together from a Labour Party point of view to see if we can get anything out of this after having gone into Government.  Unemployment rose by 14,500, the lowest increase in six years.  I suppose we should be grateful for that as it is not as bad as it was the year before.  This makes a total of 240,000 or 18 per cent of the population.  Exchequer borrowing requirements were 12.9 per cent of GNP.  For 1986 we are told it is to be brought down to 11.8 per cent. That would seem to be on target.  The current deficit was 8.2 per cent of GNP. For 1986 this is to be brought down to 7.4 per cent of GNP.  Taxation was 36 per cent of GNP and 77 per cent of this went to pay interest on our foreign debt.  The Government cannot be blamed for everything. Deputy Leonard's party have to shoulder the blame for a lot of it.</P>
    <P>It costs 57 per cent of GNP to pay for our foreign debt.  GNP increased by .5 per cent.  There was a 6½ per cent increase in wages and salaries, which is about the same as the average of Ireland's trading partners.  Our people are at the bottom of the ladder in European terms but are at the top of the ladder as far as taxation is concerned.  There has been a 12 per cent decline in farmers' incomes but the farmers have some very powerful spokesmen. When it comes near the time for a general election we will all be trying to get the farmers' votes.  Unfortunately, they do not vote for the poor fellows in the Labour Party but I am sure there will be good competition between Deputy Leonard and the other Deputies from rural constituencies.  What will we promise the farmers the next time to get their vote?  Unfortunately our people will not <Col N="576" /> be able to get it because we cannot promise them anything.  We want to take money off them so that we can reduce the amount of money our poor, unfortunate colleagues in the PAYE sector have to pay.</P>
    <P>Fixed investments and private consumption rose.  Our inflation rate is 5½ per cent, the lowest since 1968.  That is not bad.  Exchange rates strengthened due to the low inflation of our trading partners. Everybody talks about the rate of inflation going down but, basically, inflation is influenced more now by external factors than by internal factors.  It comes back again to the question of EC membership. That is one small benefit we have got from our EC membership.  Fuel import prices have decreased substantially on the international market.  The motorists and Irish industry have not benefited in relation to this.  I know that only one price reduction was taken by the former Minister for Finance.  Nevertheless, we still have the highest level of fuel prices charged to industry in European terms. We had some success in a 5 per cent increase in the value of the punt against the dollar.  Now the farmers are screaming to us to devalue so that it will leave our exports more competitive.  I do not know how the Minister can please everybody.</P>
    <P>Industrial exports increased by 5 per cent but that is in money terms and means nothing in employment terms.  You have the huge multinational companies with very substantial State investment &mdash; we are glad to see them here and we wish there were more of them &mdash; but that 5 per cent does not mean that there are 5 per cent fewer unemployed on our dole queues.  Tourism receipts increased by 9 per cent and agricultural exports increased by 7 per cent.  More cows on the hoof went out than ever before, which will create jobs in every country in Europe.  Imports rose by 1½ per cent, a good performance.  We had a balance of payments surplus of £200 million, which is the first trade surplus since the forties. That reads good but it does not reflect itself in jobs.  One would think if a country had a £200 million trade surplus that that <Col N="577" /> country would be getting people back to work.</P>
    <P>Why are our people not going back to work?  It is because we are losing more jobs than we are gaining.  We lose two jobs for every job we gain and they are all in native industry.  Our old traditional industries textiles, clothing, footwear and other industries like that are being rubbed out.  Although our economy is in a very depressed state at present the international climate will be quite favourable to Irish growth with lower prices of imported fuel provided we take advantage of that, a trade surplus, a strong exchange rate and a slightly increased output.  If the benefits of this present situation are properly channelled Ireland's economy will stand a great chance of improvement.  That must be said.</P>
    <P>What will all of this mean to the worker on the factory floor?  It should be remembered that he is thinking of what he will have in his pay packet at the end of the week.  What has the budget meant to him?  The 1 per cent income levy has been abolished, the special PAYE allowance increased from £600 to £700, personal allowances up for single persons from £1,900 to £2,000 and from £3,800 to £4,000 for a married couple.  Additionally the 35 per cent tax band has been widened by £200 to £4,700 for single persons and by £400 to £9,400 for married couples with the top tax rate of 60 per cent being reduced to 58 per cent.  The PRSI ceiling rate has been raised from £13,800 to £14,700.  There is a six months amnesty period for tax evaders, on the basis that they make a full disclosure.  The latter clearly indicates the inability of the Government to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>I might inquire what happened to the special unit set up internally to investigate the Revenue Commissioners.  They were supposed to investigate deficiencies in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners by way of staffing and so on.  What happened to that unit?  What happened to the work they were supposed to undertake and the recommendations they were supposed to make?  Indeed, many people in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners are <Col N="578" /> asking that question also.  Therefore, from an ICTU, union or worker point of view that question must be posed: what does this whole position with regard to personal taxation mean?  It means precious little to the workers: The only advantage to him is that he will not be paying more tax.</P>
    <P>Had we adopted that policy from the beginning of this Government's term in office we would have made progress. Even if the situation is to be improved this year and next year it will not offset the increases levied in the past two or three budgets.  Therefore ICTU or the trade unions would contend that whatever little has been given has been much too little and too late.  Unless the Minister has something up his sleeve, such as 20 nice juicy oilfields off the Waterford coast, or ten natural gas wells off the coast of Kerry or out in the Atlantic, we cannot see how personal taxation will be any different next year or the year after. That must be admitted.</P>
    <P>One cannot, on the one hand, call for cuts in public spending, reduce the level of employment within the public service and, at the same time, give tax concessions. That does not make sense.  It cannot be done.  Effectively all one is doing, by reducing the level of employment in the public sector, is adding to the dole queues, when the State must then pay out more money by way of unemployment benefit, assistance, or whatever. Therefore one is not allowing employed people to pay money back into the system.  One defeats the other.</P>
    <P>Let us take indirect taxation and what has happened there.  The 23 per cent standard rate of VAT will be increased to 25 per cent from 1 March next.  VAT on restaurant and hotel meals and selected services such as hairdressing, cinema, dry cleaning and so on will be reduced to 10 per cent from 1 July next. I very much welcome that proposal.  I am sure Deputy J. Leonard will agree with me here because those of us representing Border constituencies had been calling for that reduction for the past three years following the 1982-83 budget when hoteliers, restauranteurs and the general <Col N="579" /> catering industry in the Border area were decimated and put out of business. Whereas families used to cross the Border from Newry to Clones for wedding breakfasts, parties or whatever, that type of activity ceased overnight.  Overnight restaurants, hotels and public-houses were empty and staff let go.  I am thankful that that fact has been recognised even at this late stage.</P>
    <P>We have had the introduction of tax on chips.  I do not know how that will operate.  Like everything else, we always follow what happens over in Maggie Thatcher land.  Once they put a tax on chips in the UK, we had to do likewise here.  The old traditional fish and chipper will have to pay 10 per cent more.  I am sure the worker will still buy his bag of chips and give out about the Government. The price of a pint of beer went up by 1p, which is not too bad.  However, there have been so many increases in the price of beer that I find I have to scratch my head when I go into a pub for a pint.  I never know what price it was the previous day.  I do not bother to count my change any longer.  I hope the barman is an honest person.  It is impossible to know from day to day what one will have to pay for a pint of Smithwick's, Harp, or Guinness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will just have to go on the dry.  With all this depression abroad one has to take a few pints every night. Otherwise one would not sleep; one would die of plain, ordinary anxiety. Always one's drinking companions would be complaining about the price of beer. Being a good trade unionist and member of the Labour Party I always blamed Fine Gael; they blamed us; and Fianna Fáil blamed the two of us.  Then we would have a friendly argument.  When we had drunk enough pints we would go home, go asleep and forget about the whole lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Spirits went up 3½p a glass with 3p more from 1 March next.  I still contend that that is good value; it is still competitive. I think it has reduced substantially the <Col N="580" /> volume of traffic across the Border, particularly at Christmas time, because the incentive to buy spirits in the North no longer exists.  If the same was done with regard to other commodities, such as petrol and beer we might be going places. The price of cigarettes went up 7p per packet of 20, with 3½p more from 1 March next.  The Minister for Health insists on so many notices being placed on the packet now that one has to sit down and read them before having a smoke.</P>
    <P>All my friends in Carrolls in Dundalk are giving out stink about the Labour Party.  They are blaming me.  They say to me: &ldquo;How do you expect us to go out and canvass for you in the next election when a colleague of yours is putting us out of a job while, at the same time, giving the advantage to imported brands of cigarettes?&rdquo; The same is true of Irish newspapers and periodicals, their foreign counterparts can be imported.  As far as I can see there is no restriction whatever on what they can print in relation to advertising of tobacco products.  So while we go on our merry way, trying to close off the cigarette industry in Ireland, we are encouraging our British and continental competitors to sell more here.  We will still die of cancer.  The only difference will be that it will not be an Irish-manufactured cancer, it will be an EC or even American manufactured type.</P>
    <P>The price of petrol went up 6p a gallon immediately after the budget and will go up another 4.8p from 1 March next.  As Deputy J. Leonard will tell the House, our competitors around the Border areas are rubbing their hands.  I spoke to many of them who travelled down here for the McGuigan fight.  They were absolutely delighted.  They thought that the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, was the greatest thing since rice crispies.  They were almost going to make him an honorary citizen of Newry.  Just when the price of spirits was going down, when they thought they were out of business again, the Minister for Finance puts up the price of petrol.  They foresee hordes of people coming back up North for the cheaper petrol.  While they are there they will buy the spirits, drink a few pints, eat <Col N="581" /> something, perhaps buy some children's clothing.  I can tell the House that it was not Deputy Peter Barry, the Minister for Foreign Affairs who should have been made the representative of the Irish Republic in the North.  Rather it should have been the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Alan Dukes.  He would have been popular with the Unionists.</P>
    <P>All the people, whether they are Catholics or Protestants, Jews or atheists, had the same thing to say about Deputy Dukes, that he was a great man.  They believed he was keeping them in business. At the next Cabinet re-shuffle we might consider sending Deputy Dukes to Belfast because he is so popular there. Even Paisley would get on with him because he and the Unionist population in the North are in the money business. They will not come down here unless there is a financial incentive for them. Why should they come down here when we are making millions of pounds for them?  Our products do not compete with theirs.  Our people go across the Border in droves.  The people in the North are the ones who are making the money. They have no intention of having a United Ireland.  If the position was reversed and if there were advantages for the Northern businessman and the Unionists in particular in doing business with the South then they would soon forget all this.  Those people do not believe in the Church of England, the Church of Ireland or the Catholic Church, they believe in money.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Ceann Comhairle must be bored listening to everybody saying the same thing over and over again.  The central economic and social priority of the Government is to reduce the existing level of unemployment.  This will be achieved through taxation and incentive policies to create a better climate for employment.  The Minister for Finance says that the 1986 budget will do this. The budget proposals do not fulfil the stated priority policies contained in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  As long as we continue to borrow for day-to-day spending and as long as the burden of tax is shouldered <Col N="582" /> unevenly by the PAYE sector then a better climate will never emerge. Everybody agrees with that.  If we were in Opposition now we would have a field day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil would then be the ones who would be worrying.  The way to deal with Deputy Haughey is to borrow £1,000 million before we leave office, make promises, lower taxation by 25 per cent, increase the subsidy to the building industry and get them all back to work.  A colleague of mine, who is wiser than I, said that what would happen then is that we would be re-elected and left with the bill.  That would happen. Fianna Fáil will make promises and they will not tell us where they will get the money.  They will come into office with a huge overall majority but when they look at the books they will not know where to get the money to finance all those things. There will still be unemployment, and the PAYE situation will still be the same. In theory, Government borrowing should finance projects which will generate revenue so that the interest will pay for itself and get people back to work in the process. It all sounds very simple if we could only find somebody with the brains to put it into operation.  Borrowing is primarily financing current spending on such matters as unemployment benefits and education and leaving the rising interest payments to the taxpayers who must pay at increasingly higher rates to make up for ungenerated revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that allocations of State money to industry, which would be the most obvious and direct means to generate revenue and employment, have been cut very severely.  Yet the potential for industrial growth in Ireland is enormous if Government policy would only take advantage of it.  Ireland is one of the most attractive places in Europe for multinational corporations to locate. These are important for employment as already 80,000 people work in foreignowned <Col N="583" /> industries.  Approximately an additional 80,000 people work in areas of supporting inputs.  Irish corporate taxes are the lowest in the EC and export sales are even tax free.  Almost half of the foreign-owned firms in Ireland are owned by other EC companies who recognise Irish tax breaks to outweigh even the transport costs of exporting from Ireland. Capital grants are also available quite liberally and get industry started and expanded.</P>
    <P>One of the most pressing needs is to encourage the great potential that indigenous Irish industries could hold. Multinational corporations frequently engage in transfer pricing, artificially inflating their profits which can be repatriated to the parent companies.  This is a great source of wealth which is lost annually and which would not be lost to Irish-based and Irish-owned industry. Their revenue would remain in the Irish economy unlike our foreign brothers. Many Irish industries such as fishing and food processing are in desperate need of Government support which they seldom get.  The one thing we succeeded in doing while in Government was the setting up of the National Development Corporation. Whether or not it will be dismantled by the Fianna Fáil Government I do not know.  We did not succeed with divorce but we might succeed the next time.  The Minister might even vote for it.  We need only 11 more.  The National Development Corporation who were to identify areas where State investment was most likely to succeed and create employment we re-allocated a paltry £8.5 million for 1986.  Originally they were to receive £200 million.  Where did the rest of the money go?  Other areas which need improving in industry are marketing techniques, management skills, research and development, which does not exist, and input linkages.  An allowance is made in the budget for research and development through tax incentives as well as employment programmes for scientists and technologists.</P>
    <P>The other big priority of the Government was to reduce the current budget <Col N="584" /> deficit which could best be tackled through tax reforms.  At present the PAYE sector is unfairly paying the bulk of Irish taxes.  Conversely revenue from business people and the wealthiest people in Ireland is quite small.  The burden of taxation must be more evenly distributed. It is little wonder that so many people are unemployed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 19 together.  It is not possible in the current difficult Exchequer situation to abolish or raise the off-farm income limit of £6,400 under the disadvantaged area schemes. The cost of abolition to the Exchequer would be almost £6 million in a full year before EC recoupment.  The off-farm income criterion under the on-farm investment element of the western package is laid down by the EC and is that on applicant may not derive more than 50 <Col N="588" /> per cent of his total income from off-farm employment.</P>

      <P>There are two questions there.  First of all, the question of the &ldquo;insignificant&rdquo; amount of £6 million. It is a very significant sum and always has been.  The problem as the Deputy would be fully aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> We are <Col N="589" /> talking about only £3 million as regards the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>£6 million must be found first before there is the recoupment to the State the following year.  Leaving that aside, one of the problems is that this was brought in initially as a supplementary income.  It was basically to keep people on the land in the severely handicapped areas.  The resources made available at that time were to be divided amongst people most in need.</P>
      <P>When one talks about an off farm income after that, one is talking about equity and then one arrives at a typical case where there might be an off farm income of £15,000 or £16,000 coming on to a farm, and a farm of similar size in the same area must survive on farm income alone.  There is obviously a case for equity there.  Successive Governments have agreed that there must be an off farm income limit.  If one were to abolish the off farm income limit people currently in receipt of various headages would get less.  It is against that background that the Government increased the limit from £3,500 to £6,400 last year.  It is entirely a matter for the Exchequer after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that over the ten year period of the western package it is proposed to spend £300 million and that in the first five years we have only spent £103 million? Would the Minister not agree that it is one of the weaknesses of that scheme that it could not be adjusted under the one heading and there had to be three or four different headings and that there was a very small take up of the scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The proviso from Brussels on this issue means that the principal aim of the EC Commission is to channel the aid in so far as is possible to full time farmers.  That has affected all the EC countries involved.  Because of our problems with part time farming and its importance, we wished to ensure that the people farming small acreages, but <Col N="590" /> who had to take an off farm job in order to survive would be catered for and we believed that a limit of £6,400 would be reasonable in the circumstances.  As Deputy Leonard mentioned, the 50 per cent total income criteria are an EC stipulation. That is a stipulation we would like to avoid, but everybody in the Commission is adamant that the greatest percentage of resources should go to full time farmers.</P>

      <P>The first part of the Deputy's question is about farm accounts.  Yes, farm accounts will have to be kept on the basis of this farm improvement programme, but not to the same degree as accounts had to be kept for the farm modernisation scheme.  I have asked the farm development service to become involved in this to make sure that accounts are kept.  We hope the system we have now adopted will be seen as a very easy system.  Certainly it will mean that any farmer will be able to do the job himself.</P>
      <P>On the second part of the question, all farmers who are eligible for the farm improvement programme as it stands now will be entitled to a grant for drainage. Obviously, I cannot prejudge what will come back from Brussels, but under the western package there will be a choice when the time comes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take oral Question No. 5 and priority Question No. 24 together.  Proposals involving some changes in the Common Agricultural Policy mechanisms have been included in the recent Commission proposals on agricultural prices and ancillary measures for 1986-87.  The proposed changes are on the general lines of the Commission's Green Paper of July 1985, its subsequent communication of December 1985 and its memoranda on beef and cereals.  While the problems facing the Common Agricultural Policy must be recognised, the proposals on milk, beef and cereals as they stand would present considerable difficulties for Irish agriculture. On beef in particular the proposal to curtain intervention support does not take sufficient account of Irish needs in that sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> The price and ancillary proposals for 1986-87 were discussed for the first time in the Council of Agriculture Ministers of 24 February.  On that occasion I made my objections very clear to the Council. In further Council discussions on the matter, which are expected to extend over several months, it will be my endeavour to obtain the best possible outcome for Irish agriculture.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Has the Minister in mind the basic principle of the CAP which is the protection of the family farm?  Having that in mind, does he agree that all of the proposals are very serious but the proposal with regard to the further reduction in our milk quotas will affect fundamentally that principle of the family farm?  Will he consider introducing a milk cessation scheme as attractive as the EC one in order to obviate the possibility that we might lose a further percentage of our milk quota, in other words having our milk quota extinguished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties that these proposals would create for Irish agriculture if they were implemented. At this stage, however, they are just proposals.  As regards a milk cessation scheme, I am basing my case on the wording of the minutes of the March 1984 super-levy agreement which states that Irish milk production should not be reduced during the period of the super-levy regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two cessation schemes have been spoken about.  The Community cessation scheme, if introduced, would reduce production in each country by 3 per cent. Then there is the national cessation scheme where each country would be allowed to redistribute 3 per cent of its milk production.  Discussions have been going on for some time in this country, overseen by ICOS, the umbrella organisation for the co-operative movement, to try to draw up a scheme nationally.  However, I am afraid difficulties have arisen and I hope that the problems can be <Col N="598" /> overcome.  At the moment some co-operatives feel that the national scheme which has been proposed would not satisfy their needs, and word has come from the Commission that it would not accept a scheme along the lines which have been proposed.  We have difficulties both at home and with the Commission.  It would be my earnest wish that we would get a national cessation scheme in place as quickly as possible so that there would not be a demand, if the worst came to the worst, for a Community cessation scheme.</P>

A number of other countries feel that they should have exemption from the EC cessation scheme and these include, as far as I can remember, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Luxembourg.  They all have different reasons for their wish to be excluded from the scheme.  It will be months before we know what the outcome is likely to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that if there were a national cessation scheme it should be within the confines of the co-operative areas?  The <Col N="599" /> experience on the last occasion was that there was an outflow of milk from my county where the disease eradication programme was not so developed. Secondly, even if there were an EC cessation scheme, would the Minister not agree that countries outside the EC, for example, the United States, the USSR and Australia, are going to increase their milk production and create problems in the Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first question, the reasons outlined by the Deputy are precisely why the Commission will not agree to the type of scheme that we are formulating or attempting to formulate. They will not agree to a scheme based on a co-operative area.  It must be a truly national scheme covering all co-operatives and milk purchasers in the country.  On the other hand, the co-operatives do not want the Commission proposal because, as the Deputy says, it could quite likely lead to an outflow of milk from areas such as the Deputy's in the northern part of the country to the larger co-operatives in the south.  The fact is that more people in the Deputy's part of the country would give up milk production and there would not be sufficient people there with the money to purchase the milk, whereas people in the richer parts of the country would have the money to purchase the milk.  There is the dual difficulty which I have outlined.</P>
      <P>As regard the Deputy's second question, I am very disturbed that other countries are not doing what the EC have been doing &mdash; that is, curtailing the production of milk.  It is rather pointless that in the western world where there is a vast surplus of milk, the United States and New Zealand in particular are encouraging increased production which is bound to create serious problems for all of us on the world markets.  I should like to see a certain synchronisation of milk production between all these countries and the member states of the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> A <Col N="600" /> Cheann Comhairle, we are taking two or three questions together here and one is a priority question.  I want to ask two further suplementary questions, one with regard to the proposal to introduce a coresponsibility levy for cereals.  That is serious enough, but quality control is far more serious as far as this country is concerned because of our climatic conditions. Surely the Minister is aware that this can have a disastrous effect so far as our farmers are concerned.  I support the Minister in his opposition to these proposals, but his opposition should be more positive in so far as our crop farmers are concerned.</P>
      <P>Secondly, with regard to the other proposal to interfere with the intervention system for beef, has the Minister any forecast as to how it would affect our beef prices if it were implemented in its present form or even in a watered down form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is that the proposal with regard to cereals is most serious.  I do not know what the Deputy means about not taking a positive approach.  I have said outright that I am not accepting that proposal and I cannot do any more than that at this stage.  There are two areas in the cereals proposal which would be damaging for us, one which we could wear and the other which we could not.  The one which we could wear is a 3 per cent co-responsibility levy on cereals.  That would be tough enough in itself, but the other element of quality control could mean a price reduction on cereals in this country in the range of 9 per cent to 12 per cent. That is the range of the penalty clause and it is totally unacceptable.  I do not know if I should go into the background of this, but there are some countries which, like Ireland, cannot accept these proposals because of the penalisation clause &mdash; West Germany, in particular, and the British also.  The French feel that they can sell cereals on the world market more cheaply than the Americans and the Canadians if the Community bring down the price.  They think that they can produce so much extra grain that it would <Col N="601" /> compensate for the price reduction by increased output, better quality and more efficient methods of production.  Therein lies the background to the difficulty, that the Commission are backing up the French in this exercise.  It creates enormous difficulties for us, or would if it went through as a proposal, but there is a long way to go yet.</P>
      <P>On the second question about the beef proposals, the curtailment of beef intervention as proposed by the Commission would probably have the most serious effect of all on the Irish economy because of the magnitude of the beef output here. If the cattle trade is going badly, agriculture generally is going badly and the country is going badly.  Curtailment of beef intervention would have very serious repercussions.  We put 17 per cent of our beef into intervention, amounting to 80,000 to 90,000 tonnes a year.  We would have to find markets for that quantity, otherwise we could not sell it.  If we could not sell it, the price would drop dramatically. Again, it is a proposal.  A number of countries other than ourselves do not like it and there will be much discussion before any final decision is taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to lead anybody astray and think that we will get away with a veto.  It is very difficult to see how we would.  One must remember the background to and reasons for the Commission's proposals.  They are simply that the surpluses in the Community are unacceptably high.  There are 690,000 tonnes of beef in intervention, over one million tonnes of butter, 15 million tonnes of grain.  The Community have a genuine difficulty and a very serious budgetary problem.  This is the Commission's proposal to ease that problem.  It is not as straightforward as some might like to believe.  We must look at the difficulties in which the Commissioner finds himself. <Col N="602" /> Having said that, the discussions will take months and what finally emerges may be &mdash; and I think will be &mdash; considerably different from what has been proposed to us.</P>

      <P>I am encouraging the ICOS to introduce a scheme, but in recent days difficulties arose which make it look unlikely that a national scheme will be formulated in the near future.  I hope those difficulties can be overcome but, as I pointed out to Deputy Leonard, there is a possibility that there would be an outflow of milk from the northern co-operatives to some of the southern co-operatives and that would create a very serious problem.</P>

      <P>The regulations introduced on 1 November 1985 restrict the sale and use of hormones and make it an offence to slaughter livestock or to offer livestock or meat for sale which contain residues. Veterinary inspectors of my Department enforce the regulations and their powers to examine meat and to take samples for residue testing have been extended for this purpose.  Such testing of meat is now being undertaken on a regular basis at the new meat testing laboratory at Abbotstown.  A number of infringements of the regulations have been investigated and appropriate action has been taken in each case.</P>

      <P>The ban on meat which has been treated at some stage with hormones or growth promoters will come into effect on 1 January 1988, in this country and all other EC countries, with the exception of Britain and Northern Ireland who have got a derogation for a <Col N="608" /> further year, to 1 January 1989.  I will not be introducing legislation to prohibit the sale or use of hormones other than for therapeutic purposes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The most common causes of outbreaks of TB in County Monaghan <Col N="610" /> are generally to be found in lateral spread of disease due to poor fencing and fragmentation of holdings.  While every outbreak of disease is a matter of concern, there has been a significant improvement in recent months in TB prevalence within the county, dropping from a peak of 164 restricted herds in October 1985 to 119 at 31 January 1986.  A recent serious outbreak in a herd in the Donaghmoyne area of Carrickmacross is being closely monitored by my Department, with special attention being given to contiguous herds.  The indications so far suggest that the outbreak is not likely to occasion serious disease spread in the area concerned.</P>

      <P>I was particularly worried when I read some background information in this case.  A special check carried out on this herd on 4 October 1985 disclosed one reactor and the holding was duly restricted.  At a retest on 21 November all the animals were clear, but the second re-test on 13 February to determine if the restriction could be lifted disclosed 66 reactors out of a total of 149 animals.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the progress which has been made in the past 12 months in the elimination of bovine TB from the cattle herd; if he will say when it is likely that the cattle herd will be declared free of bovine TB; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the introduction of a number of improved procedures in the TB eradication scheme in 1985, an intensive round of testing commenced last June as part of a fresh drive against the disease.  In addition to a full monitor of the entire national herd, the round, which is scheduled to continue until 23 March, involved a special testing programme in all counties with particular attention to counties with the most serious infection levels.  The result of this intensified activity is that by the end of the current round the national herd will, on average, have been tested one and a <Col N="617" /> half times and, in badly affected areas, many herds will have been tested twice.</P>
      <P>Disease prevalence levels since the beginning of the round point to important progress.  By the end of October, prevalence levels had peaked at 7,128 herds restricted; there has since been a significant improvement to the point where there are now about 5,700 herds locked up due to TB.</P>
      <P>Given the unpredictable nature of disease, it would be presumptuous to speculate as to when the national herd will be entirely free of TB.  I believe, however, that the current round has shown that significant inroads can be made against the disease and that we can achieve worthwhile results in the badly infected areas over the remainder of the year.</P>

Has that been reduced?  Would the Minister say also if there has been a reduction effected as a result of the new methods?

      <P>We are discussing this budget in a vacuum.  We are in the unique situation of discussing a budget, the author of which has been moved from his ministry.  He was shown the red card and moved out.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to listen to Deputy Bell and the assessment he cited from that girl in Philadelphia.  I do not think one would need to go to Philadelphia to ascertain the same views on the problems confronting us, those created and what must now be done to remedy the ills of our economy.  There is no doubt that this budget constituted a juggling with figures and meant minimal changes only.  Budgets should charter the country's economic course for the ensuing year. Budget time is opportune to examine how the economy behaved in the preceding year, a time when we should establish our priorities for the coming year, taking a hard look at the overall economic position. An area crying out for attention is that of job creation and the development of our resources.  As time goes on we will have to look more attentively toward long-term development.  What we have been tending to do year after year is to borrow long term for short term benefits. As a nation we cannot continue in that vein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> The Minister for Agriculture made a couple of disturbing statements today.  It makes one realise that a reassessment must be carried out of our agricultural production, our methods and marketing. The fact that surpluses have increased fivefold over the past four years says something in itself.  What really concerns all of us are concessionary imports.  The Minister said we had 690,000 tonnes of beef in intervention, with 4,000 tonnes recently imported from Austria.  This will have to cease.  We talked for the past hour about the cessation scheme and the milk super-levy.  It appears that the more we reduce production the more other countries increase theirs, so that the problem remains.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the importation of food from non-Community countries.  In this respect in the years 1980 to 1982 18 per cent of livestock products were produced by way of food from outside the Community. Had we not had to cope with that 18 per cent we would have very few problems today.  For example, West Germany used 13 million tonnes of non-Community food to produce 56 million tonnes of livestock produce.  The corresponding figures for other countries were: Holland 13.4 million tonnes to produce 26 million tonnes of produce while we produced 9 million tonnes and imported 9 million tonnes only in non-Community foods.  Holland, a country with only 2.03 million hectares of farmland imported the equivalent of the produce of 2.4 million acres, effectively increasing their acreage by 117 per cent.  That is the problem with which we are faced.  It might be noted also that West Germany's imports increased their acreage by 24 per cent while, in Ireland, that would boost ours by 3 per cent only.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about the Common Agricultural Policy.  This must be subject to critical examination.  A country like ours cannot continue to have penalties inflicted on it by other member states, states with massive imports from outside the Community.</P>
    <P>It is very frightening to think that we are getting 20 per cent less for our milk <Col N="646" /> and much of our agricultural produce than other member states in the EC.  This happens at a time when everything is supposed to be levelled off, when Jack is supposed to be as good as his master and when everyone should have the same benefits.</P>
    <P>As regards the super-levy, if the 3 per cent was imposed on us at EC level for the cessation scheme it would cost us £35 million in exports.  It would mean 35 million gallons of milk less than at present.  It would have a serious effect on the production of calves for the beef sector.  Job creation in those areas will be almost impossible.  The Minister mentioned that 78 per cent of our land is used to produce surplus products.  That is a frightening figure.  People say that if this country was free from tuberculosis we could produce high quality products. That would depend on the availability of money in other countries to purchase those products.  We will have to move into the areas of fruit, vegetables and mushroom growing.  The sugar company, with all their State backing, show substantial losses.  In County Mayo the mushroom industry is going from strength to strength.  People must wonder where the fault lies.  It will have to be identified and eradicated.</P>
    <P>Money cannot be shifted from place to place either at local authority level or national level.  In the area of administration we seem to be very top heavy.  The machine is too big for the size of the field. If the amount of money to implement the schemes has to be reduced then the administration will have to be reduced accordingly.  Deputy Bell dealt at length with the problems created by a succession of budgets in respect of Border areas. The increase in the price of motor fuel has made the situation even worse in the Border areas.  Over the past four years dozens of small garages and filling stations went out of business because of the unfair trading position in which they were placed.  The Minister should accept that it is his responsibility to avoid making a certain area disadvantaged.  That is what has happened in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>People have become quite cynical. <Col N="647" /> They listened to politicians telling them what they were going to do about cross-Border development, the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the disadvantaged areas and so on.  There is no sympathy for the traders. People in the Border areas are beginning to wonder how many politicians are concerned with the development of that region.  I would like to see more action in this regard.  There should be some action taken in regard to the protection of traders in the Border areas against loss of profits arising from the major differential in motor fuel prices.</P>
    <P>Over the years costly surveys have been carried out and reports were issued on three different areas, the Erne catchment report, the social and economic committee of the EC and the NERDO report.  They all mentioned the severely handicapped areas.  The regional development organisation submitted a very detailed action programme on development strategy for Cavan, Monaghan and Louth to the Minister for Finance.  One of the last letters the Minister dictated before he left office was in keeping with his attitude towards that region.  It is a letter from the office of the Minister for Finance to Mr. Michael Garrett, the Director of NERDO.  It states that moreover, little evidence is provided that there would be an adequate net return to the economy as a whole and to the Exchequer on many of the expenditures proposed.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about returns for money, irrespective of whether or not the area is seriously disadvantaged.  Before the last election and since then the Government wearied everyone with their concern about balancing the books and the action they would take to achieve it if they were given time.  It is becoming more and more evident, particularly in this year's budget, that their concern was to have the figures right without any thought as to whether the proposed benefits would accrue to the intended recipients.  For example, in order to show that some effort was made to ease the burden on the PAYE sector, the Minister taxed a number of financial institutions while disregarding the small saver.  It is <Col N="648" /> essential to save money in order to meet education fees, weddings and funerals, to replace your car and to provide against illness.  Practically all PAYE taxpayers make some savings, great or small, on a fairly regular basis.  The Minister reduced tax in one area and increased it in another.  It is dishonest to claim that the burden is eased for the PAYE taxpayers when, in fact, it is the same or even greater.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, when the series of attacks on our old people in remote rural areas was at its peak, there was great emphasis on the need to reassure these people that they could with confidence use the Post Office and building societies for their small savings and nest eggs.  The Minister by a sweeping action and without making any special provision for those people or providing any means for claiming tax back, which they are not liable for, has made it almost certain that the small nest eggs will remain under the mattress or in a jug on the dresser.  The old will remain at risk because of the panic measures to extract this small amount of money from their savings.  Early in their period of office the Government called on people to bear with the hard measures then considered necessary.  The Government promised that there would be achievements as a result in regard to jobs, easing the tax burden and so forth.  People put up with the penalties and, unfortunately, they have not received any of the rewards. The job situation is worse than ever and the most recent budget measures have given no net improvement to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>There is a loss of confidence.  I do not mind people losing confidence in the Government but, when the Government lose confidence in themselves, the situation becomes serious.  In the budget no effort is made to get the construction industry moving again by easing the massive burden imposed by the 10 per cent VAT rate.  Regarding the house improvement grants I did welcome the decision of the Minister because 26,000 people who were waiting for inspections who <Col N="649" /> would not have got them because of shortage of inspectors.  That was a good idea and the work will get going.  The scheme should provide a lot of work this year.  It should improve employment in our quarries, for block manufacturers and builders providers.  That is to be welcomed. The Minister should be well aware of the problem which has been caused by the doubling of the VAT rate and should appreciate the benefits that would flow from cutting it back to 5 per cent.  The Minister should accept that the construction industry is in a very serious state of collapse at present.  If the construction teams which were built up over many years were to be disbanded or greatly reduced it would have a serious effect.</P>
    <P>A glaring omission from the budget is provision for dealing with the unemployment problem.  There is a saying that things are looking up.  Recent returns, when adjusted for seasonal factors, show only a slight improvement.  There is no real provision for action on the ground in the creation of more jobs.  We are not able to create jobs either in manufacturing or in agriculture.  We believed for many years that there was a great opportunity in the added value products of our agricultural production.  That has not materialised.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months I have been endeavouring unsuccessfully by way of parliamentary question and adjournment debate to get an explanation from the Minister for Agriculture regarding the monopoly that is exercised by the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards as far as the supply of milk to those two cities is concerned.  I put down a question to the Minister for Agriculture on 26 November 1985 as reported at column 43, Volume 362 of the Official Report asking:</P>
    <P>....if he will bring in amending legislation to discontinue the monopoly enjoyed by the Dublin Milk Board for the sales of milk in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>The same situation prevailed in Cork. The Minister's reply was:</P>
    <P>The system under which the milk <Col N="650" /> boards operate is currently being examined by the EC Commission.  I will be considering the position in the light of the outcome of that examination.</P>
    <P>The problem has arisen out of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936, which gives those two milk boards a monopoly of supply.  The Act was introduced at that time so that better quality milk could be provided.  The situation which has now emerged is that when a number of co-operatives contacted Brussels and objected to this monopoly being continued, the Commission gave not a decision but an opinion last December that it could not continue and should be dismantled.  I have been in touch with the Department of Agriculture and the EC Commission but nothing has happened since.  What is unfair is that the Dublin dairies deny provincial dairies the right to sell milk in the city unless the milk is produced within the Dublin area.  Nevertheless, those Dublin dairies go down to the provinces and dump milk there.  I take a very serious view of it as, under the Treaty of Rome, one of the things we expected was a fair do and that there would be no monopolistic situations.</P>
    <P>What is even more serious is that while we were awaiting a final decision from the EC, earlier this month a very strong lobby went out there to try to maintain the monopoly.  That would be in complete conflict with what the EC was set up for. I hope that the Minister and our MEPs will take a serious view of it and ensure that this monopoly is discontinued.  One aspect which annoys me is that because the institutions within the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards have a monopoly they operate a two tier price.  They are in a position to quote at a high price as the competition is not available.  In the more competitive areas outside they can alter their prices.  I ask the Minister for Health to examine the price structure of the milk boards in both Dublin and Cork as this is an area where there is a substantial amount of money spent on milk.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that we will have <Col N="651" /> to examine every area in which jobs could be created.  There is no doubt that in the field of tourism we have fallen down greatly.  Much more could be done.  In the region I come from I am continually disappointed at the allocation of moneys for general tourist development.  There should be a review and a close examination of all Department of Labour schemes.  The emphasis is on short term and temporary employment.  If we are to continue with these schemes we will have to have an approach which will provide jobs and the know-how which can be used in the development of our resources.  At the moment AnCO are operating a number of worth-while schemes in marketing and research which I hope they will continue.</P>
    <P>Although there has been an improvement in the volume of imports in some areas, this is a slow process.  Import substitution is an area in which we could provide more jobs.  One of the most remunerative areas of production is in the soft fruit area but people are not producing the fruit.  Inferior quality soft fruits are being imported and to bring them up to standard they have to use a percentage of our soft fruits.  We should develop that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a reduction in the allocation to ACOT and the AFT. There are serious implications in that, especially if they proceed with the charge for advisory services.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister indicated that in disease eradication we would not be restricted to the allocation made in the budget but that money would be available to ensure that the incidence of disease would not increase as a result of cutbacks in funds.  A number of reports have been issued recently about the results of the super-levy.  The CBF report particularly, outlined that as the result of the superlevy calf numbers are expected to decline by over 2.9 million head by 1990.  That would have a serious effect on meat plants to whom we are looking for further employment.  That, added to the unfavourable position we are in in competing <Col N="652" /> for the market for grain against the French, Germans and British, adds up to a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>During Dáil Question Time we raised the question of the problem facing local authorities with regard to finance and expecially with regard to funding for roads.  A recent article in <i>The Irish Press</i> referred to the break-up of roads, to a survey done by the county engineers and to the serious implications for the roads structure.  In my region there is a substantial amount of development in agriculture. In one area we have a large cold stores and the state of the roads is causing a huge problem for the big trucks who must use them.  A survey should be done by the Department of the Environment to point out the regions which are making an impact in job creation and in developing natural resources so that extra funds can be made available to maintain the roads in these areas so that progress is not restricted because of bad roads.  The use of heavier trucks and the increased cost of raw materials for road repairs as well as the decrease in the allocation for roads have brought about this situation where the local authorities are unable to repair the roads.  In Monaghan when we held an Estimates meeting we found that in effect we had £174,000 less to spend on roads than in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell mentioned the importation of shoes.  We will have to have a different approach in relation to import substitution.  When I came into the Dáil 13 years ago I was asking questions about finance for tanneries as there were two in operation in the county at the time.  There was a problem with warbles and there was a certain treatment to ensure better quality hides at that time.  The scheme was very successful.  Now we do not use the same number of hides at all.  In October 1984 I asked the Minister the percentage of bovine hides exported unprocessed in 1983 and I was told that 87 per cent of the hides of the estimated slaughtered animals were exported and that imports of leather in 1983 amounted to 1,226 tonnes with a value of £8.1 million.  That was when the numbers employed in the tanneries had dropped by over 50 per <Col N="653" /> cent over the previous few years.  It is a very small number now.  The quality of the hides we were providing was first class and the people who were bringing the hides out of our country were enjoying an export subsidy.  The number employed between 1974 and 1983 dropped from 1,500 to 700 and it has dropped further since then.  That is what we face at present and it is inexcusable that such a situation should exist.</P>
    <P>In June last year I asked the Taoiseach the value of footwear imported in 1984 and if he would express this as a percentage of the Irish market.  Imports of footwear at that time were £100.1 million. Based on the quantities involved it was estimated that the import share of the domestic footwear market for the same year was about 92 per cent.  No wonder a Deputy here who was a secretary of the Leather Workers Union was critical of how that area collapsed.  Relating it back to the number of people in the country, for every man, woman and child you would be talking about £20 per head for footwear alone imported into this country.  It is a figure that we cannot continue to justify.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I have raised a number of times in this House is the amount of money we are spending on drugs.  I have been a member of a health board for many years and I am satisfied from investigations we have done in different areas, including the federation of health boards, that we could make extensive savings if generic drugs were used rather than those under a brand name.  I have given instances in this House of the savings we could make if we were to adopt that practice.  In many cases drugs supplied under a brand name cost double or treble the price they would cost as generic drugs.  Only last year the British Minister of Health issued a directive that the lowest priced generic drugs would be used if the quality was all right.  A notice in an American periodical lately indicated that action in America was been taken to ensure that generic drugs would be used as against brand name drugs.  In the last couple of weeks we have been talking in this House about closures of <Col N="654" /> hospitals and reductions in the numbers of hospital beds and the general fall-off in services which we are providing.  I am not being critical.  I am a member of a health board and I realise the amount of money we are getting, the work we have to do with it and the demand people make for services to which they think they are entitled.  <i>The Irish Press</i> of 13 February contained an article by their consumer affairs correspondent, Tim Hayes, entitled &ldquo;Irish Drugs Dearest&rdquo;.  He stated that Irish prices for a shopping basket of 84 top drugs were 81 per cent higher than French prices, according to a drug survey which found that many of the most trusted painkillers were basically the same.  He said that Irish prices for painkillers were 70 per cent higher than British prices and our prices for nerve drugs were 54 per cent higher than Italy's.  We have the highest prices for five products which he mentioned in medical terms, and they are all pain killers and sedatives. A report in the current issue of the consumer association magazine <i>Consumer Choice,</i> highlights how different information on the packaging can result in patients in different countries having significantly different instructions and guidelines for product use.  The association examined over 30 non-prescription products on the market for relief of pain and concluded that, while they are likely to be much the same in terms of effectiveness, they are considerably different in terms of price.  With the restrictions under which we are operating in all areas it is inexcusable that something is not done about that.  The heavy hand will have to be applied and generic drugs used in our institutions and in the GMS rather than the very expensive brand named drugs.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the western package today.  In 1981, under Deputy MacSharry, the western package was introduced with a provision of £300 million over a ten year period.  For the first five years the take-up of it was £103 million instead of £150 million.  An element in that was private afforestation.  Here is an area of great opportunity for development and for building for the future. <Col N="655" /> Timber is one product that we can say without fear of contradiction will be scarce and very scarce before the end of our lifetime.  With so much surplus production in the EC, timber is one product which is insufficient in the EC member states and it will continue to be in short supply in the years ahead.  It is estimated that there will be a world shortfall of timber by the year 2000 and a 32 per cent shortfall in the year 2025. That is 40 years ahead but still a comparatively short time in the life of a nation. The UK imports 90 per cent of its wood requirements at present and can supply only one-tenth of its needs to the end of the century.  Today we are talking about the long haul we have with our beef products, etc., into the EC market, and here we have a product that we can grow.  It is accepted generally that especially in the drumlin soils of Cavan, Leitrim and part of County Monaghan to the west, afforestation has a high rate of growth, four times higher than in some other EC countries.  We have only 6 per cent of our land under timber as against 25 per cent in some other nations.  We should utilise our advantages.  We have the soil, the climate and the annual growth rate.  The growth rate for spruce and pine is 15 cu.m. per hectare as against 11 in the UK and two to five in the rest of Europe. Home grown timber supplies 25 per cent of the demand for construction softwoods of which we import £50 million worth per year.  Total wood and wood products imported here per year amount to £400 million to £500 million.  Recently I was in a builder's yard and I went into a shed in which there were a dozen different types of chipboard.  Not one of those bales of chipboard was manufactured in this country. I thought it really serious to see that, in an area where we had a plentiful supply of it and more coming on stream.  We will have to examine this closely.</P>
    <P>Private afforestation carries the highest grant aid rate in the EC for any development.  It is as high as 85 per cent for private afforestation and 70 per cent for others.  The take-up there has been hopeless.  Out of £19 million allocated in 1981 for a ten year period about £640,000 <Col N="656" /> has been taken up in the first five years to the end of December.  That is a ridiculously poor take-up.  Compare that with England where four main forestry management companies, encouraged by taxation incentives, employ 1,200 people with a turnover of £55 million.  They are making a profit of £2.5 million.  We cannot sit on the fence any longer as far as the afforestation of marginal land and private afforestation are concerned. There was a report from Wicklow that the men working in the sawmills there had gone on strike because of the flow of timber into the mills of Northern Ireland. Purchases of such imports 12 months in advance had accounted for 50,000 cubic metres of timber and the factories in Wicklow which would require 2,500 cubic metres per week to keep them in operation are working on short time; 25 workers have been laid off since Christmas and there are another 35 workers on notice.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, in the North there is a programme for private afforestation.  They have not available the same amount of land that we have, or the same amount of Drumlin soil, but they have a target of 1,500 acres per year and will probably reach it.  The sawmill industry there gives good employment. Last year in Waterford I saw a delivery of sawn timber being made from Ballycassidy Mills in County Fermanagh and that timber may have been clear felled in Wicklow, brought to Fermanagh and then returned.  This whole economic jungle does not make sense.  There are some matters that we will have to examine very closely and soon.</P>
    <P>At present there are many local authorities, urban and county councils which buy a quantity of nursery stock. From discussions with those involved in the business, I learn that a substantial number of plants are imported in 1984 amounting to £3,500,000.  Many of these plants could have been grown here in small nurseries around the country. There is also the area of brick imports, increasing in quantity as time goes by and we have the necessary quarry material here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> I want to dwell very briefly on the recent report presented to the Minister for Industry and Commerce by a supermarket group regarding import substitution, which gives a lot of encouragement. We have been talking in this House about many millions of pounds of frozen chips being imported.  Over the past couple of years that supermarket group have reduced these imports by 62 per cent &mdash; £570,000 worth &mdash; which is a substantial amount of money for a not highly priced commodity.  There was a long list of articles which had been almost 100 per cent imported.  The report emphasises that import subsitution cannot be dealt with completely at Government or ministerial level, although a working party of Ministers of State were set up to examine the position and they did very good work. The work that the Government can do in this area is limited.  It is up to those in the retail and wholesale outlets to promote import substitution and to purchase the commodities.  It is just as important to sell Irish goods as to export them.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Cooney, in the debate on the motion of no confidence in the Government referred to members on this side of the House using prepared scripts and I was a little annoyed at this. I have been a Member of this House for 13 years and nobody ever prepared a script for me.  I was not given one iota of background information, but had to make my own inquiries.  While that might be the Minister's belief, I do not operate using a supplied script and do not intend to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Leonard. Most of us come in here under our own steam, having done our own research.  We try to put our points as clearly as possible, as Deputy Leonard has done in the past three quarters of an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget was presented against the background of trying to maintain levels of services which we could not afford. We have maintained them through borrowing on such a scale that that borrowing is now seriously undermining our <Col N="658" /> economic growth and our living standards. We have a total national debt of approximately £20 billion.  This level of debt is a good barometer of our desire for public funded goods and services and of how our appetite for these services has outweighed our willingness to work and apply ourselves to creating wealth.  Taxation has ever increased but not sufficiently to finance the expansion and maintenance of these services.  We have had to supplement taxation incomes by foreign borrowings, the funding of which at the moment is working out at £20,000 for each worker in the State.</P>
    <P>Even if we do not set about cutting public spending, we are still adding £2 billion to our debt annually.  If we continue to borrow at the present level the future of our children will be bleak.  Our independence as a State will be under threat from the international banking institutions.  As a nation we are living from day to day.  We are living for today and forgetting about tomorrow.  In the coming year we should resurrect efficiency and enterprise.  Somebody in Government would do a great service to the State by declaring next year the Year of Efficiency and Enterprise.  Both of those concepts appear to be dead.  We are living in a country choked by bureaucracy, where initiative and adventure are stifled at birth.</P>
    <P>Every party in this House has identified the major problems of the country as unemployment and high taxation.  How do you reduce taxation without creating more unemployment?  Most people conclude that we are in a vicious circle.  Cut public spending in order to cut taxation and you create more unemployment and the circle goes around.  We can break that vicious circle in a number of ways.  We can do it, first, by being really ruthless about efficiency in our public spending. Secondly, we can create more wealth in our system and I will deal with that later. Thirdly, we can eliminate many of the restrictive practices in all avenues of the nation's affairs.  These are choking the system and creating wealth for a minority. Until such time as we deal with these three matters simultaneously, we are just <Col N="659" /> wasting time.  By having more efficiency in the public sector we can cut spending. There are many areas in which inefficiency should be eliminated and this would not result in job losses.  The elimination of inefficiency will always be opposed by the vested interests within the sector affected.  Any attempts by a Government to achieve efficiency will be the writing of that Government's epitaph. They will be committing political suicide.</P>
    <P>A person who will go down in history as one of the most courageous Ministers for decades is Deputy Barry Desmond who has tried his utmost to eliminate the many inefficiencies in our health service and who is being screwed to the wall by vested interests, as we have seen from month to month.  Attempts made by him to eliminate inefficiencies in the health service, which are devouring £1.25 billion each year, have attracted a most vicious, vociferous and abusive reaction from some of the most privileged people in the country.  We know as Members of the House that he is committing political suicide, but he is big enough and strong enough to take on these issues.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Committee on Public Expenditure, and recently we set about examining the health service.  One of the first people we had to give evidence was a spokesperson for one of the most powerful groups in the country, the IMA. We asked him to give evidence as to how we could bring about efficiencies and savings in the scheme and we were treated to a session on what that organisation wanted from the system, not what it could put into the system.  That small episode is an indication of what is wrong in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Before I deal in detail with some of the problems confronting us I should like to note that it is sad to see the only two people here now are the Deputy opposite and myself.  We have to look at our system here in the Oireachtas.  I came here in 1981 thinking I could change the world, but we are dragged down and stifled by the system that operates.  We <Col N="660" /> were given a small outlet, one that is fulfilling in ways, the Oireachtas committee system, but committees can only go so far.  The entire system needs radical reform and surgery.  If the people knew what goes on here they would be amazed. We are discussing a budget five weeks after its presentation and I am doubtful about what effect my speech will have. At least I prepared what I have to say and am putting it on record.  I do not suppose I am achieving anything.  Until we revise our system here we cannot cast stones at other systems.</P>
    <P>I will deal first of all with the major consumer of public money, the health service, which has become a major issue in recent times.  A sum of £1.26 billion is being consumed, £680 million by the hospital services, and major questions that spring to mind are not being answered.  For instance, health expenditure has increased by 64 per cent at constant prices in the past ten years, and possibly by several hundred per cent in actual levels.</P>
    <P>Have our population become 64 per cent healthier?  The demand on hospitals and outpatient clinics is growing by the day.  Therefore, our system has become more inefficient and wasteful, but is still drawing and demanding more and more resources from the State.  It is something that will have to be taken on in a major way.  We must look at the factors that have contributed to these inefficiencies and we must consider what services have been added or taken out.</P>
    <P>During the past ten years staff in the health service has increased by almost 50 per cent.  What was the policy basis for this increase?  Is there overmanning?  We are trying to come to terms with those issues but we do not seem to be able to get straight answers.  In outpatient clinics we see overcrowding, people being herded in and out without appointments, people waiting for hours and hours.  This is a symptom of something that is very bad and inefficient in the health service but we do not seem to be taking any action on it.</P>
    <P>Have we done anything about major capital cost overruns in the health service? <Col N="661" /> For example, Tralee hospital started out at £6 million and the cost has gone up to £25 million.  Public representatives have questioned it but we cannot get answers.  We are getting professional reports from architects and surveyors giving reasons why a project should overrun to such an extent, but no real answers.  When we attempt to get people before committees we find it very difficult to get them to talk.  These things must be taken on and we must be given answers. The time has come to stop this.</P>
    <P>There have been allegations of fraud, theft and abuse in the health service but there have not been any real answers. Questions have been asked about the manner in which professionals have abused the system by using staff and equipment in our hospitals without making any effort to compensate health boards or the Exchequer.  I think the whole system is being utilised by powerful individuals to make themselves rich, and we must put a stop to it.  There has to be an immediate review of the common contract in the case of consultants.  If we do not take these things on, the health service will not survive and neither will the country.</P>
    <P>We must look at the levels of payment made to other staffs in the health service, such as GPs and pharmacists.  Should we change the system so that instead of paying so much per visit we pay capitation fees per patient?  That should have been investigated in depth.  It has not been done.  We should look at the deployment of staff and facilities in the health boards. We have not done it.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to health board officials in different areas and I have been told that financial control is not all it should be.  In recent times the Department imposed on health boards a computer system which is ineffective in the control of finance and in the control of stocks and staff.  Department of Health officials should be asked who decided on the computer system that has been imposed on health boards without any consultation with them.</P>
    <P>We must look at the areas of overlapping as between the Departments of <Col N="662" /> Health and Agriculture in matters of food hygiene and general standards in our food industry.  That is being done by two Departments.  We should look at the control of accounts in relation to social welfare payments.  That was raised recently but there were no answers.  These are some of the things that have to be tackled fast if we are to get any real reduction in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>There are three factors involved in reducing taxation and creating more employment.  I will deal with the creation of wealth.  We can create more wealth by concentrating on indigenous industries, such as food processing, because we are light years behind continental Europe. There is a huge market there for exporting our food unprocessed.  If we processed it here, we could provide added value foods to the European market but we are not doing that.</P>
    <P>There was a recent attempt to overlap the Departments of Agriculture and Industry but I am disappointed that we did not seem to be able to come to grips with this reservoir of resources.  I look on this as a major failure.  We have been told that there are gas and oil fields off our coasts but we failed to bring the oil ashore, although we brought some gas ashore.  There are other gas fields but we are only utilising the Kinsale gas field and it has cost millions of pounds each year to keep pressure up.  It is costing us millions to put in an infrastructure to take gas to Dublin, Limerick and further north, using only one gas field.  Where are we going?  Why can we not get more gas ashore?  Why have we failed to tap into the huge gas reservoir which is available in continental Europe, from as far away as Turkey and Siberia?  Why not invest in a gas link between Ireland and Britain which would enable us to tap into the European gas grid?  These questions have not been addressed and it is about time they were.</P>
    <P>The Government have updated and clarified the licensing terms and the taxation arrangements, but people in the oil and gas industries to whom I have spoken believe there is still major uncertainty as to the level of State participation in any <Col N="663" /> discovery.  I have no vested interest in any oil company, but I am concerned about the numbers of unemployed, which are growing by the day.  This is an area with huge potential for growth.  If we could get more gas and oil ashore the development across the south coast, from Kerry to Wexford, would be enormous and would create thousands of jobs.  We are told the oil is there but we cannot get it ashore because of wrangling over taxation and other issues.</P>
    <P>A new Government policy is vital to create the proper opinion and climate for increased oil exploration.  The proof of this is the 1983 decision of the United Kingdom Government to revise their licensing terms.  This decision was followed by a boom in oil fields which up to then were termed marginal.  The most expert opinion we have about our oil fields is that they will be numerous, small, marginal fields and the companies would require attractive terms to bring the oil ashore.  Anybody who risks his money exploring oil fields deserves a return for his money.  As I said, I do not represent anybody when I say this.  I believe we are not offering the oil companies a proper return for their risk investment.  That is where the problem lies and that is why we are not creating jobs.  It is jobs I am interested in.</P>
    <P>The Government should immediately make the climate more favourable to oil exploration companies.  If this is done a higher level of activity will follow thereby increasing the chances of a commercial discovery.  If oil discoveries are made and oil is brought ashore the Government, in view of changing circumstances, could review the situation after a number of years.  Surely in these times when there is a slump in the price of oil we should be making our terms more attractive even than Britain.  Even though they have confirmed fields, British terms are more attractive than ours.  Is there any sense in that?</P>
    <P>It is vital for the future of this country that a re-think of this policy be brought about immediately.  I welcome a suggestion made by a colleague in Cork in recent <Col N="664" /> months that a petroleum development company be set up to develop this area. Our negotiators have at times been influenced by speculation on the stock exchange and their expectations were gauged by the response of the stock exchange rather than reality.  The reality is that we can only hope to have small, marginal fields.  Unless a very attractive package is offered to the multinationals, Ireland will be left dependent on foreign imports.  We will not have the jobs which would arise from the development of the oil fields and the economy will not benefit in a major way.  We will be doomed to high unemployment and high taxation in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I would like some answers to the gas situation.  We are ploughing ahead with massive investment in infrastructure but nobody seems to know or care what the situation is in relation to the Anglo-Irish gas deal, what is the situation in relation to the European gas grid, and what are the prospects for the future development of gas fields off our coast.  Before any further investment is made in infrastructure these answers should be clearly spelled out.  The time has come when a clearcut energy policy must be introduced without further delay.</P>
    <P>Despite the bleak picture I have painted, there are positive features too. We have lower inflation, our competitiveness has improved and our exchange rate in the EMS in relation to the pound sterling and the dollar has improved.  The Minister for Finance was faced with a dilemma in proposing the budget, and that was how to meet the demands for cuts in personal taxation, how to reduce our deficit budgeting and at the same time balance the budget in favour of job creation.  I believe he has managed in no small degree to take positive steps towards job creation through selective cuts in VAT in labour intensive services.</P>
    <P>Coming from an area which is very dependent on tourism, I welcome the reduction in VAT for certain services.  I believe that, despite the setbacks we have had because of the absence of a car ferry &mdash; through no fault of the Government but because of a breakdown in negotiation <Col N="665" /> between the company and others &mdash; the coming year will be very good for the Cork-Kerry area.  The cut in personal taxation is welcome but we all agree that the level of personal taxation in recent years has been such that personal initiative was killed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán Byrne has been given permission to raise the following matter on the Adjournment of the House: why the feasibility study being carried out at Ballingarry Anthracite Mines, County Tipperary, has been discontinued.  The Deputy has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for allowing me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  With your permission, I will share my time with Deputy Brendan Griffin and Deputy Seán McCarthy from the same constituency, who are as concerned as I am about this matter.  In Ballingarry, a small mining village in County Tipperary, 220 people line up every week to collect their dole money while over £10 million worth of top grade anthracite lies unexploited beneath their feet.  The mines and valuable machinery are flooded under hundreds of feet of water since the mine closed two years ago. Almost £5.5 million was poured into the mine over its last two year working period.  Miners want to know where the money went and when they can go back to work in what was once their sole source for earning a decent living.  There was an article about the mines in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 24 February 1986 entitled &ldquo;Ballingarry Mines £5 million Black Hole&rdquo;.  The question was asked in the article: &ldquo;Where did all the taxpayers' money go?&rdquo; We were under the impression, after a series of <Col N="666" /> meetings over the past few months between the Minister for Energy, the Minister of State, the receiver, the liquidator and officials from the Department of Energy and all the public representatives, that something would be done.  We hoped that the unemployed families in Ballingarry village and district would be given some hope.  We felt we were reaching a point where the legal jungle could be sorted out and the feasibility study could go ahead.</P>
      <P>I believe the feasibility study started about three weeks ago.  I was informed yesterday that it was about to be discontinued and I was informed this morning that the company concerned were requested to pay approximately £30,000 to the receiver, Mr. Somers.  The company concerned, Carter and Kelvin, have now pulled out of the deal and the people in the Ballingarry area are very worried about what will happen and if another year will pass before this mess is sorted out.  Many of those people have large families and they have suffered great hardship over the past two years.  There is no employment in the immediate area and they still hope the mine will open in the near future.  I look forward to any hope the Minister can give us this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go into all the details of the sad history of this mine over the years except to say that the people in South Tipperary want the mine opened in the national interest and in the interest of the unemployed people who feel they are entitled to earn a living out of this excellent anthracite mine, the best in Europe.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that the feasibility study can go ahead, the taxpayers will then see that £5 million of their money was not wasted and that employment will be created for many years ahead.  I am disappointed to hear of the events which took place over the past two days and I would like to hear the reason for them.  Late last year after a meeting Oireachtas Members had with Mr. Somers, we got the impression that the feasibility study was going ahead.  We thought all the legal matters were tidied <Col N="667" /> up and there would be no more problems. Unfortunately this is not the case.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  I had to do something similar a fortnight ago.  This is an indication of the unemployment we have in South Tipperary.  I hope I will get the same type of information tonight as I got from the Minister of State two weeks ago in connection with Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank my colleague, Deputy Sean Byrne, for allowing me part of his time on this question on the Adjournment.  I share with him the concern of the people of the northern part of the constituency, particularly those in Ballingarry, about what has happened. Today sees another sad chapter in the chequered history of the Ballingarry mines.  It is ironic that the withdrawal of Mr. Bob Carter from Ballingarry mines should occur on the day when the <i>Today Tonight</i> programme on RTE 1 will be on Ballingarry mines and people will see how a national asset like this has been abused by people.  I recommend the Minister, Deputies in the House and anybody concerned about the spending of taxpayers' money to view this programme carefully tonight.  There will be many eye-openers as to where taxpayers' money as been misspent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues from south Tipperary and I, as well as many other people in that area, have worked strenuously to try to have the very valuable anthracite mines in Ballingarry reopened.  There are very valuable deposits of anthracite in the mines.  There are 150 miners there capable of mining this anthracite.  They just want to be given the right to work. After one and a half years of strenuous effort we were delighted to note that Mr. Bob Carter of Kelvin Energy Limited, a Vancouver based company, was given permission by the Department of Energy to carry out a feasibility study.  As Deputy Sean Byrne has said, the feasibility study was in progress, the drilling machinery was on site and everything was going along smoothly.  However, last week we heard that Mr. Somers, the receiver, had <Col N="668" /> written to Mr. Bob Carter challenging his right to be on the site.  The solicitors acting on behalf of Mr. Somers had written to the owners of the drilling machinery requesting them to leave the site.  We know that as and from today Mr. Carter has been told by his board of directors to leave the site and to have nothing more to do with the Ballingarry Anthracite Mines.</P>
    <P>This came as a great shock to all of us who hoped that at long last there was some prospect of the reopening of the mines.  I thank the Minister of State and the Department of Energy for facilitating us over the past one and a half years.  On every occasion we requested him to meet a deputation of the elected public representatives of south Tipperary and all those involved in Ballingarry he did so willingly and placed his office at our disposal. We met on various occasions and we got first class co-operation from him. It is unbelievable, with everything apparently running smoothly that, at the final juncture, this snag should have occurred causing Mr. Carter to withdraw completely from the site.  I ask the Minister to act as a go between between Mr. Somers and Mr. Carter.  Surely there is some other way that Mr. Somers could have approached the matter rather than directing Mr. Carter to leave the site.  If Mr. Bob Carter is not encouraged to come back onto the site again, I have great fears for the future of Ballingarry mines. Mr. Carter had all the expertise and financial backing.  I understand that he was a man of integrity, that his company was one of integrity and that he had all the attributes necessary for getting Ballingarry mines working properly and profitably. This impasse is an abuse of the asset there, of the miners, of the people of Ballingarry, especially the families and dependants of the miners who are waiting and willing to work but because of some legal hiccup the whole project is put in jeopardy again.</P>
    <P>The Minister must get Mr. Somers and Mr. Carter around the table again and urge them to resolve the legal problem, ensuring that Mr. Carter will continue his feasibility study when, hopefully, Ballingarry <Col N="669" /> mines will go into full production.  I would ask the Minister of State to contact Mr. Carter.  I understand he is still in London.  Shortly before 5 o'clock I 'phoned his hotel but he was not available.  He had not checked out of the hotel but there was no reply from his suite.  I can give the Minister of State his hotel telephone number so that he and his Department can continue to get in touch with him, beg of him not to return to Canada, to return to Dublin and resolve whatever small problem remains outstanding on the legal side.  Above all, the people of Ballingarry demand of us, their public representatives, to ask the Minister to do that on their behalf.  I have the matter in the capable hands of the Minister, urging him to do everything possible to ensure that Ballingarry Mines are put back into full production as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank my constituency colleague, Deputy Seán Byrne, for facilitating me by allowing me some of his time.  As has been said, the news we have heard over the last two days is extremely depressing and distressing, particularly for those of us who are the public representatives of that area.  It is even worse for the natives of Ballingarry. It is very disheartening to discover that for some reason &mdash; perhaps best known to himself &mdash; the receiver has appeared to prevent the feasibility study, which had been undertaken by Mr. Carter and his company, from proceeding.  Perhaps there is an explanation.  It is unfortunate that it appears now as though that company have decided to pull out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that there is a very valuable, viable natural resource in Ballingarry, very high quality anthracite. Various independent mining engineers who were not associated with the Department or with any of the companies which in the past operated the mine, have estimated that the lifetime of the mine is approximately 30 to 40 years and that it would afford employment for that period.  The families concerned in the area have a tradition of mining, passed down from grandfather to father, to son. <Col N="670" /> Many families there literally do not know how to do anything else except involve themselves in coalmining.  The underground life has been part and parcel of their history.  Over 220 people are now unemployed in the village of Ballingarry, giving it probably the highest percentage unemployment rate, in relation to its population, of any village in this country.</P>
    <P>It should be noted also that the workers in that mine showed their commitment to the long term project before the mine was put into receivership by having worked for a considerable period of time without pay.  This should be remembered by some people who are inclined to engage in labour-bashing.  It should be remembered that the workers in Ballingarry were prepared to work, and did work, for a number of weeks without pay while waiting and hoping that moneys would be provided to allow the mine to continue in operation.  Unfortunately, the requisite moneys were not found. Now the mines are flooded.  Ballingarry mines have had a chequered history over the years.  I happen to have particular knowledge of the last concern to operate there.  I can only say now, as I did before, that the company was run in a bizarre fashion, that there was extreme mystery surrounding its operations.  For that reason, I could not have any confidence in that company.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and his Department will take every step necessary to ensure that this valuable, viable national resource will be fully exploited, that genuinely interested, sincere and committed sources or parties will be facilitated in every way.  I know the Minister and his Department will do so. It is terribly sad that the workers and families in that area have been caught up in the world of high business finance, that they have been made to appear as the pawns in a battle between powerful business interests.  Many of those families had incurred debts and had made arrangements to repay them, being confident that their jobs were secure.  I would exhort the Minister to make every effort to ensure that the company who had been undertaking the feasibility study will be <Col N="671" /> encouraged to continue in order to give continuing hope to the families there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my Department have been keeping in very close touch with developments in relation to the Ballingarry coalmine.  Nothing would give me more pleasure than to see employment once again at that mine for the people of Ballingarry.</P>
      <P>I should like to trace the history of the developments there because they are, to a large measure now, beyond my ministerial control.  I am sure Deputies will be aware that the mining lease was assigned to Flair Resources (Ireland) Limited in 1982.  I should say that when we assign a lease &mdash; and this is really a function of the Minister for Energy &mdash; my Department are not involved in giving grants, loans or moneys to mining companies to operate mines.</P>
      <P>Ours is a statutory duty to examine applications for mining leases and to grant them whenever we are satisfied that the technical and management capabilities are there.  That was done in 1982. The mining company went into receivership in January 1985.  Prior to that the company, Flair Resources (Ireland) Limited, had entered into an agreement with another Canadian company, Kelvin Energy Limited.  The agreement provided for the conduct of a feasibility study by Kelvin Energy Limited and for assignment of the State mining lease to Kelvin if the outcome of the feásibility study was satisfactory and if the consent of the Minister for Energy was forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commencement of the feasibility study was held up due to legal difficulties in relation to the lease.  In November 1985 the receiver sought the Minister's concurrence to the feasibility study and requested that the Minister indicate his position on the question of assignment of a lease to Kelvin Energy Limited.  This matter was considered by me and my officials.  A letter from my Department in early January 1986 indicated that there was no objection to the feasibility study and also that, if Kelvin satisfied the Minister <Col N="672" /> that they had the financial, managerial and technical resources to establish and maintain viable mining operation at Ballingarry, the Minister would be prepared to agree to the assignment of the lease to them.  The House must be satisfied that we in the Department have acted in the most positive and helpful manner with a view to carrying out the feasibility study and to indicating that we could grant a mining lease in the circumstances which I have described.</P>
    <P>It was then a matter for the receiver and Kelvin Energy Limited to make mutually acceptable arrangements for the commencement of the feasibility study.  That is an important statement and it may be the nub of the problem.  I understand that drilling operations commenced at Ballingarry a few weeks ago but not on a basis satisfactory to the receiver.  He required that the work should cease until arrangements acceptable to him for the conduct of the drilling were made.  This is a matter of the rights of the receiver being maintained.  These matters are outside the remit of the Department.  They are within the remit of the receiver.</P>
    <P>A number of meetings have taken place this week between the receiver and representatives of Kelvin Energy Limited. A further meeting was arranged for yesterday but was cancelled as one of the principal parties involved was not available.  The receiver has informed the Department that he is awaiting an approach about the new arrangements for the cancelled meeting.  The resolution of the difficulties encountered in relation to the feasibility study is primarily a matter for the receiver and for Kelvin Energy Limited.  While I am not involved in the breakdown of arrangements for the feasibility study I am concerned that every possibility should be fully explored for the reopening of the mine which would restore substantial employment in the Ballingarry area.  I have indicated to both parties that senior officials of my Department will be available to attend meetings between the parties if it is considered that the attendance of departmental officials would be helpful.  I can <Col N="673" /> do no more than offer the expertise within my Department to help in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have noted the Deputies' remarks as to why drilling operations have ceased. Certain statements have been made on which I will not comment because they were inaccurate.  I do not think it would be helpful in any way for me to enter into the area of the rights and wrongs of this matter.  I hope that the parties can resolve their difficulties.  They are both aware that if I can help I will do so.  To look to me to solve this difficulty by bringing pressure to bear on the parties is unrealistic. I cannot pressurise either party to act in a way which they might consider to be contrary to their interests.  The best resolution to this problem can be achieved <Col N="674" /> by negotiations directly between Mr. Carter and Mr. Somers, the receiver.</P>
    <P>People often feel that it is the Minister who is at fault.  This is not the case.  The receiver has his legal and commercial rights.  The company have their rights and objectives and they must fit into their own scene.  For me to comment in detail on the difficulties that have arisen between the receiver and the company would be inappropriate and might be harmful so I will desist from doing so.  I am more than aware of the Deputies' concern.  They have continuously been in touch with me about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to the EC cheap intervention grain being made available under the feed voucher scheme. Under the scheme it is not the intention that farmers should purchase the EC grain with their &ldquo;grain&rdquo; voucher.  Instead, they negotiate a value for their entitlement to such grain with their merchants who supply them with feeding stuffs to that amount.  The merchants can then either draw grain direct from an intervention store or else trade on the voucher.</P>
      <P>Traders have no difficulty in getting supplies of this grain on foot of vouchers presented.  The Department of Agriculture has already allocated 81,000 tonnes and there is still a balance of around 44,000 tonnes available.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason for the reduction of 75 per cent in the domestic rate grant to Carrickmacross Urban District Council; and the provision he will make for the council to purchase a site for a car park in the centre of the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the domestic rate grant allocation has been revised, I have authorised Carrickmacross UDC instead to use £65,000 from accumulated housing capital reserves and I have also allowed the council to apply 100 per cent of the proceeds of local authority house sales for general revenue purposes.  The net result of these changes has been to allow a financial allocation of £105,000 to the council this year made up of the revised domestic rate grant and the other funding mentioned.  This is anincrease of 1.5 per cent on the original domestic rate grant allocation notified to Carrickmacross in December of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> The provision of the car park in Carrickmacross is primarily a matter for the urban district council and the cost would fall to be met from the council's own resources.  As I have already stated, the council will have additional resources at their disposal in 1986.  The council may, at its discretion, use the block grant for roads to supplement expenditure from its own funds for this purpose.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give details of the total amount of the State housing subsidy to date; the lovel of subsidy this represents on a weekly basis to local authority houses; how this compares with similar subsidies by other EC countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1977 the loan charges incurred by local authorities on borrowings for the provision of houses for letting have been met in full by State subsidy. For many years prior to that, the loan charges were funded both from State contributions and local authority rates, and figures representing the cumulative State contribution are not readily available. The total amount of subsidy paid by the State from 1977 to 1985 is £818 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> The level of subsidy per week represented by the State's expenditure depends on the average cost of building local authority houses and the rate of interest applying to loans from the local loans fund.  In 1985 the average weekly subsidy for each new local authority house was about £85; in 1986 the corresponding figure will fall to about £68, because of a reduction in the interest rate on loans.</P>

      <P>In January my predecessor and the Minister for Health announced that a new unit in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital will, when completed, be transferred to the Department of Justice for the use of the prison service.  This unit is not yet completed and I understand that a number of further works may be necessary to render it suitable for offenders. Arrangements for its hand-over to my Department have, accordingly, not yet been finalised.</P>
      <P>Broadly, the purpose of the unit's transfer to my Department is to enable facilities to be provided to treat, in modern and hygienic conditions, offenders with AIDS antibodies and drug and drug-related problems.  It is proposed that, for the foreseeable future, it will be used to cater primarily for female offenders with these types of medicalrelated problems.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that staff attached to the Mountjoy Women's Prison will be redeployed to the new Dundrum unit but it may not be necessary for all of them to transfer to Dundrum as the intention is to staff the unit there (and, indeed, all the prisons) on a mixed basis in accordance with the European Communities (Employment Equality) Regulations, 1985.</P>

      <P>Figures relating to the total number of hours of overtime worked by the Garda for each of the years 1982 to 1984 and for 1985 up to 30 September were included in the replies to Questions Nos. 719 and 720 on 30 April 1985 and Questions Nos. 176 and 177 on 17 December 1985.  Figures for the total number of hours of overtime worked by the Garda in each division during 1985 are set out in the following table.  Compilation of the further details sought about the hours of overtime worked in those periods would involve a disproportionate amount of time and resources.  Garda organisation is, in general, linked to what are referred to as &ldquo;roster periods&rdquo; and not to calendar <Col N="639" /> months and records of overtime, etc., reflect that fact.</P>
      <P>As regards the details sought in the question in relation to the cost of Garda overtime, I would refer the Deputy to the final paragraph of the reply to Questions Nos. 176 and 177 on 17 December 1985 in so far as the years 1982 to 1984 are concerned.  The provisional outturn of expenditure on overtime on the Garda Síochána Vote in 1985 is £12.5 million.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the NIHE, Limerick Act, 1980, student fees are determined by the governing body of the institute subject to the approval of the Minister for Education.  I understand that no decision has yet been made by the governing body in regard to the level of the fees in the institute for the 1986-87 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recurrent grant provided by my Department in 1986 for third level educational institutions funded through the Higher Education Authority took account of a general increase in tuition fees of 10 per cent to be effective from the commencement of the 1986-87 academic year.  The National Institute for Higher <Col N="642" /> Education, Limerick, is one of the institutions concerned.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that grants under the higher education grants scheme cover payment of fees as well as maintenance. It will also be appreciated that the maintenance element of the grants was increased by 10 per cent in real terms last year together with an increase of 5 per cent in real terms in the income limits for eligibility for grants.  It was also provided last year that the maintenance element of the grants and the income limits for eligibility would be indexed to the rate of inflation for future years.  In addition, a tapering of income eligibility limits was introduced which provided for the payment of part of fees where otherwise the full fee would be payable.</P>
    <P>A further potential relief for those paying tax is the proposed change in tax legislation announced by the Minister for Finance in his recent budget speech, whereby parents can covenant part of their income to children over 18 years instead of over 21 as heretofore, and thereby qualify for tax relief.</P>

    <P>In 1986, it is estimated that revenue will amount to £5.213 million, including £2.493 million from the youth employment levy and an exchequer grant-in-aid. The remainder of revenue will be accounted for mainly by the European social fund.  Expenditure will be in line with revenue.</P>
