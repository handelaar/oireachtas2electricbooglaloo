There is a substantial number of amendments tabled to that measure and on the basis that discussion on them will not start before 3.45 p.m., I do not see how the House can do its job realistically and properly on Committee and Report Stages.

      <P>Section 2 proposes the insertion of the proviso: &ldquo;Provided that the citizenship of a person who is registered under section 27 shall commence only as on and from the date of such registration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the last occasion the Minister had available very little information on this matter but subsequently, through consultation with her officials, she was able to provide some information.  This section will not take long, but I should like to hear from the Minister now the reasons for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This looks like a fairly routine technical section but, as a result of questions, it has been discovered that its purpose is apparently to put a stopping point on qualifying descendants of people who are living abroad.  The Minister mentioned that the section has particular significance now, as the numbers applying for citizenship have increased from approximately 500 applications up to 1975 to approximately 1,600 in 1985.  I trust the Minister has the actual figures. This has been more or less a threefold increase.  She mentioned that these cases arose in particular in countries like South Africa and other countries where there were disturbances of one kind or other. There seemed to be a suggestion that some of the people involved were using Irish citizenship as a second option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister if this legislation <Col N="2115" /> was as a result of any pressure from the British Government, the EC or any other source and the Minister said it was not, that it is what she wants to do.  On the face of it, it does not look like a major step but, on looking into it a little further, there is something more to it.  Perhaps at this stage the Minister can give us a clear statement on the intention of section 2, the reasons for it and its likely effects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be reiterating what I said on the last occasion, but I have here a general statement on the points raised by the Deputy. The general position is that people born in Ireland are automatically Irish citizens. Anybody born outside Ireland who had a parent who was born in Ireland is also an Irish citizen automatically.  Persons born outside Ireland who have one grandparent who was born in Ireland are entitled to Irish citizenship if they register. The citizenship of persons who register entitles their children to register in turn. Thus the entitlement continues so long as each generation registers.</P>
      <P>The new provision in the Bill has to do only with the time at which that entitlement commences and specifically whether it operates from the date of registration or retrospectively to the date of birth of the person registered.  The original intention, as I mentioned on the last day of the debate, of the 1956 Act was that the citizenship of people registering would apply only as from the date of registration.  The effect would be that if the qualifying parent is interested enough to register a child on birth or at any time before he or she has children, that child can in turn pass on qualification when a child is born to him or her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if the parent does not act until, say, the child is grown up and has a child of his or her own, then the latter child cannot acquire qualification. However, in the mid-sixties it was decided that the wording of the Act did not support that interpretation and, accordingly, it has been accepted since that, once a person registers, his or her <Col N="2116" /> Irish citizenship is back-dated to the date of birth or the date of the passing of the Act, whichever is the later.  The effect of that interpretation is that persons of Irish descent can pass on the qualification retrospectively.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment now before the House is to restore the position to what was intended when the 1956 Act was being drafted, that is, that citizenship of persons registering would date from the date of registration.  The proposed amendment refers only to people born outside Ireland and, indeed, will affect only people who are at least three generations removed from Ireland.  It does not affect persons in Northern Ireland in any way, or the children of persons serving abroad in the public service.  The amendment will not affect people born outside Ireland who had a parent born in Ireland. Neither will it affect grandchildren of people born in Ireland.  The first generation affected will be the great-grandchildren of Irish-born citizens.  They will not be entitled to register unless the parent from whom they derive the right to Irish citizenship has registered prior to their birth.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that this enables people who have any real interest in their Irish ancestry to keep the qualification alive as long as they wish, but not to restore it if it has been abandoned, as it were, by their qualified parent.  Of course naturalisation, which is a totally separate thing, would still be available to such people.  We are only talking in this instance about full citizenship as a right. The reason for the change is that what is now being proposed is what was intended in 1956.  It is considered that there is an abuse by some people of the original intention of the provision.  This latter category are people who, it is felt, have no real sense of identity with Ireland but for purposes of convenience decide to establish Irish citizenship in case they would need a second citizenship at some future date.</P>
    <P>No detailed statistics are available in relation to people abusing the opportunity at present available under the Act but, as I said on the last occasion, the number <Col N="2117" /> of people registering has increased very significantly in recent years.  I mentioned specifically the position of South Africans. Normally statistics are not kept which show the breakdown as between the nationalities of people registering but such a breakdown was kept for a one year period, from May 1984 to May 1985. These figures show that of a total registration of 1,300 approximately, 368 were from South Africa.  Other figures were as follows: the United States, 299; New Zealand, 166; Zimbabwe, 132; England, 213.  These are all people registering.</P>
    <P>Given the overall population of South Africa it would be accepted generally that the number for that country is unusually large having regard to the figures for the other countries.  Countries generally are zealous in guarding their citizenship.  We, too, should put a high price on our citizenship. Our present laws are very liberal in regard to citizenship by descent.  This approach is influenced by our history. Vast emigration led to large numbers of people settling in other countries but wishing to maintain their links with Ireland. This is why we have provided for children of Irish born citizens to be entitled automatically to Irish citizenship and for their grandchildren to be entitled, on registration, to the same facility and so on, providing the link is maintained by way of registration from generation to generation.  As I have indicated, the amendment proposed will not necessarily break the chain but people will have to register before they have children if they wish their children in turn to be able to register.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods inquired as to where the call for the amendment came from.  I assure him that it did not come from any source outside Ireland.  This part of the legislation is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and from their observations of applications for registration it is their view that an abuse in relation to the provision for registration has manifested itself in recent years. Accordingly, the call for the amendment arises from our own observations of how the provisions of the Act work.  There has not been pressure from any other source.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> Deputy Woods inquired also as to the position under the Extradition Act.  The specific type of case he referred to was that of a person in America whom it is desired to have extradited.  I have made some inquiries in relation to that point. While it is difficult to comment on what was a hypothetical case, the general view is that the position of such a person would not be affected by the proposed amendment. His position would depend on American rather than on Irish law.  Perhaps I should point out again that the amendment will affect only great grandchildren of Irish born citizens and that even in their case the chain will be broken only where the parents of Irish descent fail to register before the birth of the children.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is not to bring about a comprehensive updating of the 1956 Act.  I said on Second Stage that the main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the elimination of the present differentiation between men and women in the condition to be satisfied in respect of naturalisation by the alien spouse of an Irish citizen or by the granting of post-nuptial citizenship.  As a Bill was being introduced it was considered that the opportunity should be availed of to bring in a number of other comparatively minor amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods brought to notice also some further aspects of the existing law which could, without doing violence to the limited nature of this measure, merit attention.  We shall be coming to those points later.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the purpose of section 2 is to resore the position to what was considered to be the provision enacted in 1956 and to prevent the continued abuse of the original intention of that section by some people who are obtaining citizenship as a right but who are considered not to have any real sense of identity with Ireland.  The amendment in the future could prevent some people of Irish descent from obtaining Irish citizenship whereas in present circumstances they can do so.  However, it is not envisaged that cases will arise where people with real Irish links will be affected by <Col N="2119" /> the change.  In any case, I would remind Deputy Woods that section 16 (a) of the 1956 Act will permit people of Irish descent or association to be naturalised. Any deserving case could be dealt with under that provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her fairly clear statement of the position. As she said, we had teased out a fair deal of all this on the last occasion.  The Minister tells us now that the reason for the Bill rests principally with the Department of Foreign Affairs, that they are suggesting the amendment.  It is clear now that what the Minister plans to do is to provide a stopping point.  As she has said, we should put a high price on citizenship by descent.  We have always put a high value on this in the past.  We have always regarded citizenship by descent as important to this country and particularly for those reasons I mentioned on the last occasion when I referred to those great numbers of Irish people who went abroad and who, down through the years, had to make their way in countries throughout the world.  There is a very genuine feeling of a link with all those people who went abroad to serve as citizens of the wider world, particularly following times such as the Famine years and also some periods of Coalition Government, for instance, around 1955 and now again.</P>
      <P>I am not particularly happy with what the Minister has said because I cannot see specific serious reasons for cutting off these people in their claims for citizenship by descent.  As we have heard, in one year&mdash;from May 1984 to May 1985&mdash;the number involved in this respect totalled 1,300.  The number has increased.  We are talking of the number registering in total. They were not merely people registering citizenship by descent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>But registering under the different categories and including, presumably, under section 27, people from Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>People born in Northern Ireland do not have to register.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, after the second generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore we are clear that Northern Ireland is not included in these figures and that the number registering has increased from fewer than 900 in 1975 and in previous years to 1,300 in the period mentioned by the Minister.  I thought the Minister mentioned on the last occasion that the number has increased to 1,600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must emphasise that it is the scale of the increase and the trend we are aware of.  That is the reason it was decided that this amendment should be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>One must wonder whether there is anything particularly bad about the situation.  If grandparents decided earlier, or even in the present circumstances, to register children to provide for the possibility of their wishing to come to Ireland at some future date, presumably such cases will be covered.  It seems that the children are to be punished by reason of their parents or grandparents neglecting to fill in an appropriate form whereas they would, by way of association, have an opportunity to come in by way of a request for naturalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that at 368 South Africa represents the biggest group involved.  Has the Minister any idea as to what kind of people these might be or what kind of abuse is involved? Are we talking of business people coming here who have experience of business abroad or whose parents had experience in business but went abroad? Are we talking of such people wishing to set up business here or about people who are fleeing from situations that are not very healthy for them at this stage or about people who form part of normal comings and goings? Movement to and <Col N="2121" /> fro has increased but when one considers that the number we are talking of in respect of England is 213 while for South Africa it is 368, I presume it is the South African situation that has set the whole trend in motion.  Surely, at this stage we are trying to encourage relations with the United States of America and we are trying to encourage the Irish who are there and have Irish associations in the United States to think well of our people going out there at this stage.  At present, we have a massive outflow to the United States where we are looking for the opportunity to establish more of our citizens where there are opportunities for them.  How does the United States feel about us taking this kind of action in relation to our citizens who have entered that country and whose children or grandchildren might be looking for Irish citizenship? The figures for England at 213, New Zealand at 166 and the United States at 299 probably seem small enough.  The figure for South Africa at 368 seems to have triggered the Department of Foreign Affairs into suggesting this action and the Government into taking the action.  Is this part of the Government's policy in closing the door on people who went out to South Africa? More than 25 per cent of the 1,300 applications are from South Africa.  It looks as if this has come about from the Department of Foreign Affairs suggesting that they do not particularly like the trend in relation to South Africa.  Are these people coloured, white or both?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have a breakdown of the applications as to what age, how many children, and to what purpose. I can assure the Deputy that this is necessarily based on the trend.  I am glad the Deputy sees the point that the proportion from South Africa is very high.  The issue would not be one of race, it would be a question of Irish by descent.  I cannot give the Deputy details of the racial breakdown in terms of colour but I would emphasise again that we are not introducing a stopping point.  The option is there for each generation to register and to enable all succeeding generations and to <Col N="2122" /> enable the children of the registering parents to become entitled as a right to Irish citizenship.  Even in the event of there being no registration by parents at any point, that does not necessarily close the door.  As I mentioned, under section 16 (a) of the 1956 Act sympathetic consideration would be given to persons of Irish descent or association for naturalisation. Therefore, it is not a cut off as the Deputy seems to imply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State described fairly well for us the way that it does cut off.  I think it is quite clearly a cut-off point and this is the intention of the amendment.  If someone does not take an action, then the stop is built in at that stage.  I take it, therefore, that the reason for this section is that the Government are alarmed at the increase in registrations and applications under this heading and particularly alarmed at the increase in recent years from South Africa, and feel they have to put this adjustment into the Act to prevent the numbers from escalating.  I have to accept what the Government say in this respect as they have the information, some of which we have been given.  Presumably, there is more available to the Government and if I was more skilful in eliciting information from the Minister of State we would probably have much more information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly concerned at the way in which&mdash;it may be that the Minister of State did not think about it at the time &mdash;the Minister of State did not make any statement about this section and subsequently made only partial statements.  I am concerned that there may be somebody trying to highlight rather than conceal. It is preferable and necessary that people be told exactly why these minor changes are taking place and what their impact could be in future.  It is fair enough that the Government are alarmed and concerned about this as they have to manage the situation from day to day. Perhaps, there is a problem which requires this kind of measure but I cannot help feeling that in some respects it is a <Col N="2123" /> retrograde step as far as our emigrants are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is going to affect emigrants in the future who have gone to places like England and the United States of America. It is going to affect their position under this Act as it has been up to the time this amendment is approved and this Bill becomes an Act.  It is going to adversely affect their position and I would hope that it is not an over-reaction on the part of the Government to the rise in the figures from South Africa of those people who want to come back to Ireland or to use Irish citizenship as a means of getting back into the EC.  Does the Minister of State have any idea as to how many of these 1,300 people have come to live in Ireland as distinct from coming to live in Britain or in the EC generally?</P>

      <P>I would like to say that it is not a case of the Government being alarmed.  It is a question of the necessity which has been shown to get back to the original intent of the 1956 Act and to stick by the provisions in that Act.  On the Deputy's second question, there are no residential qualifications.  Many of these applicants might never come to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably very prudent that each generation would be aware and register to enable their children, if they wanted to have the option, to become Irish citizens.  There are no residential qualifications and there is no way one could have statistics to that degree.  I would finally say I am quite sure that Deputy Woods is well aware that Ireland has, if not the most liberal, one of the most liberal approaches to extending citizenship of any country in the world.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear the Minister of State say that we are liberal in some respects.  I think we are liberal in quite a number of respects.  Perhaps, in this case we have been fairly liberal especially with our emigrants who have <Col N="2124" /> gone abroad in the past.  It is only right that we should be liberal in our approach to them.  We have much more important things to do than trying to seek out these people and cut them off.  It would be far better if we were to prommote relations with people who have gone abroad and encourage them to come and bring back their expertise and resources which they have developed and to put them into this country.  We should encourage people in this country to relate to them wherever they may be.</P>
      <P>I had not intended to spend so long on the section.  The Minister did not make a statement initially.  I was somewhat suspicious as it seemed like a fairly simple formality.  It has been fairly well elaborated on and we are now fully aware of what is involved.  I accept the Minister's concern, if not alarm, about this.  It looks as if somebody, if not in the Cabinet at least in the Department of Foreign Affairs, was alarmed at the rate of increase in these applications from South Africa in particular.  We have figures which show that the applications from South Africa were at least 70 per cent more than those from England.  The figures for South Africa are 368; the United States, 299 and England, 213. The Government are concerned with the figures from South Africa and the future dangers which might result.  I am not entirely convinced that somebody, whether in Britain or in the EC generally, has not been influencing the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Minister said that those figures came principally from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2 to delete lines 19 to 27 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1) A person who is an alien at the date of that person's marriage to a person who is an Irish citizen (otherwise than by naturalisation) shall not become an Irish citizen merely by <Col N="2125" /> virtue of the marriage, but may do so by lodging a declaration in the prescribed manner with the Minister, or with any Irish diplomatic mission or consular office, at any time after the marriage accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the principal changes in the Bill is in section 3 which provides:</P>
    <P>The following section is hereby substituted for section 8 of the Act of 1956:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1) A person who is an alien at the date of that person's marriage to a person who is an Irish citizen (otherwise than by naturalisation) shall not become an Irish citizen merely by virtue of the marriage, but may do so by lodging, not earlier than three years from the date of the marriage, a declaration in the prescribed manner with the Minister, or with any Irish diplomatic mission or consular office, accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship: provided that the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgment of the declaration.</P>
    <P>At present if an Irishman marries an American woman she automatically gets citizenship on application.  This section deals with inequality of women in this area.  The Government want to bring in equal treatment for men and women in this respect and we support them in this. It would seem that the simple way to do this would be to give the woman who marries an American man the same right of automatic citizenship on application. Why not bring in equal treatment and give the Irish woman the same rights as are enjoyed by an Irish man? The Minister's proposal is to give equal treatment but to introduce a three year waiting period for both men and women.  The simple approach would seem to be that, if an Irishman marries an American or a South African girl, she can become an Irish citizen automatically on a post-nuptial basis.  That is the position at the moment.  The Minister wishes to give the same rights to woman who marries a man from any of these areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2126" /> In this amendment I am suggesting that both the man and woman should be given the same rights of automatic post-nuptial citizenship and at the same time the Minister should have power to deal with exceptional cases such as marriages of convenience.  That is why I have proposed the amendment to section 4 to give the Minister power in certain cases to revoke such a citizenship if there is an abuse of the law.  This would ensure that exceptional cases only would be dealt with. What the Minister is doing here is punishing everybody by making them wait for three years.  What I have proposed in this amendment is that a person who is an alien at the date of that person's marriage to a person who is an Irish citizen, otherwise than by naturalisation, shall not become an Irish citizen merely by virtue of the marriage, but may do so by lodging a declaration in the prescribed manner with the Minister, or with any Irish diplomatic mission or consular office. This does not refer only to a man but to either a man or a woman.</P>
    <P>In extending this facility to women the Minister is introducing a three year delay which makes one wonder does she not trust women.  The Government are discriminating against women in a subtle way in this Bill.  They tell them they will get equality while, at the same time, devaluing that equality.  I know the Minister did not set out to do that but when we look at the proposal it is hard to see it otherwise.  The alternative would be to give straightforward equal treatment and to make separate provision for marriages of convenience, be they men or women who are involved in those marriages.  I am not arguing with the Minister but trying to improve the position by giving the Minister power to revoke such a citizenship and making it an offence to abuse the marriage for citizenship purposes. That is the basic intent of our approach here, to give full and equal treatment to men and women and give the Minister the power of revoking in the case of marriages of convenience.  I shall deal with that aspect when we come to section 4. Amendment No. 2 in my name deals with the matter of penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred inaccurately to declarations in applications.  Perhaps it would be useful to consider the present situation.  For the foreign spouses of Irish citizens, citizenship is extended to them by declaration. This is a right.  However, the alien husband of an Irish woman has to make an application which is termed discretionary. It is then citizenship by naturalisation and does not fulfil the same citizenship rights as a wife would get by declaration. I think perhaps the Deputy may have mixed up those two cases.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in the Deputy's name show an integrated approach.  I was involved considerably with the structuring and formulation of this legislation.  The objective is to give equal treatment of post-nuptial citizenship to men and women.  This could be done in a number of ways.  The question arose whether it might be done by way of residence qualification, by an application that would be discretionary for both spouses, or by declaration as of right by both spouses.  After much consideration and analysis the decision made has struck a good balance.</P>
      <P>We accept that the acquisition of citizenship should not be made easy and that there should be equal treatment as between men and women.  Marriage in itself should not be accepted as a sufficient criterion.  There should be some evidence that the marriage was not only &ldquo;real&rdquo; but was stable and subsisting.  In this Bill we are providing for citizenship as of right without any residential requirement. Under existing law this is a requirement for the foreign man who marries an Irish citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We decided on the criterion of three years of a subsisting marriage.  Given that the criteria are different for foreign husbands as compared with foreign wives under the 1956 Act, a balance should be struck as between improving the conditions for some foreign spouses and disimproving them for others.  Under the new section 8, foreign husbands are to be given full citizenship as a right and this is a considerable concession to them and to their Irish wives.  It is reasonable to insist <Col N="2128" /> on a waiting period before that right is exercised.</P>
    <P>If there were no waiting period there would be a greater danger of marriages of convenience for the sake of acquiring citizenship.  This is not just a theoretical point.  The phenomenon of such marriages is well known as a practical problem in all countries.  Following recent changes in some EC countries the general picture across the Community is that there is a waiting period before foreign spouses can obtain citizenship.  A waiting period of three years is considered reasonable.  At present a waiting period does not apply to a foreign wife but a foreign husband has to have two years' residence which can impose a certain hardship on couples living abroad.  It seems reasonable that the concession of the right in the case of the man should be accompanied by a longer period.  It can be argued that the introduction of a waiting period of three years can be justified on the basis that differentiation will now be eliminated.  The introduction of a waiting period for foreign wives and the possible longer period for foreign husbands is a matter of gains on the swings and losses on the roundabout.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind in the case of foreign husbands that the requirement regarding three years' marriage will be easier to satisfy in many cases than two years' residence.  After the passing of this Bill it will afford Irish citizenship as of right to a number of foreign husbands abroad who are married to Irish citizens. All the EC countries, with the exception of Portugal, have waiting periods.  They vary from six months marriage in France and six months residence in Italy to ten years in Belgium where no concession is given to a foreign man or woman.  In between these two extremes there is a wide variety of waiting periods.  One year's residence is required in Spain.  In Luxembourg there is a proposal that a foreign spouse be able to acquire citizenship within three years of marriage to a national.  Three years' residence is required in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>In Germany the requirement is five <Col N="2129" /> years' residence or three years' residence after marriage.  In Denmark it is four years' residence, including three years' marriage.  Greece allows no concession whatever to a foreign spouse and, in common with other applicants, a foreign spouse would have to wait from three to eight years.  The law in a number of these countries has recently been reviewed. Previously, as in our case, the position had been that a foreign wife could obtain citizenship by declaration on marriage to a national.  This was the position in Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Greece and Belgium.  Prior to 1984 there was no waiting period for either foreign spouse in France.  However, from that date a six months waiting period applies.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from the foregoing that there has been a movement not only to eliminate differentiation in the conditions of acquisition of citizenship as between foreign husbands and foreign wives but that, in quite a number of cases, the changes have resulted in the introduction of a waiting period for foreign wives where none existed previously.  No doubt amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are being proposed as a counter-balance to the removal of the three year subsisting marriage requirement.  I suggest it is an integrated approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised a number of important points.  We have been given some more reasons for the Government's decision.  From the point of view of an ordinary citizen, I am looking at the situation as it applies in Ireland. We know that when a man marries a woman from America, Tanzania or elsewhere that woman can automatically become an Irish citizen.  On the previous occasion I asked if there were many problems in this area but the Minister then did not seem to think there were.  However, now she is suggesting there are more problems with regard to marriages of convenience in Ireland.  Foreign women have had the right to citizenship on marriage to an Irish national.  This does not apply in the case of a marriage of a foreign man to an Irish woman.  Why not just treat the two equally and make arrangements <Col N="2130" /> for the exceptional cases which may arise?</P>
      <P>The Minister says she is not looking simply at the extent of problems here but is considering the problems in other countries and the developments taking place there.  She pointed out that many people regard marriage of itself as not enough.  Our Constitution regards marriage as of supreme importance and a major influence in relation to one's position as a citizen.  There are imprescriptible and inalienable rights which are superior to all positive law.  If we allow people to marry in the first instance, then under the Constitution they have all these rights.  It seems inconsistent that in giving equal treatment to women who marry foreign men we are changing the existing position in relation to Irish men who marry foreign wives.</P>
      <P>The Constitution tells us what marriage is.  The two parties in Government are campaigning actively to change that position, yet in their proposed changes they would still retain in the Constitution strong protection and recognition of marriage, even though side by side they will have a divorce procedure which will give the power to take away those rights and give them to a second, third, fourth or any other marriage.  Certainly that will have some effect on these rights, but even in the way the Government are approaching this matter they are still recognising the importance of marriage constitutionally. We are talking about whether Irish women married to foreign men should have the right which applies automatically to men under the existing law. If we are giving equal treatment, should women not have that right automatically?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good enough to make these changes just to keep in line with any of the other countries mentioned by the Minister such as Denmark, Germany or England.  We have our own Constitution and from it we should derive our own principles and purpose.  I am not convinced by the Minister's argument that there should be a three-year waiting period. The Minister also made a point about extending the period for husbands, in other words, having two different <Col N="2131" /> periods.  I did not fully appreciate what the Minister was saying when she talked about two years' residence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>At present an Irish man confers citizenship on his wife automatically. I do not see why the Minister should not agree to give women exactly the same treatment.  When we are about to give equal treatment to women in this respect, why decide that this is the time to consider all these other factors and the trends in other countries? Why do we have to consider these matters now? It will devalue the equal treatment which the women are to get and introduce a waiting period of three years.  I suppose the only real reason would be experience of marriages of convenience.  The Minister says there is a greater danger of such marriages but I would ask whether that is the case.  When we discussed this Bill previously the Minister did not seem to be aware of these dangers or to recognise that there could be a problem in this respect, but today she is talking about the greater danger of marriages of convenience. This presumably means that the Minister has some hard information on this question, as distinct from looking at experience in Europe and seeing what everybody else is doing.  When we are giving equal treatment to women, why give it on the less advantageous terms which apply in Europe and introduce a three-year waiting period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy suggested that these proposals would devalue the equal treatment being given to women. One could equally say they will upgrade the conditions of the foreign man who prior to this had to fulfil the requirement of two years' residence in this country before making an application for citizenship. The granting of citizenship was discretionary and could be refused.  We <Col N="2132" /> are now extending citizenship as a right to the foreign husbands of Irish women, without those husbands having to come and live in this country.  If a couple have been married five or six years and living abroad they will be entitled to claim Irish citizenship on behalf of the foreign spouse.</P>
      <P>There is little hard evidence about the risks of marriages of convenience but it is well known that this does not necessarily apply only to men attempting to get citizenship by marrying women of a particular state.  After the Vietnam war and further back there undoubtedly were marriages of convenience between women who wanted to escape from that country and US citizens, the women thereby acquiring US citizenship.  We are looking at this question in a totally different time.  In 1956 there was not the same degree of international travel and women did not have the same mobility in regard to work.  There was not the same incentive for people in some other countries to seek citizenship of a member state of the European Community.  All these factors must be considered and one factor is not stronger than an other.  We have to legislate in the light of this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that is what the Minister meant when she referred to the greater danger of marriages of convenience. The Minister meant that we are living in different times.  I thought there was something more specific than that in the Minister's statement.  The Minister also says that there is no hard evidence of marriages of convenience.  That ties in with the way we have approached this proposal.  Our amendment proposes that equal treatment be given to women.  If a woman takes a husband from abroad he should automatically get citizenship and if a man takes a wife she gets automatic citizenship.  The Minister is not prepared to do this.  The Act says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A woman who is an alien at the date of her marriage to a person who is an Irish citizen (otherwise than by naturalisation) shall not become an Irish citizen merely by virtue of her <Col N="2133" /> marriage, but may do so by lodging a declaration in the prescribed manner with the Minister.</P>
    <P>We just want to remove the discrimination against women by substituting the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;woman&rdquo;. By doing this men and women would have the same rights.  But the Minister is not prepared to do this.  What we are saying is that the Minister should do this but put in a separate clause giving the Minister the power to revoke the citizenship of a post-nuptial citizen if it is found later that the marriage was not a bona fide one.  Our amendment No. 3, to cover that, is as follows:</P>
    <P>(7)  The Minister may revoke the citizenship of a post-nuptial citizen if he has reasonable grounds for deciding and does so decide that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the marriage pursuant to which the citizenship was acquired as not a bona fide marriage and was entered into solely or primarily for the purpose of acquiring post-nuptial citizenship or,</P>
    <P>(b)  the post-nuptial citizenship was procured by fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>The rest of the amendment is consequential to that.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing is a simple logical approach.  We want to extend the right that men have to women and give the women an equal, not a devalued, right. Having done that, we would then put in a support clause which gives the Minister the power to revoke a citizenship in the very few cases where this might be necessary. The Minister has not brought any case to our attention where this is the case.  We recognise that some cases will arise.  But presumably these were arising when men had the right so they will probably arise on an equal basis when women have a similar right.  But if they are only going to arise on an equal basis why should we be concerned? I am slightly suspicious that somebody does not trust women and the Minister has confirmed <Col N="2134" /> this by saying there is a greater danger of marriages of convenience.  Possibly because both can do it there will be twice the danger there was when men alone could do it.  But it appears that somebody thinks that women will allow themselves to be abused in this respect more than men and I do not think we should approach our legislation in this way.  We should give the straightforward equal treatment to men and women that exists for men at the moment and not a devalued equal treatment.</P>
    <P>In addition, we are talking about marriage as defined in the Constitution.  It makes one wonder whether the Minister could, in view of the Constitutional protection that is given to a marriage once it is contracted, send a spouse away.  That is a separate matter but it is relevant.  If we place marriage so high and recognise the family as having such a fundamental role in our community surely we should recognise an application for citizenship at the time of marriage in the way we have suggested here.  Surely that is the positive thing to do.  The negative cover can be given then by giving the Minister power to revoke any citizenship of a post-nuptial citizen if he has reasonable grounds for deciding that the marriage was not a bona fide one and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring citizenship or through fraud or misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>This is the logical way to approach the situation.  The Minister does not seem to see it that way and she has not given us any hard evidence or reasons other than saying that she would like to see some equality across Europe.  Yet, from the various arrangements that are made in Europe it seems quite obvious that the different countries are doing different things anyway.  There may not be many of them doing just what we are doing but they are doing different things and having different periods and different mechanisms. This obviously has not been discussed or debated at that level and there is no directive and no agreement to equalise treatment in this respect throughout these countries.  Therefore why should we not stick to our own procedure and <Col N="2135" /> make our arrangements by giving women full equal treatment with men?</P>
    <P>In relation to marriage of convenience, the Minister says there are not many of these.  Does the Minister have any evidence of such marriages at present in relation to men or women?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer is that we do not have any evidence of marriages of convenience that could be identified in the past.  I would prefer not to deal with the Deputy's other amendments dealing with penalties and revocation at this time. The Deputy's amendment proposes that we extend post-nuptial citizenship by declaration to spouses.  If citizenship by post-nuptial declaration became subject to revocation &mdash; which is suggested in a later amendment &mdash; then the status of those citizens would be lower because at present citizenship as of right is not subject to revocation but citizenship by naturalisation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give a number of cases from the law reports which deal with husbands who have been refused entry.  In the case of Abdul Kefti versus the Minister for Justice, 1983-84, the husband was refused entry to the State; in the case of Pok Sun Shum versus Ireland, 1085: the husband lived in Ireland, was married to an Irish citizen and was ordered to be deported; in the case of Ahmed Bouzagou versus the station sergeant in Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station, High Court, No. 261, 26 July 1985, he was refused leave to stay in this State because he did not hold an Irish visa.  He was married to an Irish citizen and had two children but there was evidence of domestic problems during his previous residence with the family in the State and his wife had a barring order.  He had been abroad for two years but was refused leave to land here, not being a citizen of the State as specified in the Sixth Schedule &mdash; he was not a holder of a valid Irish visa and was not in a position to support himself.  It is strange that in all these cases the State and the Minister for Justice moved and refused husbands entry to the <Col N="2136" /> State.  I do not know what the wife does in those circumstances, although it is clear from one case that she did not want him back.  Situations like this could arise even after three years and the Minister will have to deal with such situations.  The Minister suggests that by allowing the Minister to revoke post-nuptial citizenship, if there are grounds showing that the position was abused&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no precedent for that.  It is not possible at the moment to revoke citizenship as of right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but at present the wife of a non-national is not entitled to have her husband living in Ireland.  We are proposing that this right be extended to men and women.</P>
      <P>The Minister is asking if revocation should be introduced at all, but the point I am making is that marriage is very important and should take precedence. The Minister does not seem to have been able to find any examples of marriages of convenience, so presumably if there are such cases they are the exceptions.  To deal with these exceptions we could couch the revocation in more restrictive terms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seems to deal with whether there should be a waiting period in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister suggested that the two amendments are connected. We are recognising that a problem could arise in the future although such a problem does not appear to have arisen to date.  At present Irish men have the right to bring their wives into this country as citizens and we are proposing to extend that right to Irish women.  The Minister says we should introduce a three year waiting period for men and women, but our amendment suggests that we give the women straightforward equality with men.  If the Minister is concerned about the possibility of marriages of convenience, we could give <Col N="2137" /> the Minister the right to revoke citizenship if there is clear evidence of fraudulent misrepresentation.</P>
      <P>These amendments are interconnected in that we propose giving the Minister an additional power to grant this right to a person rather than to a woman.  The Minister claims there is no precedent for this kind of revocation and I gave three examples from recent law reports &mdash; and my research facilities are very limited. Why not have a clear-cut arrangement to deal with these cases? I agree that marriages of convenience may take place, but unfortunately there have not been many cases to date.  The Minister seems to think there is a greater danger of marriages of convenience taking place under the proposed changes.  While I agree there could be some danger of this happening, why not provide a power to revoke in special circumstances?</P>
      <P>If the Minister is not happy with the wording of our amendment, she is free to adapt it so that it will cover any circumstances which could be envisaged at this stage.  We have no objection to that. The Minister has all the expertise at her disposal.  I think she wants to get all Stages at the conclusion of this debate. That is a bad precedent and I do not think she should be doing it.  It is very bad practice in the House.  The Minister is here presumably listening to the debate and considering the matters that arise in it and even considering things that will come to her own mind in the course of the debate.  We have a separate Report Stage, even though a very quick one, to allow the Minister to consider these matters between Committee and Report Stages.  The Minister may at that stage decide that she wants to come back with an amendment to cover any situation which might arise on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be honest if I did not say here that as a public representative and as a parliamentarian I regard it as bad practice.  It is an unwise practice to say the least.  I appreciate that the Government are anxious to get certain legislation through and the Whips will argue about wanting all Stages and if not getting that <Col N="2138" /> not giving something else.  This is just an example of how bad it is.  No matter how much we debate this or how much the Minister may think about it &mdash; and I presume she is thinking very honestly and sincerely about it &mdash; she does not have the opportunity to introduce an amendment on Report Stage because Report Stage will be taken just like that at the conclusion of this Committee Stage.  The Minister will have an opportunity when the Bill goes to the Seanad to think again about it, but it is one of the limitations under which this debate takes place now. Obviously the Minister is thinking because she is coming out with different suggestions and ideas in relation to what precedent there is for one thing or another and in relation to the incidence of these problems.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the three cases which I have mentioned here recently all concern the husband.  Presumably we do not hear about cases where there might be a problem about the wife because she has automatic citizenship and we must put up with those problems thereafter and no action can be taken in the present circumstances.  I am sure that the Minister's advisers in the Department are aware of these cases.  I find it hard to see how they were not aware of cases in the High Court, in which the Minister for Justice was directly involved.  In that event I would have thought that the Minister's advisers would have been alerting the Minister to the kinds of cases which occur.  That is the kind of thing we in the House want to hear about because it is very relevant to the sort of legislation which one would agree to.</P>
    <P>These generally are the points I want to make about the amendment.  I will not have much to say about amendment No. 3 to section 4.  We could have asked the Chair earlier that they be discussed together and then vote on them separately.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given me any real reason for not extending equality in this regard to women.  That will devalue the position of women.  Regarding the case of Mohammed Ali Somjee and Margaret Somjee in the High Court, the Minister <Col N="2139" /> said that the Pakistani gentleman who was looking for citizenship as a right because he had married an Irish citizen, had to wait two years.  The Minister was prepared to give him citizenship after a two-year residential period and, as we know, that was not very helpful to him in representing Ireland in international squash.  He could not represent Ireland because he was not an Irish citizen and it would take him two years to obtain Irish citizenship.  Now the Minister, in a way is overcoming that problem in providing legislation which deals with it, is introducing a three-year waiting period.  I cannot see him or his wife Margaret being particularly happy with what the Minister is doing in that respect.</P>
    <P>From any of the cases we have it would seem that the logical thing to do would be to have a straightforward change in the Act as we have suggested in our amendment No. 1 here, to substitute &ldquo;a person&rdquo; for &ldquo;a woman&rdquo; and leave it at that as far as citizenship is concerned, to give a straight equal right to the woman. The Minister might feel that there is a need then to provide separately in relation to marriages of convenience under a <Col N="2140" /> separate section on the lines of what we have proposed here in our third amendment which gives the Minister power to revoke those post-nuptial citizenships where there might be fraud, misrepresentation or whatever.  That seems a logical approach.  I do not think the Minister has really said anything that makes it necessary to introduce the three-year waiting period.  From our experience here I do not see how that becomes necessary.</P>
    <P>Let me bring to the Minister's attention the primary which we give to marriage and the respect and authority given to marriage in our Constitution.  Here the Minister is not showing that respect for marriage which it deserves and which the Constitution lays down is due to it.  I do not know if the Minister can tell us anything more about it at this stage.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 35, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  (a)  Any person who enters into a contract of marriage solely or primarily for the purpose of enabling one of the parties to the marriage to acquire post-nupital citizenship pursuant to this Act, or who knowingly gives or makes any false or misleading statement or information for the purpose of enabling such citizenship to be acquired shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Any person convicted of an offence referred to in this section shall be <Col N="2143" /> liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £5,000, or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding 12 months, or to both such fine and imprisonment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this matter in connection with my earlier amendment, that a woman should be given equal treatment with men and that certain safeguards should be built into the legislation.  The Government have insisted on a three year waiting period.  In my amendment I am proposing that we introduce a penalty in relation to persons entering into a contract purely to get post-nuptial citizenship. The Minister has tabled an amendment in relation to penalties.  That amendment states:</P>
    <P>4a.  In page 4, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>6.&mdash;Section 17 of the Act of 1956 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (2):</P>
    <P>(2) If any person, for the purposes of or in relation to an application for a certificate of naturalisation, gives or makes to the Minister any statement or information which is to his knowledge false or misleading in any material respect, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or both such fine and imprisonment.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is a need to provide a penalty for giving false or misleading statements or information to enable citizenship to be acquired.  The second portion of my amendment states:</P>
    <P>(b) Any person convicted of an offence referred to in this section shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £5,000, or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for <Col N="2144" /> any term not exceeding 12 months, or to both such fine and imprisonment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My suggestion seems to deal with the Minister's fears in relation to abuses in this area as expressed when we were discussing my first amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to add on new subsections to section 8 as substituted by section 3. Apart from the view that the three years' subsisting marriage requirement is the best way to protect our citizenship, the amendment is open to the following objections: (1) the test of whether the marriage was &ldquo;solely or primarily&rdquo; for the purpose mentioned is far too uncertain for a criminal offence.  The spouses might allege other purposes which the prosecution would have difficulty in disputing. One of the spouses may be marrying in order to become a citizen and the other for a different reason.  If the latter knows the former's reasons he or she will be guilty under the amendment, as an accessory unless the amendment is further amended.  This opens up the provision to more uncertainties as to the citizen spouse's motives.</P>
      <P>As the amendment stands, it is doubtful whether it would apply to a marriage abroad because the general rule is that the criminal law applies to things done in this State only.  A special provision could be included to cover marriages abroad but it would be a drastic and perhaps objectionable measure to penalise things done by aliens abroad.  Anyhow a provision would be necessary as to where in the State proceedings could be instituted in the case of a marriage abroad.  Therefore we oppose the amendment.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a difficulty with this section.  It is very important in this area that the law is clear, that people are aware of what are their rights and that the application of the provisions of the section is not left open to the vagaries of departmental interpretations which could change as time wears on.</P>
      <P>I do not have difficulties with the three year period to which Deputy Woods referred.  But within the context of the section, it has to be established not merely that a marriage has run for three years but it must also be established and here I quote that:</P>
      <P>...the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgment of the declaration.</P>
      <P>I am not sure I know what that phrase means.  I am wondering does anybody else know.  In ordinary legal parlance the idea of marriage subsisting would simply mean that the couple are still legally married to each other.  They could be living apart.  They might have separated two days after the marriage took place and they might have been living apart for two years, 11 months and 28 days after the marriage.  But legally, formally speaking, the marriage would still be subsisting, it would be an existing marriage.  I assume that the departmental intention is to establish not merely that three years earlier a couple went through the formal marital ceremony but that the marriage is still operating in some way.  I cannot work out the phraseology of what should be used here; I have not applied my mind to working out the phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that what is being talked about is a marriage that is a continuing relationship with the couple still residing together.  I presume that is what the Department are talking about.  If they are simply talking about a marriage subsisting three years later, if the couple are still lawfully married to each other whether or not they are living together, it is a valid <Col N="2146" /> marriage, it is a subsisting marriage and will come within the context of the provisions of this section.  If the Department are talking about the couple still having a viable relationship then I have another concern about this section.  Within the context of the Bill and the amendments being proposed I understand the Minister will have discretion &mdash; where there is a belief that someone might have married for the purpose of gaining Irish citizenship &mdash; to refuse Irish citizenship.</P>
    <P>Let us paint two possible scenarios: first, that an Irish woman marries an alien.  I always think this is an unfortunate phrase and conjures up things that one sees in the movies when one starts talking about aliens to describe human beings.  I always have difficulties with that phrase. However, let us presume that an Irishwoman marries an alien man.  Presumably that is someone to be found on earth and not someone landing here from outer space.  The concept of an alien man conjures up images that do not necessarily coincide with the idea of something with two arms, two legs and a head that looks like the rest of us in this House.  We are stuck with this phraseology of &ldquo;alien&rdquo;.  It has been used in legislation for many years.</P>
    <P>Let us say an Irishwoman marries an alien man.  They marry each other and the man comes to Ireland.  They have been living together for about two years when the woman makes off and establishes a liaison with a third party with whom she then permanently resides.  Let us assume that the man has come to Ireland in good faith, has made his home in Ireland and possibly has children he may be taking care of.  If that man, having been here for three years, goes seeking Irish citizenship what will be his position? If it is to be the first interpretation, simply that he is lawfully married to his wife, he is entitled to citizenship.  But, if it is to be the second interpretation, that his marriage must be viable and through no fault of his it may have ceased to be viable, is he to be deprived of citizenship and possibly placed at risk of being put out of this country? His rights to reside in Ireland may become or be dependent <Col N="2147" /> on his having citizenship, which is another problem.</P>
    <P>Let us take the reverse scenario, of the Irishman who marries an alien woman who comes to live in Ireland and, after two years of residing together, the man makes off and enters into a liaison with someone else with whom he permanently resides.  The woman who may not necessarily have custody of young children then goes to the Department of Justice officials saying: &ldquo;I want Irish citizenship&rdquo;.  Do they say: &ldquo;You are still validly married; therefore you are entitled to it&rdquo;? Or do they say: &ldquo;Because your husband has left you your marriage is no longer subsisting; we are not going to grant you citizenship&rdquo;? Is she then penalised and put in a position in which her rights to remain in this country are undermined through no fault of hers, having made a commitment to a marriage and to reside in Ireland?</P>
    <P>I have great difficulties with that phrase.  Whereas I know it is well intended, I am not sure that its consequences have been fully worked out.  The differing types of interpretations that could derive from this phrase result in too broad a discretion being placed on departmental officials who are not subject to any checks either by the courts or the Oireachtas in dealing with this issue.  I regard it as a totally unsatisfactory phrase which will leave men's and women's rights to Irish citizenship extremely uncertain and subject &mdash; and I do not mean this disrespectfully &mdash; to the arbitrary whim of the interpretation applied to the section by the individual officials who are asked to administer it. That is thoroughly unsatisfactory.  It does not give rise to good law, to common sense and certainly would not give rise to clarity in the context of citizenship rights or laws.</P>
    <P>We then have another problem.  Let us assume that we are talking about a couple having to establish a viable marriage relationship.  One no longer goes to the Department, displaying one's marriage certificate, providing proof that one has resided in Ireland for three years.  Does <Col N="2148" /> one have to disclose personal matters relating to one's personal marriage relationship with one's spouse so that a departmental official can pronounce on the viability of one's marriage? I know what is intended, the intention is laudable but it would seem to me that we could get rid of this concept altogether, that we should talk about someone applying for citizenship three years after a marriage ceremony has taken place with the Minister or the Department having this residual power to recall citizenship at a later stage if it can be fully established that it has resulted from someone marrying for convenience to come to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about that concept as well because, where a marriage does break down, where it breaks down through no fault of the alien partner to it, how will the Department make that type of determination? I know we deal with this in a later section but the two are inter-linked.  Who will pronounce on what were the motives of someone when coming to this country to marry? I have grave doubts about the workability of the phraseology of the section in this context. Rather than clarifying our citizenship laws, I believe it will throw them into a degree of confusion and uncertainty, leaving people exposed, in a sense, to arbitrary decisions taken within a Department in secret, decisions in respect of which there are no proper or formal grounds of appeal.</P>
    <P>Something else needs to be clarified in the overall context of this section.  There have been many cases in the courts in recent years in which Irishwomen married alien men &mdash; someone should have thought of another word, such as non-national instead of talking about aliens as if they had descended on us from outer space &mdash; who have come to Ireland either for travel purposes or for some other reason and, for reasons that may have been valid, the Department refused to allow the spouses of Irish citizens to remain in Ireland beyond the holiday stay periods.  The officials in the aliens' section of the Department have wide discretionary powers under our Aliens Act to make decisions in these matters.  We should <Col N="2149" /> have a formal appeals system so that people would not be forced to resort to the High Court to have decisions of this nature reviewed.</P>
    <P>A person who marries an Irishman or woman, effectively in the ordinary course of things will have to be married for three years before acquiring Irish citizenship, and the Minister has wide discretionary powers in this matter.  We need to clarify the right of the alien spouse to come to Ireland to reside with the Irish citizen to whom that person is married and the right of the alien to come to Ireland for certain holiday periods.  Such people should be treated in the same way as other aliens who are not married to Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>When this section comes to be put into operation it will give rise to enormous difficulties, so we need a great deal of clarification of how the Department and the Minister envisage it being operated. We need to flesh out what is meant by &ldquo;marriages subsisting at the date of lodgment of the declaration&rdquo;.  We need to decide whether the thought behind decisions coincides with the language in the Bill.  Otherwise we will create considerable confusion in regard to citizenship rights, and that will affect, particularly, couples who in good faith enter into marriage and who in their early years of marriage find they are tragically parties to marriages that in a brief period have collapsed irretrievably.</P>
    <P>Though the Bill is an effort to resolve such problems, and to put men and women in positions of equality, it creates other problems and ambiguities and could be the catalyst to an increasing number of court cases which would not have been necessary and could be avoided if the legislation were clear and if the discretionary element could be made clearer.</P>
    <P>There are appeals systems in other jurisdictions.  Perhaps it is not being done here because the officials who administer the system exercise powers which they do not always want to be reviewed.  In the way of the world, no doubt they mean well and they exercise their powers with the best intentions but they do not like the idea of an independent tribunal to <Col N="2150" /> review cases.  This is symptomatic of administrative decisions that have far-reaching effects on the lives of many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I made this point on Second Stage: once you accept the three year waiting period you bring in a whole set of new problems.  I said on Second Stage that the Minister has included a new clause which provides that the entitlement to automatic citizenship to be enjoyed by a spouse shall not take effect earlier than three years after the date of the marriage, provided the marriage is still subsisting at the time of the declaration.  This safeguard, presumably, is being included to provide against marriages of convenience.  The three year waiting period is a new provision.  It did not apply before women were given the same rights as men.  This waiting period could create further difficulties and anomalies.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I explained that we would need to get into the ramifications of family law and the kind of situations that could develop.  Deputy Shatter referred to some of them and I am sure that on further consideration one could find other instances.  I said on that occasion that if an Irishman marries an Italian women in Italy and if they resided in Ireland, after two and a half years, with two children, if he dies she would not have a right to citizenship by the marriage.  If the husband deserted her and got a divorce in Italy she would still not have the right to citizenship by the marriage.  If they had lived abroad and he died she would not have a right to Irish citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested then that the Minister would have to include on Committee Stage a provision to entitle the woman in such cases to lodge a declaration notwithstanding the death of the spouse, provided the Minister would be satisfied that there was a bona fide case.  The Minister has not come forward with any amendment along these lines.  Has the Minister considered this matter and what view has she taken? Though not a specialist in this area, it became obvious to me that once <Col N="2151" /> you introduce the three year waiting period there will be potential complications.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter spends much time professionally working in this area and he can see that this can be a real problem. Provision should have been made to cover a variety of circumstances that will arise in regard to the three year waiting period, and I should like to hear the Minister explaining these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the right of admission to the State. That is dealt with in the 1935 Aliens Act. In regard to the requirements for a declaration, subsection (2) provides that citizenship will date from the day of lodgment of the declaration.  The earliest date on which a declaration can be lodged is three years from the date of marriage, as provided for in subsection (1).  Under the existing section 8, a foreign wife can lodge a declaration either before or after the marriage.  Lodgment of the declaration will not be allowed earlier than the third anniversary of the marriage under the new section 8 because the marriage must be a subsisting one of three years' duration for a foreign spouse to acquire citizenship.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that by way of administrative requirement, to enable the provision to be implemented, when making the declaration a foreign spouse would have to provide the following proofs of three years' subsistence of marriage to an Irish citizen, otherwise than by naturalisation: one, a birth certificate of the Irish spouse; two, a marriage certificate to the Irish spouse; and three, adequate evidence from the Irish spouse to the effect that the marriage is subsisting.  The decision will be made by the Department of Justice.  Deputy Woods referred to a point he had made on Second Stage with regard to the death of one spouse before the end of the three year period.  There would be provision for the citizenship to be extended to him or her under section 16 of the 1956 Act, by Irish association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to <Col N="2152" /> the Minister &mdash; and I do not mean this in a destructive way &mdash; I find her response totally unenlightening.  A formal response of that nature to the points raised does not exactly shed too much light on the intentions of the Department.  Minimum requirements would include the production of a birth certificate from the Irish spouse but it would not take too much imagination to reach that conclusion.  With regard to the marriage certificate, presumably if someone is alleging to be married some official might recognise the need to look at a marriage certificate.  The third requirement is that ample evidence be given that the marriage is presently subsisting. I do not know what that means, any more than what the phrase &ldquo;that the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgement of the declaration&ldquo; means. Presumably the marriage must be subsisting for the three years.  Is that not what the section intends? I want to know what is meant by that phrase.  I do not want to waste the time of this House and regret that today we shall be dealing with two Bills dealing with issues of some importance in the area of social reform and social legislation, issues that I have sought to have dealt with for many years, both outside and inside this House. Having a curtailed debate which renders it impossible to tease out the implications of the legislation is not satisfactory.  I find the Minister's response on this issue particularly unenlightening and unhelpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the points raised by Deputy Woods regarding a husband or wife who drops dead after two or two and a half years.  Section 16 of the Act is being amended in this Bill.  The Minister has a residual discretion under that section to extend citizenship in certain circumstances. That is a grace and favour exercise, not an entitlement to citizenship as of right.  To take Deputy Woods' example, if I were an Italian man who came to Ireland, set up home here, married an Irish woman, we had children, my wife tragically died two and a half years after marriage and I wished to stay in Ireland, why should I not be entitled, as of right, <Col N="2153" /> to Irish citizenship? Why should this be a grace and favour exercise left totally to the discretion of the officials within the Department of Justice, with no regulations set down guiding them as to how those decisions are to be made? The legal theory is that these decisions are made by the Minister, but the reality is that no Minister will move in these areas unless he or she is trying to prime the parish pump without the advice of the departmental officials expressing a view in favour of something.</P>
    <P>In my constituency I have had experience of a young person of 24 years of age, a medical student, both of whose parents have Irish naturalisation, one of these going back to the sixties.  Having this person naturalised is apparently an issue of gigantic difficulty for departmental officials to come to terms with, although he has lived in Ireland since the age of five years, has been totally educated in Irish schools and is currently attending an Irish university.  I have seen the way in which the system operates and it operates most inefficiently and most foolishly.  It is the classical example of Parkinson's Law in operation.</P>
    <P>Why put a couple through this grace and favour procedure, or a spouse where a marriage has broken down or the partner has died? The Minister's reply, rather than satisfying me that this is an issue which is being fully thought out and will be dealt with in a satisfactory way by the Department officials concerned in making it clear to people what their rights are, confirms to me that the matter will be left finally as a totally discretionary exercise.  Within the Department, as time goes on, different officials dealing with the matter may introduce different rules as to what is regarded as &ldquo;ample evidence that a marriage is presently subsisting&rdquo;. The marriage certificate establishes that a person is married.  Does the phrase concerning ample evidence of the marriage being presently subsisting, refer to the viability of the marriage? If a couple are living apart, what would be the right of the alien spouse to acquire Irish citizenship? Is that person debarred from Irish citizenship under section 3 of this <Col N="2154" /> Bill &mdash; or what will be the new section 8 of the 1956 Act? Is it envisaged under those circumstances in the administrative structure that citizenship will never be given to a spouse in circumstances where the couple have separated within the three year period? That is not an unreasonable question.  Will a departmental official adjudicate on marital breakdown by trying to score points and work out which spouse is responsible for the marriage breakdown? If the official forms the view that the Irish citizen is primarily the guilty party, will he award citizenship as a prize to the alien spouse; or if he forms the view that the alien spouse is primarily the person at fault, will he withold the prize of citizenship for bad marital behaviour? These issues have not been teased out and if we as a Parliament do not do so they will be the subject of litigation which should not be necessary in an area as basic as this.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right in saying that the admission of aliens to the State is governed by the Aliens Act of 1935.  That does not answer my second question, which is, what rights are envisaged for an alien spouse within the administrative structure that equally operates in the Department of Justice in relation to the Aliens Act? That alien spouse will not have descended from Mars; he might descend from England and if he or she descends from an EC country he or she should be protected under European Community legislation to some degree. If he or she descends, not from outer space but from the United States, Sweden, Finland or Canada, what rights would that person who cannot apply for citizenship for a three year period, have to live in Ireland? That is not an unreasonable question.  That spouse could be a man or woman in the way this Act is envisaged.</P>
    <P>Up to now if the alien spouse were a woman she would have automatically acquired Irish citizenship upon marriage and her right to reside in this country would be uncontroverted.  We are now reversing the position.  Even then no <Col N="2155" /> woman would acquire automatic citizenship on marriage but for the exceptional provision arrangement made within this legislation.  In equalising the position of men and women, which in itself is desirable, we are taking away a right which wives currently have.  We are telling the alien wife that because she does not automatically have Irish citizenship upon marriage, the right to stay in this country, particularly if she comes from outside the EC, may be a grace and favour exercise operated by the aliens section of the Department of Justice administering the Aliens Act of 1935, applying their discretionary interdepartmental approach to dealing with that issue? They are issues on which this House is entitled to seek clarification. The formal reply given by the Minister has not shed too much light on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to tell Deputy Shatter that what I said was &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; and not &ldquo;ample&rdquo; evidence. He misheard me.  Adequate evidence is the third requirement that the marriage is subsisting.  The overall need is to ensure that the marriage is viable.  The fundamental objective of this legislation is citizenship rights based on marriage.  I am pleased that the Deputy has come into the House because I realise that he has vast experience in this area.  He has brought up quite an important item concerning the requirement of adequate evidence of the Irish spouse to the effect that the marriage is subsisting.  I am prepared to look at that requirement to see if we can improve on it and prevent the difficulties that the Deputy has suggested.</P>
      <P>With regard to an alien spouse coming into the country, he or she would be treated in the same way as any alien who would not have Irish citizenship.  This position is no different from the position of someone in similar circumstances in another country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion tends only to highlight the problems raised by providing <Col N="2156" /> for a three year waiting period.  To a large extent we have had that discussion earlier but the various problems that could arise are now highlighted.  There is the question of a couple separating during that period or of what would happen in the event of a divorce, assuming that we had divorce legislation.  There would be the problem then of whether the Irish citizen was the defaulting partner or whether the person from outside was responsible for the marriage not subsisting. Therefore, we are left with two problems: the question of determining whether the marriage is subsisting and the question of what happens if the marriage is not subsisting, whether by way of death, separation or because of other definite reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section seems to indicate that the parties will depend on the grace and favour of the Minister and of the Department.  This raises the question of what exactly is the position during the three years up to the time that a declaration can be made.  What would be the position of the non-Irish person during that time? Could he or she be sent from the country very easily? We have had the case of Ahmad Bouzagou v. the station sergeant at Fitzgibbon Street Garda station. In that case a barring order was applied to Bouzagou who was married to an Irish citizen.  There were two children of the marriage.  The wife obtained a barring order and the man was deported. He was refused leave to land here again. Therefore, it is not as if we were talking about totally theoretical situations.  In dealing with legislation we try to think theoretically of what kind of circumstances might arise but these kinds of cases do occur.  Presumably the Minister will have to make provision in a whole series of ways for such cases.  I shall not repeat what I said at the outset regarding my belief that it would be better to provide for straight, equal treatment and to provide the revocation for the exceptional circumstances which might arise under this legislation and to leave it to the Minister to specify the provisions as much as possible.  That would be covered <Col N="2157" /> by my amendment but it would be covered even more so in the next amendment.</P>
    <P>All these problems will have to be met. There is the danger that in taking the kind of action we are taking in this section we are opening the door to a substantial amount of litigation in relation to these questions.  We must ask what we are letting ourselves in for in relation to the three-year period in circumstances in which a marriage is deemed not to be subsisting at the end of that time and where there are children involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Another problem that could arise in this area occurred to me as the Minister was speaking.  She expanded on what she said originally and said that the departmental view was that we were talking about a viable marriage.  I shall not go back over old ground but presumably the view of the Department would be that if there is not a viable marriage there is not a good case for granting citizenship to the alien spouse.  I have explained already the problems that could give rise to, particularly if the alien spouse was not the person responsible for the marriage breaking down.  However, let us take a different perspective and presume there is an Irish citizen whose marriage to a foreigner breaks down and that there are young children of the marriage. Let us presume that the foreign spouse is the man and that he is operating a business in Ireland.  The woman may have no independent support of her own and be depending on the husband for support.  The courts may have made maintenance and other support orders requiring the man to maintain the wife and children and extending to the children the right of access to their father though the wife might have custody of them.  There might be extreme cases such as the one Deputy Woods referred to where a husband was very violent and was barred from the home.  In such circumstances it might be convenient for everyone, and no one more so than the wife, to have him removed from the country but in the majority of instances that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2158" /> In most cases when a marriage breaks down one of the anxieties of the wife is that the husband, if he is the principal wage earner, will not flee the jurisdiction but will remain in Ireland either in employment or continuing to operate his business so that she can be assured of receiving income supports.  If a marriage is not viable it can be as much in the interest of everyone concerned that the possibility of citizenship be extended to the foreign national as is the case when the marriage is viable.  On the assumption that the Department would deal with people in a civilised way under the aliens legislation and would not exclude the foreign husband or wife from the country, when the marriage is not viable it might be in the interest of everyone concerned that the possibility of citizenship be entended to the non-national.  This would be particularly so in the case of a husband who was the principal wage earner in the family and who had made a commitment to staying here.  The aliens' department suggestion that such a person should be sent from the country could result in the future maintenance and security of the wife and children being placed in jeopardy. I am sorry if I misquoted the Minister when I referred to ample evidence that the marriage was subsisting.  She says she referred to adequate evidence and I accept that.  My problem is not whether the evidence is ample or adequate.  It is what everyone means by the reference to a marriage subsisting.  The very valid problem in this area is being highlighed by both Deputy Woods and myself.  It is a problem that we must deal with.</P>
    <P>The Bill we are dealing with this morning and also the one we shall be dealing with tomorrow have in-built reforms for which I was campaigning long before I came into this House.  I was campaigning then as a member of different voluntary bodies and organisations.  Both Bills deal with the equality of women but in providing for equality we must ensure that while solving one problem we do not create others or simply replace one problem with others thereby making the legal position of people whose problems we are seeking to resolve more precarious than <Col N="2159" /> it was in the first instance.  Regardless of what kind of legislation we are dealing with it is never helpful to have both Committee and Report Stages compacted into the one day.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister of State said that she will have another look at this.  I would seriously urge the Minister of State when we do come back on Report Stage to have a series of specific amendments tabled by this side of the House to flesh out the problems created by the new section 8 which we are going to insert into the Act and to deal specifically with the rights each spouse would have to citizenship.  We need to have a definition section which would state explicitly what is meant by a subsisting marriage after the three year period.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with Report Stage debates is that each side has only one bite to deal with the problem.  This is an issue that I do not see as a matter of great party political contention.  I do not think the blood pressure of any particular political party in this House is going to rise greatly on this Bill and it is the sort of matter we should be able to deal with in a constructive, legislative fashion.  It would be an opportunity for some Members of this House who have an interest in this area to have a look at what amendments the Government might table prior to us moving formally into Report Stage.  I would urge the Minister of State to give a specific commitment that she will introduce on Report Stage specific amendments to deal with the problems which have been highlighted and which are very real ones.</P>
    <P>I notice Deputy Woods has not expressed a view on this issue but he may have done so on another occasion.  I would be interested to hear whether the Minister of State will be willing to consider the establishment of an administrative appeals body to deal with appeals by people who are seeking citizenship and who have had their original applications turned down.  This exists in many other countries in Europe and there is no reason why we do not have it here.  My <Col N="2160" /> colleague, Deputy Kelly, often says that in the context of some legislation introduced in this House we too frequently slavishly follow what happens in the UK. In the context of legislation which confers large discretionary powers on departmental officials the one area where we do not slavishly follow what they do in the UK is that we provide independent appeal mechanisms whereby people can appeal against decisions made at an official level within Government Departments which are theoretically made in the name of the Minister but which, as we all know, are made on the advice of the Minister's officials.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will see the debate we have had on this issue as a constructive one.  I would certainly hope that when we come back on Report Stage we will have fully fleshed out what is meant by this phrase.  My view on this would be that if the departmental administrative approach is to require adequate evidence that a marriage is presently subsisting and if we cannot lay down the specifics in this legislation of what is meant by that type of evidence, there should be a statutory instrument or regulation which extrapolates on the meaning of that phrase so that the discretion is not so broad as to be indefinable so as to render it impossible for people to know exactly what their rights are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question of an appeals system on Second Stage.  It is something which we can return to on Report Stage when the Minister of State may have something further to say.  The points in relation to this section have been well highlighted.  There is one other aspect which I would ask the Minister of State to clarify and that is that once this Act comes into being there would be a change in relation to the application.  The Minister of State mentioned on Second Stage that she would give a six month notice period.  Will that be advertised?</P>

      <P>Will that be advertised publicly to let people know what the situation <Col N="2161" /> is? Some of the main considerations have been highlighted in relation to the section.  I still remain of the view that it would have been preferable to go the other way about it but now that the House has decided to go along this line there will be a need on Report Stage for further elaboration and elucidation of the areas which have been mentioned.  I would like to see from the Minister of State amendments which would cover the points which have been raised in so far as this can be done.  This may be difficult for the Minister of State because once one introduces a three year waiting period one automatically gets a number of these events occurring within the three year period.  I appreciate that it is difficult to make provision for all of them.  Perhaps, the Minister of State can, in so far as is possible, make provision to deal with that period.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Section 19 of the Act of 1956, is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (6) of the following subsections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(7) The Minister may revoke the citizenship of a post-nuptial citizen <Col N="2162" /> if he has reasonable grounds for deciding and does so decide that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the marriage pursuant to which the citizenship was acquired was not a bona fide marriage and was entered into solely or primarily for the purpose of acquiring post-nuptial citizenship, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the post-nuptial citizenship was procured by fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>(8) Before revocation of a post-nuptial citizenship the Minister shall give such notice as may be prescribed to the person whose citizenship is in question, of his intention to revoke such citizenship, stating the grounds therefor and the right of that person to apply to the Minister for an inquiry as to the reasons for the revocation.</P>
    <P>(9)  Subsection (3) of this section shall apply to an application in the prescribed manner for an inquiry under subsection (8).</P>
    <P>(10) Notice of the revocation of a person's post-nuptial citizenship shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is that in the event of there being no three year waiting period the Minister would have power to revoke and that the individual would have power to appeal against such a revocation and have a right to have the grounds stated and put clearly to him or to her for such a proposal to revoke citizenship which was obtained allegedly on a fraudulent basis.  We are trying to make the system as fair as possible for the person whose citizenship might possibly be remoked.  Exceptional cases might come forward where it was necessary to take such action and this amendment provides a clear means by which the person could be informed of the intention to revoke such citizenship and puts an obligation on the Minister and his Department to state the grounds for such an intention. <Col N="2163" /> It is a mirror image of the points raised by Deputy Shatter in relation to the other aspects.  In the circumstances which now apply there is need for a clearer definition of the processes by which decisions would be made.</P>

      <P>We are attempting to give clarity, statement of grounds, and definition to this and to make sure that the person would be given that kind of information. This is very relevant.  If we take the other route which the Minister is taking in having a three year waiting period, similarly it is necessary to have clear statements and clear grounds given to people for decisions which are made in relation to them, for example, in relation to a non-subsisting marriage.  The same spirit is included in this amendment as that referred to by Deputy Shatter.  I support the approach of clarifying and making certain the methods and the measures which are involved in determining whether or not a marriage is subsisting, or in determining the position of people whose marriages have not reached the three year qualifying period.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to press this amendment because it was related to the first one.  On that basis I will withdraw it on the grounds that the House has now voted in favour of the three year waiting period.</P>

    <P>The purpose here is to tidy up the existing Act.  When we are talking about powers which are given to renounce citizenship, why should it be only a married woman under that age instead of a married person? This Amendment deals with renunciation of citizenship.  It is a new section which would amend section 21 of the Act of 1956.  It is consequential on the other change which was made in the first part.  I put the amendment down to deal with that because I feel the Minister should make that change.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 16, and 19 together.</P>
      <P>It has not been customary, for security reasons, to provide details in advance in relation to the timing and venue of meetings of the conference.  As indicated after its meeting on 11 March 1986 the conference will consider at its next meeting further progress reports on cross-Border security co-operation and on the development of relations between the security forces in Northern Ireland and the community; progress reports from the groups of officials set up under Article 8 of the agreement to discuss extradition, the possible harmonisation of areas of the criminal law, and the search for measures to enhance public confidence in the administration of justice; and cross-Border economic and social co-operation, with particular reference to tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting of the conference on 30 December 1985, I put forward views and proposals designed to give substantial expression to the aim of ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice.  A major issue which is of concern to me in this regard is, of course, the use of uncorroborated evidence of dubious supergrass witnesses in criminal trials in Northern Ireland in what appears to be a systematic way.  I have expressed on a number of occasions my concern at the use of uncorroborated, or poorly supported, evidence in the Northern Ireland courts.  A sub-group of the conference which was established last January <Col N="2168" /> has initiated detailed consideration of measures which would enhance public confidence in the administration of justice.  This work is being actively pursued at the present time and, as earlier indicated, it is the intention to make a progress report to the next meeting of the conference.</P>
    <P>I have already made known my views on the remarks made by the British Attorney General in the House of Commons on 19 March 1986.  I have pointed out that the issue in Northern Ireland is not the admissibility of uncorroborated evidence in law, but rather that the perception has developed in recent years of a system involving large numbers of defendants charged on the evidence of dubious supergrass witnesses in trials which are presided over by a single judge acting without a jury.</P>
    <P>At each of its meetings the conference has held a detailed exchange of views on a variety of matters affecting relations between the minority community and the security forces in Northern Ireland.  It is considering ways in which these relations can be improved.</P>
    <P>In regard to the use of plastic bullets, the British authorities are already aware of my views.  I believe there is a clear need to reduce the risk to human life caused by the use of plastic bullets and, if this cannot be done, alternative measures of crowd control should be found.</P>
    <P>At its meeting on 11 December 1985 the conference agreed that the RUC and the armed forces must not only discharge their duty evenhandedly and with equal respect for the Unionist and Nationalist identities and traditions but be seen by both communities to do so.  It also considered the steps which were being taken progressively in applying the principle that the armed forces, including the UDR, operate only in support of the civil power with the particular objective of ensuring as rapidly as possible that, save in the most exceptional circumstances, there is a police presence in all operations which involve direct contact with the community.</P>
    <P>Since then I have informed myself at regular intervals of the implementation <Col N="2169" /> of this principle.  Evidence available to me indicates that progress is being made. Full implementation of this policy will provide the minority with a significant safeguard in its dealings with the security forces, including the UDR.  As regards the number of complaints made to the authorities about UDR behaviour since the agreement was signed, I am not in a position to comment on whether there has been a reduction as statistics in this regard are not available.  I believe, however, that there will be less cause for complaint once the policy of accompaniment has been fully implemented.</P>
    <P>The conference has also considered a number of policy issues relating to prisons. I have made known to the British side my views on the subject of strip-searching at Armagh Prison and my belief that this practice should be reduced in the new prison at Maghaberry to an absolute minimum compatible with security requirements.</P>

      <P>The Minister has dealt with a number of matters in his reply but I wish to focus on two issues and to ask the Minister specifically about them.  I am concerned in my question about supergrass trials and the strip-searching of prisoners. Apart altogether from any attempt to build confidence in the system of administration of justice in Northern Ireland, will the Minister accept that both these practices are undesirable in themselves? For instance, will he not agree that the system of supergrass trials is an affront to our whole parliamentary democratic way of life and the proper principles of the administration of the system of justice? In that connection is he not concerned that the British Government apparently are not prepared to indicate that these type of trials will be terminated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to strip-searching, will he not agree this is something that is unacceptable in itself, apart altogether from any implications it may have in inspiring or not inspiring confidence in the system of justice, and that it is not something over which a humane or humanitarian <Col N="2170" /> administration can stand? Will he not indicate clearly to the House that he condemns both these practices, the supergrass trials and strip-searching, and that he will do everything in his power to have both of them discontinued?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in agreeing with virtually everything the Deputy said.  I indicated my attitude to the supergrass trials and strip-searching long before the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed and the conference established. I presume that, when the Deputy spoke about the British Government giving no indication with regard to supergrass trials, he was referring to the reply given by the British Attorney General in the House of Commons some months ago.  What he indicated there was that there is a belief that there is a difference is the system of law in the North of Ireland and in Britain and that objections were taken to this and he indicated this was not so and that the same law applies. My point when I drew attention to supergrass trials was the large number of defendants who appear before a single judge without a jury &mdash; even though that judge may go through the process of advising himself that he must be careful of the evidence &mdash; the dubious character of some of these supergrass witnesses, which was referred to by a number of justices on a number of occasions, and also the fact that it takes so long to process the whole system of trial.  Many of the cases have not been completed after three or four years and that is very undesirable in a system of law.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister embarrassed by the fact that having given a clear impression in this House after the December meeting of the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference that in future UDR patrols would be accompanies by the RUC, thus obviating the need for direct public contact, the following month an unaccompanied UDR patrol opened fire on civilians near Cookstown in County Tyrone? Is the Minister aware that the Chief Constable of the RUC has made it clear that UDR patrols will not <Col N="2171" /> be accompanied at all times by the RUC? What does he propose to do about this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the time that it would be the objective of the conference to ensure that confidence in the security forces in the North of Ireland would be built up by having security forces &mdash; UDR or regular British Army &mdash; accompanied by RUC police officers when dealing with the public.  Progress is being made in this regard.  Obviously there is a logistical problem concerning the number of people available.  It has been very evident during the past few months that the RUC have been stretched in other matters.  I am satisfied that progress is being made and will continue to be made, especially in the most sensitive areas, to ensure that where the security forces are dealing with members of the public the point of contact will be an RUC person.</P>

I accept that there are UDR patrols operating without being accompanied by RUC men when dealing with the public.  I am quite willing to accept that they are harassing some of the Nationalist community and I have had some complaints.  Where I have received specific complaints with details of locations, times and named people or some possibility of identification, I have brought them to the attention of the British authorities.</P>

If so, can the Minister say if the conference will deal with the recent spate of attacks on homes, churches and schools in the Nationalist <Col N="2172" /> area?

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my original reply that it has not been customary for security reasons to provide details in advance in relation to the timing and venue of the meetings of the conference. I am extremely concerned about the sectarian attacks on some members of the Nationalist community in the North of Ireland and at the &ldquo;bully boy&rdquo; terrorist attacks on the homes of some RUC men who are doing their job in protecting Nationalist areas.  My concern about those has been conveyed to the authorities. Anything we can do politically to bring about a diminution of these attacks will be done.  In the meantime the security forces in the North of Ireland must ensure that the RUC officers whose homes are being attacked and Nationalist churches and play schools which are also being attacked are protected and the attacks stopped.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the growing perception that the Inter-Governmental Conference is achieving very little, that the Deputy Leader of the SDLP has spoken of growing impatience, while the Deputy Leader of the DUP has called the conference an impotent structure?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to what was said by the Deputy Leader of the SDLP on radio on Sunday and I could not argue with anything he said in that regard.  He indicated that Nationalists welcome the Anglo-Irish Agreement and welcome the fact that the secretariat has been established in Belfast and that the conference is meeting regularly. There are indications that work is being done in areas of concern to the Nationalist community but obviously he would like to see, as I would, tangible, positive results.  There are areas which have been a cause of concern to Nationalists in the North of Ireland not for the past five <Col N="2173" /> months or 50 months or five years but for over 50 years and these problems cannot be resolved quickly or easily.  They need some discussion.  He, as I, would wish to see that discussion takes place as quickly as possible.  Deputy Collins says that the Deputy Leader of the DUP has said that the conference is impotent.  His rhetoric and the encouragement I believe he gives to men of violence would not lead one to believe that he considers it unimportant or impotent in any regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 12, 15 and Priority Question No. 20 together.</P>
      <P>The Single European Act has now been signed by all the member states and the question of seeking further amendments to it does not arise.  As Deputies are aware, there will be a full debate on the Act when the necessary legislation to permit ratification of the Act is brought before the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
      <P>Both the Taoiseach and myself have previously pointed out in this House that the provisions on Co-operation in the Sphere of Foreign Policy contained in Title III of the Single European Act pose no threat to this country's sovereignty, neutrality or ability to take independent decisions on foreign policy matters.  I wish to take the opportunity of the Deputies' questions to reiterate this.</P>
      <P>An integral part of our foreign policy has been the pursuit of international peace and security.  In the 14 years of our involvement with European Political Co-operation successive Irish Governments have not felt constrained from working actively for peace or from undertaking appropriate initiatives.  This Government will continue the policy of supporting concrete measures aimed at disarmament, especially nuclear disarmament, and of supporting and contributing to the maintenance of international peace through UN peace-keeping activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal effect of Title III of the Single European Act will be to formalise existing practices and procedures governing European Political Co-operation &mdash; EPC.  Under this process which has been gradually evolving over the past 16 years, the member states of the Community, operating on the basis of consensus, agree to adopt as far as possible common policy <Col N="2175" /> stances on issues of foreign policy which are of general concern.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of security, Ireland's particular interests and concerns have been fully met in Title III of the Single European Act.  Provision is made in paragraph 6 (a) of Title III for closer co-ordination of positions on the political and economic aspects of security. So as to take account of the fact that Ireland is not a member of any military alliance, it is specifically provided that those member states which wish to co-operate more closely on security matters, that is on military and defence questions, may do so within the Western European Union or the Atlantic Alliance.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 (b) of Title III records the determination of the member states to maintain the technological and industrial conditions necessary for their security. This is in the context of the specific commitment in Article 6 for the co-ordination of the positions of member states on the political and economic aspects of security within the framework of European Political Co-operation.  There is absolutely no commitment involved of a military or defence nature.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell has also raised the amendments to the Treaty of Rome contained in Title II of the Single European Act. Let me say that there is no question of the operation of the so-called &ldquo;Luxembourg Compromise&rdquo;, that is the entitlement of a member state to invoke a vital national interest and to veto a proposal by the Council, being affected by these Treaty amendments.  As a country so dependent on foreign trade, we have a very considerable national interest in the early and full achievement of a genuine single internal market in the Community.  Therefore, we welcome the limited but nonetheless significant improvements which have been provided for in the Council's decision-making procedures in the Single European Act by means of substituting qualified majority voting in certain areas where unanimity is now required, notably to facilitate completion of the internal market by a target date of 31 December 1992.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give us some examples as to what he means by the political and economic aspects of security referred to under Article 30, paragraph 6 (a) where he argues that that in no way involves us in a diminution of our neutrality or independence? Perhaps related to that is Article 30, paragraph 2 (d) where the contracting parties are obliged to endeavour to avoid any action or position which impairs their effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations or within international organisations.  Would the Minister not accept that there must be some restriction on our independence if we take those two paragraphs together, given that the other partners in the EC are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The political aspects of security relate to foreign policy issues dealing with international peace and security which are concerned with the Twelve as a whole.  Questions relating to international security in general, and European security in particular, have always been central to European political co-operation whether in discussing issues such as the Middle East or South Africa or in discussion of disarmament issues arising in the United Nations.  For example, in regard to the economic aspects of security, during the energy crisis of 1973 the economic security of supplies in that area would have been of concern to the Twelve.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second point the Deputy raised, obviously the intention is &mdash; and it has been part of European political co-operation for the past 15 years &mdash; to try to get our political attitudes to problems around the world and international bodies as close together as possible.  But it is always on the basis of consensus.  Therefore, if only 11 countries can agree to taking a certain stance at the United Nations or at the CSCE then there is not a European political position because there has not been consensus about the position.  While we would wish to get our positions as close as possible, there may be issues which cannot be agreed and, therefore, there will not be a common European position.  There can only be a common European position when all Twelve agree to it.  Otherwise there is not a common European position. There is no diminution of our independence in that regard because we can decide independently we will not be part of that consensus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It quite specifically does <Col N="2178" /> not include defence, as I said in the answer to the original question.  Paragraph 6 (a), (b) and (c) must be read together and, to satisfy the Irish demands, part of that says that in relation to military security or defence those countries who wish to pursue these matters must pursue them either in NATO or WEU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  But I can see why the Deputy would ask that question.  What is in mind here is that in the CSCE or the Non-Proliferation Treaty Organisation or in the follow up meetings that are taking place in Berne and Vienna at the moment or in the UN in September we would try to get a common European position on that.  Obviously if there is an outbreak of some kind of hostility in some part of the world and we want a common European position, there will be the delay that would be involved in the calling of the meeting and the holding of the meeting.  But it has been proven that that can be done very quickly.

      <P>I thank the Minister for that information.  I want to make it absolutely clear that I did not and would never refer to this Dáil as a rubber stamp.  But I did refer to this procedure of ratification as a rubber stamp procedure.  Surely if we cannot amend the treaty and we only have the decision to ratify or not, the Government in bringing it before the <Col N="2181" /> House is certainly turning the House into a rubber stamp in so far as this procedure is concerned.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the Act.  In regard to its proposal to remove all barriers in the internal market of the Community and to have, as near as possible, a single integrated market, does the Minister not share my apprehension that this will involve considerable danger to our economy in a number of areas? Are the Government engaging in any procedure which will protect at least sensitive areas from the dangers inherent in this development? Is there to be any compensation for this country following the elimination of all internal mechanisms inside the common market? We saw yesterday and the day before that the position of our agriculture in the Community is being weakened and the Common Agricultural Policy is in the process of being dismantled.  If our agriculture is to be thrown to the winds, are there any compensatory advantages in any area which the Government are seeking in the context of the new situation which this European Act will create so far as the internal market of the Community is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the premise that the internal market is a danger to this country.  The reverse will be true, it will be of benefit to this country. We always wished for a more open market in which is sell our goods and if Deputies examine our trading figures with individual countries in the Twelve since we joined the Community, my point will be borne out, and my regret is that this has not happened more quickly. Obviously there are sensitive areas not just for this country but for other member states and the objective of the Twelve is to achieve a common market by 1992.  As a help to achieve that a number of areas which previously required unanimous voting have been brought into majority voting.  The right of veto in other areas, such as the harmonisation of taxes and other sensitive areas, still exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>To take it as an example: the Minister will agree that that could involve us in a loss of revenue of around £500 million or £600 million and there are many other areas where the process which will be initiated under this European Act could result in very serious losses to the detriment of different sections of our economy.  It is no good closing our eyes to this fact.  The Minister should accept that while a completely free market is very advantageous to us from one point of view&mdash;because of our geographic situation and our small size &mdash;it can have very grave dangers for us from other points of view, particularly now when we see our agricultural industry being totally dismantled.  Does the Minister not recognise that there is a very real need for a major arrangement to be made within the Community to compensate this country for the very serious dangers that we will incur in this process? In other words, does he not think that the implementation of this Act is another compelling reason why we should seek to negotiate an entirely new régime for Ireland in the Community?</P>

      <P>The European Act contains a chapter on cohesion in the Community. This is something countries like Greece and Ireland insisted on putting in so that the less developed areas outside the centre of the Community would be developed and that the Community would concentrate its efforts on getting the standard of living in those countries up to that of the countries in the centre of Europe.</P>
      <P>I must not have made myself clear when I answered the previous supplementary. I said that in the area of taxation, the invoking of the Luxembourg Treaty still applies.  We can still use the veto there.  That is not one of the areas which is open to a majority vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The US administration, as indeed the Governments of all the nuclear weapons states, are well aware of the Government's position on nuclear testing.  When I addressed the third NPT Review Conference last August I outlined that position.  On behalf of the Government I spoke of the need for a demonstration of genuine willingness on the part of the nuclear weapons states to give a fresh impetus to the negotiation of a comprehensive test ban treaty.  As evidence of that commitment I urged those states to halt their nuclear tests at the earliest possible date.  This exhortation was repeated in my address to the 40th Session of the UN General Assembly in September last.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific incidents of testing by the US which the Deputy has raised, it is not our practice to convey our views regarding individual tests to the Governments concerned.</P>
      <P>I have already alluded to the efforts of the Government to promote a ban on the testing of nuclear weapons.  This Government consider the negotiation of a comprehensive test ban treaty the first milestone in any serious programme of nuclear disarmament.  Successive Irish Governments have advocated such a treaty, the conclusion of which would, we believe, constrain and eventually preclude the further development of nuclear weapons.  To this end we have traditionally lent staunch support or cosponsorship to resolutions urging the negotiation of a CTBT at the United Nations General Assembly each year.  It is the Government's intention to continue to strongly advocate the necessity of a comprehensive test ban treaty.</P>

Does any course of action occur to him as Minister for Foreign Affairs that this country can take, perhaps in co-operation with other countries, to do something about this appallingly ominous, threatening situation? Will he agree that our apprehensions about Sellafield have now been dramatically confirmed over what happened in Russia? A nuclear power station, which the Russians assured the world was the safest on earth and that nothing could possibly happen to it, has experienced a devastating accident.  I feel sure that the Minister agrees with me that there is very real cause for concern about this whole area of nuclear weapons. Would he care to comment on any worthwhile action that the Government of this small country could undertake, perhaps in co-operation with other countries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the reason that prompts Deputy Haughey to say after Monday's appalling accident in Russia that civilian nuclear power is as dangerous as nuclear weapons.  The truth is that civilian nuclear power has killed more people and done more damage in the last 40 years since the end of the war than nuclear weapons.  But, it would be an exaggeration not to recognise that the potential for destruction by nuclear weapons is infinitely greater than by civilian power stations.  The levels and speed at which the two super powers have built up nuclear armaments over the last 40 years is terrifying for all the peoples of the world, including their own peoples. The stand-off position that existed between the two super powers for a number of years was resolved last year, I am glad to say, but that does not mean <Col N="2188" /> an end to the build up of nuclear armaments nor does it mean the destruction of existing nuclear armaments.  However, at least they are now talking and that is a small but significant step forward.  I share the concern about the safety of nuclear plants all over the world.</P>
      <P>We have no nuclear plants, and I think that the most constructive attitude that this Government can take is that we can ensure that in the Community of which we are a member there is an overseeing policing authority for all nuclear plants to see that they are continuously monitored as to safety into the future.  Regarding nuclear weapons, we must try to get the consensus that is important politically among the 12 member states of the Community to ensure that we speak as one voice in the CSCE and the UN particularly to bring home to the two super powers the danger for the world for generations to come of this build up of nuclear arms.  That is where our strength lies as a small Government.  They do not need persuading.  They think alike on this.  We must encourage the two super powers to get together and devise a method whereby they can step by step reduce their huge stocks of nuclear weapons.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the number of occasions since February 1986 on which Irish troops serving with UNIFIL have come under fire or threat of fire; the groups or organisations believed to have been responsible; the action, if any, the Government have taken as a result of these incidents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2190" /> The Government are kept fully informed of all incidents involving Irish troops serving with UNIFIL.  The number of occasions on which incidents of one kind or another involving Irish troops occurred in the period from 1 February 1986 to 18 April 1986 was 87; on 82 of these occasions firearms were discharged by the bodies confronting the UNIFIL troops.  The incidents arose mainly from the activities of Israeli-backed militia, although other armed elements active in the area were responsible in a limited number of instances.  Thanks largely to the skill and training of the contingent, no fatalities were incurred in any of these incidents.  However, on two separate occasions members of the contingent were wounded as a result of hostile firing. On 20 February, Corporal Christopher Shine was shot and wounded in an incident involving the local Israeli-backed militia; on 23 March, Private Kevin Moran was wounded in a confrontation with members of a Muslim militia group. Both soldiers have made a good recovery.</P>
    <P>As I have repeatedly made clear, the security of Irish personnel serving in the Lebanon is given the highest priority by the Government and the situation facing our UNIFIL contingent is kept under constant review in this regard.  I have ensured that the Secretary-General who has been given the responsibility by the Security Council for the day-to-day administration of the force is fully aware of our concerns in this area.  Steps have also been taken through diplomatic channels to convey to the parties to the conflict our insistence that the members of the force be allowed to carry out their functions unimpeded and that there should be a cessation of harassment or other forms of attack on UNIFIL personnel.</P>
    <P>As a mark of its concern at this and other aspects of the situation facing the force the Security Council at its meeting on 18 April agreed to extend the mandate of UNIFIL for a three month period only, in place of the more usual six month period.  In examining the question of continued participation in the force beyond the expiry of the current mandate the <Col N="2191" /> Government will, in the period immediately ahead, continue to give very careful consideration to an assessment of the level of risk involved for our personnel and to a determination of whether it remains within acceptable bounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that our soldiers can discharge their role in carrying out the UN mandate and that there is a genuine commitment within the United Nations by the various member countries to resolve the problems in Lebanon? Can he also explain why the mandate was extended for only three months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the latter part of Deputy Treacy's question in my original reply.  It was because of the concern which other members &mdash; not just Ireland &mdash; felt about conditions in South Lebanon and the harassment which UNIFIL forces were experiencing in trying to fulfil that mandate.  However, as the Deputy is aware, UNIFIL forces have not been fulfilling the mandate virtually since their arrival in Lebanon but they have been performing a very useful role.  At the invitation of the Lebanese Government they have been in a peace-keeping position in Southern Lebanon and have been welcomed by the population who wish to see them remaining in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the determination of the United Nations Security Council to find a solution to the problem of Lebanon, I am satisfied that such a desire exists amongst the members involved but, because of the complexity of the situation, they are as frustrated as everybody else in trying to find a solution which would be acceptable to all factions.  It is a tragic country which has been divided and destroyed by warring factions and the goodwill which existed there ten years ago has vanished.  Beirut is a bombed out city and peace loving people who just want to live normal lives are not allowed to do so because they are harassed by different groups of militia.  In Southern Lebanon there is what the Israelis refer <Col N="2192" /> to as their security zone which is a further cause of tension and resentment among the local population.  The solution is not easy but I am satisfied that there is a great desire among United Nations personnel to find it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit more complex than that.  I presume the Deputy is referring to the Americans and the Russians. However, because they did not subscribe does not necessarily mean that they do not wish to see a solution in Lebanon. The reasons the Russians gave were different and I am glad that they have now changed their minds, which is welcome. I also welcome the support they indicated they may give to UNIFIL forces in the future and the statement of the Secretary of State, Mr. Shultz, that he hopes to have a reversal of the decision of Congress not to subscribe to UNIFIL.  That is due to come into operation in October next.</P>

      <P>The Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, Fr. Miguel d'Escoto, visited me yesterday for a working discussion about the situation in Central America, and in Nicaragua in particular, with specific reference to the signing of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America.  Along with our partners in the Twelve, we consider the signing of this Act to be essential to the achievement of peace and reconciliation in the Central American region and this has been the primary objective of the Twelve's diplomatic efforts since they decided to support the Contadora process three years ago.</P>
      <P>I emphasised to Fr. d'Escoto that it would be Ireland's wish to see a successful outcome to the forthcoming meeting of the Central American States and the Contadora countries in Panama at the beginning of June when it is hoped that the Contadora Act would be signed by all the participants, including Nicaragua. I would hope that by then there could be agreement on outstanding points in the negotiations such as those relating to the complex problems of military manoeuvres and control and reduction of armaments and a verification procedure acceptable to all signatories to the Act and that this could serve as a means of overcoming the climate of hostility and putting an end to the arms race, foreign intervention and policies of force in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the second half of the Deputy's question, while Nicaragua, having regard to income levels, is not a priority country for Irish bilateral aid, we have over the past seven years participated in joint financing of programmes sponsored by non-governmental bodies to the extent of approximately £125,000. During the same period Nicaragua received £68 million in direct aid from the Community.  In addition, the Community is prepared to consider further <Col N="2194" /> appropriate forms of economic support for the Central American region, including Nicaragua, when a political agreement among the countries of the region has been concluded.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate what initiatives he or the Government are taking, independently of the Community, in relation to the signing of the Contadora peace initiative? Could he also indicate what aid, if any, has been provided by Ireland to Nicaragua in the past 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the European Community has been that a solution to the problem of Central America in regard to peace and stability should come from the region itself without outside interference.  For that reason we encouraged the countries involved to sign the Contadora Act.  To show our concern for what is happening in Central America and give encouragement to the various countries to sign the Contadora Act next June, the President of the Council of Ministers of the EC went to Panama when discussions were taking place there in March.  He did so as an indication of Europe's interest, concern and encouragement to all the countries to sign the Act.  At that stage Nicaragua felt that they could not sign but there have been certain movements since then.  I hope that, given the undertaking that may be given to Nicaragua and taking into account what Ambassador Habib said about the cessation of aid to the Contras, such an Act can be signed on 6 June. With regard to the question about the amount of aid given I am not sure I have all the information.</P>

      <P>No.  We have no promises from any of the countries yet.  The Deputy will be aware that a Bill is going <Col N="2196" /> through the American Congress in that regard.  The British and Irish Governments have made joint approaches to the Canadian and Australian Governments who indicated initially that they would be willing to give support. That was about six weeks or two months ago, but we have not heard anything since.  The European Community have almost completed an examination of the options open to them to subscribe, whether through the Regional Fund, the Social Fund or by direct contribution. When that examination has been studied and agreement reached by the British and Irish Governments as to the desirability of each of the options, we will make the formal approach.</P>

      <P>That is not the objective. The implication in what the Deputy is saying is that in some way the agreement damages the Unionist's position, but, clearly, it does not.  On a number of occasions I said that I resented very much this misrepresentation of the agreement by leaders of the Unionist community which has led some very moderate Unionists to believe that it contains something that is detrimental to their interests.  It does not contain any such proposals.  The intention in forming the international fund was because structurally, psychologically and socially a lot of damage had been done through violence over the last 17 or 18 years on both sides of the Border, but mostly in the North of Ireland.  It was in an effort to repair that damage that the fund was set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question No. 6 and Priority Question No. 21 together.  I have already set out the concerns of the Government about the US attack on Libya in reply to questions in this House on 15 April.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on that occasion, the Government share the concerns of the United States about international terrorism. I also pointed out that we believe that terrorism can be defeated by political means.  To this end, we have been engaged in the last few weeks in an intensive round of consultations with our European partners in the elaboration of an agreed European strategy to confront the challenge of international terrorism and to provide protection against terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>Throughout this crisis, I have urged the need for restraint on the part of all concerned and have emphasised the importance we in Ireland attach to the role of the United Nations and in particular the Security Council in facilitating the peaceful resolution of crises of this kind.</P>
      <P>We received no advance notification of the US intention to launch an attack on Libya.  Since the attack the US authorities have been in communication with my Department and they have informed us of the action they had taken and of the background to their decision.  The US authorities, for their part, are fully aware of our concern about this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the framework of the common Twelve strategy for countering international terrorism, a number of measures have been agreed, including measures directed at Libya in the field of diplomatic and consular relations as well as stricter <Col N="2199" /> visa requirements and procedures.  The Twelve will also examine the scope for reduction in the size of non-diplomatic Libyan offices in their countries and there will be greater concentration on the problem of abuses of diplomatic immunity.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these decisions, several partners have already taken action to reduce the size of Libyan missions in their countries.  As Deputies will be aware, Ireland maintains diplomatic relations with Libya on a non-resident basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Twelve have decided not to export to Libya arms or other military equipment.  They are agreed, moreover, that they will do everything in their power to ensure that their nationals and industry do not seek any commercial advantage from measures taken by others in response to terrorist attack.  The Twelve have taken no decision on the imposition of trade sanctions as such against Libya. We and other partners have at all times made clear our opposition to such sanctions as inappropriate.</P>
    <P>In the context of the present crisis, the Twelve have called for restraint and have taken steps to engage interested states, including the Arab states, in a dialogue about international terrorism and about effective methods of eradicating it.  The Government strongly support this ongoing effort to elaborate a common European political response to the threat posed by international terrorism and to discourage support by any state for those who engage in terrorist attack.  We believe that if there is an effective deterrent against state-supported terrorism, this will serve to diminish the dangers of military confrontation arising from such support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the abolition of the wife's dependent domicile. Subsection (1) says:</P>
      <P>From the commencement of this Act the domicile of a married woman shall be an independent domicile and shall be determined by reference to the same factors as in the case of any other person capable of having an independent domicile and, accordingly, the rule of law whereby upon marriage a woman acquires the domicile of her husband and is during the subsistence of the marriage incapable of having any other domicile is hereby abolished.</P>
      <P>Then subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>This section applies to the parties to every marriage, irrespective of where and under what law the marriage takes place and irrespective of the domicile of the parties at the time of the marriage.</P>
      <P>We agree entirely with this provision.  As the House will be aware, prior to the introduction of this Bill we introduced the Conflict of Laws (Reform) Bill, 1985, which was taken here in Private Members' Time.  The basic purpose of that Bill was to give a woman independent domicile, something the Fianna Fáil Party felt was very important and which could be done relatively simply to provide independent domicile for the woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a point of difference with the Minister in regard to the basis for the use of domicile as distinct from habitual residence.  We used the term &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; in substitution for the term &ldquo;domicile&rdquo;, which constituted a more fundamental reform and one recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  The Minister's response was to the effect that it involved a far-reaching reform, that it would be preferable to tackle that task at a later stage, perhaps when the matter of the referendum <Col N="2237" /> had been dealt with.  That is our position.  While we agree with the Minister and support this section we would have preferred that the more fundamental task would have been embraced &mdash; that of substituting the term &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; for &ldquo;domicile&rdquo;.  Accepting that the Government will not do that, we are prepared to go along with the provision of independent domicile for the woman, which is what the Minister is proposing in section 1.  Therefore, we are supporting the section.</P>

      <P>This section follows naturally on the new rules governing domicile and these rules will apply after the commencement of the Act.  Personally I regret that this Bill has not been used as a vehicle to reform some of the more antiquated concept of domicile and how it is determined.  Though I do not wish to <Col N="2238" /> have an argument with the Chair in regard to the ruling, the amendment I tabled would deal with the oddity of the concept of domicile of origin, which is a classical example of the legal anachronisms this House has not been willing to deal with.  Though I welcome the Bill and the establishment of independent domicile for married women and for married men, I deeply regret that there is not a good deal more in this measure than is in it.  Section 3 could have been much wider by making domicile a more realistic concept than under present law.  That opportunity has been lost and I am sorry it was not possible for agreement to be reached on the amendment I tabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated on Second Stage, this is a minimal provision to abolish dependent domicile and, following on that, to bring in new rules of recognition of foreign divorces.  Following the abolition of the rule of unitary domicile, it was necessary to include a provision to decide what rules should apply to determining what the domicile of a wife will be on and after the commencement of the Act.  The provision is to the effect that the new rules on the domicile of married women will apply in these cases.  An alternative approach which is found in the corresponding British legislation, the Domicile and Matrimonial (Proceedings) Act, 1973, is that on the passing of the Act a married woman would retain the domicile she had immediately before the passing of the Act until and unless she had either reacquired her domicile of origin or a domicile of choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with this solution is that rather than determine a person's domicile at a date after commencement by simply applying the new rules to a person's history and circumstances after that date, it imposes a statutory artificial domicile on a person which can only be shaken off by that person taking appropriate steps after the commencement.  This implies that a person would have to take some action, rather than that he or she would just be <Col N="2239" /> affected by the enactment of the legislation. It seems preferable, in accordance with the policy of the Bill, to adopt an alternative and treat a married woman for the purpose of her future domicile as if she had an independent domicile all along.  In this way married women would be treated as to their future domicile in the same way, irrespective of whether they were married before or after the coming into force of the legislation.</P>

      <P>(2)  The domicile of a minor at any time when his father and mother are living together shall be that of his father.</P>
      <P>(3)  (a)  The domicile of a minor at any time when his father and mother are living apart shall be the domicile of that parent with whom the minor has his principal home.</P>
      <P>(b)  At any time when a minor does not have his principal home with either his father or his mother the domicile of that minor shall be the domicile of that parent with whom the minor last had his principal home.</P>
      <P>(4)  (a)  The domicile of a minor whose mother is dead shall be that which she last had before she died if at her death the minor had her domicile by virtue of subsection (2) (a) of this section and has not since had a home with his father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The domicile of a minor whose father is dead shall be that which he last had before he died if at the time of his death the minor had his domicile <Col N="2240" /> by virtue of subsection (2) (a) of this section and has not since had a home with his mother.</P>
    <P>(5)  This section shall not affect any existing rule of law as to the cases in which a minor's domicile is regarded as being, by dependence, that of his mother.</P>
    <P>(6)  In the application of this section to a minor who has been adopted, references to the father or mother of such minor shall be construed as references to the adoptive father or adoptive mother of such minor.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately Deputy O'Rourke had to leave the Chamber to attend a meeting of the Women's Rights Committee at this time.  I wish to offer her apologies and she hopes to be back before this debate concludes.  I am sure that meeting is affecting some other Members who might have been interested in these sections.</P>
    <P>The scheme proposed in the Bill is somewhat unsatisfactory.  Following the Minister's concluding speech on Second Stage, I am surprised that she has not agreed to or made any amendments.  The problem here is that the section leaves intact the general principle that the domicile of a minor is that of his father and attempts to adjust the position of the mother within that framework.  It is not clear from the Bill how exactly the original common law rule and the new statutory provisions would co-exist. Inevitably, the courts would have to harmonise the two, probably following litigation. The approach which we are suggesting is to substitute for the general principle the amended section 4 in which we would provide a comprehensive code governing the domicile of a minor which, by providing clarity and certainty, makes it far less likely that litigation would inveitably flow from the approach being taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Apart from these general observations, one would have to take exception to the drafting of this section.  The phrase &ldquo;and has no home with his father&rdquo; would have to be deleted as it would create the effect that, if a minor had regular <Col N="2241" /> overnight visiting with the father, the domicile of the minor would remain that of the father notwithstanding that the minor might be in the custody of the mother.  It is necessary in our view to qualify the term &ldquo;home&rdquo; with the adjective &ldquo;principal&rdquo;, to achieve what I believe the Minister intends in this regard.  For these reasons we have proposed in our amendment the substitution of a new section 4 for the present section.  Subsection (5) would cover in particular cases in which there was an unmarried mother or an illegitimate child.</P>
    <P>Our approach is an attempt to rewrite totally the father and mother into the situation where the home is partly with the father and partly with the mother as distinct from the Minister's approach of leaving the general rule of law in which the minor is taken to be domiciled with the father and making arrangements for a situation when the minor is with the mother.  These are two different approaches to the one question.  Even if the Minister were to find that our proposal required some further additions or amendment, that proposal subsequently would be seen to cater for the different circumstances which might arise.</P>

      <P>One of the things which depresses me most frequently in this House is that no matter which Government are in power the Minister of the day who is guiding a Bill through the House seeks to preserve his or her macho stance as the <i>eminence grise</i>&mdash; although that is not the correct reference to the present Minister.  The Minister has to preserve the reserved expertise of his or her departmental officials as a matter of course.  Deputy Woods party are as guilty of this as my party are.  Amendments proposed, whether validly proposed or not, are rejected out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support Deputy Woods' amendment in relation to this issue.  It makes a great deal of sense.  It makes a good deal more legal sense than does the proposal contained in section 4 as drafted, with all due respect to the Minister's Department.  Deputy Woods' proposal seeks to set out the general law in relation <Col N="2242" /> to the domicile of dependancy of a minor in a way which makes it as clear as possible. It does that in a way which gets over some of the basic flaws which exist in the departmental drafting of this Bill which is being supported by the Minister. Let me compare the two and indicate the reason for my taking of this view of Deputy Woods' proposed section.  This is not a matter of great party political contention and perhaps we could consider whether it is a section which could be adopted without appearing to allow somebody either to score or lose on the political point operation carried on by this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods' amendment has the merit that it proposes to substitute the rule referred to in subsection (1) for subsection (2) which proposes that:</P>
    <P>The domicile of a minor at any time when his father and mother are living together shall be that of his father.</P>
    <P>That is the current law.  If it is what we are to retain in our law why not state so explicitly? The Deputy proposes in subsection (3) (a) that:</P>
    <P>The domicile of a minor at any time when his father and mother are living apart shall be the domicile of that parent with whom the minor last had his principal home.</P>
    <P>That makes a great deal of sense.  To translate it into the language of separations it means primarily that the domicile will be the domicile of the parent who has custody of the minor.  The proposal in the Bill is that:</P>
    <P>The domicile of a minor at any time when his father and mother are living apart shall be that of his mother if &mdash; (a)  the minor then has his home with her and has no home with his father...</P>
    <P>There is a difference between the principal home and having no home.  Most people here would support the notion that, where marriages break down, it is important that the children involved retain relationships with both parents. <Col N="2243" /> That is something both Deputy Woods and I agreed on as members of the Committee on Marital Breakdown.  The home of the parent who has custody might be the child's principal home, but it is normal and usual that a child of separated parents has contact with the parent with whom he is not living, usually the father. That contact will often involve the child staying at the home of the father during weekends or holiday periods.  Therefore, the child will still have a home with the father.  It would appear from the Bill as drafted that the child would have to have no home with the father before his domicile could be determined to be dependent on that of the mother.  That makes no sense.</P>
    <P>Various reports have been produced in different jurisdictions on the law relating to domicile.  We only have a short time to deal with this issue here and I shall not burden the House either by quoting from the working paper of the Law Reform Commission in this jurisdiction or from other reports produced in the UK and elsewhere.  The language used usually in this context to deal with this issue is a reference to the principal home.  When separation takes place, the child's domicile will no longer be solely dependent on that of the father but coincides usually with the domicile of the parent with whom the child has his principal home. This matter is not dealt with properly in the Bill.  In the amendment proposed by Deputy Woods the issue is dealt with in a way that would add a greater degree of clarity than is the case in the Bill.  With due respect to those concerned, I have no doubt that a departmental official, in order to preserve his original draft, will have the Minister given a brief to state that there is something grossly defective in Deputy Woods' amendment.  If I should be proved wrong on that it will be the first occasion that I have witnessed in this House in recent time acceptance of an Opposition amendment.  I never witnessed it either when Deputy Woods was Minister.  I do not recall his ever giving way to a proposal from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2244" /> This is a very limited Bill but at least we should ensure that we are right in respect of those areas it touches on and not leave any ambiguity.  We should not pass legislation which gives the appearance of extending rights to wives and mothers while leaving us in the position that no one will be sure as to whether such rights exist.  Let us not have a Bill which leaves the law in a state of either greater or equal uncertainty with the current uncertainty.  I cannot find any defect in Deputy Woods' proposal.  I regard his amendment as rational, reasonable and sensible.  I am not frequently as charitably disposed as that towards the Deputy's proposals.</P>

      <P>Possibly this is being damned by faint praise.  I am not sure whether I am assisting him or creating greater difficulties for him by these comments, but it would seem that the provision in the Bill is far more defective than any defect that might be found in the Deputy's amendment.  Consequently, I trust the Minister will accept the amendment in an uncontentious way and in the light of improving the Bill because this Bill requires a great deal of improvement if it is to improve the law in this area and clarify it and also if it is to remove some of the current anomalies rather than contribute to the creation of additional anomalies.  I trust that what I am saying will be taken as a contribution to a piece of legislation which deals with an area with which I am very familiar.  I work outside this House regularly with people who are affected by these laws.  The next amendment is complementary to the one we are discussing so I trust, it, too, can be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions but, as Deputy Woods knows, these fairly technical and detailed amendments were tabled only late in the day before Committee Stage.  The Second Stage of this Bill was concluded on 21 March and I am at odds to know why the Deputy waited all this time to <Col N="2245" /> table such an amendment.  There can hardly be reasonable examination when amendments of this kind are tabled so late.  I suggest that Deputy Woods knew we were listed to be in the House this morning and also this afternoon.  I regret the lateness of the amendment.  It is not fair to anyone, especially those of us on this side.</P>
      <P>I must oppose the amendment because I cannot see how the new section proposed would make any improvement to the section as drafted.  The section produces a perfectly reasonable rule as to the domicile of the minor child whose parents are living apart.  I need not repeat the explanation I gave on Second Stage.  In any event, the amendment is defective in two respects.  First, subsection (4) refers in two places to subsection (2) (a) but there is no subsection (2) (a).  I presume what is meant is subsection (3) (a).  More seriously, subsection (4) (b) in the amendment is contradicted by subsection (5). This is because subsection (5) preserves the present rule that the domicile of a minor whose father is dead is that of his mother but subsection (4) (b) provides that, in certain circumstances, such a minor's domicile shall be the domicile of his father, that is, the domicile of the father at the time of his death.  Admittedly, provisions as to family law are difficult to draft without making some errors or without leaving room for improvement, but this is another reason for allowing the House time to consider amendments.  As a matter of policy it seems right to preserve the rule that the domicile of a minor whose father is dead should be that of his mother though the child had the father's domicile up to the time of the father's death.  For that reason I ask the House to reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister might communicate with the Minister for Justice because he told me he wished to take first the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill and then these Bills later.  I was making preparation in that direction.  However at the weekend I was told that this Bill and the one dealing with nationality were being brought into the House this week, <Col N="2246" /> one following the other.  We do not have available to us all the resources to that kind of situation.  With both Bills being taken today there is particular difficulty for us on these benches.  Leaving that aside, that is how that came about.</P>
      <P>Obviously, for some other reason the Minister wants to leave his Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill aside for a while, and do not ask me the reason why.  I do not mind and I will respond as well as I can, but I can only do that within my own capacity.  That is the difficulty we have on this side.  The amendments were put down yesterday.  At least between yesterday and today there was some time.  The Minister had an amendment to the Nationality Bill which we received with the Bill yesterday morning.  Unfortunately, that is the way things happen on Committee Stage at times and it is not anybody's fault.  It is a matter of getting time in the House and getting people together.  The basic fault here this afternoon is not any of those things.  It is the fact that we are taking the Committee and Report Stages together.  I could leave the suggestions we have made in this amendment and say to the Minister of State: &ldquo;We have put our case and ideas to you.  Other Members have said that they think there is some value in what we are saying, even from your own side of the House.  Have a look at these and come back on Report Stage with your own format of amendment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter has stated that it is not usual to accept amendments from this side of the House.  It is usual to withdraw them in the light of the Minister of State showing some consideration for the points which have been made.  That is the normal procedure in this House.  This leaves the Minister of State to come back on Report Stage with her own amendment embracing this point and adding to the overall comprehensiveness of the Bill.  We are not able to do that now because of this order which insists that we take Report Stage with Committee Stage.  I take it that is the position?</P>

      <P>All remaining stages have to be taken at the end of this debate.  It is not even a question of the amount of time from now until 7 o'clock.  It is a question of the gap between 7 o'clock and Report Stage.  There is no gap between the two and that is awkward even from the Minister's point of view. Even if the Minister accepts arguments made in the House or is interested in them, she does not have the flexibility or the possibility of doing anything about them.  The Minister was foolish to allow the Whips to insist that these two should go through together.  If it was the Minister's own choice to do that, I think it was a foolish one.  It is not a good arrangement and it is not good for the House or the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>If we are to do the job of an Opposition, without the parliamentary draftsman and without the legal back-up which the Minister of State has available to her we can only put forward the best version we can on that basis.  The Minister of State would presumably consider this and come back having consulted the parliamentary draftsman and others.  The Minister will have had time to cogitate on it herself.  This was partly what Deputy Shatter was talking about.  It is not just a question of the parliamentary draftsman saying one thing or another.  The Minister has to consider whether what he might say is in the spirit of what the Minister of State and we on this side of the House want and whether there might not be a better way to meet it.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to subsection 4 (a) which states:</P>
      <P>The domicile of a minor whose mother is dead shall be that which she last had before she died if at her death the minor had her domicile by virtue of subsection 2 (a) of this section...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section should read (3) (a) as the numbers have been changed.  I presume the Minister would be able to make that change here on the spot without having to go anywhere else.  We can regard that as an amendment to subsection (2) (a) <Col N="2248" /> instead of subsection (3) (a) and it should not be a major undertaking.  The second point the Minister made was in relation to subsection (4) (b) which states:</P>
    <P>The domicile of a minor whose father is dead shall be that which he last had before he died if at the time of his death the minor had his domicile by virtue of subsection (2) (a)...</P>
    <P>If we read subsection (3) (a) for subsection (2) (a), we do not need to go to the parliamentary draftsman or the vast legal store of expertise to put the legal point right.  The position is quite clear.  If the Minister of State is suggesting she feels the domicile should not be regarded in that way, I do not see why it should not be.  Until the domicile is determined otherwise, then presumably it should be the domicile which the minor had at the time of the death of his father.  Obviously, this is a situation that needs to be examined. Presumably, the court which will deal with the case will have to look at the domicile of that minor again.  It may be that it will be suitable to have domicile with the mother in that event, or it may be that it might not be suitable to have domicile with the mother at all.  The court might have to make proposals in relation to that.  In any event, it seems reasonable that the domicile would be the domicile as stated here until otherwise determined. The point is to suggest that that is what the domicile would be until it is otherwise determined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot take very seriously Deputy Woods's comments which I regard as somewhat disingenous. On the Order of Business today I made the point that I felt we could not adequately deal with this Bill by completing both Committee and Report Stages on the one day.  It was Deputy Woods's own leader who indicated that he was agreeable to dealing with both Committee and Report Stages on the one day. As a backbencher I do not want to be caught in the crossfire of point scoring between the Government side and the front bench of the Opposition.  I do not <Col N="2249" /> believe this House can do a proper legislative job on legislation of this nature if the Whips on both sides of the House agree to have Committee and Report Stages on the one day.  That might suit everybody to get business through, and it can often suit an Opposition spokesman as much as it suits a Government Minister.</P>
      <P>The reality is that we are making a joke of the legislative process when we do that.  We do it too frequently.  This is a classic example.  There are things in this Bill which need to be teased out.  If it could be agreed by all sides that Report Stage could be taken on another day it could result in teasing out the problems we have in this Bill to the satisfaction of everybody both in achieving what the Minister would like to see achieved and in giving a degree of flexibility in dealing with this.  Of course, we may end up having that subsequently through the Seanad amending it when it would have to come back to us which only makes the process more long drawn out than is necessary.</P>
      <P>With a desire to speed things along one can often get there quicker walking than by running.  This is symptomatic of a problem that has been created by the Government and the Opposition front benches agreeing through their Whips to have this type of ridiculous procedure. The point the Minister of State makes about Deputy Woods's amendment referring to subsection 2 (a) instead for subsection 3 (a) is something which I noticed this morning when I read the Deputy's amendments.  I assumed that in a rational world &mdash; though rationality does not necessarily apply to what happens within this House &mdash; one could cope with amending that by subsection (2) (a) becoming subsection (3) (a).  I did not realise that would be the major issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods's amendment about the principal home makes it quite clear on whose domicile a child is dependent. The original section is very poorly drafted and does not help to clarify the provision. The general principle of what Deputy Woods proposes is correct.  In the <Col N="2250" /> absence of acrimony people can agree that subsection (2) (a) means subsection (3) (a).  Deputy Woods will probably say that when he was a Minister I used to come in here and get under his skin on occasions.  I am sorry if I am getting under the skin of a colleague by saying this. Government Ministers, Whips, or those sponsoring Bills, be they Private Members' Bills or Government Bills, agree that this House should take Committee Stage and Report Stage on the one day.  If sensible amendments are tabled to a Bill which deal with the subject matter of the Bill and on the assumption that some degree of expertise existed in the Department that drafted these measures, I presume it is not beyond the bounds of their ingenuity to explain the meaning of proposals or amendments so that the Minister is in a position to accept or reject them.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the approach that because this was tabled a bit late we cannot understand it and therefore we will put it on ice.  That is not the way Parliament should conduct its business. If we reject this amendment and if we cannot, by agreement on all sides, postpone Report Stage I have no doubt that this section will come back to this House to be amended after it is debated in the Seanad.  If it does not, then this section will do nothing to clarify the law and resolve the ambiguities that currently exist.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods stated that in some cases where the child's father is dead the court might have to make some arrangement.  A court cannot do anything about a child's domicile.  Much of the discussion has been about the Order of Business and the agreement of business.  Even though we have agreed to take all stages this afternoon, any valid or relevant points which arise will not be ignored and will be considered.  The great expertise and considerable experience of Deputy Shatter are extremely useful in these debates.  It is regrettable that we did not have his thinking on Second Stage when his points of view could have been <Col N="2251" /> taken on board and considered for this stage.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage various people made clear the problem in relation to a child having no home with his father and the difficulty that was created by that section.  It was suggested that there would be a need for tidying up in that area when it came to Committee Stage.  I mentioned that fact in my speech and I was surprised that the Minister did not take some action to tidy up that section and to make it clearer.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of Committee Stage and Report Stage, the Government order the business.  We are subject to that at all times.  I did not seek to have Committee Stage taken with Report Stage, especially when we had amendments down.  The proposal for this certainly did not come from this side of the House, whatever about the other arrangements about business.  Unfortunately, things become involved in the totality of arrangements about business, the conduct of business, what the Government will or will not do and what they will accept in terms of arrangements which are made.  There are very limited circumstances in which there can be no difference between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  Can I take it that subsection (3) (a) can be substituted for subsection (2) (a)?</P>

I would like to say to the Minister that there is a certain amount of agreement and support for that approach in the House and ask her to come back on Report Stage with her own proposal to deal with this matter. If this is Report Stage as well as Committee Stage, which it is, then I will press this amendment because I will not have another opportunity to do so.  I do not <Col N="2252" /> think this Bill should go to the Seanad without putting those matters right or they may change it and send it back to us again.

      <P>The point I made in replying to this amendment seems to have been missed by both Deputy Shatter and Deputy Woods.  Subsection (4) (b) in the amendment is contradicted by subsection (5).  This is because subsection (5) preserves the present rule that the domicile of a minor whose father is dead is that of his or her mother.  Subsection (4) (b) provides that in certain circumstances such a minor's domicile shall be the domicile which his or her father had at his death.  The policy behind the provision in the section is that there should be no change in the present legal position or common law whereby a minor takes the domicile of his father unless he or she has no home with his or her father.</P>
      <P>In regard to the inclusion in this amendment of &ldquo;principal home&rdquo; I do not think it would make any difference because it would still require a decision by the court to define the principal home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (5) was included to deal with the situation where an existing rule of law applies in which, by dependence, the minor's domicile would be that of the mother.  I was thinking of cases such as illegitimacy where the home of the natural mother is the basis for domicile.  The Minister says that that is in conflict with the other subsection. It is in so far as it applies to those cases.  Other cases which arise here are spelled out quite specifically.  One case as described in subsection (4) (b) is where the father is dead and the child has not since had a home with his mother. Whether it is necessary to provide further clarification could be a matter of drafting to make quite clear that it applies to other specific cases.  We are talking here about the existing rule of law, that the domicile of a minor is that of his father and we propose to substitute certain provisions, <Col N="2253" /> including that to deal with a case where the father is dead.</P>
      <P>It would take further examination and analysis to convince me that there is a major conflict in this case.  Subsection (5) of my amendment is intended to deal with a case where there is a direct relationship with the mother and it may be possible to clarify that further.  I think it is the right approach to take all these provisions as a group and it is a better alternative than the existing position.  I am very anxious that we make that point before the matter goes before the Seanad.  It would be preferable if the Minister would consider all these points and come back to us on Report Stage with her proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that the existing flaws are even greater.  Subsection (4) (b) of my amendment, No. 3, states:</P>
      <P>The domicile of a minor whose father is dead shall be that which he last had before he died if at the time of his death the minor had his domicile by virtue of subsection (2) (a) of this section and has not since had a home with his mother.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) of that amendment states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section shall not affect any <Col N="2254" /> existing rule of law as to the cases in which a minor's domicile is regarded as being, by dependence, that of his mother.</P>
    <P>There is a specific reference of dependence on his mother in subsection (5).  For instance, in the case of illegitimacy the dependence is directly on the natural mother.  I do not concede the degree of conflict the Minister appears to see in these subsections.  I am not the only one who recognises the difficulties arising from the section.  I can quote views given outside this House that state it is extremely badly drafted.  The opinion is that it is not a question of a possible minor conflict but that fundamentally it is badly drafted and that a different approach should be taken.  Most Deputies will have had a series of representations from outside groups who have taken legal opinion on the section.  They could point to the ambiguities and uncertainties that arise from phrases such as &ldquo;his home&rdquo;, &ldquo;a home&rdquo;, &ldquo;living apart&rdquo; and so on.  The general opinion seems to be that it compounds the confusion that already exists.</P>
    <P>We come back to the basic matter, namely, that if we had a Report Stage later the Minister could reconsider the matter before that time.  However, Report Stage will be taken at the conclusion of Committee Stage and in those circumstances as the proposal we have put forward is superior to that of the Minister I shall have to press the amendment.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The domicile of a minor who marries shall cease to be dependent on the domicile of either his father or mother and such minor shall acquire an independent domicile.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope that this is an amendment that can be agreed in that it follows on from the changes which have been made under the Bill.  Under the current law persons under the age of 18 years can marry with parental consent and persons under the age of 16 years can marry with the consent of the court.  The Oireachtas marital committee recommended that the age of 18 years should be the minimum age for marriage but that, in certain exceptional circumstances, persons between 16 and 18 years should be allowed to marry. It appears that that recommendation is going to be adopted as it is referred to in the Government's statement of intent as to future legislation that accompanied the release of the Bill for a divorce referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take it that a minor's domicile is normally dependent on that of his parents, without going into the difference between being dependent on a mother or a father, the problem we currently have and that is going to be with us after this legislation has been enacted is that if persons of 16 or 17 years of age marry, their domicile will remain dependent on that of their parents.  They will not be able to acquire an independent domicile of their own until they attain the age of 18 years.  To take an example, let us assume two 17-year-olds marry each other.  Under the current law, before a <Col N="2258" /> wife had an independent domicile, her domicile would be dependent on that of her husband and the 17 year-old-husband's domicile would be dependent on that of his father.  That is the effect of the current law.  It produced ridiculous consequences when the age of majority was 21 rather than 18.</P>
    <P>The consequences that it now can produce and the number of people it can affect would obviously be relatively small but as a minor under this legislation is presumably an 18-year-old, as a result of the reduction of the age of majority, now someone of 16 to 18 can currently marry and someone between 16 and 18, except in certain circumstances yet to be specified in new legislation, will still be allowed to marry.  It makes no sense to require that someone who has married has a domicile dependent on a parent.  If a 17-year-old girl marries a 25-year-old man her domicile is dependent on her parents.  If she was 19 she would preserve an independent domicile, the man under this legislation having independent domicile. If she is 17 when she marries her domicile will remain dependent on her father until she attains the age of 18.  If a 16-year-old girl marries a 25-year-old man and she and her new husband emigrate to Australia, instead of the girl acquiring an Australian domicile her domicile will remain dependent on that of her father.</P>
    <P>This is really a tidying up measure.  It should not give rise to any degree of excitement.  It is not a major issue.  It is not going to affect many people.  But I have a rather simplistic view which is that when we are dealing with legislation of this nature we might as well get it right and not leave legal ambiguities or oddities in existence simply because we have not contemplated them.  I would hope that would be something lacking in contention that is acceptable and could be incorporated within the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel this amendment is unnecessary because the position is that under the provisions of the Age of Majority Act, 1985, section 2, a minor who <Col N="2259" /> marries attains his or her majority. Therefore, he or she acquires the capacity to have an independent domicile.</P>

      <P>As far as the section as a whole is concerned the Minister has not given us her final view.  It has been pointed out on Second Stage, and again here, that there are confusing elements in this section.  I expected the Minister to clarify the position on Committee Stage and I was surprised she did not introduce any amendments.  She said this afternoon that she would consider amendments during the Seanad debate.  What exactly is her position on the section as it stands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of boring the House this has already been dealt with. The section has been debated and the issues raised have been addressed.  If there is any specific point the Deputy wishes to raise, perhaps he would tell the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the disagreement between the Minister and Deputy Woods is about whether Deputy Woods made a mistake in the amendment which was not supported by the House.  I ask the <Col N="2260" /> Minister to take on board the problem that arises from the absence of a reference to &ldquo;principal home&rdquo; in this provision. That is the major problem. Paragraph 4 (1) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>the minor then has his home with her and has no home with his father,</P>
      <P>We cannot change that paragraph today, but I urge the Minister to introduce an amendment in the Seanad.  Deputy Woods's amendment seems to have given rise to some difficulty and the Minister seems to be unwilling to adopt that formula. I urge that section 4 (1) (a) be amended in the Seanad to read that the minor has his principal home with the mother and the reference to having no home with the father should be deleted. That would clarify the section and make it work.  The absence of a change of that nature will leave this area of the law ambiguous and it will not be clear until a court has interpreted it.  That would be regrettable.  There are number of other matters which have to be gone through in this Bill and I do not intend to speak further on this section.  I urge the Minister to consider amending this paragraph as I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the main point I wanted to make.  If the Minister is not prepared to amend the section on the lines I have suggested, perhaps she would tell us if she intends to deal with the principal home which arises under subsection (1) (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised on all Stages of this Bill will be considered in the context of the Seanad debate but there is a difficulty with the principal home.  It is not easy to define.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe we can beneficially spend any more time on this section.  We have suggested what we regard as a more fundamental and better approach to this section as a whole, but the Minister is not disposed at this stage <Col N="2261" /> to adopt that approach.  She may consider this between now and the Seanad debate but there are clearly difficulties and confusion in the section as drafted.  The Minister said it was her intention to consider all the points made in the course of the Seanad debate.  We will have to wait and see what happens there.</P>
      <P>This highlights the point we have been making that it would be preferable if we had a separate Report Stage, irrespective of the gap between Committee and Report Stages.  The Minister would have an opportunity to consider the points made on Committee Stage and come back to this House with her proposals which, in a case like this, would probably be welcomed and passed quickly.  As I said, we will have to wait and see what happens between now and when this Bill is discussed in the Seanad.  On that basis we accept this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1)  The validity of a divorce, where one or both spouses were domiciled in the State, will only be recognised after the commencement of this Act if,</P>
      <P>(a)  both spouses were domiciled in the State in which the decree was granted, or</P>
      <P>(b)  one of the spouses was domiciled in the jurisdiction in which the divorce was granted and&mdash; (i)  the other spouse submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court or tribunal which granted the said divorce, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  the divorce was not obtained for the purpose of evading the laws in force at the time the said divorce was granted, in the State where the spouse referred to in <Col N="2262" /> paragraph (b) (i) of subsection (1) was domiciled.</P>
    <P>(2)  The onus of proving that paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section applies in any case shall rest on the party seeking recognition of the validity of the divorce in question.</P>
    <P>(3)  In the case where neither spouse is domiciled in the State, a divorce shall be recognised if, although not granted in the jurisdiction where either spouse is domiciled, it is recognised in the jurisdiction or jurisdictions where the spouses are domiciled.</P>
    <P>(4)  This section shall only apply to a divorce granted after the commencement of this Act.</P>
    <P>(5)  Nothing in this section shall affect a ground on which a court may refuse to recognise a divorce, other than such a ground related to the question whether a spouse is domiciled in a particular jurisdiction, or whether the divorce is recognised in a jurisdiction where a spouse is domiciled.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>`divorce' means divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii,</i></P>
    <P>`domiciled' means domiciled at the date of the granting of a divorce;</P>
    <P>`State' means the area over which the laws enacted by the Parliament established by <i>Bunreacht na h-Éireann</i> have effect.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the recognition of foreign divorces.  Subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>For the rule of law that a divorce is recognised if granted in a country where both spouses are domiciled, there is hereby substituted a rule that a divorce shall be recognised if granted in the country where either spouse is domiciled.</P>
    <P>We agree with the Minister in relation to the independent domicile of a woman. Our amendment will make the recognition of foreign divorces in this country easier.  It replaces common domicile with <Col N="2263" /> either domiciled and for the rule of law, divorce is granted where both spouses are domiciled.  This was to be a protection for the family and the spouses.</P>
    <P>We all know how this operated. Because the wife's domicile was dependent on the husband it was possible for him to go to a foreign country for a divorce and claim that the wife's domicile was a foreign country because hers was a dependent domicile.  The rule of law at present is that both spouses should be domiciled in a foreign country and that rule covered the case I have just mentioned, but that is being changed by the Minister.  She is introducing a rule that divorce will be recognised if granted in the country where either spouse is domiciled. The first wording was unjust to the woman who was at home, and could be seen to be unjust to her in certain circumstances but now, instead of doing away with that potential injustice, we are going to replace common domicile with the domicile of either of the parties.  As I said, at present this can operate as an injustice to the wife.  The Bill proposes to retain this injustice to the wife and to extend it to the husband.  It is retaining the situation that arose because of the anomalous position whereby the wife was dependent on the husband, therefore this general rule of law in effect did not have to operate as far as the wife was concerned. This Bill is going to extend a similar provision to the husband.</P>
    <P>To deal with that we have introduced this amendment to put in a new section instead of section 5 to provide that:</P>
    <P>(1)  The validity of a divorce, where one or both spouses were domiciled in the State, will only be recognised after the commencement of this Act if,</P>
    <P>(a)  both spouses were domiciled in the State in which the decree was granted, or</P>
    <P>That is if the original intention of the rule of law which applies at the moment was met, in other words both spouses are domiciled in the State in which the decree was granted, and <Col N="2264" /> (b)  one of the spouses was domiciled in the jurisdiction in which the divorce was granted and&mdash;  (i)  the other spouse submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court or tribunal which granted the said divorce, and</P>
    <P>This second spouse is still resident here and the husband, say, goes off to England or wherever, claims his domicile is there, establishes domicile there and then applies for a divorce which relates to his partner who is here.  We are proposing that the other spouse would have to submit to the jurisdiction of the court or tribunal which granted the divorce. Paragraph (b) (ii) states:</P>
    <P>(ii)  the divorce was not obtained for the purpose of evading the laws in force at the time the said divorce was granted, in the State where the spouse referred to in paragraph (b) (i) of subsection (1) was domiciled.</P>
    <P>It should not be possible for either the husband or wife to go off unilaterally to a foreign jurisdiction and claim a divorce without the other partner here consenting to recognise or submitting to the jurisdiction of the court or tribunal which is granting the said divorce.  That was meant to pertain up to this time but because of the wife's dependent domicile it has not pertained as far as she was concerned.  It pertained where a wife went away.  If a wife goes over to England that would be difficult because her domicile is dependent on the husband anyway, but if she could establish her domicile there she would still have to relate to the fact that the husband should be domiciled in England also if the divorce was to be granted or considered.  The Minister is making it quite clear that that divorce will be recognised if granted in the country where either spouse is domiciled, so it is an open situation without safeguards for the spouse who is still here.</P>
    <P>What kind of safeguards will apply in the circumstances created here? Deputy Shatter in amendment No. 8 to section 6 is concerned about the same situation, <Col N="2265" /> perhaps in a different way.  He is concerned about the making of adequate provision for the spouse who is here and that in any arrangements made in any divorces granted these provisions would be made and the people properly catered for.  What plans and proposals has the Minister to protect, guard and vindicate the spouse and family who are here when either spouse can go to a foreign domicile and get a divorce without the other spouse having to submit to the jurisdiction?</P>
    <P>In our amendment, subsection (2) provides that:</P>
    <P>The onus of proving that paragraph (a)  of subsection (1) of this section applies in any case shall rest on the party seeking recognition of the validity of the divorce in question.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is to place the onus of proof on the party who is seeking the divorce. Our amendment continues:</P>
    <P>(3)  In a case where neither spouse is domiciled in the State, a divorce shall be recognised if, although not granted in the jurisdiction where either spouse is domiciled, it is recognised in the jurisdiction or jurisdictions where the spouses are domiciled.</P>
    <P>This is to cover a situation where neither spouse is domiciled in the State and both are out of the State.  It is a question of recognition in that instance.  The number of people who might be affected by this would presumably be very small.  For instance, a multinational director from, say, California, whose wife is from Canada gets a divorce in London and we would recognise that provided it is recognised in either one of their jurisdictions. I do not know how many multinational directors here might find themselves in that situation but I put that as an example of the sort of thing that can happen.  The amendment continues:</P>
    <P>(4)  This section shall only apply to a divorce granted after the commencement of this Act.</P>
    <P>(5)  Nothing in this section shall <Col N="2266" /> affect a ground on which a court may refuse to recognise a divorce, other than such a ground related to the question whether a spouse is domiciled in a particular jurisdiction, or whether the divorce is recognised in a jurisdiction where a spouse is domiciled.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the definitions area which relates to subsection (7) of the Minister's proposal and we propose under subsection (6) that in this section:</P>
    <P>`divorce' means divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i>;</P>
    <P>`domiciled' means domiciled at the date of the granting of a divorce;</P>
    <P>The Minister's provision is &ldquo;domiciled at the date of the institution of the proceedings for divorce&rdquo;.  There could be a difference between these two and perhaps the Minister will comment on that.  We feel that the date of the granting of the divorce should be the relevant time.</P>
    <P>The final point we have added which the Minister has not got at present is:</P>
    <P>`State' means the area over which the laws enacted by the Parliament established by <i>Bunreacht na h-Éireann</i> have effect.</P>
    <P>That is the amendment we are proposing. The proposal which the Minister is making in this section is that a divorce would be recognised if granted in the country where either spouse is domiciled, and in simple terms it means that either the husband or the wife can establish a domicile in England or somewhere else and this divorce would be recognised here notwithstanding the fact that the other partner may not have been aware of the circumstances of the granting of the divorce.  It has been clearly seen that the present situation operates against the interests of the wife and can do her an injustice.  The Minister's proposal does not seem to guard either spouse in these circumstances and could create a possible injustice to either spouse or the family. What safeguards does the Minister propose in this area if she is not willing to accept our amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will remember that on Second Stage of the debate this section evoked the most robust comments from all sides of the House and many Deputies were worried regarding the effect it would have on the spouse left behind, so to speak, when his or her partner got a divorce in another country.  We agree, as Deputy Woods said, with the concept of the removal of dependency but as it is the woman from whom the divorce is obtained in two out of three cases, how does the Minister propose to safeguard the rights of a spouse from whom a divorce has been sought and given in another country without the other spouse having any say in the matter? The underlying thrust of the Bill is to enhance the status of women by removing the element of dependency but if is a pity that in many instances it will take away from a woman's status because her rights under the Succession Act, Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, will be affected if a divorce is obtained without her consent.  I speak as if the abandoned spouse is a woman but, naturally, it would be the same in the case of a man.  Because the thrust of the Bill is to elevate the status of women it seems strange that this section will have opposite effect and will mean that the rights of women domiciled in Ireland from whom divorces have been obtained abroad will be undermined.  I hope the Minister will comment on women's rights in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to revive an old argument that took place on a Private Members' Bill introduced by the Opposition Party but the amendment introduced by Deputy Woods is a re-hash of the principal proposal relating to recognition of foreign divorces except using the domicile term instead of the habitual residence term.  It would not necessarily provide protection for dependent wives or husbands, if implemented, it would result in considerable ambiguity as to whether particular divorces were recognised in the context of section 5 (1) (b) which I believe is unworkable and would create a great <Col N="2268" /> number of problems for many people.  I have no doubt that the Minister has a lengthy brief as to why it is unworkable, I do not have to do that job for her, no doubt she will do it herself.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Woods raised a more fundamental issue in this context because everybody is concerned about the recognition of foreign divorces and the consequences for dependent wives and children and, indeed, for dependent husbands.  I regret that the Bill does not deal with that in any detail. My amendment is an essential one which would ensure that following the granting of a foreign decree of divorce, a dependent wife and children would still preserve their rights to go to the Irish courts where necessary to obtain maintenance for their support and protection for their position within the family home because, if a foreign decree of divorce is currently recognised, as it may be, or following the passing of this Bill is recognised here, the effect of the recognition of a foreign decree of divorce is under current law to eliminate the rights which a party to the marriage has to seek maintenance support under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  It is also to terminate a property which has been the family home being properly called a family home within the definition of that term under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, which can create real problems.  We need to deal with the consequences and I do not think that Deputy Woods amendment helps because it creates considerable ambiguity as to whether some divorces are recognisable or not.  If the principal wage earner, presumably the husband, is living permanently outside the jurisdiction of these courts, it does not necessarily assist the wife to tell her that her divorce is not recognised.  We may assist her by ensuring that she has financial protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will be in a position to indicate, if not here then in the Seanad, whether the protections which I think are necessary can be provided.  It is interesting to note that we have not tackled this problem in the House and it was not tackled in the Private Members' <Col N="2269" /> Bill tabled by the Opposition Party before Christmas.  Curiously, a country which we frequently criticise in this area but which can sometimes be more aware of the problems which exist are now addressing the problems in the West-minister Parliament in the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act, 1984.  It is regrettable that the Bill does not deal with the consequences of the recognition of foreign divorce decrees for dependent spouses and children along the lines which I propose in amendment No. 8.</P>

      <P>The objections raised mainly by Deputy Woods and Deputy O'Rourke on the grounds that it would create an injustice to a wife in relation to her husband getting a divorce in England without her consent apply under the present law.  Deputy Shatter and Deputy O'Rourke referred to what one would call ancillary orders subsequent to and in recognition of foreign divorces.  I am aware that an amendment dealing with that was ruled out but it was worthy of consideration.  It will have to be considered in the future because of the terms of the new rules that will follow the passage of this Bill and in the context of the Government's statement of intent to bring in new legislation on family law dependent on the outcome of the referendum. I should like to assure the Deputies that this matter is not being overlooked or ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Woods that there are serious defects in his amendment.  At the beginning the amendment refers to where one or both spouses were domiciled in Ireland and goes on to refer to cases where both spouses were domiciled in another country.  One cannot be domiciled in two countries.  Moreover, the amendment fails to provide a general rule to replace the present rule that a divorce is recognised in the State if it is granted in the country where the spouse is domiciled. The Government's Bill does this in section 5 (1) which provides that divorce shall be recognised if it is granted in the country where either of the spouses is domiciled.  There is no corresponding provision in the amendment and the <Col N="2270" /> omission is fatal.  The amendment should be rejected for this reason, if for no other.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that, where one of the spouses is domiciled in the State and divorce is granted in the country in which the other spouse is domiciled, the divorce will be recognised in the State only if the spouse who is domiciled in the State &ldquo;submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court or tribunal which granted the said divorce&rdquo; and &ldquo;the divorce was not obtained for the purpose of evading the laws in force...in the State&rdquo;.  There are at least three objections of substance to this rule.  First, the result of the amendment would be that divorce which would be recognised under the present law, and the Bill, would not be recognised under the amendment.  I shall give a simple example of a couple who are domiciled and living in the State, the wife deserts or leaves the husband and goes to live with another man somewhere else in the State while the husband moves to England and becomes domiciled there.  If he or she gets a divorce in England it will be recognised here under the present law and under the Bill.  Under the amendment if the husband obtained a divorce in England the wife could veto the recognition of the divorce here by simply refraining from submitting to the jurisdiction of the English court.  That would be a wholly unacceptable restriction of the present law.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is no definition, as I mentioned, of the idea of submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts which is rather vague.  Finally, the requirement that the divorce should not have been obtained for the purpose of evading Irish law is too vague.  The purpose of obtaining a divorce is surely to end a marriage. What Irish law would it be evading? There is nothing in Irish law to prohibit a person from seeking a divorce abroad. With regard to the points about protection of safeguards, I should like to point out that where applications are made for divorce in England it is broadly the experience that notice of proceedings of the case have to be given to the other spouse.  Every effort is made to give this notice of proceedings.  Where the wife's <Col N="2271" /> abode is known the matter is simple but, if not, other means are attempted.  It would be possible for the wife to go to England and contest the divorce, make her claim for maintenance, payments or settlement of property in the courts there.  In that way she could have the facility for presenting herself and making her case.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recognition of a foreign divorce I should like to refer to section 5 (6) which states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall affect a ground on which a court may refuse to recognised a divorce, other than such a ground related to the question whether a spouse is domiciled in a particular country, or whether the divorce is recognised in a country where a spouse is domiciled.</P>
    <P>It is for the courts here to decide whether a foreign divorce should be recognised and whether all the requirements have been adequately and properly fulfilled in getting that divorce.  There is nothing automatic about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expressed the view clearly that our amendment would, in effect, give a wife a veto unless she consents.  The Minister said that new, improved and comprehensive legislation and safeguards are expected to follow the referendum although we argue that they should be introduced in advance of the referendum.  Deputy Shatter's approach appears to be along those lines because he said those protections should exist.  I accept that Deputy Shatter does not agree with our approach to this issue.  We are proposing to give a wife that veto until the measures are introduced to provide the safeguards like those mentioned by Deputy Shatter.  Is amendment No. 8 in order?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter seems anxious to provide the type of protection that is needed for the family in these <Col N="2272" /> circumstances.  We are saying to the Government: &ldquo;If you are to bring in these new protections why not leave the veto with the spouse who is here, whether the husband or the wife, until the safeguards are introduced?&rdquo; The Minister has said that in most cases it will be the wife and everybody seems to agree that in practical terms that will be the case.  The Minister said the wife will receive notice of proceedings but that person may not be in a position to pursue the matter and contest the divorce.</P>
      <P>We are concerned that the Minister appears to be opening another door.  She is saying the injustice applies to the wife at present and that we should not be worried if she wants to extend this injustice to the husband as well.  I accept that it is a form of equality but it is not the type of equality one wants to have.  If it is an injustice to the wife we should be providing the same cover and protection for both cases.  We are bound to provide that protection under the Constitution. We are debating this issue while a wider debate in regard to the whole question of divorce is going on outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, what will be the position <i>vis-á-vis</i> all of the types of arrangements to which Deputy Shatter referred? He mentioned that similar arrangements were made in the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act of 1984 in the United Kingdom.  In this respect I presume subsection 9 (2) (h) would be relevant, in other words, the length of time which has elapsed since the date of the divorce.  Then subparagraph (g) relates to the extent to which any order made under section 6 is likely to be enforceable. These kinds of safeguards bring one to the reality of what will happen in such circumstances.  For instance, the phrase &ldquo;the length of time which has elapsed since the date of the divorce&rdquo; means, presumably, that the court in particular will have regard to the length of time which has elapsed since the divorce, that there may be a cut-off point at that stage, with no further support or protection afforded thereafter in relation to maintenance or whatever.  We must take into account these cut-off points where the <Col N="2273" /> family will be left without practical support, when they will then be thrown onto the State.</P>
    <P>We would be anxious to have safeguards to protect the arrangements relating to the family home, dependent children, maintenance and the other matters which have been raised already, to ensure that such safeguards existed.  Until such time as those safeguards can be clearly shown to be applicable perhaps the Minister would accept at least the spirit of our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up two points the Minister made.  One was that under the provisions of this Bill the woman &mdash; if it were known where she was living &mdash; would be informed of the court proceedings and could then move accordingly if she so wished.  In practical terms that might not always be possible. For example, she may live in a remote country area, in a town in which there is no legal aid or, if there was, its application could be sparse.  Out of sheer inability to cope with the problem she might give up, which happens in many cases.  I sincerely mean what I say, that the Minister is doing women and injustice if she does not take on board the spirit of our amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the position obtaining prior to the introduction of this Bill is that the woman is discriminated against.  Surely one can fairly expect that the aim of any legislation would be to materially alter for the better the position of the person seen to be disadvantaged? Therefore any provision that would militate against such a person is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister has referred to the proposals outlined by the Government which would come into force as well as the referendum proposals, such as the family courts and all the various supports for families mentioned, it should be remembered that they are very much in the future.  We had hoped that they would come about prior to the debate.  In the meantime this Bill, when enacted, will be the legislation of the land and of the day to be observed.  In the Bill before us I <Col N="2274" /> still maintain that a woman's property rights, those to the family home, that all of those rights will not be assured at all. Perhaps during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad the Minister would give this issue consideration.  It is one which carries disadvantages in the main for women when surely the purpose of the legislation was quite the opposite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would reiterate that this is a minimal measure, to get rid of the very offensive concept of dependent domicile.  The Deputy will accept that that could not be done alone because it would leave a <i>lacuna</i> in the law.  As it is at present, with dependent domicile, at least it is clear cut.  When we change that it will not be so clear cut.  Therefore it would be irresponsible of us not to introduce the new rules we have under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the points being made with regard to the need for the protection of spouses with a close connection with Ireland in this context.  There is no provision in the Bill that would empower a court here to make an ancillary order to protect a spouse with a close connection with Ireland in relation to such matters as maintenance, the family home or barring orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage some Deputies pointed out that the recognition of a foreign divorce obtained by a spouse can have the effect of depriving her, or indeed him &mdash; because let us remember we will have a number of women establishing domicile in other jurisdictions and succeeding in divorce petitions &mdash; of protection under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976. It is not clear if this is a correct interpretation of the law in all cases.  For example, in certain circumstances our courts have implemented maintenance orders relating to foreign divorce decrees.  The reason there is no provision in this Bill is that it is a minimal measure only.  The inclusion of the kind of provision for ancillary orders which has been highlighted would represent a substantial extension of the measure which would be <Col N="2275" /> outside the scope of the Bill, as determinned by the Long Title.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, in their working paper on the recognition of foreign divorces and legal separations, acknowledged that the issues raised by the question of orders ancillary to the foreign divorce decree, go well beyond the limit context of recognition of foreign divorces.  These issues, which are referred to in the last paragraph of the appended extract from the working paper, have not been analysed and were not considered in the proposals submitted to Government in connection with the proposals for reform of the law of domicile of married women.</P>
    <P>As the purpose of giving the courts discretionary power to make ancillary orders would be to make provision for a divorce dependent on the spouse having a close connection with Ireland, the question of the nature of such provisions can hardly be isolated from similar questions of policy that arise in connection with the question of introducing our own divorce jurisdiction.  Accordingly, there are good reasons for awaiting the outcome of the debate on the domestic divorce issue before making provision for ancillary matters in relation to foreign divorces. On Second Stage it was not so apparent; it is now more apparent.  In any event, any proposal to empower the Irish courts to make provision for maintenance and for occupation of what was the family home in the case of a man and woman who are considered by Irish law to be no longer married would raise difficult questions, including questions as to what should be the scope of the provision and as to enforcement which could not be satisfactorily decided in the course of the passage of a Bill with the limited purpose of abolishing the domicile of dependency of married women and making the necessary consequential changes for recognition of foreign divorces.  However, any problem there may be will not be a new one; it exists already &mdash; where, for example, husbands have gone to England, <Col N="2276" /> become domiciled there, fulfilled all the requirements and had that divorce recognised here.  We have that situation at present.</P>
    <P>Dr. Woods: We are aware that that exists and can operate as an injustice particularly to the wife.  We are all agreed on that.  However, we feel there is an onus on us to give a veto to the wife until adequate safeguards are introduced here to protect the spouse who is left at home here, the family home and the dependent children. The essence of our concern is that the spouse is remaining here and maintaining the home and the children &mdash; normally it is the wife &mdash; until adequate provision is made in law to protect them and to ensure their interests will be properly looked after in any decisions made in foreign courts, and we are reluctant to go along with this provision.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think it is constitutionally correct today and that it will be correct under the Constitution we may have in two months, though it may turn out that the Constitution then will be the same as now to put through an Act under whose provisions one spouse can go abroad and take this step, and that such a divorce would be recognised in our jurisdiction? Let us not forget the husband can do it now because of the dependent domicile of the wife.  The Minister is saying we are creating a position in which the family can be broken up by Act of the Oireachtas, because if one party goes abroad the State will recognise such a foreign divorce.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister taken advice on this and does she think it would be constitutionally acceptable at present? It is effectively tantamount to both spouses going abroad, but because of independent domicile it will be only the husband going abroad, in law.  When the Minister makes a declaration in this regard it will be recognised as declaring that if either spouse domiciled abroad gets a divorce abroad that would be recognised here in law.  Would that come into conflict with the Constitution, having regard to the <Col N="2277" /> inalienable rights of the family? Will the Minister let us know what her view is in that respect?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make brief reference to the comments made by the Minister in regard to the consequences of recognising a foreign decree of divorce. The Minister was right when she said that currently if a foreign decree of divorce is recognised the consequences for a wife in Ireland would be that her right to maintenance in the Irish courts would collapse, her right to protection under the Family Home Protection Act would collapse? Would her rights to a barring order go? Would her rights to take an injunction in the courts remain?</P>
      <P>That is not as fundamental a problem as the other two aspects.  Though I favour the Bill because it provides a more rational rule of recognition, I am afraid its effects will be to accept the consequences of loss of maintenance rights, family home protection rights, equally to both husband and wife &mdash; both would be put in an equally difficult position.  I do not accept the Minister's statement that this is an issue to be left over to a later stage until the divorce issue has been dealt with by way of referendum, or until other issues will be dealt with in future legislation.  The Minister seemed to indicate that she is prepared to consider the amendments I tabled but which are not now up for discussion.  They would provide maintenance and protection in the family home.  Would she consider them when this Bill is going through the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we have constitutional changes or not, we still have a problem in regard to recognition of foreign divorces. That problem will not be solved by people getting divorces in England where the courts can make orders of ancillary protection. There are wives in Ireland now whose husbands have been divorced in the US, in Canada, in Germany and in various other countries, all of which divorces may be recognised in current law.  All of these wives find their rights cut out and not all of them can afford to be represented in those foreign countries <Col N="2278" /> in order to secure ancillary orders in regard to divorces brought in those countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke touched briefly on this.  There is a gross deficiency in our legal aid system.  We do not provide legal aid to assist wives to obtain legal advice and legal representation in foreign countries where husbands are seeking divorces. Some Irish wives obtain foreign legal aid from those countries, but in some countries that is not available and as a result the wives are left in considerable difficulty.</P>
    <P>As somebody who sees these problems daily I would not accept that the consequences of recognition, because we have had a problem of this kind for many years, can be lived with even if it gets worse.  The problem is that this is the first Bill since the foundation of the State even touching on this matter.  My experience in the House has led me to be supremely cynical as to the speed at which likely additional reforms will be introduced following the enactment of an original Bill, particularly because of the time it has taken to get this Bill to appear.  All parties in the House are at fault for that.</P>
    <P>I hope the type of proposals contained in the amendments I tabled can be provided and implemented in the context of this Bill, which is separate and apart from having a domestic divorce jurisdiction. This Bill is the only means of providing real financial and property protection and assistance for dependent spouses. Under current law such spouses do not have the facility to obtain orders relating to property or support in foreign jurisdictions where decrees of divorce have been granted.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle adopted the attitude that this is not within the scope of the Bill, but the effect of this is that it has certain consequences because current law eliminates maintenance and Family Home Protection Act rights, and the reform in this Bill will retain that situation and make it even a little worse.  It is not the Minister's fault that current law does it, but why can we not deal with this in a comprehensive, sensitive way? Why <Col N="2279" /> must we have only piecemeal bits of legislation that fail to take a broad view of what is necessary to make legislation workable? Why can we not have a Bill that will deal with the overall problems people outside face whose marriages are dissolved by foreign courts?</P>
    <P>I have long since held views on dependent domicile and I welcome its going but, in all fairness, for the majority of wives whether they have dependent or independent domicile is a fine debating point at tea parties of well-heeled ladies discussing social problems academically.</P>
    <P>The wife who has obtained a divorce does not care if her divorce is recognised because she has an independent domicile. However, the dependent wife who is divorced and has children is interested in her future financial security and her security in the family home.  The real substance of the problem relates to an issue on which this Bill does not touch. We are dealing with a wonderfully refined issue for ladies' clubs to debate.  I am not diminishing its importance, but it is a good deal less important than the impact recognition has currently under the law on the lives of many people.  This Bill does not make it unique in that regard. It is a shame that we cannot deal with that issue in this context today.  If not, I suggest, with all due respect to the Minister, that it is something which could be dealt with in the Seanad when the Minister's Department have had time to consider the amendments in this area which have been tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the consequential legislation mentioned by the Minister has been brought about &mdash; and that will take some time &mdash; the Bill cannot stand on its own.  It has very far reaching consequential effects.  These should have been considered and discussed at length when the Bill was being formulated, but that has not happened.  Until the improvements in family law mentioned by the Minister come about, would it not be better to take the very short term view and allow the retention to the spouse who has been left of the right of veto on <Col N="2280" /> whether the divorce is to be recognised? That would seem to bring about the least damage now.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods spoke about the husband going to England, becoming domiciled there and getting a divorce.  I do not know if the Deputy realises that if the husband is in England and his wife is in Ireland she can sue from here for a divorce.  That is possible under the existing situation of dependent domicile. Either the husband or the wife who is living here can obtain a divorce in England which will be recognised here if he fulfils the necessary requirements of the British jurisdiction.  Only a court will then say if this is constitutional but we can see no reason to doubt that it would be.</P>
      <P>On the further issues, I suggest to Deputy O'Rourke that we would not have the powers to dictate to a foreign court on whether they should veto the divorce if the wife does not consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be impossible to enforce even if we felt it to be desirable.  May I remind Deputies that we are talking about limited legislation brought in for reasons which have not to do with ladies' tea parties, I suggest, but to do with a UN Convention and a longstanding grievance which women and very many fair-minded men have had about this offensive concept of dependent domicile which all married women shared.  It is not just a fanciful issue; it is a very serious one for many women. Consequent on changing that concept we are obliged to bring in new rules for recognising foreign divorces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the entire Bill, it would be ludicrous to buy a greyhound and then regret that it is not an elephant. This is effectively a limited Bill.  It could <Col N="2281" /> not and does not deal with the issues about which I and the Government care and which will not be abandoned.  I take Deputy Shatter's proposals and welcome having a chance to examine them.  I know they have been ruled out, but they came in very late last evening and I have been in the House all today and have not had a chance to examine them.  I am very happy to have them and certainly they will be examined because this is an issue to which we shall have to address ourselves. However, we will not be doing so in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised concerns the fact that once a foreign divorce is recognised the various rights collapse in relation to the family home, maintenance and so forth.  I am surprised Deputy Shatter's amendment has been ruled out of order but I had better not get into disagreement with the Chair on that subject. I saw this amendment as a mirror image of what is contained in our amendment and, until such time as adequate provision is made, the Minister might accept our amendment.  We believe that the Irish family and spouse should have a veto, to some extent at least, on the degree to which they will have to submit to the foreign jurisdiction until adequate safeguards are introduced for maintenance, dependent children and the family home, for instance.</P>
      <P>This is not always something which happens across the water, or far away. Questions can arise such as the family home and the right to continue to reside in it.  That is one of the aspects covered in the Family Home Protection Act of 1976.  Under that Act the wife &mdash; as the case will usually be &mdash; enjoys the protection of the home.  She cannot be put out of the home under section 5 of that Act which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where it appears to the court, on the application of a spouse, that the other spouse is engaging in such conduct as may lead to the loss of any interest in the family home or may render it unsuitable for habitation as a family home with the intention of <Col N="2282" /> depriving the applicant spouse or a dependent child of the family of his residence in the family home, the court may make such order as it considers proper, directed to the other spouse or to any other person, for the protection of the family home in the interest of the applicant spouse or such child.</P>
    <P>Will that protection still apply once the foreign divorce has been recognised?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There will clearly then be a loss of that protection and, as Deputy Shatter said, these rights will collapse. Have we, as the Oireachtas, the right to interfere in this way with the spouse here in Ireland in the family home who is trying to bring up the dependent children? Have we a right to make arrangements which will result in the collapse of the protection provided under that Act? On a wider basis, from the constitutional point of view the Minister has said that, as far as she understands, it would be consistent with the Constitution to make these arrangements &mdash; arrangements which could be quite damaging to families here.  As far as the Minister's advice goes, that would be consistent with the Constitution and if not, test cases could be brought to the courts and sorted out there.  I had hoped that the Minister would have made a more comprehensive statement about the constitutionality of the change proposed in this Bill and her conviction that it is consistent with the Constitution, because this is a question that one must contemplate.  Instead, in a kind of offhand way she told us that so far as advice goes it appears that the change would be constitutional.  There is not much more we can say about this section.  I do not know how the Seanad can consider Deputy Shatter's amendment if we are not to be allowed consider it here formally.  Nevertheless, it puts the question fairly comprehensively in relation to this whole area.  Deputy Shatter has mentioned particularly Nos. 8, 9, 10 and 11 as areas that need to be covered.  Perhaps we have elucidated <Col N="2283" /> those so far as possible in the circumstances in which we find ourselves at this point but I assure the Minister that these are the kinds of matters that concern us now and that we consider that the Government's decision as proposed in section 5 is in effect condoning the injustice that applies now and extending it to both spouses.  This is not desirable.  It is particularly undesirable if the Minister does not intend bringing in in parallel the safeguards which should be applied to these cases of foreign divorces, even to the extent to which notification and consent are required.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter raised the question of legal aid.  We know that there is a shortage in this area even for civil cases here, but we are talking in this instance of cases that are in conflict with the family here and which are being taken outside the jurisdiction.  The Minister is adopting a very open approach by way of recognising that either spouse can establish a domicile elsewhere.  That approach could be very damaging to Irish families and, in particular, as we know from practice, to many Irishwomen.  The section is not in any way adequate to deal with that and the Minister if not disposed to accept our amendment in the short term and if she is not prepared to bring in more comprehensive controls and safeguards relating to this area, the proposal is too limited to deal with the very practical and real situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the point made by Deputy Shatter that while we can say it is nice theoretically to establish independent domicile &mdash; we are all agreed on that &mdash; we are talking of an area of very complex and difficult problems.  The Deputy is familiar with the area of marital breakdown and foreign divorces.  He deals with <Col N="2284" /> such cases on a day-to-day basis so he can appreciate the need for safeguards and controls.  We can only ask the Minister now to consider the various points made this afternoon.  Because she will not be coming back to the House with the Report Stage, the only other context in which she can consider the various points is during the deliberations in the Seanad so we must trust her to consider the questions that have been raised.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned now we must adhere to our basic position, that is, that until these protections are introduced, the Minister should maintain some degree of control on the part of the spouse in Ireland.  We are open to listening to what kinds of controls might be operated.  I appreciate that the control we are suggesting represents, as the Minister says, a veto on the part of the wife, particularly in the matter of the protection of her family and family rights when a foreign divorce is being considered. This amounts to a kind of veto in at least that the spouse here must submit to the foreign jurisdiction but if the Minister wishes to put forward something which provides another kind of control, we will be happy to listen to her.</P>
    <P>This takes us to the question of providing the safeguards that are necessary irrespective of whether any change is made as a result of the forthcoming referendum but perhaps even more so if the referendum is passed.  Therefore, there is a great urgency about providing the safeguards.  In that context one can appreciate the certain sense of frustration expressed by Deputy Shatter.  I am happy to participate in any measure that will lead to the protection of the family in that way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (4), lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;it is recognised in the country or countries where the spouses are domiciled&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;it is recognised in a country in which either spouse is domiciled.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The provision in subsection (4) seems to give legislative force to what is believed to be currently the law as a result of a very old court case called Armitage versus the Attorney General at the beginning of this century at which it was decided by an English court that, if a decree of divorce was granted in a foreign country and if that divorce was recognised by the country of the domicile of the couple who obtained it, then it would also be recognised by English law.  That is believed to be the case in Ireland also.  The provision in the Bill seeks to make that part of our law formally and statutorily.  It is welcome to the degree that it makes the law certain.  The provision contained in the Bill does not seem to have modernised it or brought it into keeping with the actual reform introduced by the Bill.  The decision in that case was made on the basis of reciprocity, on the basis that the English courts would normally recognise a decree of divorce granted in the place where the couple were domiciled.  It made sense if the couple obtained a divorce in a foreign country in which they were not domiciled but it was recognised by the law of the domicile in which they resided.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to provide the same degree of reciprocity in the context of the new situation that would come about on the enactment of this Bill.  It seems that the provision as phrased would require that the foreign decree of divorce would be recognised in the country of the parties common domicile.  My proposal is that if a foreign decree of divorce is granted to a couple and if it is recognised in the place of domicile of either spouse we should also recognise it. We are now making it law that we will recognise a decree of divorce if either spouse obtained it in a country in which they were domiciled.  In that case we should also recognise a decree of divorce obtained elsewhere if it is recognised by the country in which either spouse is domiciled.  It does not make sense to preserve the common domicile rule.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to this so as to provide a uniform system of recognition of foreign divorces.</P>

      <P>This amendment is opposed.  The provision in subsection (4) deals with a situation where the divorce is not granted in a country where either spouse is domiciled.  Nevertheless it provides that the divorce will be recognised if it is recognised under the laws of the domicile of both spouses.  The amendment would allow recognition in Ireland if the divorce is recognised under the law of domicile of one spouse and not the other.  This is a much wider rule.  Since we are concerned with a case where neither spouse is domiciled in the country granting the divorce, it is right to take a more restrictive view as to when the divorce should be recognised in the State and to insist as a precondition that the divorce should be recognised by the laws of the domicile of both parties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 28 and 29, to delete subsection (5) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> (5)  This section shall apply to a divorce granted in divorce proceedings initiated after the commencement of this Act.</P>
    <P>This amendment is of some importance. The Minister might clarify the position in regard to section 5 (5) of the Bill.  The Bill provides that we will recognise a foreign decree of divorce if granted in the place where either spouse is domiciled. Domiciled is said to mean domiciled on the date of the institution of divorce proceedings. The normal position will be that in a year's time after the enactment of the Bill in most instances divorce proceedings will be initiated in a country in which the couple are domiciled or in which one or other party is domiciled. Divorce would subsequently be recognised. Subsection (5) gives rise to a difficulty that will affect people in respect of whom divorce proceedings have already been initiated at the time this Bill commences. Subsection (5) provides that this section shall apply to a divorce granted after the commencement of this Act. Taking into account the effect of subsection (3) it could give rise to certain divorces being recognised as valid without people realising that was the case.  Let us take the position of a husband in Ireland who has been deserted by his wife who is now living permanently in England and who has instituted divorce proceedings in England.  At the moment if the husband seeks advice as to the legal position in Ireland with regard to the proceedings he will be told that as he is domiciled in Ireland and his wife also has such domicile because of the concept of dependent domicile the divorce will not be recognised in Ireland.  If that divorce decree is granted one day before this Bill becomes law the divorce will not be recognised but if the decree is granted the day after the Bill becomes law the divorce will be recognised because of the interaction between section 5 (5) and section 3.  That gives rise to a real problem that could affect a number of people.  It is usual that a measure of this nature should apply in respect of proceedings initiated after the legislation has come into force, not <Col N="2290" /> simply in respect of a decree granted after it has come into force.  This can change the consequences of the granting of that divorce decree in mid-term.  There is a drafting problem in this connection.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister and her officials may not have had time to deal fully with this point.  It is a technical matter but it is one that could have a real effect on the future lives of a number of people in respect of whom divorce proceedings will have been initiated when this measure comes into force.  From the point of view of drafting it is a better provision to say that the section shall apply only to a divorce granted or divorce proceedings initiated after the commencement of this measure rather than that it should apply in the manner provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I understand that the concept of domicile as it is defined seeks to ensure that what is meant is domicile at the date of institution of the proceedings but if one marries that definition with section 3 and the effect of section 5 it could result in considerable injustice to a number of people.  Some people could find that foreign decrees of divorce are recognised when, after the initiation of the proceedings and even prior to the commencement of the debate in this House, they might have received legal advice to the effect that such a divorce would not be recognised.</P>

      <P>On the face of it, the amendment appears more restrictive than what is contained in the Bill.  The Government are satisfied that it is correct to abide by the provisions in the Bill. However, the point raised by Deputy Shatter is worth considering.  The amendment would have the effect that recognition would be refused for a divorce granted after the commencement in force of this measure merely because proceedings had begun before that.  We suggest that seems an unnecessary restriction and could create an anomalous situation.  We will maintain the position as set out in section 5 but we will bear in mind the point made by Deputy Shatter.</P>

      <P>In normal circumstances legislation enacted in this House does not affect legal proceedings already in being. Many years ago, a famous constitutional case, namely, the Sinn Féin funds case, established that precedent.  This House cannot interfere with the rights of individuals in respect of existing and subsisting legislation.  That principle has never been applied by the courts because they have only to determine it in the context of this House changing by legislation the rights of individuals living in Ireland in the light of existing litigation involving them in a foreign country.  This is a technical difficulty that could have real consequences and that could have a constitutional infirmity.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour or against things because they are either restrictive or liberal.  I am in favour or against things because of their effect on people in the real world.  In this connection, people may have planned how they will cope with foreign divorce proceedings on the basis of advice received by them based on the current law here.  This Bill speaks about a person having a domicile in the country in which divorce proceedings take place at the date of the initiation of the proceedings.  Normally the two things will coincide: the domicile will exist at the date of initiation of proceedings. According to current Irish law the view here may be that both parties have an Irish domicile.  When this Bill comes into force section 3 produces the retrospective application of the concept of independent domicile and then suddenly in the middle of the proceedings one party could be regarded retrospectively as having independent domicile within the foreign jurisdiction. If the decree is granted two days after this Bill comes into force it is recognised but if it is granted two days earlier it is not recoginsed.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the indication given by the Minister that she will consider this matter before the debate in the Seanad.  It is an important point that will affect some people and we should iron out the difficulty. On the basis of the Minister's assurance that the matter will be looked at, I shall not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I was speaking last night about the high cost of motor insurance, particularly for young people, and making the point that a large number of people are driving without insurance.  A person who is injured by an uninsured driver can seek compensation from the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland.  In effect, it is drivers with insurance who support the bureau.  Therefore, insured drivers are paying for the uninsured drivers and this is the reason for the very high cost of motor insurance.  I support the call for a &ldquo;no blame&rdquo; premium for young drivers in regard to motor car insurance.  It would be helpful if the <Col N="2294" /> Minister could give us the figures of those uninsured.  If we take a figure of 100,000 uninsured drivers, we could make available premiums of £500, thereby raising about £5 million.  That is the policy we would like to see so that there could be a reasonable premium offered to younger drivers.  The Minister and the Department should insist that all insurance companies give that type of cover to younger drivers.  Only one insurance company, the Norwich Union, gives cover to motor cyclists</P>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Bureau are paying the claims of people injured by uninsured drivers.  In the most recent accounts available to me there is a total provision of £49 million for claims in 1984.  That is a colossal amount which must be provided to compensate those injured by uninsured drivers.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will join me in calling on the insurance companies to launch a massive educational campaign in relation to road safety.  In many other countries within the EC this has been done by the motor insurance industry. In France, for example, the insurance companies matched the Government contribution towards road safety.  I have not seen that happening in this country although, in fairness, the insurance companies contribute to fire prevention campaigns.</P>
      <P>I greatly regret that insurance companies are penalising drivers on the basis of their age.  Many young people may be named drivers on their parents' policies and may be very experienced drivers, perhaps more experienced than drivers over the age of 40 who can get insurance cover more easily.  The criterion should be experience rather than age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk about abolishing juries.  The committee set up to report on the cost and methods of providing motor insurance did not agree with abolishing juries.  I do not believe such abolition would reduce the cost of premiums.  People can be very seriously injured in accidents and there is no guarantee that the awards would be reduced in the absence of a jury.  Perhaps the <Col N="2295" /> money could be invested on behalf of the injured person rather than paid in a lump sum.</P>
    <P>The incidence of accidents is very high in this country by international standards. The Minister of State mentioned measures to improve road safety and the work being done to eliminate accident black spots.  When we consider the cutback in the road programme and the condition of our county roads, we must ask where is the Government's will and commitment to improve that aspect of road safety.</P>
    <P>The committee report also referred to charging higher premiums for vehicles with inferior locks.  I should like to see a more positive type of commitment to lower premiums where there are better locks, alarm systems and anti-theft devices. Perhaps we should consider the situation in Canada and some parts of the USA where there is a mix of the private and public sectors in motor insurance. The insurance industry is regulated by the State and the State sets the premium, but the risk is offered to the private sector.  That matter should be considered.</P>
    <P>Young drivers are getting a very raw deal.  Recently there have been some tragic incidents at car rallies where cars were being driven at speeds of up to 120 m.p.h. on our roads.  At the same time people aged 22 or 23 cannot get a realistic insurance premium.  There is much red tape involved in setting speed limits. Even where the Garda are recommending speed limits to improve road safety, these proposals have to go to the Department and are held up there for a long time, when the Garda have recommended that they should be implemented immediately and the local authorities are obviously anxious to provide them. Those speed limits should be strictly enforced.</P>
    <P>The question of the role of the Garda and of enforcing the law has come up. From the figures the Minister gave here last night, it is obvious that the Garda are very busy trying to track down uninsured drivers.  There were 108,000 prosecutions in 1984 and the figure will be as high as <Col N="2296" /> 120,000 for 1985.  The total number of prosecutions under the traffic laws amounted to 798,000 in 1984.  If the Garda had no other duties and responsibilities, this amount of work would have kept them very busy.  Perhaps the proposal to provide a sticker on cars from 1 July indicating that the car is insured would make the job of the Garda easier, even though it was rejected by the report on the inquiry into the cost of methods of providing motor insurance.  A person can tax his car a week after his insurance has lapsed, so there is a need to bring motor taxation and car insurance into line.</P>
    <P>On the question of road accidents, there may have been a drop between 1983 and 1984, but the total number of injuries certainly increased during that year and, in fact, there is a figure for 1984, when one includes accidents and fatal accidents, of 8,625 people.  That shows how serious the issue is.  There should be a massive publicity campaign to educate people on these facts, to maintain and repair vehicles and to test cars above a certain age, and that should be compulsory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were to read the speech of the Minister of State one would believe there was very little wrong with the insurance industry.  We are all aware that at present the whole insurance industry is in a state of chaos.  Public liability, employer liability and motor insurance are continuing to produce serious underwriting losses.  The motion tonight deals specifically with motor car and motor cycle insurance.  There is no doubt that this type of insurance is causing serious problems for the whole insurance industry.  We have crippling costs, exorbitant claims, outrageous awards, all leading to a situation where the young motorist is being penalised out of the market.  I contend that young drivers are being discriminated against with excessive charges.  It is for that reason that one out of every five cars is being driven without proper insurance cover.  The Government have a duty to take steps to rectify that serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2297" /> The majority of insurance companies licensed to engage in the motor insurance business are not prepared to take a full share of the risks involved.  They are looking for a motor portfolio which will be profitable and are, therefore, taking the mature motorist, the motorist over 25 years who has a full licence and, more often than not, has no claim against him. All this is happening at the expense of the under-25s and younger drivers.  The Minister should ensure that all insurance companies are prepared to take all the risks involved on a more equitable basis. The risk is a basic principle in the insurance industry and I do not think certain insurance companies should be allowed to shy away from that risk.  Car insurance for younger people should not have to be carried on by a few companies while the others tout for the profitable sector of motor insurance business.  Drivers under 25 years are at present in an impossible situation with regard to getting even a quotation.  That is seriously wrong.  It is a serious problem that has been with the insurance companies and the insurance industry over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>We must face up to our responsibilities. We have a duty to ensure that the younger driver is not discriminated against and will get a fair crack of the whip and be able to get insurance at a reasonable cost.  At present there is no way that a young person can afford to pay the ridiculously high prices being sought by the insurance companies.  That is a fact of life that is facing all politicians. But the Government have made a very little effort over the past three years to tackle this serious problem.  Because of their inability to pay such high insurance premiums, young people are taking the chance of driving without insurance and this has serious consequences for both the driver and the general public when an accident occurs and it is in that particular age group that most accidents occur.</P>
    <P>In regard to insurance for young drivers, one must take into account that cars are no longer a luxury for most people.  The scarcity of jobs in most areas means that young people need a car to <Col N="2298" /> travel to work in other towns and sometimes outside the county.  They are finding it impossible to buy a car, to run a car, to pay the insurance.  I know many young people who purchased a car for about £1,500 and were quoted a figure above that for insurance.  No young person starting out in a low paid job can afford to buy a car and pay for the type of insurance involved.  That is the reason many young people are just not insuring their cars at present.  Every Deputy in this House is aware of such cases.  None of us can say we have not had young people coming to us complaining about the high charges for insurance, complaining about not being able to use the car to go to work.  In some cases people have actually had to give up their jobs because of being unable to get there.</P>
    <P>This is a serious problem which the Minister should look at seriously.  What is needed at present is a set of proposals agreed between the Government, the insurance industry and the public.  In the short term at least, that will lead to a stabilisation of the cost of insurance. Today we hear that insurance premiums are to go up by about 15 per cent.  I do not know how true that is.  But the Minister should certainly look at the situation and say to the insurance companies: &ldquo;Halt; enough is enough.&rdquo;  The Government should have a look at the whole insurance industry before premiums are allowed to increase further because this will lead to more cars being driven without insurance and it will certainly escalate the number of young people driving without insurance.  In the long term we have to have proposals that will lead to a dramatic reduction in the cost of insurance.  Two major cost factors at present are the high level of accidents and the exorbitant levels of compensation being awarded through the jury system. Awards under the jury system should be looked at and reconsidered.  Deputy Flynn pointed out last night that that would not lead to a dramatic reduction in insurance premium costs, and I agree with him, but it might lead to a tapering off in short term insurance premia.  For <Col N="2299" /> that reason the jury system should be looked at.</P>
    <P>We have a very high level of accidents, and this must be of grave concern to all. The Government have a greater role to play in this area.  They should introduce and implement legislation that will lead to some type of control on motorists. Road conditions are the cause of one in three accidents.  Low cost measures, such as the removal of accident black spots, improving road networks and so on, could bring about a reduction of at least 12 per cent of all accidents and, if high cost measures were taken, that reduction could be 20 per cent.  Such work would make a considerable contribution to a reduction in the price of premia because fewer accidents mean fewer claims.  This, one would hope, would lead to reduced premia, but sometimes I wonder when I consider the attitude of the insurance companies.  A greater number of road signs would make the motorist aware of accident black spots.  In every county accidents occur regularly on particular stretches of roads but until two or three people are killed the local authority will not take action.  This is one area the Minister should look at seriously.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with learner drivers.  We were all learner drivers at one time and we all took chances, and probably even broke the law, but this is another area the Minister should look at very seriously.  We must be the only county in the world where a 17 year old can get a provisional licence and take a car out on the road without any driving qualifications.  The law must be tightened in this area and the Minister should introduce legislation which prohibits provisional licence holders from driving cars above, say, 1100 cc.  The same would apply to motor cyclists on cycles of more than 100 cc.  I do not believe a young person who has not taken driving lessons and is therefore inexperienced is qualified to drive a big car.  It must be remembered that a young person will always want to drive a big flashy car knowing he will look great.</P>
    <P>Educating the motorists on their <Col N="2300" /> responsibilities as road users is another area in which the Government could play a greater role through the National Road Safety Association.  Many motorists could do with some form of education because they take chances on the road and do all sorts of dangerous things which eventually lead to accidents.  We should have a proper programme to educate motorists, particularly our young people. I hope the Minister will start a campaign to ensure that motorists are aware of all the problems.  As I said, accidents lead to high premia and at the end of the day they militate against the young driver, and I am concerned that young people should be able to get insurance cover at reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister made a statement on vehicle safety.  He said gardaí will be checking the road worthiness of motor cars, and that drivers will be given a certain amount of time for defects to be remedied, but I wonder if the Garda are in a position to do this.  In my town of Enniscorthy I do not believe the Garda have the time to take on another task nor do they have enough manpower to tackle this problem.  Therefore, I believe this plan will fail.  At present the Garda pull in trucks, have them weighed to see if they are overloaded and so on, and I do not believe they would have the time to implement another, even worthwhile, scheme.  The Minister will have to increase the number of Gardaí if the scheme is to be a success.</P>
    <P>Motor cyclists have a particular problem because insurance companies refuse to cover pillion passengers.  I agree with Deputy Flynn who said that if a motor cyclist has a full driving licence he should be able to get insurance cover for the pillion passenger.  It is important that the Minister look at this problem because there are 70,000 motor cyclists in Ireland and I do not believe any Government or any insurance company has the right to disregard them.</P>
    <P>A suggestion which has been put forward from time to time and which merits investigation and costing by the Department is that a levy be charged on petrol usage and that, in turn, would be <Col N="2301" /> deemed as insurance payment.  I do not know how realistic or how sensible this is but young people always put that suggestion forward.  This money would be passed to the Exchequer.  The Government have two State-owned insurance companies &mdash; PMPA and ICI.  The money collected by way of a levy on petrol usage could be passed by the Exchequer to those insurance companies which would handle all insurance claims. This deserves investigation.  It would ensure that every person on the road would be insured and we would not have the problem of large compensation as a result of accidents and uninsured drivers. Perhaps the Minister would give his opinion on this.  It may not be a practical solution but it deserves investigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In the limited time at my disposal I want to cover a few subjects that arose in the debate last night, namely young drivers, &ldquo;no-blame&rdquo; insurance, jury trials and bogus motor insurers.  I also want to announce some good news for disabled drivers, and to mention one or two other points.</P>
      <P>Dealing firstly with young drivers, the cost of motor insurance for young drivers is higher than other classes because of a number of important factors.  Firstly, they are regarded as a higher risk group. The road accident facts support this, as do the studies of the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee in the late seventies. Young drivers are also usually inexperienced &mdash; provisional licence holders, and are loaded for a temporary period on this account.  My Department have, however, got insurers to place an overall limit on the combined effect of age and inexperience loadings.  Finally, and probably most importantly, young drivers have not yet earned their no claims bonus, which in the case of many drivers can amount to a discount of more than half the basic premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the facts.  When proposals are made to reduce the premium for such a large class of drivers, the implications must be spelled out.  Since the level of <Col N="2302" /> claims remains unchanged the total amount of premium would have to be recouped from the remaining sectors.  In short, the premiums of the older, and the claims free motorists, would have to be levelled up.  Maybe that is no bad thing but it is important to point this out when proposals on young drivers are being considered. If we are evening out the level of premia charged, the effect is to increase the premia on everyone else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn suggested that insurers who get licences to do motor insurance should be required to take on a broad spectrum of risks and not discriminate against any other sector.  Reference was made to certain selected group motor insurance schemes.  However, the claims experienced on a number of the group schemes and the consequential hefty rate increases a couple of years ago put paid to several of them.  I know of group schemes that ran into serious difficulties: people who started off with low levels of premia have a higher loading now than if they were to go commercial in these restrictive schemes which are supposed to be for low risk people.</P>
    <P>In so far as a balanced portfolio of risks is concerned, my Department have on a number of occasions obtained assurances from insurers that they would play their part in taking on young drivers.  I am loath, as Deputy Flynn said he would be, to have to resort to legislation on this matter, since insurers must be given the latitude to accept or decline risks.  However, I want to see insurers playing a full role in accepting their fair share of risks in the market and I will be disappointed if they do not.  It is fair to say that frequently young drivers can be added to the insurance of their parents at very low cost, and if we were to make changes along the lines suggested by Deputies opposite it would not necessarily follow that this way of getting insurance for young people would be maintained indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn suggested a system of no blame insurance whereby young drivers would not be loaded at the start and those of them who were not bad drivers would be given a chance to prove so.  This has certain attractions but also a number of <Col N="2303" /> drawbacks.  The provision of insurance is based on the expected risk insurers are covering when they accept the premium. Thus if one is in a high risk group it is only reasonable that the premium should reflect the risk.  What would happen if, say, all drivers starting out were rated as clean risks? When the inevitable accident happens will the young driver be expected to pay the costs of the accident in his next year's premium? Would the insurer even expect to recoup the premium? The driver could either give up driving, or break the law and go uninsured. Perhaps at the end of year one the claims would be averaged out over all the young drivers involved.  This would hardly be &ldquo;fair&rdquo;&mdash; fair, that is, under the Deputy's scheme.  Those clean drivers would have been persuaded to buy insurance on a false premise.  At the end of their year's claim free driving they would see their premium increase without any basic increase in the overall level of claims, or without any claims having been made by them.</P>
    <P>The principle of insurance is that the premiums of the many cover the claims of the few.  Insurance can be underwritten only on the basis of having the fund of premium income there before the claims arise in order to fund the payment of the claims.  Thus, younger drivers as a class have to be rated on the basis of the higher expected level of claims from that group. However, as I have said, I would expect the companies to play their part to make sure that, while we allow for the fact that young drivers are higher risk group than older and experienced drivers, they require insurance and should not be discriminated against by a series of refusals. Deputies are aware, of course, that there is a mechanism via the Declined Cases Agreement where everybody will get a quotation and my Department regularly take up cases with insurance companies where people get a series of refusals.  We will continue with that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn referred to the Courts Bill and the abolition of juries.  The intention of the Government is that this measure will be proceeded with and I see it as <Col N="2304" /> an important element needed to bring stability into the insurance market in general. I know that there are different views of the effect of juries on premiums. Deputies opposite made this point a while ago.  I am clear in my mind that the effect of juries is adverse.  I do not think that any of us would want to retain a system which could develop some of the worst features of what is in the US at the moment.  It is not surprising that the cost of liability insurance over there has increased by so much and that one reads of sporting events and festive and commercial ventures which have to close through lack of insurance.  A statement was brought to my attention that in Georgia the local jail had to close down because of lack of liability cover and the activities of local municipalities in several states had to be severely curtailed because of lack of public liability cover.</P>
    <P>We want a sensible, rational, less time-consuming way of settling claims that will allow one to predict the right level at which a claim could be settled.  This is difficult to achieve under the jury trials system.  There is no reason to believe that victims' rights will be prejudiced by the abolition.  The Circuit Court which has been dealing with claims such as this involving the same citizens' rights since 1972, operates quite satisfactorily without a jury.  I am not saying that the level of claims will decrease dramatically or that the amount awarded by judges will be substantially below the amount awarded by juries.  That is not the argument I would put forward.  I would argue that there will be more consistency in the awards made by judges and it will be easier for insurance companies to predict the level of risk and, consequently, to arrange their projections, their cover and their costs in a more predictable fashion. In so far as the Deputy referred to it, yes, the intention is that the Government will go ahead with the Courts Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt mentioned a problem of bogus motor certificates being issued by bogus insurers and others.  My Department have taken significant action in previous years in publishing warning <Col N="2305" /> notices against dealing with specific named companies and individuals operating in the market without authorisation. If the Deputy has specific evidence he should, as the Minister of State said yesterday, bring it to my or the Minister of State's notice and we will act on it.  I want to advise all of those in doubt over any insurer whom they have reason to suspect to contact my Department, where the list of authorised insurers can be consulted.  Deputies are probably aware that an authorised list is available for consultation by Deputies or any member of the public.  Last year the powers available to the Minister were strengthened to take action against bogus insurers and the powers will be used where necessary.</P>
    <P>All Deputies will know that a special advisory board on motor insurance was set up and began work last year examining the loadings applied to different categories of drivers, including young drivers. The first report of the board will be in my hands shortly.  Of its nature the compilation, analysis and drawing of conclusions from the statistics will be ongoing over a number of years.  I can say, however, that I am advised that the board will be making a recommendation to me on the loadings applied to disabled drivers with a view to a reduction in these and a more equitable regime for such drivers.  I will be happy to approve that proposal when it comes before me and I am sure everybody here will welcome that.  This is an important step in the right direction and has been agreed with the insurers.</P>
    <P>The point is worth developing somewhat because the House may not be aware that at present disabled drivers experience loadings ranging from 25 per cent to 100 per cent on their basic premiums. Under this new arrangement loading for disability will be removed for the vast majority of disabled drivers at their next renewal date, whenever that occurs. Reduced loadings of 20 per cent for the first year of insurance and 15 per cent for the second year will be applied.  There will be no loading after two years of claim free driving.  Therefore, it will go from reduced loadings of 20 per cent to 15 per <Col N="2306" /> cent and after that clear if there is no claim.  Disabled drivers should approach their insurers to have their cases reviewed at the next renewal date as it will be operable from the next renewal date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Fair enough, it is not the case.  More generally speaking &mdash; and it is a point the Deputies might not wish to draw attention to &mdash; the size and rate of price increases notified in the last year have abated considerably.  I use the word &ldquo;notified&rdquo;, since detailed price control has been lifted on insurance, subject to insurers informing the Department three weeks ahead of proposed changes in premiums.  The market for motor insurance is improving and underwriting losses are expected to show a significant reduction for 1984 both in absolute terms and as a percentage of premium.  This is testimony of the Government's action and I look forward to continued improvement.</P>
      <P>I wish to challenge the views expressed on the levels of fines being imposed.  The administration of justice is a matter for the courts and that is as it should be.  The courts must take into account a person's ability to pay a fine.  For example, a person may not qualify for unemployment benefit and may be in receipt of about £80 per week from unemployment assistance.  He would like to run his car but cannot pay £500, £600 or £700 in insurance costs so there must be a regime which takes into account the person's ability to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not excuse the fact that 93 per cent of people brought before <Col N="2307" /> the courts for driving without insurance are fined less than £200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That has now changed dramatically but I do not think Deputies would accept harsh fines being imposed on those with limited means.  However, the courts have been increasing the level of fines contrary to what insurers say.  In the second six months of 1985 in the Dublin Metropolitan District, fines of £100, £300 and £500 were the most common fines for driving without insurance.  Maximum fines of £1,000 were also imposed and terms of imprisonment were imposed in 599 cases. In 1985 as a whole, fines of between £100 and £500 comprised over 60 per cent of the fines applied.  That is the most up-to-date information, although I know another set of statistics is being circulated which are not correct.  These figures speak for themselves and I fully agree with Deputy Flynn that offenders should pay the price, especially drunk driving offenders.  We know that an unemployed man with a wife and a flock of children should not be driving a car without insurance but the district justice must deal with each case individually.  I do not agree that we should remove the stipulation from law that the means of people should be taken into account when they are dealt with in the District Court.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Opposition put down this motion because it gives me an opportunity to make it quite clear that the Government have acted vigorously in the area of motor insurance.  Far from the amendment motion being, as Deputy Flynn claimed last night, a confirmation of the Opposition motion, the situation is the reverse.  Nearly all the measures enumerated by the Deputy in his opening remarks yesterday as being necessary are, in fact, being undertaken and that is why there is so little disagreement.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I urge the House to pass this amendment and if anyone has any doubts I refer him or her to the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, who outlined the range of measures being undertaken by the Government to do what Deputy Flynn, a very sensible Deputy, wants us to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that Deputy Flynn's speech last night did not amount to a recommendation that the insurance industry in its motor insurance dimension should be nationalised or subsidised. However, I have a nasty feeling about the cry for cheap or reasonable insurance for young drivers or cries of that kind when they are articulated by politicians. I realise that we all have the job of trying to make life better for those around us in whatever field is open to us, but we need to understand that, when we articulate a demand, state a principle, or lodge a complaint against our opponents in contexts in which we are glad to suppose that our constituents will support us to the extent that what we are saying agrees with their prejudices or wishes, we will be doing something with implications which we would not like to face if in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I specifically do not accuse Deputy Flynn of anything of the sort, it is not the first time we have heard, in the House or outside it, the claim that insurance is too high for young drivers in particular and for certain other categories and that it should be reduced.  I have heard it said in the House that if companies will not run insurance in a way which makes it more accessible to young drivers, those companies should be nationalised and that we should have a subsidised State company administering the insurance.  I do not want to erect targets to which the Opposition did not refer and then knock them down.  I do not want to spend the rest of my time disclaiming such intention, but any time this theme is raised it naturally evokes in the minds <Col N="2309" /> of the voters, those who are interested in the subject, the feeling that, because they are on the other side in debates of this sort, the Government are to blame for things being as they are and that it is in their power to amend them.</P>
    <P>Of course it is in the Government's power to do many things, including some of the matters to which Deputy Flynn and others adverted, and it would be in their power to nationalise the insurance industry or sections of it and to have a special regime for young drivers in which they would be given preferential treatment by reference to their risk assessment. That is all possible but it is undesirable that this should happen.  I hope that nothing said on the other side &mdash; even though they did not use such words themselves &mdash; will be construed by their supporters or anybody else as indicating a volume of support in this House for the State to step in, whether by regulation or nationalisation, to assume the burden which at present is borne commercially.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have admitted that and I do not want to spend the rest of my time repeating the admission.  I do not think I ever accused a Deputy in here, except in moments of heat to which I am as liable as the next Deputy, of something of which he was not guilty.  To bring a motion of this sort before the House is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny that, but to bring in a motion of this kind in a context where the Government must reply to it awakens the expectation among the public, who do not of course take the trouble to read the small print in the speeches of Deputy Flynn or the Minister, that the Government have it in their power by pushing a financial lever to change the situation.  It would be more <Col N="2310" /> sensible to make people understand as, of course, most of them do, that the whole principle of insurance is one of mutuality, of sharing a light burden of premiums in order that the very heavy burden of liability or claims does not fall on an individual in a measure which he is quite unable to meet.  The whole principle is one of pooling resources.  It is like a burial society or a Christmas draw for a turkey.  Everybody contributes a little in order that someone else will have a large benefit.</P>
      <P>In this case the benefit is that he will be freed of the liability which the ordinary law imposes upon him to answer for his neglect, for his want of care and for his negligence.  To be free of that liability is an extremely valuable thing.  I was not listening to the first half of the debate last night but I read parts of it subsequently and I do not know if any Member adverted to the fact that rock bottom third party motor insurance of the kind the law requires us to have entitles anybody to go out without having had a driving lesson, a driving test, expertise or competence in driving, without being sober and in the right degree of physical competence that eight hours sleep implies, drive with wild recklessness and kill not one person but, perhaps, a very much greater number in a multiple accident and be completely free of as much financial liability as would take a slate from his roof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That point has been sufficiently got home on either side of the House and I am sorry to feel obliged to say it now. That possibility exists only because of the contribution of a very large number of people who make a small contribution in premiums and never make a claim.  To disturb that system, to rattle at the basis of it, to undermine it in any way, however well intentioned &mdash; I know that is what is at work in the motion before the House &mdash; by suggesting that it can be manipulated in some way, that it is only a lack of understanding or neglect on the part of somebody or other that it should be as it is, awakens expectations among a public who, I am sorry to say, have become accustomed to having their <Col N="2311" /> expectations awakened and then, very often, not fulfilled.</P>
    <P>We have a very important benefit in civilised society in the whole insurance principle.  I do not have any stake in it, I do not own shares in an insurance company and, perhaps, it is just as well that I do not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have shares in that company either.  This is one of those benefits that people in a society like this live with without ever realising the force of it.  When one tells a young driver that it is a disgrace, as I feel many Deputies, councillors, or people in politics may well do behind their hands, that he should be penalised for his age and so forth, public representatives do not tell that boy that he could go out and inflict on another human being as much physical injury as would destroy his life and would entitle him in the eyes of a jury to £200,000 worth of damages and for nothing.  An insurance premium of £365 per year which, for a young person, would be a heavy insurance rate &mdash; it is about two-thirds of what I pay for comprehensive cover &mdash; works out at £1 per day.  To drive a car which weighs the best part of a tonne of metal, more in some cases, at any speed and with any degree of competence one likes, 365 days per year and do any amount of damage, human and other kinds of damage, for £1 per day is a bargain.  To be able to do that much damage and not have to apprehend losing one shilling out of one's pocket over and above a no claims bonus is a bargain. That facet of the type of society we live in must not be obscured in a debate like this although I do not accuse any Member of trying to obscure it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I defend also the system of dividing drivers into categories.  If we were to do otherwise, if we were to have no differentiation between drivers young and old, it would be grossly unfair to older drivers. Why should a 70 year-old who takes his car to Mass, the library or to see his son and nowhere else and merely puts about <Col N="2312" /> 1,500 miles on the clock be saddled with liability for people who may drive 15 times that distance, who are up at all hours of the day and night, who have stress, fatigue, maybe drink and all kinds of problems weighing on them, problems of the sort that the old person does not have? Why should he be part of that pool? It is unreasonable to create a special pool of less dangerous drivers and another pool of those who statistically turn up more accidents? That is not unreasonable.  I have sons in this situation and I have tried, without lecturing them in the way I am lecturing the House, to make it clear to them that a high risk category necessarily involves larger expense in an insurance system.  If we start to shake at the roots of this insurance system it will be no time before we will have a Government &mdash; I have enough imagination to visualise it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If a relative belonging to any of the Deputies was injured in an accident how would they like it to be said, &ldquo;if only you had taken your action six months ago before the new law was brought in you would have got £150,000 but now we only have a mingy old judge sitting there without a jury drawn from the county you can only expect one-third of that&rdquo;.  How would Members opposite like to be caught in that position? When the relevant Bill comes before the House I will be saying that I am not sure that this is a proper system.  I accept that the whole legal system whereby an array of two or three counsel appearing for one party can draw costs.  Even though I belong to that profession I accept that that is something which is unacceptable and inexplicable to the public.  However, if that system is changed in such a way that a lawyer is bound to appear at a particular case and has to refuse all other briefs, that there is not the possibility of juggling from one court to another, the fees will go up.</P>

    <P>The only criticism I have of Irish insurance companies in this context is that they are too defensive.  They whinge, whine and cry about the freedom of establishment and about how foreign companies are going to come here and take all their business from them as the Italian company, Assicurazioni Generali, has done by capturing 3 per cent of the Irish motor market.  Why are the insurance <Col N="2314" /> companies not availing of this mechanism and looking for business in the foreign markets, access to which membership of the EC guarantees us? We think only in terms of the sale of butter and beef which few people want today and nobody will want tomorrow.  Nobody gives a damn about the other dimensions of the market of which this is a very simple and topical example.'</P>

      <P>Usually I have a lot of admiration for what Deputy Kelly has to say but I found it very difficult to comprehend his sentiments on the insurance industry.  It is clear that the cause of the high cost of motor insurance is Government inaction.  That inaction has resulted in continuous increases in the cost of motor insurance.  We are not suggesting, as the Deputy has tried to point out, that there should be any nationalisation or interference by politicians.  We are suggesting a series of Government actions which would reduce the cost of insurance.  Deputy Kelly, more than any other Member, should understand how that Government action would help the cost of motor insurance.  I have with me the MacLiam Report published in November 1981.  That committee was set up by Mr. John Kelly TD, Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  Government action was requested in 1983 in regard to 20 measures.  The report stated that if those measures were adopted they would bring about a better climate in the insurance industry.  One measure set out in this MacLiam report has since been implemented by this Government.  I put it to the House that the reason motor insurance costs have gone through the roof is the inability of this Government to implement a series of measures which would greatly improve the climate throughout the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another committee established in 1985, a working group of Ministers of State, who succeeded in continuing the talk shop. I want to put to the House the areas in which I, the insurance industry, and everybody concerned about the price of insurance, feel would bring <Col N="2315" /> about a decrease in the cost of motor insurance.</P>
    <P>First, there is the question of jury trials in respect of which this Government have failed to bring forward legislation.  I know the Courts Bill is before the House, but clearly this Government either had not the backbone or were afraid of the lawyers' lobby to bring this legislation into being.  There is no question or doubt in my mind but that the jury system is a significant contributor to the high cost of motor insurance.  The jury system requires 12 people with little or no knowledge or experience in such matters not only to make decisions on legal liability but also to assess damages.</P>
    <P>This results in awards which are inconsistent, unreliable and totally unpredictable.</P>
    <P>This unpredictability makes for exaggerated settlements, unrealistic expectations. It also leads to far too many expensive appeals to the Supreme Court. An example of this is that in the five year period from 1980 to 1985, 316 awards by High Court juries were appealed to the Supreme Court.  A significant feature of those appeals was that in two-thirds of the cases brought before the Supreme Court they disagreed with the awards granted by juries.  This unpredictability of jury awards as well as being unfair to defendants can create injustice for the injured parties.  Additionally, the legal system operating around this jury system is cumbersome, unwieldy and time-wasting. The two seniors system, under which each participant in a case must have two senior counsel, one junior counsel and a solicitor, adds significantly to the cost of settling insurance claims.  Because of the jury system a whole series of experts, such as doctors, engineers, architects and so on are required to give verbal evidence, with all of those people sitting in a courtroom perhaps for days on end, all being paid very high fees.  An estimation of the cost of the jury system in most High Court cases is that litigation accounts for approximately 20 per cent of the total amount paid out in claims by insurance companies.  Therefore there is no doubt <Col N="2316" /> in my mind but that the discontinuation of the jury system will significantly reduce the cost of motor insurance.  It is significant also that Ireland is now the only country in Europe that decides civil claims by jury.  Clearly, this Government had not got the backbone to introduce the legislation to do away with that jury system which is having a direct effect on the premiums being paid for motor insurance, particularly by young people.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to act on the whole question of the uninsured motorist, and indeed with regard to the implementation of standards with regard to vehicle defects, drunken driving and general safety on our roads.  I must seriously disagree with the Minister in what he said with regard to the efforts the Government have made to reduce the incidence of uninsured motorists.  The insurance industry have estimated, from a survey of fines imposed on drivers convicted of driving without insurance and carried out in the six month period between October 1984 and April 1985&mdash;that, despite the tenfold increase in the maximum fine from £100 to £1,000, over 80 per cent of those fines were still under £100.  It will be clearly seen that the present system is no deterrent to uninsured drivers.  If anything it invites young people not to bother insuring their vehicles. The fault lies fairly and squarely at the door of this Government who have failed to implement the recommendations of the MacLiam report with regard to the minimum amount of fine and other aspects of punishment which should be meted out.</P>
    <P>The no-blame policy which has been proposed by Deputy Flynn carries worthwhile benefits for young people.  I believe this constitutes the way in which the Government, the insurance companies and the public generally can co-operate in reducing the cost of motor insurance. For example, if a young person has to pay £1,500 for motor insurance when he can perhaps buy a car for £1,000 it is natural that he will not pay that insurance. I believe a no-blame policy would <Col N="2317" /> lead to a significant increase in the numbers of people who would take out insurance on their vehicles and that it would constitute the first significant input of finance into insurance companies. Second, the penalty being imposed after the accident will ensure that young people will make every effort to avoid being involved in an accident.  The third benefit of this no-blame policy will be that uninsured drivers will no longer have the excuse of being unable to afford to pay for motor insurance.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the implementation of the Fianna Fáil policy as a new principle in the motor insurance industry because I have no doubt but that it will work.  I have discussed it with some insurance companies as part of Fianna Fáil's youth policy.  They are quite satisfied that, with proper safeguards, it can be made to work.  This Government have rejected that logical suggestion, indeed have even refused to consider its merits.</P>
    <P>The large numbers of claims and accidents also mean that the cost of insurance lies heavily on motorists generally and, in particular, on young motorists.  Here again I want to lay the blame firmly on the shoulders of this Government.  They have failed to enforce what are considered to be minimum road safety standards, minimum standard in regard to drunken driving, vehicle defects and, indeed, the condition of our roads themselves. In Canada, which I visited recently, a person dare not attempt to drive if he or she feels they are over the alcohol limit.  Here it is quite normal, day in day out, night in night out, to have thousands of drivers driving with very significant levels of alcohol in their blood. In other words, the law is not being enforced. The Government are to blame.  The statistics show quite clearly that in the hours between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. the most significant numbers of accidents and deaths take place.  Again the blame lies fairly on the shoulders of the Government who are not prepared to ensure that the law is enforced.</P>

      <P>The one difference now is that the cost of motor insurance has increased four-hundredfold in the last three years, which was not the case during the terms of office of previous Governments.  This Government have failed to honour their responsibility in this regard.</P>
      <P>There is this famous committee of Ministers sitting at present.  One wonders what they are doing.  We heard from the Minister last evening many things they were going to do.  One of the other causes of the high cost of motor insurance is the condition of vehicles on our roads.  The Minister announced last evening that the vehicle defects campaign would commence in 1986.  One might well ask: what have this Government been doing for almost the last four years that they have not dealt with the basic problem of the condition of vehicles? What have this Government been doing with regard to the various aspects of this MacLiam report which Deputy Kelly established in 1981? They have been doing nothing. They have been setting up either committees or commissions but have not been taking any action which would stop young drivers from paying through their noses for insurance cover.</P>
      <P>There are four problems which will be tackled by Fianna Fáil when they come back to Government which will bring about a climate conducive to reasonable insurance costs.  Jury trials in civil actions will be discontinued.  We will lay down standards for law enforcement and we will provide the means for the punishment of people who defy the law.  One such action recommended by insurance companies is that when a person is fined and refuses to pay, his car would be confiscated until he does.  Recently a judge complained that there is no point in imposing fines on uninsured drivers because the fines would never be collected. We suggest that cars of uninsured drivers should be impounded until they pay the fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do the Government not introduce <Col N="2319" /> legislation along these lines? The reason is that they are not interested in the cost to people of motor insurance.  I fail to understand the logic of Deputy Kelly's speech in the face of the Government's inaction to create a climate in the insurance business conducive to allowing drivers to be insured at half the present price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this very important motion.  It is obvious that the insurance business is in crisis not only in regard to motorists but public liability cover, employers' liability, sports and so on.  It is virtually impossible to get cover quickly at a reasonable price.  I cannot understand why the Government, who have set up committees and commissions to investigate various problems &mdash; Deputy Collins set up a committee of Ministers to investigate insurance &mdash; have not come up with a solution to the problems besetting the insurance industry.</P>
      <P>I will illustrate how serious the position is in regard to car insurance cover.  Today an 18-year-old looked for a quotation to cover a car worth £1,000.  He was quoted £1,200.  That is serious and the reason for it is that the Government and the State do not make an effort to provide insurance at reasonable cost to anybody who wants it if he or she is able to pay a reasonable price for it.  In 1970 I was an 18-year-old and I was able to get insurance cover for £40.  Today the cost is £1,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criteria should be drawn up that would put a ceiling on insurance premiums.  We should stipulate that £10 per week, £500 per annum, would be the maximum figure for young people under 25 years and £1,000 per annum for fully licensed drivers. Something must be done by the Department or the Government as a whole to create an environment in which insurance costs would be brought to realistic levels soon.  There is a stipulation that insurance cover is not valid in some cases unless one is accompanied by a fully licensed driver of more than 25 years. This is impossible for most insured persons. The only people who could enjoy <Col N="2320" /> that kind of luxury would be a Minister or Minister of State.  The ordinary citizen cannot afford that luxury.  That stipulation will have to be abolished so that cover once given will qualify the person or persons named in the policy.</P>
    <P>One way to achieve that would be through certificates of competence: people who drive should be made to prove their competence through a driving course culminating in a simple test and a certificate.  At the renewal of their insurance cover in 12 months they should have to undergo a mandatory driving test and if they passed there would be certain reductions in the renewal premium; if they failed the test they would not be entitled to the reduction and therefore would be paying the price for not being as competent as other drivers.</P>
    <P>There are many uninsured drivers in the country.  The economic situation is the main cause.  People on social welfare benefits, young people who cannot afford to pay, fathers of families who have to maintain those families, take the risk of driving without insurance until they encounter the police or have accidents. They do not consider it necessary to have insurance.  We must create a climate in which our people will be encouraged to have proper insurance cover at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>The Government have added seriously to the problems of the insurance companies. In Britain, where the population is so large and the revenue base so great, it is much easier for insurance companies to operate profitably and charge the insured less.  We have a smaller population and a much narrower revenue base.  In Britain they have a far superior road network. Here our roads are disintegrating and the Government will not give funds to provide proper main or county roads throughout the nation.  There is another cutback this year.</P>
    <P>The biggest mistake the Government made was the DIRT provision in this year's budget which will cut seriously into the revenue of insurance companies in the short and long term.  The direct interest retention tax will ensure that the cost of insurance cover will escalate.  We know <Col N="2321" /> that insurance companies are considering another hike in insurance and I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was in the Department of Justice and who understands the legal implications, will ensure that motorists will not suffer more.</P>
    <P>The Government set up a committee and, indeed, they have set up many commissions. We heard last night from the Minister of State that this committee were concerned with road safety precautions. It is the duty of the Minister for the Environment and his Department to ensure that roads are safe, first in the quality of roads and second in the competence of people to be on those roads. That may have an inherent effect on the cost of insurance, but basically it should not have to worry the Minister of State. His duty should be to ensure that reasonably priced insurance premia are available to all throughout the country. He contrasted the present costs of insurance with those in 1980, 1981 and 1982. He also spoke about high inflation.  I often wonder about the time this Government can spend talking about the cost of inflation.  At least insurance premia in the 1980 to 1982 period were reasonably priced and available on a regular basis. According to the Government, inflation today is supposed to be at zero per cent, yet the cost of insurance is absolutely astronomical, beyond the reach of the vast majority of ordinary working people and the unemployed.  That situation cannot continue.  The Government have a duty and a function to ensure that it will not continue any longer.</P>
    <P>Now that we are a member state of the European Community, international law covers the trading situation pertaining to the operation of multinationals here and there are many multinational insurance companies in this country.  Many of these operate in Britain where insurance premia are only one-third of what they cost here.  Those same companies clean out the market for a certain period but, when they find that large claims are being given against them and they are beginning to lose money on the motoring end, they close down the motoring section of <Col N="2322" /> their business here and operate life and other commercial cover which is much more lucrative.  That cannot be allowed to continue.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure that any company coming into the country will keep their systems and policies open to all motorists at all times.  The market is being fragmented. Fewer companies are operating motor cover than heretofore.  They are closing down on a regular basis and there is only one company in the country today who are constantly open to giving adequate insurance cover to motorists of any age who seek that cover.  That is the sad situation at which we have arrived.</P>
    <P>Our legislation must be changed to ensure that companies cannot do what they like, where and when they like to motorists.  If they give cover elsewhere within the European Community and operate here, we must insist that they make available to us who are a member state of that Community the same type of cover at the same reasonable price.</P>
    <P>The Judiciary must also take cognisance of the serious effect of high awards with the jury system in court.  It is vitally important in all areas of law that the Judiciary be constantly briefed and updated on the various changes in law, the problems besetting the country financially, the changes in traffic laws and the difficulties being encountered by the insurance industry, to ensure that the awards which they grant are reasonable. I know of many people, including my own relations, who have paid large amounts to barristers to defend them.  One barrister defends the client, another operates for the insurance company and there are perhaps four barristers involved in the one case.  Innocent, distraught people are totally disturbed on finding themselves in a very difficult environment in court.  The barristers get together, make an agreement, one of their number tells the judge that an agreed figure has been reached and the decision is made.  It becomes law and is totally binding on all parties.</P>
    <P>When those people get notification of the result, they realise their predicament and have no recourse to appeal of any type in any court.  Something will have <Col N="2323" /> to be done, through the Department of Industry and Commerce, with the Motor Insurance Bureau and the judicial system, to see that this will not continue. Department information officers will have to be available in the courts in these cases to explain to the innocent victims of serious motor crashes their rights and entitlements and what they are going to receive in financial terms.  Some realism must be brought into this area of the insurance.  Otherwise the insurance industry will be in difficulties <i>vis-à-vis</i> motor insurance.</P>
    <P>There are cases of drivers with alcohol in their system who are involved in crashes, get scratched and are taken to hospital.  They do not then have to undergo the same type of tests which are done on other drivers.  Perhaps somebody is killed, as happens in many cases.  That driver can walk away on payment of a nominal fine and innocent people are killed going about their normal business. The advice of medical people is that it is dangerous to insist on these tests being done.  This area must be tightened up, so that the heavy awards made in such a situation will not continue.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to make available the proper climate and type of insurance cover and the committee which were set up have also failed to do so.  I urgently appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State for immediate action to be taken to have realistic premia available for motorists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite a difficult and complex subject.  One cannot hope to say very much on it in the space of five minutes, but I want to express one or two thoughts on the matter.  The major emphasis which appears to be given to the subject goes to the trimmings rather than the core of the subject.  We talk about administration costs, legal costs of barristers and solicitors and the abolition of juries.  Both the Minister and Deputy Fahey appear to think that the abolition <Col N="2324" /> of juries on this issue will be a panacea and bring a state of order to the insurance market.  I do not believe that for one moment.  I do not believe it will produce any reduction whatsoever in the rate of insurance premiums.  One insurance broker interviewed on radio on this subject conceded that the abolition of juries, first, would be unlikely to lead to a reduction in the amount of awards and secondly, would not be likely to lead to any reduction in insurance premiums, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that our laws and the concept of award of damages, particularly in serious cases, need looking at in this Oireachtas.  They have not been looked at for a very long time.  This problem will escalate and it is not confined to this country.  It is common to most of the countries in the western world.  The courts have taken cognisance of the fact that the amounts of awards in serious cases have escalated to a remarkably high level, causing in perhaps just a very few cases intense strain on the rate of insurance premiums.  The Supreme Court, in particular, in a case within the last year or so, gave some thought to the question of providing a cap or maximum limit on the amount of what are described as non-economic damages.  That is to say, while conceding that a person's loss of earnings, cost of medical and hospital expenses for the entire duration of the injury and into the future must be provided for, that when it comes to the question of general damages on top of that, some maximum figure must be applied, a so-called cap on those damages.  Whether we like it or not, consideration will have to be given in this House to that question because this is a matter of law reform that falls properly within the ambit of the House.  It is beyond the ambit of legislation by judges to bring this about. It is a subject that has aroused intense debate in the state legislature in the US. I have read an article which indicated that Bills are pending in most, if not all, the state legislatures, to provide a form of maximum amount of general damages that may be awarded by the courts in <Col N="2325" /> certain cases.  That is a complex and difficult subject but it is one that we may not shy away from.</P>
    <P>One small point in that connection that should be considered also by the House in reviewing the legislation is that provision should be made in the case of large awards for payment to be made by the insurance company, not in one immediate lump sum, but in instalments spread over a number of years.  In many cases that would be to the advantage, not only of the insurance industry, but of the recipients because I have known of too many cases where lump sums were paid to people who did not have the experience of managing such amounts of money with the result that the moneys were dissipated all too quickly.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies contribute to their own costs.  There are four lawyers involved in these cases because the cases are allowed to go to court though the overwhelming bulk of them are settled at the doorstep of the court.  There seems to be some unwillingness on the part of the insurance companies to settle cases early on and thereby save the costs involved in engaging two barristers as well as the other legal costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that most of the Government speakers have agreed with our motion.  This motion sets out clearly what the position is.  It is almost impossible for young drivers to find a motor insurance company who are willing to insure them.  The reason for this is that only a small number of companies are engaged in motor insurance and only one of those have opened their doors to young and old alike.  Many companies have discontinued motor insurance.  In the past couple of years particularly, companies have been declining to renew motor insurance policies.  That is a very serious position.  I speak with good knowledge of the industry because I worked in insurance for many years.  Not all the blame can be attributed to the legislation in this respect.  Some of it rests with the insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding knock-on claims, there is an <Col N="2326" /> opportunity for companies to arrange to settle cases very quickly instead of going to court and thereby involving extensive legal costs.  This should not happen.  It is an area that must be given attention.  Last year I asked the Minister if he would bring the insurance companies together to discuss this aspect.  Eventually cases must be fixed anyway, but far too many cases reach the stage of court.  This places a major burden on the companies because up to 20 per cent of the total amount involved in the claim will be spent on legal fees.  That should not happen. This is a subject that the Minister should take up immediately with the insurance companies urging them to deal with this question effectively.</P>
    <P>One must ask why in Circuit Court cases dealing with insurance claims there must be two barristers or in some cases three or four? Then if the case goes to the High Court there are senior counsel involved.  After all that, the case might be settled on the steps of the court.  This whole area should be considered.  If a case can be resolved on the way into court surely it could have been resolved long before that point had been reached. Many of the claims concerned are very small and could be settled very quickly but some companies allow matters to proceed for up to 12 months.  With inflation and so on, this involves them in much greater cost than if the cases were settled quickly.</P>
    <P>The very high premiums being applied by insurance companies are causing job losses in the motor trade.  It is interesting to note that in the month of March there was a 29 per cent drop in the sales of new cars.  One must ask what caused this decrease.  Many people in the motor trade to whom I have spoken believe that the high cost of motor insurance is the reason.  A decrease in car sales represents a loss to the economy in terms of revenue and that is another factor that must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he is to ask the Garda to examine defects in motor cars from next month on.  I do not believe that the Garda are equipped to take on this work.  They may be able to help in <Col N="2327" /> regard to minor defects but not in regard to major defects.  I submit that all cars of five years and over should be subject to an engineer's test and report before being insured.  That is a fundamental point.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the question of the learner driver.  A person holding a provisional licence only should not be allowed drive a car of 1000 cc or more while in the case of a motor cyclist holding a similar licence, the maximum capacity of the bike should be 150 cc.  Such restrictions should help to reduce the number of accidents on the roads.  The motoring public would be helped considerably if a measure were introduced to enable them to pay their premiums by way of monthly instalments.  For many people a car is a necessity in terms of travelling to and from work.  That factor should be borne in mind, too.</P>
    <P>Some of the companies operating in the motor insurance market are not taking their fair share of young drivers but they should be made to do so.  That is why I stated here last year that the Minister, as it is open to him to do, should bring all the insurance companies around the table and ask what they are doing in this respect.  They cannot have all the cream and leave others to carry the can. In regard to insurance companies that are operated by the State now, the tab had to be taken up in the first instance by the taxpayer.  While in some of the cases concerned management left a lot to be desired the fact remains that these companies had to carry a major burden in regard to what I would refer to as undesirable risks.  If those risks were spread among all the companies, of which more than 20 are operating, there would be a lesser burden on these other companies. One must ask why that was not done?</P>
    <P>I have a good knowledge of the underwriting procedure.  In some companies that procedure left a lot to be desired but they were carrying risks that should have been spread among all the big companies such as Llyods and others.  That is how one should operate and not hold on to risks which will result in high claims in respect of injuries.  The demand on the <Col N="2328" /> Motor Insurers' Bureau is running extremely high.  The uninsured driver is causing us a great problem.  I was somewhat surprised by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, when he said that he could impose only so much of a fine on these people.  Does that mean that if a person was drawing unemployment assistance, or whatever the case may be, that we have to go easy on the person? In other words, by implication this person after paying a fine of £10 would be back on the road again.  That is not good enough and we cannot support that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>£10 to him would be the same as £100 to somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but does the Deputy support the uninsured driver who knocks down the innocent? I do not think the Deputy or anybody else in this House supports that.  Deputy Kelly said I was trying to allege that Fianna Fáil, were in favour of nationalising insurance companies. We are not in favour of nationalising insurance companies and we have made that absolutely clear.  What we are saying is that the insurance companies should get their act together.  It is up to the Minister, as I stated earlier, to get the insurance companies together to see if they can work out a policy and take their fair share.  There is nothing wrong with that, but at present there is only one company taking all the risk, three others in a selective way, while the others have closed the door.  Can we stand for that? Can the Minister stand for that? I say he cannot and we in this House say he cannot.  The motorist is asking that we do something about it.</P>
      <P>I am glad that this evening the Government are putting some improvements in train, after we put down this motion.  We welcome these, especially in regard to disabled drivers.  I want to say also that we proposed that.  I am glad that the Government are now coming round and seeing the light.  We welcome any proposals put up which will improve the situation. We will give the Minister all the support that he wants in regard to that and we will be constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very substantial financial <Col N="2329" /> burden on the Motor Insurers' Bureau. The money raised in fines should be passed on to the bureau in order to help it out.  Reliable people in the industry inform me that there are claims in the bureau for over £50 million.  That is an enormous amount.  Under the insurance Act the Motor Insurers' Bureau have to take up the tab in regard to personal injuries.  We have to comply with that law.  Therefore, I must say that the Garda must get a lead from Government in this respect.  Because of their other duties the Garda are not able to do as much traffic duty as they would like.  If they were able to there would be a substantial increase in fines and the number of uninsured motorists would be brought to our attention very quickly.  The fines imposed by the courts should go to the bureau in order to cushion the effects and above all to cushion the effects on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the unfortunate, hard-pressed, honest-to-God person who is trying to pay motor insurance by instalment or otherwise has to pay £70 or more to prop up the uninsured driver who has caused these accidents and crippled the bureau.  I want to say that this debate has <Col N="2330" /> brought about a change of heart in the Government who have brought forward proposals.  We welcome and support them.  We are glad that we brought the Government out into the open and got them to do something in respect of it.  I want to say that much will depend on the future.</P>

      <P>&ldquo; `transport officer' means a transport officer appointed under section 15 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Other amendments which I shall move later refer to the appointment of transport officers with powers to carry out inspections for the purpose of enforcing the law relating to road freight transport and the carriage of passengers in buses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the definition section and as transport officers are being appointed this is the appropriate place for a definition.  I wish to ask the Minister if this is the first time since the Bill was in the Seanad or in this House on Second Stage that the word &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; has been mentioned? We are dealing mainly with hauliers and the haulage system.  As far as I can see, this is the first time the word &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; has been used in this context and I shall have more to say about it if that is so.  I do not know why or when this word was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson is correct. The major part of the Bill deals with freight matters but here we are dealing with enforcement.  The problems of enforcement in relation to the road freight industry are similar to those of enforcement in the road passenger industry.  The purpose of the set of amendments we are taking tonight is to provide a multi-purpose inspectorate to bring together all the Stage agencies involved in different aspects of law enforcement in relation to road transport and road traffic.  Obviously it would be an omission if we were not to include road passenger services.  I am sure Deputy <Col N="2336" /> Wilson would agree that it would be utterly wrong if, for instance, for lack of enforcement buses were travelling around the country in a dangerous state, not paying due taxes or having due markings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement with the Minister that this is the place for a definition of a transport officer.  As the word &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; does not appear in section 1, I do not intend to say more about it at this point.  I warn the Minister that I see quite significant implications in spreading the bailiewick of the transport officer outside the bounds of this Bill and I will be opposing it, for reasons I will state, when we come to the amendment which mentions omnibuses and the inspection of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 20, after &ldquo;1972.&rdquo;, to insert the following: &ldquo;A system of bonding to ensure sound financial standing shall be established.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, there are three requirements&mdash;good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence&mdash;which will be demanded of those who seek a licence under the new legislation. Those three conditions were welcomed on all sides of the House.  In the context of the transport industry being so important, accounting for about 12 per cent of the economy, then it is necessary to have this type of qualification for someone who <Col N="2337" /> seeks a licence.  The people involved in the industry have told us that one of the ways to help them is by introducing a bonding system.  This House is aware of the benefits of such a system as it is built into a good deal of legislation.  I refer to the Auctioneers Acts and to a Bill which I had the privilege of piloting through this House, the Tour Operators and Travel Agents Bill which laid down a bonding procedure as a necessity.  Consequently I moved this amendment to establish a system of bonding.  One could say that an individual haulier could make his arrangements for bonding and take that in as evidence to the Department of Communications that he was of sound financial standing, but I am asking that it be written into the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is one to which I will have to give very careful consideration.  It was alluded to on Second Stage and in the Seanad.  I see very clearly the thinking behind it and, of course, it is linked to the requirement of sound financial standing. To require applicants for licensing to comply with a bonding scheme could have the effect of unduly restricting access to the industry.  The overall purpose of the Bill is the liberalisation of the transport industry.  The Irish Road Hauliers' Association want bonding for new entrants in order to limit access but, if a bonding scheme were introduced, it would almost certainly have to be applied to the existing operators as well as to the new entrants; otherwise there might be very serious charges of discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement in relation to financial standing under the EC directive and the provisions of that directive are implemented in this country by the European Community's Merchandise Road Transport Regulations of 1977.  Provision for a bonding scheme could more appropriately be made under these regulations. Arising out of Deputy Wilson's amendment we have had these regulations examined to see if they are wide enough as drafted to include a bonding scheme, <Col N="2338" /> if it is thought to be a good thing.  The answer we got was positive&mdash;that it would be a more appropriate place for this.  The regulations are being reviewed at present for other reasons and I have in mind that more effective criteria for satisfying the financial requirements will be introduced. The Transport Consultative Committee have recommended it.  Certainly I will be ready to look again at the question of a bonding scheme in the revision of the regulations.  If it is thought to be a good thing; nobody will turn it down.  I repeat the difficulty I see&mdash;that it might unduly restrict access to the industry.  We are trying, of course, to liberalise the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has said that the requirement to establish sound financial standing might restrict access to the industry.  The people who would not be able to get a bond would probably be those who are not of sound financial standing.  On what basis is a person determined to be of sound financial standing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an argument for bonding.  The person looking for a bond would have to go to a financial institution and that institution would not give a bond unless they were assured that the person seeking it was of sound financial standing. However, I would be concerned that the people who are not involved directly in business and in day-to-day financial transactions of that nature might not have the first hand experience to make a true judgment on sound financial standing. Therefore if a bonding system was acceptable and put into the Bill it would <Col N="2339" /> ensure that the people who would then be applying for licenses would be of sound financial standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation at the moment is that if a vehicle is taxed or insured in an operator's name, that is one way of fulfilling some of the financial criteria.  Another is a letter from a bank that the person involved has sufficient financial resources to set up in this type of business.  They are not very strenuous obligations.  That is why we are having a look at the whole area of financial requirements in the regulations.  It might prove difficult for new people coming in to get a bond.  Having said that, I repeat that I am happy to have a look at the question of bonding.  It may turn out to be a very excellent scheme and maybe the difficulties that we see in it do not exist.  Naturally what we and the Deputies who have spoken are trying to do is ensure that the people involved in this have the requirements for stability and have the necessary financial strength or backing to be involved in this industry.  I am interested in the bonding area and I will certainly have a look at it, and it can be done under the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to bonding, would the Minister not agree that a new entrant could be in a sound financial position today when he is getting the licence but that might not be the position tomorrow and that the industry itself feels there is a need for an assessment of the person's means to see if he can stay in business and that for that reason bonding is necessary to protect the customer at the end of the day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not go that far.  I do not want to defeat the main purpose of this Bill with some new provision such as putting in bonding.  Bonding can be very much looked at in the terms of the regulations and they are wide enough to accommodate it.  But I would be very much afraid that if we introduce bonding <Col N="2340" /> we might create extreme difficulty for people in the business.  I do not think we could possibly consider introducing it in the manner in which the Road Hauliers Association want it, that is, for access for new entrants.  I think we would run into difficulties at that stage.  I do not want to make it unduly restrictive because this is a liberalisation which is sought by everyone and is badly needed.  I am willing to have a look at the question of bonding and if it proves a good scheme, so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Strangely enough, I got the opposite impression from the Road Hauliers Association, that it was not an effort to restrict them but to make an easier road of access.  This is the impression I got from the argument as it was put to me.  In other words, a person who might not have in hard cash, enough money to satisfy the Department of his sound financial standing &mdash; although I am somewhat reassured by what the Minister said &mdash; might be able to get a bond on an annual subscription basis.  I do know that a load of lamb that was being exported by a company disappeared in France and they never heard tale or tidings of it afterwards. When the Minister refers to the regulations, would he tease that out a bit and let me know are they European regulations? What regulations is the Minister referring to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The current regulations about taxing or insuring a vehicle in the person's name are European regulations but we are entitled to make our own provisions within the regulations.  We are allowed to set the financial criteria ourselves but these conform generally to what is in operation on the European scence.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a little clarification. Section 2 (1) (b) provides that:</P>
      <P>every application shall state&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  whether it is for a national road freight carrier's licence under the Road Transport Act, 1985, or for an international road freight carrier's licence under that Act.</P>
      <P>If I understand correctly from discussion on Second Stage, the holder of an international road freight carrier's licence can conduct business within the State as well on a footing equal to the haulier who has a national road freight carrier's licence. It would seem then that a more sensible thing to do, considering that we are a member of the EC, would be to ignore the national road freight carrier's licence and apply for the international one. There may be something wrong with my thinking there, but if an individual or business was not engaged in international transport but wanted to keep the option open, the most logical thing to do would be to apply for an international road freight carrier's licence.  He or she could then continue to operate within the country until the international development had taken place and the firm was in a position to develop an international sector.  There may be an international heavier obligation to be fulfilled in the case of getting the international road freight carrier's licence and this may be where the flaw is in the argument, but I would like the Minister to clarify that.</P>
      <P>The application is to &ldquo;contain such information as will satisfy the Minister that the applicant complies with the requirements as to good repute...&rdquo; That is difficult.  I do not know what would satisfy the Department of communications as to the good repute of an individual. Where do you go looking for good repute?</P>
      <P>The purest treasure mortal times afford</P>
      <P>Is spotless reputation; that away Men are but gilded loam and painted clay.</P>
      <P>Who is in a position to tell the Department that an individual is of good repute? What kind of goodness? Moral goodness? Financial goodness? They are not always or even frequently the same. &ldquo;Sound financial standing&rdquo; is easy to get at.  The Minister of State mentioned letters from bankers and/or other financial institutions.  I am sure that can be assessed easily enough.  Owners of property of a certain value, land and professional competence are covered and I do not need to tease them out.  The professional competence will be assessed according to international standards or European standards and certified later.  I would like the Minister to comment on these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right as regards the validity and usefulness of an international and national carrier's licence being the same in the country here, but this is all about the old question of examinations.  Amongst the criteria for professional competence the examination for the international licence is the wider and has an international section, so I suppose some people might feel it would be easier to qualify under that section alone if they were not involved <Col N="2345" /> in the international situation and would prefer it that way.  That is the reason for the distinction but, as the Deputy points out, rightly, the usefulness, validity and thoroughness of the licence in each case for operation within the State are the same.  That is the reason for the two types.  In other words, there is an option if one prefers the national licence and thinks the examination in that respect is sufficient to be going on with, so to speak.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it would be wise as far as possible not to leave to subjective judgement the question of good repute.  The criteria of good repute are laid down in Community regulations, not by the community as such because it is up to the member state to provide the various criteria, but they must in turn be sanctioned by the Commission.  To give an example of what it is, it is not an individual thing; it is cumulative, so to speak.  In the case of illegal haulage, for instance, only a fine in excess of £50 is taken into consideration.  I am not saying that any individual thing eliminates a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a European limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is ours, but the commission have to be satisfied with our regulations and have to sanction them, but so far individual States are entitled to make their own set of requirements for good repute.  There are other matters, such as drunken driving, driving without tax or insurance, etc. but that is not any individual one of those.  The cumulative record will be taken in when the Minister makes his decision on this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be a little perturbed if I thought the national certificate by being that much easier to obtain were to be regarded as something of less value or validity than the one allowing a person to operate internationally.  It would not be desirable for that state of affairs to be allowed to continue.  What about people who already have international licences under ECMT or EC regulations? Will <Col N="2346" /> there be any question of examinations for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, strictly speaking, the criterion about examinations is one for further recruits to the haulage business.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  However, I should not like to denigrate the national carrier's licence and to say that it denotes a lesser competence than the international licence, but there is a section in the international examination which is particularly appropriate to people who would be carrying out road haulage on an international basis, regarding laws, geographical knowledge and traffic laws on the Continent.  However, that would not mean that the person who had a national licence only would be less worthy to conduct haulage in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern has just suggested that the man who got a pass would get a national licence and that the man who got honours would get an international licence which suggests a transposition of a quotation from the Minister's constituency &mdash; Pass Man, Horse by.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask about people who have been operating in the road haulage business for many years, who are honest and financially sound and have paid their taxes and so on over the years but who have not got licences.  Would good repute count in the case of those individuals if they applied for a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have to prove good repute when the Bill is passed. However, I am aware that there are many individuals who, although they do not have licences, have kept all the other laws.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not dealt adequately with my question.  How would good repute be applied to those individuals? Would the fact that they did not have a licence be held against them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2347" />
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there is a £50 fine for illegal haulage must be a factor but if illegal hauliers have not been convicted of drunken driving, driving without insurance or tax that would be a factor in their favour.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This section contains the substance of the Bill.  Subsection (1) (c) needs further clarification.  It says that the Minister shall grant, in accordance with this Act, &ldquo;to the holder, on the commencement of this section, of a current road freight certificate issued under regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, who is not the holder of an existing merchandise licence (or licences) or of a restricted road freight licence (or licences) under the Principal Act who is engaged in the business of road haulage operator in an area which is an exempted area within the meaning of section 8 (1) of the Principal Act (as amended before the commencement of this section), in substitution for such current road freight certificate, a national road freight carrier's licence or an international road freight carrier's licence.&rdquo; What is the significance of the European Communities Act, 1972? Could the Minister also say if there is any relevance in certificates issued by the European Commission of Ministers for Transport, an organisation which covers a wider area and includes more countries than those in the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The people in the exempted areas, even though they do not need a licence, require a road freight certificate in relation to the three elements about which we have been speaking. That is how the 1972 regulations of the EC come into it because they laid down the three particular areas requirements to which I referred.  I did not get <Col N="2348" /> the Deputy's last point about countries outside the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go over that section again.  It says that the Minister shall grant &ldquo;to the holder, on the commencement of the section, of a current road freight certificate issued under regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972 ...&rdquo;, Such a person only has a road freight certificate under the European Communities Act Regulations.  He does not have an existing merchandise licence or a restricted road freight licence but he is engaged as an operator in an exempt area which meant that he did not have to have a licence in that area.  Is the current road freight certificate simply taken from him? Does he then get a national or international road freight carrier's licence in lieu of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes that is the situation. Apparently, if one is in an exempted area like Dublin or Cork in which there is a ferry service, has an international licence and does not need to operate any further within the State that person can operate internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The other part of my question related to licences held from the European Council of Ministers of Transport, the ECMT licences.  Are they covered by subsection (1) (c)? They were very precious and were very much in demand by hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section refers to Irish operators only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to Irish operators who under a special arrangement held licences, permits or permissions to operate from the European Council of Ministers of Transport.  I presume that body still exists.  Are those hauliers covered in this and, if not, are they covered in any section of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, those people would also hold a licence from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2349" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that individual of necessity hold a licence from the Department? We are talking about some licences held under the EC Act without having to have anything from our licensing authority.  Is that correct? The subsection states:</P>
      <P>... of a current road freight certificate issued under regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, who is not the holder of an existing merchandise licence (or licences) or of a restricted road freight licence (or licences) under the Principal Act who is engaged in the business ... which is an exempted area ...</P>
      <P>The business of such an operator may have been in an exempted area and he may have had a licence under the EC Act to operate outside the country but will that person get a national or international licence? I am wondering if there is an ECMT gap there? Will the Minister have a look at that matter before Report Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a person has to have an international road freight certificate to get an ECMT licence.  The position of that person will not be affected by the section before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a person would have to have an existing international licence?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have a number of points clarified.  The holders of licences under the 1971 Act related to the number of vehicles owned.  Will one licence cover any number of vehicles and, conversely, in the case of a partnership, will more than one licence be issued for the one vehicle? How will that relate to the existing position? The two year clause mentioned in subsection (6) has been a very argumentative point between different aspects of the industry.  Will the Minister tell the House why he selected a period of two years? What circumstances <Col N="2350" /> will obtain in two years' time that will not apply in one year's time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>One licence will be issued per applicant and a partnership will be treated as one applicant.  There is no limit on the number of vehicles per licence. The reason two years was chosen is because some people may be slow to renew their licences and may overlook this.  Those who had a licence will be allowed in within a period of two years prior to the coming into force of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the provision in regard to partnership not leave a loophole? If an individual of bad repute realised he did not have a chance of getting a licence he could set up a partnership with a person who may be new to the business.  Is that not a loophole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is covered because the partnership will have to be designated and the record of the partners will be taken into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will those who have been forced to operate without a licence but have proved to be reputable be granted an interim licence for a period of two years so as to give them an opportunity to apply for a licence under the new law rather than keeping them in the wilderness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of enforcement is there any provision in the Bill concerning the displaying of the licensing arrangements on a vehicle as we have in regard to tax and insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>If we gave interim licences to illegal hauliers they would be placed on the same footing as the legal hauliers and I do not think that would be fair in the circumstances.  The two year transition <Col N="2351" /> period is reasonable taking everything into consideration.  It was difficult to pick the time span because arguments could be made for a shorter and a longer period. The question of display of the licensing arrangements was raised in the Seanad but there is not such a provision in the Bill.  As I said on that occasion, I will give consideration to the matter.  The point was made very strongly in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no provision in the Bill for display of the licensing arrangements what section gives the Minister power to introduce those arrangements subsequently? Is it not more logical to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to insist on a simple disc being displayed to indicate that the owner is conforming with the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>A point was made in the Seanad about the difficulty of getting an absolutely identifiable disc that would be easily recognised at a distance.  Under the 1933 Act vehicles must be plated and that regulation continues in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the existing plates changed hands at very substantial prices up to comparatively recently.  Deputy Yates's intervention prompted this question from me: three people each pay £3,000 and each has a legal right to a third of a plate.  On the transfer now to the new system where will they stand, the people who have that kind of investment? Will only one of them get the new licence or can they, as a <i>troika</i>, get the licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dependent on whose name the licence is in, but generally speaking in order to qualify, it had to be a partnership or a company.  The final test will be in whose name the existing licence obtains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying then, that at present where there is such an operation that one name only attaches to the licence or are there any instances of two or three names attaching to a licence, as such?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2352" />
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are partnerships listed but, in the final analysis, that will be the test; I do not think any other test could be applied.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) raises the question of an international road freight carrier's licence qualifying the holder to carry on a merchandise road transport business either inside or outside the State with such vehicles as may be specified in the licence.  I note that the vehicles must be specified in the licence.  How does that square with what was said to Deputy Yates, namely, that there would be no limit on the number of vehicles? Is there a limit or what does &ldquo;specified&rdquo; mean when it is stated, &ldquo;with such vehicles as may be specified in the licence&rdquo;? What exactly do those words mean?</P>
      <P>I might as well make my other points while I am on my feet.  I am a little puzzled about subsection (3) which reads:</P>
      <P>Every merchandise licence shall also operate subject to the relevant provisions of this Act..</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; we mean the Road Transport Bill, 1985 when it becomes an Act. What does &ldquo;(as amended by the Road Transport Act, 1985)&rdquo; mean? Is that this Act, or does that refer back to the Principal Act? The wording is obscure and, if recast, could be clarified somewhat. When it talks about &ldquo;this Act&rdquo;, naturally it should be remembered that this is a substituted section.  Consequently &ldquo;this Act&rdquo;, in a substituted section, should not refer to the Principal Act but to this Act, the Road Transport Act &mdash; as I hope it will be &mdash; 1985.  It strikes me as being a kind of incestuous amendment, an Act amending itself.  I may be right in speculating that it is the Principal Act, as defined.  I think the Principal Act has <Col N="2353" /> been defined as the 1933 Act in the definitions section.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would comment on those points, what is meant by the phrase: &ldquo;with such vehicles as may be specified in the licence&rdquo; both in the national and international context? Also, what does that obscure, mixed-up, incestuous kind of sentence mean?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained when replying to Deputy Yates, there is no limit on the actual numbers but, in making the applications, the particular operator, company or whoever it is must give the registration numbers.  If he wishes to add to it subsequently he has to give the extra registration numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Or if he changes during the year he has to as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  But there is no limit.  He can have as many as he wishes, or as great a number as he wishes, but he just has to give the registration numbers.  I understand that those numbers are written into the licence given to the particular haulier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree absolutely with what Deputy Wilson has said about that and about subsection (3).  This is one of the difficulties that arises from the lack of consolidation at this stage.  Indeed, there is a proliferation in the whole Bill of this kind of thing and it is extremely difficult to follow.  I want to make that point.  This is simply a new section that will go into the old 1933 Act.  Therefore, when it refers to &ldquo;this Act&rdquo;, it is referring to the 1933 Act.  I am sure the Deputy will have noticed, in preparation for the Committee Stage discussion, the number of times it occurs and, indeed, the virtual impossibility to follow it at first glance without having carried out a thorough study of it. I hope it will be consolidated at some stage in the not too distant future.  As the Deputy will have seen, in the earlier stages, this deals with the Road Transport Acts of 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1956, 1971, 1978 and the Transport Acts of <Col N="2354" /> 1944 and 1958.  There are references to all of those Acts in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I share in the general confusion about the different types of licences. Subsection (4) says that a merchandise licence shall not be transferable.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify for me, in relation to &ldquo;own account&rdquo; transport, what would be the situation in the event of a business having gone into liquidation. What would be the rights of a liquidator in those circumstances over a company sold as a going concern? Would that have no effect on &ldquo;own account&rdquo; transport or would the transferability of that merchandise licence not apply in that instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that an &ldquo;own account&rdquo; carrier does not need a licence.  There is provision in another case &mdash; not exactly similar but we shall be dealing with it later &mdash; where a person may die, where a haulier may die, for accommodation for his wife and family. That is dealt with in details in a later section.  That is a different matter from what is being raised now.  There is no such thing as a transferable licence.  As everybody knows, there was the possibility under the existing legislation that the Minister had power, in certain circumstances, to transfer a merchandise licence because the quantitative restriction licence that may have been required for monetary values about which we have been talking was never really intended</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that, in the circumstances of the business mentioned by Deputy Yates &mdash; and I intended to make a point about that transference &mdash; I presume that prescinding from the licence thing the provisions of the Act will not interfere with the value and goodwill of a built up business.  If one prescinds altogether from the licence the goodwill of the business could be sold, not the licence itself.  The new person who bought a goodwill could then apply and if he fulfilled the conditions, he could get a licence for that business.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>It is a separate question. Indeed, I could possibly take in the question of liquidation for a licence holder, when the new owner of the business would be eligible to apply for a new licence if he qualified.  With regard to Deputy Wilson's point about the vehicles and all of that type of thing, naturally all of that would have a value.  The existence of the licence would not enhance the value of the asset because the next person would have to apply for a licence, and he would have to prove eligibility.  Of course goodwill comes into it.</P>

      <P>I should like to know something about the effects of the Bill on own accounts transport.  One with an own account system might go for hire to a large company, such as Cadburys or Guinness.  If such a person decided his overheads were very high and he decided to supplement his turnover by doing some transport for Rowntree-Mackintosh, for example, surely that would be totally anomalous.  A professional haulier will have to comply with the full rigours of this legislation but another person who decided to do a bit on the side would be totally exempt.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has made an interesting point.  If an own account firm wished to get into trading for another he would have to apply for a licence like anyone else and if he were otherwise qualified he would get a licence.  There are many theories about what will happen under this legislation.  There is an opinion that there will be a great movement of own account people into the licensed haulage area.  That has been the experience in other countries.  We cannot forecast what will happen but my guess is that a large proportion of goods carried will move to professional licensed hauliers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, after line 51, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) provided always that such revocation or suspension may be appealed to the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment was not tabled because I had no confidence in any Minister but on the basis that a citizen should have a right of appeal.  Some legislation that came before the House from the Department of Communications recently, for instance, the Canals Bill, was amended, the Minister accepting an amendment of mine.  This amendment proposed to give the citizen another bite at the cherry if he or she is not satisfied with the decision of the Minister.  Other suggestions have been put forward by professionals in the field about a special tribunal &mdash; some of my colleagues may speak about that suggestion &mdash; but I want a provision that the person who applies should feel that there is an avenue open for him or her to appeal to an independent tribunal.  All too often people who fail for perfectly valid reasons when dealing with Departments resurrect all types of accusations against the Minister.  They say political influence was brought to bear or that some official in the Department would not give the person a licence if he <Col N="2357" /> or she were applying until Tibb's Eve. Everyone in public life is familiar with that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>I want the appeal to be to the High Court.  It is necessary to have such a safeguard.  The amendment proposes to put in a new paragraph in substitution for subsection (3) of section 24 of the Principal Act.  The wording of this section is provocative because it suggests that the Minister may at any time on his own motion and at his discretion revoke or suspend for such period as he shall think proper a merchandise license:</P>
    <P>(a)  on the ground that, in his opinion, there has been a breach of or a failure to observe or comply with a condition attached to the licence,</P>
    <P>(b)  on the ground that the holder has been convicted of an offence (whether under this or any other Act) in relation to the business to which the licence relates or a vehicle used in such business,</P>
    <P>(c)  if the holder ceases to comply with any relevant requirement specified or referred to in regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, or</P>
    <P>(d)  on the ground that, in his opinion, there has been a failure to comply with a relevant provision of this Act or of regulations made thereunder.</P>
    <P>The Minister is acting as a kind of judge and jury for the EC and I do not think it is healthy that this subsection should stand without giving applicants recourse to some preferably outside authority.  The Bill refers to &ldquo;regulations made thereunder&rdquo;. That covers a very wide field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the principle and the thinking behind Deputy Wilson's amendment that there should be a right of appeal against the Minister's power to revoke or suspend a licence, there should also be provision for an appeal against refusal to grant a licence.  There is an appeal provision in the EC regulations which would apply where a Minister refuses a licence on the ground that the <Col N="2358" /> applicant for the licence, or the licence as the case may be, does not comply with the requirement of those regulations.  On reconsideration, it might be better to have the appeal provision in the Bill and I am putting forward an amendment to include a section covering appeals against both refusal to grant and revocation or suspension of a licence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will raise the serious ongoing discrimination being imposed by the British army on the officers, members and supporters of Crossmaglen GAA Club, County Armagh, within the Anglo-Irish Conference; and if he will make a statement on this very serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my own behalf and that of the Oireachtas Members of the Border counties and in particular on behalf of Deputy Kirk who represents County Louth, which adjoins the Crossmaglen area, I want to thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me this opportunity to raise this very serious matter.  I am very disappointed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has not come here tonight to take this question.  He was in the House today but we did not have an opportunity to raise the matter.  As a member of the Anglo-Irish Conference, his absence is disappointing.  Crossmaglen GAA park is the only available recreational area in Crossmaglen and is also one of the three GAA grounds in County Armagh classified as county grounds and suitable for inter-county matches.  It is known that Crossmaglen Rangers' Gaelic Football Club provide recreational facilities for people of all ages, male and female, but <Col N="2359" /> especially for those between ten and 35 years of age.  Outdoor facilities are provided through field games and indoor facilities in the hall and adjoining complex. All these facilities have been provided by the club without Government or local authority aid.  The unauthorised use of the club's property is involved and the unnecessary harassment and failure to keep successive promises made by the British Government and their civil representatives in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Since 1971 the British army have occupied a number of areas of the property and have caused considerable damage to the entire property.  Two portions of the property are still retained by the British army, one being an undefined right of way which the army took by requisition order in 1976 and which included one of two entrances to the property owned by Crossmaglen Rangers' GAA Club. Without amending the order, the British army took control of the second entrance into the ground.</P>

      <P>Various negotiations have been going on over the years through the successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs, through the Department of Foreign Affairs with both Ambassadors here, with the British Government and their representatives.  Over the years various commitments have been made, even in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Humphrey Atkins, who on 11 July 1980 stated that he proposed to return to the GAA all land taken in 1974 and that he hoped an amicable settlement could be reached with the GAA regarding <Col N="2360" /> other issues.  This is recorded in Hansard, the official record of the House of Commons.</P>
      <P>A meeting took place in the House of Commons on 17 July 1980 between Mr. Michael Allison, Minister of State representing the British Government, and a GAA delegation led by the president of the association at that time, Mr. Paddy McFlynn from County Down and Mr. Con Murphy from Cork, the outoing president at that time.  Mr. Allison was questioned by the delegation as to the content of Mr. Atkins's statement in the House of Commons on 11 July 1980.  In reply, Mr. Allison stated that his Government did not intend to return all the land taken in 1974 but that they would return approximately half of it.  In response to further questioning regarding the major discrepancy between his statement and that of Mr. Atkins in the Commons six days earlier, all he could say was that this was only an interpretation of what Mr. Atkins had said.</P>
      <P>That is only one of many instances of double-crossing, double-dealing and failing to honour commitments at the highest levels to officials and members of the Crossmaglen GAA club.  It is quite clear that Mr. Atkins deliberately misled the House of Commons and that Mr. Allison was not prepared to make any concession whatsoever regarding the commitment given in the House of Commoons by Mr. Atkins on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, the British army decided to build a 20 foot wall on the GAA property, on the external side of the proposed army base.  The British Ambassador to Ireland on 14 July 1980 assured the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs at that time, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that no work would be carried out on the erection of that wall until further discussions had taken place with the officers and members of Crossmaglen GAA club, that regardless of the decision no work would start before September 1980.  In actual fact, work had already been started by the British army two days prior to the meeting with Deputy Lenihan in Dublin and continued right through the month of July <Col N="2361" /> and the wall was almost complete by September 1980.  This again illustrates the failure of the British Government and their agents and members to honour the commitments given at that time.</P>
    <P>We discussed this matter in this House on a number of occasions and in 1984 Deputy Kirk and I raised the matter on the Adjournment of the House.  We asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs at that time, Deputy Peter Barry, if he would visit Crossmaglen and investigate the situation for himself.  I should like to know tonight if he has done that and has got an up to date factual knowledge of the exact position.  I want to know if he is aware that the British army are using both entrances unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>There were options available to them not to have to use those entrances at all. First, they had a permanent entrance on to the Culvoille Road on the western side of the army base; secondly, there was another secondary entrance on to that same road; thirdly, for ten years there was available a derelict site, the property of the Northern Ireland Minister for Education between the army base and the main road alongside the Crossmaglen GAA headquarters.  This could have been acquired from the Minister for Education and used as a permanent exit or entry point by the British army to their base, but they never used that derelict site and it has now been disposed of, to prove that there is a need to use the GAA entrances.</P>
    <P>There has been total discrimination against the members of the Crossmaglen club for a long number of years, particularly since 1971.  They have been held up on their way to matches and have even been intimidated on their way to Mass.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago, on their way to play a game in Lurgan they were help up in Portadown for one and a half hours by the UDR.  The police were called, but no action was taken.  Now we have the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in that both Governments reaffirmed their <Col N="2362" /> commitment to a society in Northern Ireland in which all may live in peace, free from discrimination and intolerance and with the opportunity for both communities to participate fully in the structures and the processes of government.  As far as I am concerned, this is total discrimination against Nationalist members in Northern Ireland.  This total harassment has been going on for far too long.  The county secretary in Armagh, Mr. Gerry Fagan, intervened two weeks ago when the club were held up on their way to Lurgan and he, as a senior representative of the GAA, got no response from the police on the matter.  RTE have covered what has been happening.  They have seen at first hand the wanton destruction being inflicted on this property in Northern Ireland.  In the past three weeks three different stretches of the fence, each ten feet wide, have been destroyed by the Army.  The Crossmaglen club will receive an agreed refund for that damage.  The case will not be going to court because the British army do not allow that to happen.  Such destruction causes a great deal of inconvenience to people who are trying to provide facilities in a town of about 1,500 people and where there has been large scale unemployment.  The GAA are the only organisation who have tried to provide these facilities but they are being discriminated against constantly. Major damage has been caused to the structure of the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one stage a helicopter pad was sited on the GAA grounds but after negotiations with the Department of Foreign Affairs here, the pad was relocated at the army base.  It is our information that this is a very large army base and that underground there, there is a very strong fortress. One wonders what the need for this structure is in an area so close to the Border.  Helicopters fly constantly over the GAA property.  Games have been interrupted by these machines flying too low.  Major destruction has been caused to the club's social centre as a result of helicopters flying too close to the roof. With Deputies Kirk and Collins I visited the club some time ago.  The damage on <Col N="2363" /> the western side of the centre was very obvious.</P>
    <P>Last year there was a settlement of £150,000 agreed in court between the British authorities and the Crossmaglen club to cover damage to the property and its confiscation up to that time.  There will be other claims but the commitment given that the grounds would be restored and returned to the club has not been honoured.  We are asking the Government to proceed through the Anglo-Irish Conference to ensure that this will be done.</P>
    <P>There has been constant discrimination against members and supporters of the club.  Two weeks ago a 22 year old man coming from a shop after buying a bag of chips was stabbed seven times by four people in tracksuits who jumped over an adjacent wall.  That man would very likely have died had it not been for the fact that someone came on the scene quickly.  He was rushed to hospital and is recovering.  Three days later four soldiers from the army base were charged with the attack.  The case is now <i>sub judice</i> but it is typical of what has been happening in that area for a long time.</P>
    <P>I submit to the House that whoever controls the entrances to any property virtually controls the entire property. Technically or legally they may not have ownership rights but because of what the army have been doing in this instance under the Emergency Powers Act they can be said to virtually control the whole destiny and progress of the Crossmaglen GAA grounds.  The club have major plans to develop the grounds.  In that respect they applied ten years ago for planning permission but the conditions being imposed by the British army were so stringent and difficult as to render it impossible for the club to proceed with the development.  That development is needed urgently for what was one of the prime county grounds in Armagh.  The club applied again recently for planning permission but the army will not allow them to proceed unless they are given a temporary base protective structure. Such structure would cut the members of <Col N="2364" /> the club and the players away from the western side of the grounds.  By way of compromise, all the army were prepared to allow was a passage through which supporters might or might not pass.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as a member of a sovereign Government operating within the conference with another sovereign Government to ensure that this problem is debated and discussed so that a consensus can be reached.  Whatever decision might be taken as a result of that consensus should be put into operation in Crossmaglen so that there would be restored to the club members and supporters the right to pursue pastimes in a normal and reasonable atmosphere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Treacy for giving me the opportunity to speak on this motion.  He has outlined graphically for us the difficulty of the people of Crossmaglen and particularly of the members of the Rangers club.  The British army have been occupying the GAA grounds in the town since the early seventies. Their attitude in the intervening years has been one of provocation and aggravation.  This is a humiliation and an insult to the people of Crossmaglen.</P>
      <P>The playing area and the area for spectators have been curtailed severely because of the construction of the army base.  The fencing and the playing area have been damaged severely.  The fencing around the field has been cut regularly. Helicopters have landed on the grounds during matches, using the playing area as a landing pad.  one can visualise what the playing surface in the field was like when that was happening.  In addition, army landrovers made their way through the field.  That was a deliberate provocation and left a very sour taste with those involved with a voluntary organisation in trying to provide recreational facilities for the club and for the people of the south Armagh area. Matches were being disrupted regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last October I was at a match there and just at my heel there was a British soldier in camouflage.  He leaped out from the undergrowth in the surrounding <Col N="2365" /> area.  There were other occasions when up to 20 or 25 soldiers emerged from that undergrowth sending people running in fear.  At times young children were looking down the barrels of the guns of the British soldiers while matches were in progress.  In view of all the aggravation that has been caused to players and spectators at the grounds one would expect the British army to stay away from the spectator area when matches are in progress. At the match I attended there was a large number of people present.  The people of Crossmaglen have been living with this aggravation for many years.  All the indications are that the problem will continue for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>We will be looking to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise this matter immediately with the British authorities at the first available opportunity.  The time has come for the British army to leave those playing grounds.  The people of the area must be allowed to pursue their recreational facilities without interference from the army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Treacy began his contribution by thanking you for allowing him to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  In describing the problem as an ongoing one he was not exaggerating.  It is a problem that has been discussed in this House during very many years.</P>
      <P>During the course of the afternoon while briefing myself on this subject I discovered that my colleague Deputy Kenny, Minister of State with responsibility for sport, raised this matter on several occasions during the seventies.  While I have not seen the report I gather at an even earlier stage it was raised by the late Deputy Loughnane.  As Deputy Treacy commented, it has been the concern of successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs and successive Governments of different persuasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems of the Crossmaglen Rangers GAA Club have an importance that goes well beyond the effects on the local people themselves, though that of itself <Col N="2366" /> is important.  This was spelled out by both Deputy Treacy and Deputy Kirk.  They have an importance which goes beyond that because they serve as an example of the serious disruption which the present troubles in Northern Ireland have brought to people in their daily lives. Because the Department have recognised, and more specifically because the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, has recognised, the very real difficulties that the club, their officers and members are experiencing, that the Minister directed that senior officials of the Department should visit Crossmaglen to inspect the club and speak with their officers and members to brief themselves in the greatest possible detail on the subject.  The effects of the violence in Northern Ireland and the security measures to which that violence has given rise have had an immediate and continuing effect on the sporting activities of Crossmaglen Rangers GAA Club.</P>
    <P>Much of the history has been referred to but it might be useful if I put it in some sort of a time span.  The problems faced by the club in Crossmaglen first arose in the early seventies at the time the British army began to use the RUC station adjacent to the GAA grounds as a base for their operations.  As the level of activity at the army base grew in response to the security situation, the club found their games disrupted by low flying helicopters and, in some instances, these helicopters even landed on the GAA pitch.  One would not need to be an inter-county footballer &mdash; and there is at least one in the House at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to work out what the effects on a playing surface would be.  The construction of a helicopter pad within the base added further complications and necessitated the requisitioning of land belonging to the GAA in order to meet the needs of an expanding military base.  In 1974, part of the club's property was taken over by the British authorities.  In 1976, a further slice of the <Col N="2367" /> club's property was taken over.  Clearly, the club suffered considerably from this loss of land and from the disruption which was caused by the proximity of the army base.</P>
      <P>The club have experienced many difficulties over the past number of years in their sporting and social activities ranging from loss of revenue and damage to property to reported harrassment of members of the club on the club grounds.  These have been discussed in detail with the GAA on a number of occasions and the specific problems outlined were raised with the British authorities on many occasions who say they have not had specific complaints in recent times such as those outlined by Deputy Treacy.  I will undertake to have those specifics he mentioned looked into.  I do not want to go into detail as the Deputy says the case he mentioned is <i>sub judice</i>, but it is worth commenting that people were charged in the aftermath of that incident and charged very quickly.</P>
      <P>What then is the continuing difficulty? The major difficulty is, of course, that the British army continue to hold land which has been requisitioned from the club.  The situation we see today has improved greatly when compared with that which existed in the late seventies because, as was mentioned in the earlier contributions, in response to repeated pressure from the Department of Foreign Affairs together with the activities of the GAA and the club, a considerable portion of the confiscated portion of the confiscated land was returned.  That is to be welcomed but the fact still remains that some land belonging to the GAA still remains within the British army base. Obviously, that is a source of difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second issue is the damage which has been done to the club in material and financial terms.  The pitch has been damaged as we have said.  Walls and fences have been knocked down and the clubhouse on at least one occasion has been damaged by an army vehicle.  To point to some changed circumstances, the fact that Deputy Treacy was able to tell <Col N="2368" /> the House that the most recent damage is to be compensated for without the necessity for prolonged litigation &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that Deputy Treacy can expect that compensation will be rapidly forthcoming is a change on the situation that existed some years ago when the club were denied compensation which they were so obviously due and left without it for many years.</P>
      <P>There has been a severe financial loss because of the disruption of the club's sporting and anciliary social activities. On that basis, they submitted a substantial compensation claim to the Northern Ireland authorities.  That claim was a prolonged affair and it went on and on.  My Department were involved on a number of occasions with the British authorities and eventually the claim was settled out of court in February of last year.  My understanding is that the amount of the settlement was as indicated by Deputy Treacy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle will come to my assistance, if required.  I gather what has now evolved is that the club are proposing to put that compensation to use.  What they have in mind is to restore and develop the facilities at Crossmaglen and to get on with work which, for the regrettable circumstances which existed over recent years, might have been long since undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Problems still persist and I would single out one particular issue, namely, that of the right of way which the British army <Col N="2369" /> have exercised at the rear of the grounds. This right of way stretches across the entry to the GAA grounds and it virtually encircles the clubhouse.  The existence of such a right of way and its frequent use during building operations in the late seventies seriously impeded access to the clubhouse and impaired the freedom of the members to make full use of the club's facilities.  It was a vehicle making use of that right of way which inflicted the damage on the clubhouse to which I made reference earlier.  While construction work at the barracks in June last year again involved the use of the right of way with consequent inconvenience and disruption to the club's activities, my understanding is that its use has declined, though it remains a problem for the club and a cause of friction.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has urged the British authorities to give up the right of way and to secure access to the base through alternative means.  Efforts are continuing to be made along these lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the difficulties faced by the Crossmaglen Rangers GAA Club and I have on many occasions raised specific matters with the British authorities. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the problem dates back to the early seventies when the British army began to use the RUC station adjacent to the GAA grounds as a base for their operations, requisitioning part of the club's land for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The principal difficulties experienced by the club were delay in compensation for loss of land, a right of way across club property used by the British army and the club's inability in all the circumstances to fully enjoy and develop their facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following agreement in February 1985, the Northern Ireland authorities settled the outstanding compensation claim which the GAA had brought in respect of the loss and damage resulting from the operations of the British army. As to the issue of the right of way, I understand its use by the British army has declined in recent years although its <Col N="2203" /> continued existence remains a problem for the club and a cause of friction.</P>
    <P>I will continue to be responsive to the views of the GAA on this point and others which inhibit the enjoyment and development of the club and will take up issues appropriately with the British authorities.  It is not clear from the Deputy's question whether he is referring to some specific recent incident involving officers, members or supporters of Crossmaglen GAA Club.  If such is the case, perhaps he would let me have details of the complaint.</P>

      <P>Ireland, as one of the 35 states which participated in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, is represented at the meeting of experts on human contacts in the CSCE framework which opened in Berne on 15 April.  The meeting, which will continue for six weeks, was preceded by a two-week preparatory meeting.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Berne meeting is to discuss the development of contacts among persons, institutions and organisations in the context of the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and the Madrid Concluding Document.  These provisions are designed to facilitate the resolution of specific problems which arise because of restrictions imposed by some Governments of the movement of their citizens across frontiers.  They cover the whole range of human contacts, including the reunification of families and marriage between citizens of different states, contacts and regular meetings on the basis of family ties, travel for personal or professional reasons, contacts and meetings between religious organisations, tourism, exchanges among young people and sporting contacts.  The broader questions of religious and racial discrimination mentioned by the Deputy, which were already dealt with in detail at a CSCE meeting of experts on human rights in Ottawa in May-June 1985, are not covered by the mandate of the Berne meeting which focuses rather on specific measures aimed at solving problems in the areas I have mentioned.  However, all of these questions will be considered again in a review of implementation of all the provisions of the Final Act and the Madrid Concluding Document at the next follow-up meeting of the conference which is scheduled to begin in November 1986 in Vienna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Berne meeting the Irish delegation, together with our partners in the Twelve, will seek to ensure that a thorough examination takes place of the <Col N="2207" /> manner and extent to which the CSCE participating states have fulfilled their existing commitments in the area of human contacts.  We will also make an active contribution to the exploration of possibilities for resolving the problems created by legislative and administrative restrictions which hinder the free movement of people across frontiers, including contacts and meetings between members of religious faiths, institutions and organisations. Among other improvements, we will be seeking to facilitate unimpeded access to postal communications.  Our ultimate objective at Berne is to try to bring about concrete improvements in the lives of all those most directly affected by the divisions in Europe.  We would wish to see a substantive outcome to the meeting in the form of a concluding document containing agreement on measures to improve implementation of the commitments already undertaken at Helsinki and Madrid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am aware that some employers, including small building contractors, are experiencing difficulties in obtaining liability insurance cover and are faced with increased premium levels.  I have expressed my concern at this situation on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The root cause of difficulties in the liability market is the enormous underwriting <Col N="2208" /> losses being sustained by insurers on this class of business.  These losses amounted to almost £36 million in 1983. In the face of losses of this size, insurers have naturally been more selective in the risks they take on and careful that premiums charged accurately reflect the risk being underwritten.</P>
    <P>My statutory function in relation to insurance companies is to ensure that they meet their statutory reserve and solvency requirements.  I have no power to compel companies to take on particular risks or to dictate to them what constitutes a reasonable cost.  The cost of insurance is directly related to the frequency of claims and the size of the eventual awards.  One of these factors is to a large degree under the control of employers. Studies have shown that a high proportion of industrial accidents are avoidable and consequently the importance of adequate safety precautions in the work-place cannot be over-emphasised.  In relation to the size of awards made, the Minister for Justice recently published a Bill to give effect to the Government's decision to abolish jury trials in cases of personal injury.  I am confident that this measure will result at least in a stabilisation of award levels and a consequent stabilisation of premiums.</P>
    <P>For those finding it impossible to obtain a quotation for liability insurance, I have an arrangement with the Irish Insurance Federation to investigate these cases with a view to obtaining cover.  Any individual case of difficulty should be referred directly to the insurance section of my Department.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As I indicated in a written reply on 9 April, the general thrust of Government policy involves a movement away from detailed price controls in favour of measures to promote greater competition throughout the economy.

In addition, all of the basic powers in relation to price control in the Prices Acts are being retained.  The necessary amendment of the restrictive practices legislation to give effect to the new regime is in preparation at present.  Work is also proceeding in regard to the establishment of appropriate staffing arrangements, including the provision of staffing, as necessary, for prices duties.</P>

      <P>Official statistics are not available from which such costings could be derived. However, from investigations in my Department it appears that the full year cost involved in excluding from the retention tax the interest income of persons, voluntary organisations and other non-corporate bodies, such as pension funds etc., which would not otherwise be liable to tax, could be of the order of £50 million <Col N="2218" /> to £70 million.  Of this amount some £25 million to £40 million could be in respect of non-liable persons while some £15 million to £20 million could be in respect of voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>The amount which could qualify for tax relief in respect of the capital cost of a car was limited to £2,500 by virtue of sections 25 to 30 of the Finance Act, 1973.  The limit applied in general to expenditure incurred on or after 16 May 1973.</P>
      <P>The restriction was subsequently eased so that at present the allowance is limited to £3,500 by virtue of section 31 of the Finance Act, 1976, in respect of expenditure incurred after 28 January 1976.  A new restriction, also based on £3,500, was introduced by section 32 of that Act to limit the amount of car running expenses which could qualify for tax relief.</P>
      <P>The only relevant information available as to cost is in regard to the direct cost to the Exchequer in income tax and corporation tax foregone if the limits mentioned in the question were substituted for the £4,000 limits in relation to capital cost and running expenses proposed in this year's Finance Bill.

      <P>Where a person has less than 156 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment, entitlement to disability benefit is limited to 52 weeks.</P>
      <P>According to the records of the Department the person concerned has only 65 contributions paid on her behalf since entry into insurance.  She was paid disability benefit from 7 January 1985 and her entitlement became exhausted on 6 January 1986.  However, because of an administrative error payment continued up to 21 April 1986 resulting in an overpayment of £500.95.</P>

      <P>My Department does not normally provide playing fields for second level schools.  In the case of community schools the development of playing fields is a matter for the board of management in co-operation with the local community with the Department making a grant towards the cost.</P>
      <P>A grant for this purpose was approved for Bailieboro community school in February 1983 and subsequently paid to the board of management.  It is understood that the work has yet to be completed and that the board will be making a further application to the Department.  This will be considered on receipt.</P>
