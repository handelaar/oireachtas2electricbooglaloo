      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has any proposals to arrange for the transfer to this country from Britain of State papers relating to this country prior to 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no specific proposals in mind.  This could be considered by the Director of the National Archives following the passing of the National Archives legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware if any survey has been made of the quantity of material relating to Ireland in the British archives and has there been any discussion between the archivists about the possible transfer to this country of some of the material originating in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a comprehensive survey has been carried out, although of course some work has been done as people carry out their historical researches.  I suspect the position is fairly complex in that probably there is material that is purely Irish in the British archives <Col N="2658" /> and also British material about Ireland and disentangling that could be quite a problem.  There may well be material here which relates at least to Northern Ireland, if not to Britain.  I suspect history has left us with rather a tangle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the public records kept in London would contain, for instance, many detailed reports of the state of different counties here which would no longer be of any significant interest to British historians?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That could well be the case and I think it is one the Director of the National Archives could take up in due course.  The immediate task facing us is the transfer to the National Archives within two years of all records of more than 30 years standing which are to be released by Departments.  The timetable for that is tight and I think he will probably find himself concentrating on that task in the first instance.  However, I hope he will also find it possible to examine the question of what type of material there may be in British hands that relates specifically to Ireland, which is of primary interest to us and which might possibly be returned.  Perhaps that will come at a slightly later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the comments made by the General Secretary of the Irish Bank Officials' Association that the banks were operating a policy of discrimination against women employees and women customers; if it is intended to make any representations to the banks on this matter; if it is intended to take any other measures on these allegations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, it is unlawful to discriminate on grounds of sex or marital status in relation to terms <Col N="2659" /> and conditions of employment including access to associated benefits, or in the provision of opportunities for promotion. It is open to a trade union or to any employee to refer complaints of sex discrimination in this regard to the Labour Court for investigation under the 1977 Act.  In addition, the Employment Equality Agency advise on the preparation of such references and may, where necessary, provide assistance in the actual preparation of the reference.  I would strongly recommend anybody who feels aggrieved at what they believe may be discriminatory policies, rules and practices in their employment, to have recourse to this enforcement machinery if they have not themselves been able to secure redress.</P>
      <P>I appreciate, however, that the existence of anti-discrimination legislation is not enough in itself to achieve equal opportunity in employment.  The legislation must be complemented by positive steps to redress the effects of past discrimination and to achieve changes in behaviour.  Past discrimination endures in outmoded attitudes &mdash; such as the view that women do not want careers &mdash; or stereotypical assumptions about customer preference which, if allowed to go unchallenged, can work to the detriment of female staff.</P>
      <P>I would urge the IBOA and the main banks to enter into consultations together on the development of a comprehensive equal opportunities programme in each bank.  A commitment to positive action should be a central element in such a programme, which should also include arrangements for the continuing review of the different rates of promotion of men and women and a close study of the extent to which hazards to fairness may arise in the promotion process, particularly in regard to mobility requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any reference in the statement attributed to the General Secretary of the Irish Bank Officials' Association to discrimination against women customers although I note it is in the Deputy's question.  However, I am <Col N="2660" /> happy to inform the Deputy that, following upon Ireland's accession to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women last December, my office is at present in the process of drafting legislation which will <i>inter alia,</i> address the issues raised in the Deputy's question. The broad purpose of the legislation is to build upon the existing provisions in Irish law regarding equality in the employment field by addressing discrimination against women in economic and social life generally, with particular reference to the right to bank loans, mortgages and other forms of financial credit.  The legislation will enable women who consider themselves to have been discriminated against in these areas to seek legal redress through the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that detailed reply.  Incidentally my question is incorrectly worded.  It should refer to women employees as customers, rather than women customers. Apparently the banks discriminate against women employees in the context of the length of time over which they may borrow from their employer.  Has the Minister made any representations to the banks on that aspect of discrimination and also on a statement made by a spokesperson for the Bank of Ireland who said there is an unquantifiable amount of customer resistance to having women handle financial affairs?  This is an extraordinary statement by a spokesperson for a bank in view of the fact that 60 per cent of his staff are women.  Does the Minister propose to make direct representations to the bank concerned in relation to the report produced by the IBOA?  If so, will she let us know the response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that this does not arise in this instance.  The Employment Equality Act, 1977, makes it unlawful to discriminate on grounds of marital status or sex in relation to terms and conditions of employment.  The Employment Equality Agency are there <Col N="2661" /> to advise on the preparation of such references and to help any employee in need of this assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the experience we have already had that anti-discrimination legislation does not go far enough in regard to changing attitudes, would the Government consider a positive affirmative action programme which would be essential in business, financial and industrial agencies where women are employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply in similar vein to my main reply.  We have the legislation in place and we have the Employment Equality Agency to which a number of these cases have been referred.  Ideally we would need to encourage the IBOA and the banks to come together and agree to a programme of equality for women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is satisfied that the census form as laid out allows for information on disabled or handicapped persons to be provided for future State planning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): The possibility of including a question on disability or handicap in the Census of Population has been carefully considered on a few occasions in recent years.  The conclusion was that the census could not provide the type of information which would be needed to assess reliably the extent and nature of disability in the community.  It was considered best that the health and community care services should compile and keep up to date special &ldquo;registers&rdquo; of handicapped persons which would not only yield overall quantitative and qualitative measures but would actually contain identified particulars <Col N="2662" /> for use by those administering services &mdash; something that could never be done as part of a Census of Population.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health in conjunction with the Medico Social Research Board and the National Rehabilitation Board have promoted the establishment of such registers.  I understand that a register for the mentally handicapped is now complete and kept up-to-date; but that the compilation of a register of physical handicap is still in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the statistics compiled during the census are used for planning, is the Minister happy that he could satisfy the parents of, say, a spina bifida child that there is sufficient planning for children in that category?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> From a statistical point of view as distinct what would be the concern of the Department of Health, the Census of Population is not the best way of compiling statistics of the type to which the Deputy refers.  This was confirmed in the Green Paper <i>Towards a Full Life</i> published in April 1984 by the Minister for Health.  Paragraph 2.30 of that document makes it quite clear that the Census of Population is not the best way of gathering statistics of that kind and that a special register would be the best means of gathering the information, particularly in view of the confidentiality of the Census of Population. That information cannot be used publicly for distribution to certain agencies and is not therefore the best way of compiling these statistics.  I recognise that the Deputy has a genuine concern about having this information available and I would share his concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that there is sufficient source information to enable proper planning for disabled people, particularly disabled children, in the decades to come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I am quite satisfied that efforts are being made <Col N="2663" /> through the Department of Health to establish such special registers and I would sincerely hope that the compilation of a register of the physically handicapped would be completed very shortly, now that the register of the mentally handicapped has been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the deplorable condition of the road at the Carrickarnon frontier post and the similar condition at the Dundalk road station on the Newry Road, Dundalk; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The locations in question are on the National Primary Route N.1. in the administrative areas of Louth County Council and Dundalk Urban District Council respectively.  Primary responsibility for the planning and execution of any road improvements considered necessary at these locations rests with the local authorities.  The full cost of approved schemes of work would qualify for State road grant assistance.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some deterioration has occurred on the hardshoulder at Carrickarnon. This is largely due to parking and turning movements of heavy commercial vehicles.  In order to remedy the situation, road grants totalling £505,000, including £100,000 in 1986, have been made available for the provision of parking accommodation for lorries and improvement of the immediate access to this park.  Louth County Council expect that the lorrypark should be completed by the middle of June.</P>
      <P>Dundalk Urban District Council are monitoring the condition of the road surface in the vicinity of the customs station at Newry Road with a view to carrying out maintenance works as the need arises.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware <Col N="2664" /> that some local authorities are refusing to sanction &ldquo;top up&rdquo; loans for low income families who have received house improvement grants, because they claim that as a result of the decision to abolish prior inspection for grant applications, renovations will not be inspected until after the work is done; if he intends to take any measures to deal with this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that eligible persons should be able to avail of home improvement loans from local authorities to supplement the very generous grants now available for undertaking house improvements.  With this goal in mind, I have notified local authorities that the amount of the unsecured loan that they may advance for home improvements has been increased from £1,000 to £2,000 with effect from 1 May.  In addition the rate of interest has been reduced from 11 per cent to 9 per cent from this month.</P>
      <P>While local authorities are obliged to ensure that the combined total of the loan and any grant does not exceed the approved cost of the works, I have advised them that the operation of this condition need not delay in the approval in principle of a loan.  Any adjustment, upwards or downwards, may be made at a later stage.  I am sure that my instruction in this regard will enable eligible applicants to readily avail of both the generous loan and grant arrangements now in force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities were informed last week of the increase in the size of the unsecured loan from £1,000 to £2,000 and of the reduction in the rate of interest charged from 11 per cent to 9.5 per cent.  The notification in relation to adjustments as between the size of the loan and grant was issued in the fairly <Col N="2665" /> recent past.  I cannot give the exact date but I would imagine that it was some time during the past two weeks.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment given the deteriorating situation of the construction industry underlined clearly by the recent figures for falling cement sales, and given the importance of the sector in the overall industrial economy, if he considers it appropriate to take steps to stimulate the industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the serious state of the building industry, he will as a matter of urgency, introduce a range of incentives to boost construction activity which could result in creating worthwhile employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer Deputies to the reply to Question No. 12 answered on 12 February last which set out various measures taken by the Government to generate additional construction activity.  Since then, the following measures, which are calculated to provide a major stimulus for the industry have been announced:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  The release of approximately 26,000 applications under the House Improvement Grants Scheme from the need for prior inspection.  The improvement works represented by these applications are estimated to <Col N="2666" /> have a value, in terms of potential construction activity, of some £100 million, involving about 6,000 man-years of work.  The estimated value of the construction activity represented by all the house improvement grant applications received since the inception of the scheme is now in excess of £250 million, involving more than 10,000 man-years of work;</P>
    <P>2.  The extension of the special tax reliefs available under the inner city development programme to designated areas in Galway and Waterford. This programme is specifically designed to generate investment in new building and in reconstruction and development work.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully conscious of the importance of the building industry. About 70 per cent of the industry's output is publicly financed and much of the remaining 30 per cent is induced by Government incentives.  Public capital expenditure affecting the industry was up by 4 per cent last year and this year's provision shows a further increase of 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>An upsurge in private sector investment remains the key to full recovery in the industry.  Many of the measures taken by the Government &mdash; such as the new improvement grants scheme and the designated areas incentives &mdash; are designed to stimulate such additional investment. Taking the likely effects of these measures into account together with the favourable trends now developing in regard to inflation, interest rates and real incomes and the expansion in economic activity following this year's budget, I consider that the outlook for the industry is brighter than it has been for some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the production and use of cement is a barometer for an industry capable of providing necessary employment?  The situation that the Minister outlined is not in accordance with the facts.  There has been a drop of 5 per cent in cement sales in 1985 over 1984 and in the first three months of 1986 there has been a drop of <Col N="2667" /> 15 per cent over the corresponding period in 1985.  That being the case, would the Minister agree that what he has said appears not to be the incentive that the industry so badly needs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister outlined the value of the grant applications on hand for the reconstruction scheme announced last October as being approximately £250 million.  In the Book of Estimates the Minister has a figure of £24 million for this scheme for this year.  How does the Minister intend to pay even a proportion of the grants if he only has £24 million in the Estimate, even assuming that a certain amount of work would not be completed until next year?  If only half of it is completed this year, it will cost about £125 million compared to the £24 million which the Minister has in his Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have misheard the reply.  The point I was making was the estimated value of the total construction work generated by the applications to hand is in the order of £250 million.  One of the purposes of any grant scheme such as this is to provide an incentive and a stimulus for the industry and it is estimated that the multiplier effect of the grants will generate total activity in the order of £250 million.  We are not in the business of promising hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the grant scheme a person is entitled to two-thirds of the estimated cost of the work.  That would be around £170 million, working on the figure of £250 million that the Minister is talking about.  Even with a conservative figure of £150 million worth of applications in, where does the Minister intend to get the money to pay those grants?  Even if £75 million worth of grants were due this year, how does the Minister intend to pay for it with the £24 million that he has in the Estimate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That sort of smart comment will not hide from the public the fact that the Minister's letters of approval are not worth the paper they are written on.  How many grants does the Minister estimate will be paid by the £24 million?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to misunderstand the scheme entirely.  There are a variety of different grants available for different types of work which are subject to a maximum in each case.  The maximum is a certain monetary sum or two-thirds of the cost, whichever is the lesser.  The Deputy is suggesting that, irrespective of the amount of work carried out the Government would undertake to pay two-thirds of the cost.  I am sorry to burden the House by going into the matter in detail.  I thought Members of the House had a better grasp of the scheme generally than it appears they have.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that two out of every three children injured seriously in car accidents in the United Kingdom could be saved by wearing rear seat belts; the comparative figures for this country; and if he has any plans to deal with the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the UK estimate that the use of restraints, including seat belts where appropriate, can reduce the risk of injury to children carried as rear seat passengers by about two-thirds.</P>
      <P>So far as this country is concerned, 17 children under the age of 15 were killed and 186 were seriously injured while travelling as rear seat passengers in the period 1982 to 1984.</P>
      <P>I propose to make regulations shortly making the fitment and wearing of rear seat belts compulsory in new vehicles.  However, the wearing of seat belts is not generally recommended for children under the age of 12 years.  Such children will remain outside the scope of the compulsory seat belt regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge parents, on a voluntary basis, to take steps to protect their children when they are travelling as passengers in motor vehicles.  Children should not sit <Col N="2671" /> in the front seat.  As rear seat passengers, infants aged four years or less should be in a carrycot, or on a safety seat, strapped to the back seat.  For older children, up to 12 years of age, a child safety harness is preferable to a seat belt.  Where a seat belt is used, it should be fitted with an adjustable strap or be used in conjunction with a special booster cushion, not a household cushion.  I understand that the special restraints recommended for young children are not compulsory in other European countries.</P>

If they have to be laid before the House for a certain period before coming into force, I will make them at an earlier date.  Following a campaign last year the estimated wearing of seat belts is at the rate of 60 per cent but to achieve full potential a wearing rate of 80 per cent to 90 per cent is regarded as ideal.</P>

      <P>The enforcement of the maximum vehicle weight provisions of the Road Traffic Act is primarily the responsibility of the Garda Síochána.  The Garda can only use a weighbridge appointed under the Act and such appointment is legally a function of the local road authority.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Garda have examined a number of privately owned weighbridges in the Dublin area but are unable to recommend their appointment. This is due to problems with the legal ownership of the weighbridges, and the poor quality of the equipment.</P>
      <P>In accordance with a programme developed by my Department, a total of ten modern weighbridges are being provided by road authorities at strategic locations on national routes with the aid of 100 per cent grants from the Department.  Five of these weighbridges are already operational and the remainder will be completed later this year. The new weighbridges will complement a total of 103 appointed weighbridges throughout the country, including five appointed weighbridges in the Dublin area, which may also be used for enforcement purposes.  One of the basic aims is to ensure that all hauliers operate within the legal weight limits which would promote fair and equal competition.</P>

I should mention that in the last few years library developments in Kerry have included headquarters and the branch at Tralee, £971,000; the branch at Killarney, £260,000; the branch at Caherciveen, £24,500; refurbishment of the Dingle branch, £50,000; mobile libraries, £15,500; and books, £40,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that at present Ballybunion is served by a mobile library which the Deputy would probably not regard as ideal.  From the details I have given in my reply it is worth noting that over the last five years £1.09 million of library capital have been spent in County Kerry.  That represents one-eighth of the total allocation for libraries for the entire country.  The population of County Kerry represents 3.6 of the whole country, less than one-twenty-fifth, yet one eighth of the library spending has been devoted to County Kerry.  By any stretch of the imagination this would have to be described as generous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">

      <P>I will bear it in mind together with the other applications that have been made.  The Deputy said the application was with the Department for a considerable period, but it has been with the Department for a little over six months.  When one takes into account the spending on library services in Kerry over the last few years, I do not believe that is unreasonable.  The total population of Ballybunion is 1,300 and the mobile library carries a stock of 3,000 books to Ballybunion every week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will examine the correlation between pollution in Dublin city and the effect it is having on asthmatics; if he has any plans to eliminate the pollution problems; if he will make a regulation to have cars fitted with automatic pollution gauges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general acceptance that severe air pollution can aggravate respiratory conditions.  The several EC air quality directives now in force are designed, <i>inter alia,</i> to safeguard public health.  They are being observed everywhere in Ireland with the exception of parts of Dublin city, where smoke levels occasionally exceed EC limit values.  It is intended to achieve full compliance with relevant smoke limits in Dublin and the Air Pollution Bill, 1986, which is awaiting a Second Reading in the Seanad, will provide an appropriate framework for the necessary action.</P>
      <P>More effective measures than automatic pollution gauges fitted to cars have already been taken under European Community Environment Policy, or are in prospect, to reduce and phase out lead in petrol and to improve car engine or exhaust design with a view to reducing other emissions from vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Clean Air Bill is a welcome move towards reducing the amount of sulphur dioxide being discharged into the atmosphere and will help those suffering from respiratory disorders, does the Minister accept that the large number of cars in the city centre, the majority of which use petrol containing lead, are proving to be a serious health hazard particularly to young children living in the inner city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a smoke problem in parts of Dublin from time to time and the EC limit values have not been met.  However, the situation in Ireland is far less serious than in many other parts of Europe, but that is not to say we should be complacent.  The Air Pollution Bill will introduce a range of measures to ensure that good quality air is maintained in most of the country and in the small areas where there is occasionally a problem attention can be given to them. I would not like it thought that the problem is at a level commensurate with that in other countries.  The House will be aware that regulations were made last year by my predecessor to reduce the permitted lead content in petrol marketed in the State.  As a result there has been a 60 per cent reduction in the lead content of petrol from the beginning of last month.  That alone should secure a sizeable reduction in the level of lead in the air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Athens a person is allowed bring his car into the centre of the city only every second day?  Is the Minister aware that the location of Athens is pretty similar to <Col N="2676" /> Dublin in that it forms a bowl at the edge of the sea and Dublin is backed by mountains and that, therefore, this increases the pollution in the air?  This has a deleterious and serious effect on children in the short term.  Will the Minister see if a more accessible public transport system would help in this problem and in the long term will he introduce a ban on lead in petrol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last part of the question, a lead-free petrol is the ultimate objective.  As I have explained to the House, there has been a reduction of 60 per cent in the lead content in petrol since the beginning of April and a range of measures will be implemented following the passage of the Air Pollution Bill. I feel that it is not appropriate to delay the time of the House in going into them now.</P>

      <P>They will be before the House when the Bill comes here from the Seanad, but they are relatively well known.  That range of measures which will be possible as a result of the passage of that Bill &mdash; the changes in the lead content regulations to which I have referred, the objective of seeing that lead-free petrol will be available throughout the Community from 1989 onwards together with a commitment at EC level that all new petrol engined vehicles will be designed to run on unleaded petrol, new limit values for the control of emissions from motor vehicle engines together with a time limit for their introduction, and Council directives regarding the exhaust emissions from the existing car fleet &mdash; all are matters being implemented progressively or under examination at present.  The level of attention given to this area both from a Community point of view and nationally will ensure progressively a far higher standard of air cleanliness in our cities and throughout the country generally.</P>

As far as I am aware the county council made the request, which was refused, for the upgrading of the Drogheda-Maynooth road, the reason being the increasing numbers of heavy vehicles using Drogheda port and carrying from Drogheda products imported into this country along with cement and so on down the country.  Will the Minister give a commitment that the matter will be renegotiated with the county council on the basis of upgrading this road because it is carrying more heavy traffic than any other of the main national primary roads in the county?</P>

      <P>Dunboyne-Maynooth.  I gather that the question of reclassifying the Drogheda-Dunboyne road was not raised and there was no formal application for that.  The total grant allocation for roads to Meath County Council in 1986 was £3.752 million.  That compares with £3.2 million in 1985, an increase of 17 per cent.  It also represents an increase in the grant provision of more than 200 per cent since 1978.  As part of their overall allocation in addition the council were notified of a block grant totalling £550,000 for 1986, an increase of 32 per cent over the 1985 figure and of 55 per cent over the 1984 figure.  Special grants of £300,000 were also made available for regional road strengthening in the county in each of the years 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986.  Those figures, in particular the special grant for the <Col N="2680" /> strengthening of the regional roads which classification this road has, indicate a very full awareness within the Department of the needs of this regional route which is important as a designated regional road.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will amend the conditions covering the £2,000 new house grant by making the grant available to all new first time home owners, irrespective of the floor area of the house, and if he will withdraw the restrictions relating to the maximum garage size and to the finish of their internal walls, as there is a considerable cost to his Department in having to measure each new house, and the refusal of a grant can cause great hardship to applicants who do not comply with these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the policy of successive Governments that new house grants should be payable only in respect of reasonably sized houses.  Accordingly, for many years now &mdash; even before the existing new house grant scheme was introduced &mdash; floor area limits have applied in the case of grant-aided houses and the current limits are set out in the Housing Regulations, 1980.  The limit of 125 square metres, i.e., 1,346 square feet, <Col N="2683" /> allows for the construction of a four bedroomed house.</P>
      <P>Restrictions on the size and development of garages were imposed to deal with attempts to evade the requirements on the floor area of houses by describing as garages areas which were obviously designed for incorporation within the main accommodation of the house. These restrictions have been in force since 1 January 1986 and I will shortly be reviewing them in the light of experience so far of their operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that sending engineers from his Department 70 or 80 miles to physically measure every new house in the country now costs a considerable amount of money?  Does he also agree that those building houses for the first time should be allowed to build them without a floor area limit?  In view of the Department's nit picking in literally enforcing the rules to the letter of the law, does the Minister agree that there is grave hardship on many applicants who perhaps because of a small mistake on their part, are denied a new house grant when the house is completed at a time when they most need it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other reasons for an inspection apart from measuring the house and even if there were no grant size limits it would still be necessary for inspections to be carried out.  However, when one considers that the houses in question are built or bought for first time purchasers, 1,346 square feet is a reasonable grant size and some of the difficulties which have arisen are because people built what were described as garages but which, in certain cases, were clearly designed to be converted with the minimum amount of additional work subsequent to the inspection and passing for grant purposes.  However, I am aware that the limit has caused difficulties from time to time and, of course, any limit will cause difficulty because somebody will <Col N="2684" /> always manage, advertently or inadvertently, to build something which falls outside the limit.  The question remains as to whether the House would feel it more equitable that grants should be paid without any limit or whether it was not acceptable that people building a house for first time occupation of perhaps mansion size proportions would still be eligible for grant purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few people build houses of mansion size proportions, particularly first time buyers.  I accept that inspections must be carried out but it is not neccessary to physically measure a house.  The extra cost of this far outweighs the cost of the additional number of grants which will have to be paid if all houses are given the grant which is made to the first time purchaser. Does the Minister not accept that it is reasonable for a person to do preliminary work on a garage such as hardwalling the internal walls or putting in electric points so that when his family is older he can convert the garage into a bedroom or playroom?  The Minister's Department, in insisting that that kind of development cannot be done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question of garages, I have already indicated that I will be reviewing the situation which has obtained since the beginning of the year.  There is a case to be made that when a person is having a house constructed, it might be more cost effective to have some minimum work carried out which would facilitate conversion at a later stage.  However, it is difficult to decide where the limits should be.  For instance, I examined a file yesterday where what was euphemistically described as a garage in a four bedroomed house which also showed a living room, dining room and a substantial kitchen, had two windows included in the side wall, two radiators, electric points, a glazed window at the rear which was obviously for purposes of a bathroom <i>en suite,</i> which would have been a most inappropriate place to house a motor car.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It brought home to me that the level of construction and the size of houses which first time purchasers are able to build nowadays are vastly superior to and larger than the houses constructed in the past.  It is an indication of the level of income available to first time purchasers that they are able to build houses of that size.  From that point of view, I will be examining the regulations in regard to garages.  However, I do not think there should be an abolition of the new house grants; I do not know whether that would be equitable.  If Members of the House have opinions in that regard I will be glad to hear them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency has established itself as a major force on the housing scene and has enabled some 13,000 borrowers to house themselves during the past three and a half years.  Many of these persons have either vacated local authority houses or would have sought such housing in the absence of the agency scheme.  The agency has, therefore, played a valuable role in national housing policy.  Loan approval and payments by the agency are continuing at a high level.  The Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Act, 1985, increased the agency's overall borrowing limit of £500 million which should be adequate to cover the agency's operations over the next three years or so without having to seek a further increase. As indicated by my predecessor in the course of the debate on that Act, the conditions prevailing in the financial market have resulted in the agency having to rely on short term borrowing in the absence of sufficient long term funding from sales of index-linked stock. The general question of the agency's funding arrangements is under consideration. The operation of the two publicly funded house purchase schemes &mdash; the agency scheme and the SDA scheme &mdash; are kept under continuing review to ensure that adequate mortgage facilities will continue to be available to intending home owners of modest means.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the Minister of the debate that took place at the time the agency was established. On that occasion the Taoiseach made great play of what the agency would do but is it not true that the agency are totally at the mercy of financial institutions &mdash; as we said they would be &mdash; and have failed to raise the necessary funds? What action does the Minister propose to take to make up the shortfall this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have outlined the agency faced certain difficulties in raising suitable amounts of indexed linked stock. Part of the reason for that was the phenomenal success of the agency and the number of applications it was able to advance loans to.  More than 13,000 families have purchased homes of their own through advances made to them by the Housing Finance Agency.  That is at a level which is far higher than even the optimists on this side of the House estimated or the pessimists on the other side of the House indicated.</P>
      <P>It is correct to point out that adequate funds are available to the agency to pay loans and service applications to it.  I should like to indicate that in the first three months of this year the agency approved 1,135 loans and paid out 1,340 loans.  I am a little disappointed at the general tenor of the Deputy's questions which, if misinterpreted, might wrongly give the impression to applicants of modest means that there might not be a continuing availability of money of this sort.  Those applicants, otherwise, would have to apply for local authority housing which, in turn, would form a continuing burden on the taxpayer because of the level of subsidy for local authority houses.  The successful operation of the scheme has allowed applicants of modest means to house themselves in a way which would not have been possible otherwise.  It ill-behoves the Deputy to denigrate the scheme in the way he has done.</P>

I also pointed out that the operation of the agency's scheme, and the SDA scheme, are kept under continuing review to ensure that adequate mortgage facilities will be made available.  That review is taking place currently and I have every confidence that as a result of it it will be possible to continue to make loans available to people of modest means who would not otherwise be able to house themselves.  I must confess that I am disappointed at the general impression the Deputy has sought to convey.  The agency have had <Col N="2690" /> difficulties in that they have not been able to get access to sufficient amounts of index linked funding in the market in the recent past.  I am referring to sufficient amounts to meet the level of demand from potential borrowers.  That level is far higher than could have been estimated. As a result of that the agency have had to resort to short term borrowing.</P>

      <P>It is and that has caused some difficulties for the agency.  Any borrowing institution like this will from time to time have difficulty with the type of borrowing it specialises in or has to resort to.  It is up to the promoters of that institution, or in this case it is up to the Government, to take adequate steps to ensure that there is a continuing source and supply of mortgage finance available to people of modest means.  It is the intention of the Government that that should continue to be the position.  I would not like the discussion in the House to give rise to apprehension in the minds of people who may be applicants with the agency.  That is why I took the trouble to point out that the agency in the first three months of this year paid out loans to 1,340 as well as approving 1,135 loans for new applicants.  The agency are continuing to operate and it is wrong to raise fears or doubts in the minds of young people of modest incomes who are endeavouring to purchase their own homes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 4 of 7 November 1985 which sets out the position in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have not that <Col N="2691" /> answer in front of me, would the Minister agree with the theory advanced in the question which is that there are now many areas under the aegis of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council where people have taken advantage of the £5,000 grant and that such people have had to move out of their local authority home in order to buy a new home?  Is the Minister aware that these houses, in particular in the Tallaght area, of which there are 50 to 60, are lying vacant and cannot be relet?  Would it not be better that leaders of communities remain in their areas, if, for example, the £5,000 grant was available to them to buy their existing homes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally well known that one of the factors that facilitated the introduction of this scheme was the grant incentive of £5,000 to people to vacate their local authority houses.  The resultant effect would be that they would purchase another house, very often a new home in the private sector, thereby helping to maintain private sector sales while freeing-up a dwelling unit which would be available to the local authority for reletting at a considerably lesser amount than replacement cost.  The replacement cost of dwelling units in the Dublin area would vary from £30,000 upwards, as the Deputy will be aware.  One of the main purposes of the scheme was the freeing-up of existing units, making them available for reletting, which would be absolutely defeated if the existing occupier of a home were to be given a grant in order to remain there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be aware of the social effects of the scheme and that many of the applicants for this £5,000 grant are community leaders within their estates.  They are leaving local authority estates, which can suffer badly from the loss of such community leaders.  It means that the best of the tenants are leaving.  Surely there is social merit in making this £5,000 grant available in order to retain such community leaders in their estates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to those tenants who do not opt to avail of this grant to describe those who have opted to avail of its provisions as the best of the tenants and community leaders.  I do not think that is necessarily the case at all.  I would not like it to be interpreted in any way that there was a two-tier type of local authority tenant being implied here.  The situation is as I have said.  The only logical conclusion one could draw from the Deputy's remarks would be that he seems to be implying in some way that perhaps the scheme ought to be disbanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is wrong to suggest that.  I am not in any way suggesting that.  I am merely suggesting an extension of the scheme.  Is the Minister aware &mdash; if he is not as Minister for the Environment he should be &mdash; that because of the number of people taking advantage of the provisions of this scheme in the Tallaght area Dublin Corporation have on their hands 50 to 60 homes that they cannot relet in that area, whereas had these people been able to buy their existing homes they would have remained in their communities and be able to add to them? I want to make it absolutely clear that there was no intention of any slur being cast on those remaining on in local authority homes.  The Minister knows it; he is playing the old soldier, as usual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary situation that Dublin Corporation, who had ostensibly 4,484 applicants on their housing waiting lists at the end of December last year have 50 or 60 houses in Tallaght which the Deputy tells us they cannot let.  They also have upwards of several hundreds of flats in Ballymun and perhaps 100 dwelling units throughout the city which they have not let.  They also managed to house 1,300 applicants last year who were not even on their approved waiting list.  That is just an indication <Col N="2693" /> of the change there has been; that there is no longer any real waiting lists for local authority housing in this country, and certainly not in this city, when the local authority representing the capital city have dwelling units on their hands which they are unable to let or for which they cannot find tenants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be blinded by figures.  Is he aware that in suburban areas, places like Tallaght, Blanchardstown and others, in the Minister's constituency &mdash; although he said earlier that he does not involve himself in local matters, a fact well known in the constituency &mdash; there is a social aspect to this scheme?  What I am asking, and what those involved in local government will ask the Minister, is to extend the provisions of the scheme to allow people to remain in their homes, continuing to fulfil a role within their communities as settled members of those communities.  That is what we are talking about, not just the figures or statistics with which the Minister seems to be blinded.  I am talking about people, families and communities. That is what is important to me and the party I represent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's description of the situation as chaotic is not in accordance with the facts.  Yesterday was the first day of the tests in woodwork and in engineering. These practical tests are scheduled to run over a number of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first day, yesterday, these tests <Col N="2694" /> took place in over two-thirds of the schools involved.  I am informed that the proportion of schools holding the tests is much improved today.  I am satisfied that these tests will be run correctly and adequately in all the schools involved. Accordingly I am not prepared to postpone these examinations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of the facts he has given this House today, although I am sure given with good intent, represent misinformation? Is the Minister aware that, of the leaving certificate marks for construction and engineering, one-third are awarded for the practical examinations, one-third for theory and one-third for practice? Therefore, will he agree that students are likely to be discriminated against with regard to one-third of their higher paper and two-fifths of their lower paper?  The Minister has said that the proportion of schools holding these tests today is much improved.  I would wish that that were true but it is not.  Is the Minister aware that the number of schools in which chaotic situations obtain has increased today, that attendants who turn up wishing to participate find that they cannot do so because of lack of knowledge of the practical equipment needed for such examinations?  Furthermore, is the Minister aware that these are not tests merely of manual dexterity, which he has been contending, but are also tests of tasks to be performed.  Is the Minister of my view that it is educationally unsound for one set of pupils to be aware of the tasks yet to be performed while others have already done so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is suggesting that I have misinformed the House as to the facts of this matter.  I want to categorically reject that suggestion.  My information &mdash; and is has to be unlike hers &mdash; is coming from that being fed into the offices of my Department charged with running these examinations.  I am satisfied that what I have said here is factually correct.  The vast majority of schools in this country commenced the practical examinations yesterday.  There <Col N="2695" /> were some schools where they did not commence for one reason or another, into which it might not be appropriate for me to go having regard to the fact that at this moment talks are taking place.  I will leave it at that.  But in a good number of those schools substitute arrangements have already been put into place.  I am satisfied that the majority of them will have substitute arrangements in place tomorrow, or the following day, to ensure that the pupils &mdash; and our concern must be for the pupils &mdash; concerned will have their examinations presented to them and will be given an opportunity to equip themselves adequately.</P>

      <P>My concern is solely for the pupils, many of whom contacted me over the last 24 hours, saying that they are not satisfied with certain aspects of the examination in that some pupils have sat them and others have not.  Is the Minister aware that the association of teachers involved in third level education have issued a statement today saying that the marks accruing to these practical examinations will, in their eyes, have no authority or validity for entrance to third-level institutions?

      <P>Agreed.  I want to ask the Taoiseach about the taking of the legislation which will introduce the referendum on the amendment to the Constitution. Would he accept that the Opposition are looking for three days on Second Stage, with an interval of a week and then two days for Committee Stage? Is he prepared to agree to a timetable of that order?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Whips.  My understanding is that the proposal was that there should be a two day debate on Second Stage and that is <Col N="2784" /> agreed, and that it was proposed that there be a one day debate on Committee Stage.  I understand that the Opposition sought a second day and that was agreed. That is how the position stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising the matter here because the Whips have been unable to reach agreement.  I understand that is because the Government are taking a certain position.  I want to suggest to the Taoiseach that this legislation deals with one of the most fundamental matters that legislation can deal with, namely, an alteration in the Constitution.  It would be unheard of and unthinkable that this legislation should be rushed through the Dáil.  We on this side of the House are quite prepared to facilitate the Government to the greatest possible extent in ensuring that this matter is decided by the people in a calm, non-political atmosphere. I suggest that at the minimum we would take three days to discuss Second Stage and then, as is traditional, have a reasonable interval and take Committee Stage within a week after the conclusion of Second Stage.  I suggest that is a very reasonable timetable for important legislation of this kind and I am asking the Taoiseach to agree in principle to it so that the Whips can work it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been reasonable about this.  Originally, we proposed two days for Second Stage and a day for Committee Stage.  The Opposition came back and agreed to two days for Second Stage and suggested a second day for Committee Stage.  We immediately agreed and the matter was settled.  I do not understand why it has been reopened at this point by the Opposition after agreement has been reached by the Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no agreement between the Whips.  The Whips cannot reach agreement on this matter because of the position of the Taoiseach and the Government.  I am now suggesting to the Taoiseach that it is a reasonable proposition to allow three days for Second Stage <Col N="2785" /> debate on constitutional amendment legislation.  I have been in this House, Sir, when the Dáil took about six months to discuss legislation in regard to a constitutional amendment.  We are suggesting that the minimum the Taoiseach should agree to and the minimum that we can be expected to agree to is three days for Second Stage, at least, an interval of a week, followed by two days for Committee Stage.  I think that is eminently reasonable and, in fact, the general public would regard us as doing less than our duty if we did not give at least that amount of time to legislation to amend the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The business of this House depends upon agreements being reached and adhered to.  We originally proposed a timetable which involved the taking of the Bill a week earlier than is now proposed.  The Opposition asked for an extra week, we gave it.  We proposed a two day debate on Second Stage and a one day debate on Committee Stage.  The Opposition agreed to two days debate on Second Stage and proposed a two day debate on Committee Stage.  We agreed to this.  We cannot proceed on the basis of the Opposition continually changing their position.  We have already accommodated them fully on this matter and the work of the House would become impossible if the Opposition go back on agreements which have been reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Taoiseach has decided to introduce that note into this exchange.  I want to tell him that the Opposition did not agree to anything on this matter so far and I am asking him if it is not reasonable for the Opposition on legislation to amend the Constitution to seek a three day Second Stage debate? We have speakers on this side of the House who are anxious to contribute and who would take more than three days even apart from any Government speakers.</P>

      <P>I want to put the record straight.  I sought to have the debate as early as possible.  I sought two days and a day.  This was not agreed to.  The Opposition Chief Whip asked me to consider two other days, 14th and 15th, and the 20th for Committee Stage.  I consulted with the Government and asked whether these dates would be suitable to facilitate the movement of the legislation through the House.  They said yes and I informed the Opposition Chief Whip of the position. This was satisfactory.  My office received a call asking to consider another day for Committee Stage as it would, certainly in the eyes of the public, be better to run a Committee Stage a second day.  This is something that was not sought in any serious manner.  I had further discussions with the Opposition Chief Whip and I agreed but there never was any question of a third day for Second Stage.  I want to make that quite clear and I want to put that on the record.  I am satisfied that the time given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think the Taoiseach would have to agree with that.  It is a matter which has been outstanding for a long time.  It is now finally being brought before the House and I think, having regard to the dignity of the House and the importance of the subject, reasonable time should be given <Col N="2788" /> to it.  Three days for Second Stage, followed by an interval, and two days for Committee Stage is, I believe, a reasonable proposal on our part.  We have already shown a certain degree of co-operation in regard to the legislation; we have indicated that we do not propose to oppose it passing through the House but it is legislation of some complexity and great significance and I think three days to allow Deputies to debate it on Second Stage and two days on Committee Stage is not unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have argued this case at sufficient length.  What I have endeavoured to demonstrate is that increasing the dependent relative allowance to £500 would be an incentive to children to look after their parents and grandparents at home.  I think I have satisfied the House that not only is this the best form of care for old people, but it is also the cheapest form of care from the point of view of the Exchequer.  I will press the Minister in those circumstances to ensure that we can achieve two ends at the same time, better domiciliary care and a cheaper burden on the Exchequer, instead of placing people in institutions which are overcrowded and totally inadequate. This is the right direction to move in both from a social and economic point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much sympathy with the point of view expressed by <Col N="2793" /> Deputy O'Kennedy in regard to dependent relatives.  It is highly desirable, as he has said, that people of advanced years should be cared for in their own homes to the greatest extent possible and that their relatives should be given a fiscal incentive to ensure that that is done. However, the problem is that, in any given year, the Finance Bill is relatively tightly drawn in so far as the amount of financial commitment one can make is concerned.  I realise that Deputy O'Kennedy is not putting forward this amendment with a serious prospect of its being accepted but rather for the purpose of having a useful debate.  I do not criticise Deputy O'Kennedy for that.  The proposal he has put forward would cost £4.2 million in 1986 and £7 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has fullminated at considerable length about the problems which are caused by borrowing and by increasing commitments by the State in excess of what the State can afford.  I am, therefore, somewhat surprised that he should be pressing this amendment.  It is not wise that he should press an amendment which would involve very substantial additional commitments on the part of the State in this current year.  It is notable that Deputy O'Kennedy has not put forward any proposals accompanying this amendment which would suggest how £4.2 million could be raised in 1986 to pay for this or how £7 million might be raised in a full year to pay for it.  It is not permissible for any Deputy other than the Minister for Finance to put forward an amendment which would impose a charge on the Exchequer. If he had been serious in putting forward the amendment he might have suggested alternatives taxes or alternative expenditure cuts of sufficient size to enable the House to be satisfied that the proposal advocated by the Deputy would not result in an increase in the overall requirement to borrow money, bearing in mind that we are borrowing for one sixth of our <Col N="2794" /> total expenditure and all our capital requirements, and that our national debt is the highest in Europe.</P>
      <P>These are the primary considerations that must be borne in mind, and I regret to have to bring those points to the notice of the House.  I have great sympathy with the Deputy's points, particularly those made last week about old people being cared for in their homes and that the neighbourhood in which they live should consist of a mixed generation community both from the social and the environmental points of view, rather than having all young married couples, without a mix of old and young people.</P>
      <P>I do not oppose the Deputy's point in any sense of disagreement with his objectives, but regretfully the money is simply not available.  It is fair to say that this allowance has remained fairly static, in my recollection, during many debates of this kind.  It was introduced, or possibly increased, in 1948 and has remained at the same level, nearly, for many years.  It is probable that there is a danger of a degree of abuse of an allowance of this kind, because all that is required is that dependence be indicated.  This is somewhat difficult in a society which is not as computerised or controlled as it might be: it is possible that claims would be made on behalf of people who are not truly dependent at all but who could claim to be dependent and given the relatively modest allowance, and it would be rather difficult and cost expensive to prove to the contrary.  Therefore, there is a possibility that the allowance might be abused.</P>
      <P>I recollect making the very arguments Deputy O'Kennedy is now submitting and hearing the Finance Minister of the day &mdash; I do not know if it was Deputy O'Kennedy or the late Deputy Colley&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am somewhat surprised at the interruption because it appears Deputy O'Kennedy considers that a discussion on his amendment, which I have acknowledged as being of some social importance, is irrelevant and should be curtailed.  Deputy O'Kennedy displays a certain lack of sincerity in putting forward amendments and then, having put them forward, seeking some advantage, not known to other Members of the House, by trying to curtail the debate by making spurious points of order.  They could be more accurately described as points of disorder: indeed in this debate we have heard more points of disorder from him than points of order. Regretfully, one has to become used to that in matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of years ago relatives were dependent on this tax allowance for their subsistence, and in intervening years Governments of both parties or of major formations in coalition introduced many allowances and benefits specifically designed to deal with the type of person who would normally be claiming a dependent relative's allowance.  We introduced the <Col N="2796" /> free travel benefit, the free electricity allowance, the free television licence, the free telephone scheme, the free bottled gas scheme and various fuel schemes. They are all available to people who would normally be described as dependent relatives, in addition to which a tax allowance in respect of rented accommodation is available to those above 55 years of age &mdash;&mdash; it was originally 60 years.</P>
    <P>If one looked at these allowances in isolation one could make the case that the allowances have not been increased very rapidly or substantially, but many other compensation measures have been introduced, designed to achieve similar effects.  Deputy O'Kennedy sought to disparage some of the points I made earlier, which is not surprising but totally invalid and representing wishful thinking by him.  It is my intention to review the level of the dependent relative's allowance between now and the Finance Bill following the 1987 budget to see if we can do anything more in this area.  At the outset of this contribution I indicated a good deal of sympathy for the case made by Deputy O'Kennedy, which is very similar to one I made myself at another time.  I hope to be able to do something about it next year but I cannot give any guarantee of that kind and would not wish to mislead the House by so doing.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked me why I did not propose alternative means of fund raising.  He knows it is not permissible for anyone but the Minister for Finance to make proposals to levy extra taxes and I treat that point with the contempt it deserves.  Secondly, he has said that the total cost this year would be £4 million and he invited me to indicate where savings could be achieved for the Exchequer.  If the gross cost this year would be £4 million &mdash;&mdash; £2.5 million net &mdash;&mdash; the saving to the Exchequer this year would be far in excess of that amount because people would not have to be cared for in institutions and geriatric homes.  The Minister may not be prepared to accept that but perhaps his colleague, the Minister for Health, would accept it.  A sum of £2.5 million goes <Col N="2797" /> nowhere in the provision of geriatric services. I regret the Minister is not prepared to meet the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fallacious for the Deputy to suggest that the bulk of the people in respect of whom dependent relative allowance might be claimed are people now in full time care and who in the event of the allowance being dramatically increased would be withdrawn from full time care or that they are people who would be put into full time care in the next year but who in the event of the amendment being accepted would not be put into full time care.  It is only in those two eventualities that the saving mentioned by the Deputy would occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit I am working on the basis of a degree of subjective judgment based on work in my own constituency.  The bulk of people in respect of whom dependent relative allowances are claimed are people who would not be in full time care, irrespective of whether the allowance was £100, £1,000 or zero.  The majority of the people concerned live at home with their relatives and will continue to do so for a number of years.  While the allowance is very welcome it is not something that influences their decision to stay at home or not.  The only way the contention of Deputy O'Kennedy would be true would be if a substantial number who are not claiming the allowance would leave county homes or hospitals and return to their relatives or who, alternatively, would not go into such institutions if the allowance was increased.  That is not the case.  Deputies will agree that in most instances people go into county homes or hospitals not for financial reasons but because members of their families are physically incapable of looking after them.  That is my experience from discussions I have had with people in my constituency. In most cases the family concerned will do everything possible to <Col N="2798" /> keep their relative at home, irrespective of whether an allowance is payable.  The increase the Deputy is proposing would be worth a relatively small amount per year to the average family.  It would not be worth much more than about £150 to £200 per year and I do not think that increase would tip the balance one way or another with regard to a person staying in his own home.</P>
    <P>The financial arguments made by the Deputy do not stand up.  That is not to say that there is not a good deal of validity in the point he has made.  From a social point of view it would be desirable to give a reward or a recognition in the form of a tax allowance to those adult children who look after their aged relatives.  However, quite frankly it would be turning economics on its head to make the rather more extreme claim the Deputy has made, namely, that this would save a substantial amount so far as institutional care is concerned.  While I would like to believe what the Deputy is saying is true, I have to say I do not believe it.</P>
    <P>The case the Deputy has made must be based on social considerations rather than on financial considerations.  That is not to disparage the social considerations. There are genuine considerations in favour of what the Deputy is suggesting from the social point of view.  Quite regardless of the position the Deputy adopts on the amendment, I undertake quite freely that between now and the budget and the Finance Bill next year I will have an analysis undertaken, in consultation with the Department of Health of the claimants for the dependent relative allowance to see the extent to which an increase in the allowance would ultimately reduce the level of costs claimed by health boards in respect of institutional care.  If the Deputy's case can be substantiated &mdash; I hope it can, although I doubt it &mdash; I will be encouraged to introduce an amendment next year on the lines he is suggesting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to drag out the debate on these amendments.  They are all related to the table in the Bill setting out personal reliefs.  The personal relief for a married man, for instance, is increased in the Bill from £3,800 to £4,000.  The amendments are designed to increase the existing <Col N="2800" /> personal reliefs by 10 per cent.  There is an opportunity to allow PAYE taxpayers to catch up in some way for the loss over the years of higher inflation when the burden on them increased.  The allowances in those years did not increase appropriately in line with inflation.  There is now an opportunity to redress that matter in respect of personal reliefs for PAYE taxpayers.  Amendment No. 27 relates to the PAYE allowance and is similar to an amendment put down last year.  Our proposal is that the employee allowance should be increased to £1,000.  I am glad that the Minister is increasing it but only from £600 to £700.  Our amendment is designed to give substantial PAYE allowance of £1,000.  Everybody recognises the enormous burden of personal taxation and the need for a substantial increase in the personal reliefs.  Inflation is reducing but simply keeping the increase in line with current inflation does not make up for the position which obtained over the past few years.  Each of these amendments is designed to increase last year's allowances by 10 per cent.  In relation to the PAYE allowance our proposal is not for a 10 per cent increase but to raise it to £1,000, as we proposed last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 27, I would ask the Minister to consider this section in its application since a very large number of people are excluded from claiming the PAYE allowance, despite the fact that they pay PAYE. Most of these are in the category of proprietary limited companies, many of them very small companies with £100 share capital.  The director and his relatives working for him cannot claim the PAYE allowance.  The Minister might consider extending the scope of this section to cover that category of person. I had a case recently which I brought to the attention of the Minister's predecessor and also to the attention of this Minister when he first held the Finance portfolio.  The case related to a man who was working for his father in a small company.  This man was not residing with his father and had a very big mortgage which he had to pay from a very small <Col N="2801" /> income.  He also paid PAYE.  Despite the fact that he was quite independent of his father but happened to work for his father's two-man company he was not entitled to the PAYE allowance.  I believe that is grossly unjust and unfair. I have raised the matter time and again and the reply from the Department is that it would be difficult to know who is or is not a real employee of such a company.  Surely there are certain tests which the Revenue Commissioners could devise to allow very many employees who are genuinely involved in various small family businesses and paying PAYE to avail of the PAYE allowance.  We are told time and again that this cannot be done but it is amazing what can be done when there is a will to do it.  In justice and equity this allowance should be extended to this category of person.  I would not object to any reasonable test being applied.  I would ask the Minister to consider extending the scope of this section with a view to introducing an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla's amendments Nos. 21 to 26 would between them cost £28.9 million in 1986 and £48.2 million in a full year.

I must regretfully ask the House to oppose these amendments because they are not consistent with any kind of prudent fiscal policy, particularly when they are put forward in the absence of any suggestion as to how the money would be raised and what public services would be cut if revenue were cut to this extent by these amendments.

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the cost of £63 million in the current year and £105 million in a full year.  This PAYE allowance was brought in to give some compensation to the PAYE taxpayer for the benefit which the self-employed have and which the PAYE taxpayers had before the PAYE system was introduced, in other words, they paid this year for their last year's earnings.  The self employed are still taxed by reference to their earnings in the previous tax year and if the increase that I refer to costs that enormous amount it must indicate that continuing to give benefit to the self-employed is costing the Exchequer somewhat similar proportionate amounts.  The cost to the Exchequer is not always the appropriate measurement of whether an amendment is justified.  The figure of £600 allowance was given in 1980.  This is 1986 and if £600 was an appropriate allowance in 1980 I think £1,000 is an appropriate allowance now.  The Minister can always attempt to justifiy everything on the cost to the Exchequer but if he wants to recoup that cost he could introduce a similar system for the self employed so that they would pay in the current year.  That would obviously recoup losses to the Exchequer which they are suffering at the moment.  Previous Governments have admitted that this would be the correct system.  The Commission on Taxation recommended <Col N="2803" /> it and it was supposed to be implemented but it still has not been implemented. What I am proposing here is that the allowance of £600 which was introduced in 1980 should be increased now by much more than the £100 the Minister is proposing. The PAYE taxpayer is still being discriminated against as against other taxpayers by the fact that the money is being deducted from him before he even gets it into his fist, whereas other taxpayers have a year in hand before they repay. Perhaps the Minister could indicate when he believes this discrimination will end and the self employed will be paying on the current year's earnings or, alternatively, that the appropriate increase will be given to the PAYE taxpayer.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us what the present day equivalent of £600 in 1980 is?</P>

      <P>I am not asking the Minister to yield to these amendments. But it is important, under this amendment, to bear in mind the precise level of taxation that we are talking about.  I have to raise a point here which I raised earlier in this debate, that is, the habit of the Government of pointing out that this would cost too much, would cost so many millions and could not be yielded.  On the surface that appears to be a practical approach to it.  But taken in the context of the massive increase in recent years a better way of putting it may be that the Government are not prepared to attempt to reverse the trend which has been evident here since 1983, not to spread it beyond that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us just talk about the Minister's stewardship for a moment. In that year 11 per cent of taxpayers were paying tax above the standard rate.  The position now is that 40 per cent of taxpayers are paying tax at above the standard rate and that is in the Minister's own time.  I want to make a second point on that because in these demands for some relaxation of the burden of taxation I <Col N="2804" /> want to put the point clearly and crisply in the context of seeking a reversal of the difficult burden put on people's backs in the past couple of years, not so much a handout or a giveaway or a cost to the State or a magnanimous gesture.  That is the way it has been portrayed in this debate up to now by putting out the cost of the amendment.  That is not a broad enough approach to it considering what has happened in the past couple of years. The State has taken in £217 million extra this year on taxation over the pre budget figure.  All that is being sought in a number of these amendments is some reversal or an easing of that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this married allowance the Minister is proposing a £200 increase.  He should be aware that this is no big deal. We are talking about perhaps £1 or £2 per week in extra take home pay for the average person.  Indeed the Minister's own table supplied with the budget speech states that a person on £10,000 a year will have a reduction in taxation of £100, which is about £2 a week.  If one looks at other sections of this Bill which has put additional VAT on petrol, cigarettes and beer, that £2 a week disappears quite rapidly.  The point I am making is that we have a habit in these Bills of giving a very marginal relief and taking back marginal taxation which leaves the Bill right back where it started at the beginning.  We have to do something a lot more fundamental with the tax system than just that.  The marriage allowance figure in 1980-81 was £3,230.  The Minister is proposing to make that £4,000.  That is no big deal after four or five years of increasing the burden of taxation.  It is worth pointing out that out of every £100 paid in income tax at the moment the PAYE sector pays £87.  It is also worth pointing out that income tax as a percentage of total tax has risen, since the day the Minister came to office, from 36 per cent to today's figure of 40½ per cent. That is the evidence of the taxation drift in the past few short years.  What we are seeking in a number of these amendments is some relaxation of that drift that has occurred in the past two or three years, not a handout or a reckless giveaway <Col N="2805" /> because that is not the context in which we are putting these amendments.</P>

      <P>In respect of Deputy Mac Giolla's question the advantage of the previous year method of assessment for the self employed is obviously greatly diminished by the reduction in inflation. There is a greater case therefore for discrimination in favour of those who are paying on a current year basis when inflation was higher than it is now.  With regard to Deputy Brennan's points I have to correct an inadequacy on his part.  He stated that in 1982 11 per cent of taxpayers were on higher rates as compared with over 40 per cent now.  In fact, in 1982-83 34.4 per cent, three times the figure quoted by Deputy Brennan, were on higher rates.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 7 to 25 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  who is under the age of 16 years, or</P>
      <P>(b)  who is under the age of 16 years and is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity, or</P>
      <P>(c)  who if over the age of 16 years of age at the commencement of that year;</P>
      <P>(i)  is receiving full time instruction at any University College School or other educational establishment, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining himself and has become so permanently incapacitated before he had attained the age of 21 years or has become so permanently incapacitated after attaining the age of 21 years but while he has been in receipt of full time instruction as aforesaid, he shall be subject to the provisions of this section be entitled in respect of each such child to a deduction specified in the next succeeding subsection.</P>
      <P>(2)  The deduction referred to in subsection (1) shall be:</P>
      <P>(a)  In the case of a child to whom (a) or (b) (i) of that subsection applies, £100, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2807" /> (b) In the case of a child to whom paragraph (b) or (c) (ii) of that subsection applies, £600.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to restore the child tax allowance.  The Government's decision to terminate the child tax allowance is, in my view, the clearest example of their anti-family bias.  At a time when the family is under attack from a variety of sources, the termination of the child allowance is particularly reprehensible. Families with children over 16 years of age still attending third level education are especially penalised since they are excluded from the provisions of the family income supplement.  I hope the Minister will recognise that whatever arguments have been made in relation to the family income supplement do not apply to the category I am arguing for, those still at third level education and over 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>Just when educational expenses are heaviest the Government add to the burden of these families by terminating the tax allowance which was hitherto available to all such families.  What we need to do is to encourage maximum participation in third level education in this era of technology.  We need to ensure that parents who are prepared to encourage their children with ability, will not be penalised because their children avail of third level education.</P>
    <P>We believe we should provide every incentive to continuing education to third level to ensure that our management personnel will be equipped with the best possible qualifications in marketing, in which we are deplorably weak, in research and development, in financial services and in the various technological disciplines.  The potential of this economy will not be realised unless we invest in knowledge and in knowledge based industries.  Many other countries have demonstrated this effectively and it is time we decided to at least follow that path, if not move ahead of other countries.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government's decision in <Col N="2808" /> terminating this child allowance is unfair and particularly inappropriate at this stage.  We welcome the fact that this allowance is not being terminated in respect of physically and mentally handicapped children because they have a very special claim to be maintained properly and they have a very special claim on all our citizens.  While I welcome the fact that the Minister has not reduced the allowance in respect of physically or mentally handicapped children, it would be entirely appropriate that he restore the tax allowance to all children, but in particular to those between the ages of 16 and 21 years who will not qualify for family income supplement and who are going on to third level education.  I believe our case is undeniable in the interests of justice and, more important, economic development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were in Deputy O'Kennedy's position I would not be inclined to make the case so largely on the basis of the position of those who are lucky enough to be able to participate in higher education in any event.</P>
      <P>I believe the allowance is of relatively little significance in that regard.  It is mainly of interest in respect of families at a younger age.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government have significantly increased social welfare child benefit.  He will also be aware that the main argument for this proposition relates to the fact that, like all tax allowances, it is of greater benefit higher up the tax ladder than it is at the lower end.  I realise the same argument could be made against an increase in the personal allowances, or against personal allowances in themselves. It is hard to distinguish in some ways between making a case against child tax allowance and not making a similar case against personal allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this instance the Government decided to substitute child benefits, which would be in a form similar to what might be a tax credit for children, for the previous child tax allowance.  At this transitional point, there is some difference in the treatment accorded to those with a number of children and a couple with no <Col N="2809" /> children.  The most appropriate way to look at this proposal is in the context of a transition towards tax credits in the long run.  The House will be aware that there are many difficulties in the way of introducing tax credits and it cannot be done rapidly.  This proposal should be seen as tax credits in respect of a particular category, namely, dependent children.  The Government have made a reasonable effort to substitute for the child tax allowances child benefits which are of the same value to all families, whereas child tax allowances are of greater benefit to higher income taxpayers and of no benefit to those with children who have no tax to pay because their incomes are so low they are exempt from tax.  That is the essential argument which needs to be made in respect of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous section we endeavoured to persuade the Minister to extend the number of those who were exempt from tax but we failed.  We are now addressing ourselves only to those who have a tax liability.  It is recognised by all that the burden of taxation has grown enormously under this Government. The burden of income taxation has increased two and a half times since this Government came into office.  When there is an increase of that nature it bites each and every taxpayer.  This is particularly true this year when income tax will account for more than £400 million above last year's figure.  It is obvious that this will affect every income taxpayer.</P>
      <P>My amendment is attempting to ensure that families with a very heavy tax burden will be given minimal relief.  This in nothing new.  It is merely retaining an allowance to which these people were always entitled.  I am not trying to add anything to the relief they would otherwise enjoy but to ensure that in 1986 they will not be deprived of what they enjoyed until this Government decided to abolish the child allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying it is a deliberate strategy of Government but many people are concerned about the anti-family trend in legislation, particularly tax legislation.  I will not confine my proposal to those <Col N="2810" /> between the ages of 16 and 21 years; I extend the application to all children. When the Minister advises me not to make a case in a certain way, sometimes I may be informed enough to listen to his advice, but from some of his earlier comments in respect of my qualifications, I do not believe I am ever likely to reach that stage; but we learn every day.  The proposal I make is in respect of all children. I have stressed the significance of it in respect of those who cannot benefit from the family income supplement because they are over the age to qualify. That is the only reason I made the point in respect of those between the ages of 16 and 21.  At that stage in the family children are most expensive; if they go on to third level education, assuming they are not working for themselves when they become taxpayers in their own right, they must be provided for.  We should not be discouraging either the young people themselves from attending or their parents from having them attend third level where possible.  Only by investing in knowledge at that stage, whether in technology, marketing, financial services and so on will we see, not this year but in five year's time, a much more effective input into the economic development of this nation.  On that basis I press the Minister to accept the amendment.  He does not seem disposed to do so but I have made my case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to section 103 of the Bill which introduces, by means of the reduction in the age of majority to 18, the ability of parents in exactly the type of situation the Deputy is referring to to covenant up to 5 per cent of their income tax free to what would then be an adult dependant, being over 18, and that money can be used for payment of university fees.  I do not mean this in an aggravating way, but probably Deputy O'Kennedy should not base his case so much on that category because they are being provided for in the Bill.  I would be concerned if there were substance in what Deputy O'Kennedy said about an anti-family trend in <Col N="2811" /> legislation but I do not think there is, and certainly there should not be.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Government have committed themselves in the White Paper published and accompanying the present proposals in regard to the Constitution to a review of any provision in the law which could be construed as representing a disincentive to people to remain in what are said to be normal, traditional family circumstances.  No fiscal disadvantages should be involved in such a decision on their part.  That commitment has been given by the Government in the White Paper and it is very much in the spirit of the case that Deputy O'Kennedy is making on this occasion.  Without disrespect to Deputy O'Kennedy, I think I can explain why the Government have taken this decision.  It is essentially a move towards tax credits on an incremental basis by doing it in respect of children first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that certain anomalous situations will arise because of that, but that is the best way to look at it rather than looking at it in terms of singling out situations where there are a large number of children.  My desire is not to create a situation in which people are not given due recognition in respect of the cost involved in having children cared for in one's home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.  The first is of a technical nature.  The abolition of this allowance seems to affect two other areas.  One is section 12 of the Finance Act, 1967 which gives relief for health expenses of dependent children and the Act refers back to those in receipt of this £100 allowance.  Section 10(2) of the 1983 Finance Act provides for an abatement of residential property tax for residential children.  Again it refers to those in receipt of this £100 allowance.  I assume that those sections will be so amended as we <Col N="2812" /> go on, otherwise what we are debating today would be a broader thing and would be interfering with the abatement of residential property tax and with the relief of health expenses for dependent children.  I do not think that is the Minister's intention in this section and I would not like it to happen because of technical drafting.</P>
      <P>I have another question to put to the Minister the answer to which he has hinted at already.  Does he accept broadly that while the abolition of the £100 allowance and its replacement with the child benefit allowance, might level up for somebody in the 35 per cent rate of taxation, it is new taxation, a fresh eating into the living standards of anybody above 35 per cent?  If that is the case I come back to the point I made earlier.  I know that at this difficult time it is popular to speak up for the lower paid, the person on the average industrial wage of £7,000 or £8,000 as I have done on many an occasion in this House, but another group of people are to be spoken up for many of whom I represent.  Those people are on £15,000, £16,000, £17,000, £19,000 a year and are not in receipt of any worthwhile State benefit and increasingly are becoming the new poor.  The Minister corrected me earlier.  I meant to apply that 11 per cent to the UK; there those paying over the standard rate are about 11 per cent of the tax paying public.  Let me ask the Minister, with something like 40 per cent of Irish taxpayers paying above the stand rate, is abolishing this £100 allowance directly not putting a new burden on that group of taxpayers?  We are not talking about a mythical higher income earner but about 40 per cent of the taxpayers.  It is quite clear from the sums that the new child benefit allowance being brought in to replace the £100 tax allowance does not make up the difference to anybody above 35 per cent.  The point is worth making strongly that 40 per cent, two-fifths, of all taxpayers, are in that league and will not benefit from the replacement of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the idea of tax credits is a reasonably progressive notion and I would have time for it.  I want to start it <Col N="2813" /> with the children.  I am not sure that I want to start it with this £100 allowance. If you are going to introduce tax credits that should be done in a more uniform, planned way.  You cannot do it in an <i>ad hoc</i> way by jumping on this allowance this year and on another allowance next year.  When last I contributed on Committee Stage last week I called for some overall, coherent finance legislation which seeks to implement the report of the Commission on Taxation.  We should tackle tax credits in this way, not as is happening in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment which is largely to the same effect as a previous amendment in my name which unfortunately I missed moving as I had to go out for a few minutes.  I support the arguments made already particularly in respect of those who are in full time education between the ages of 16 and 21 where the costs are appalling and where severe difficulty is caused for a huge number of families.  The abolition of this allowance is not substituted for in the great majority of those cases by the higher payment of children's allowance because the loss on the tax side is greater than the gain on the children's allowance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the fact that 40 per cent of taxpayers were in that category.  I thought the percentage was slightly higher.  In any case, 370,000 taxpayers pay above the standard rate and each one of those is worse off straight away.  It is ridiculous to argue that these people are relatively well off when they constitute such a huge proportion of taxpayers and when someone on the average industrial wage is paying tax at his marginal rate well above the standard rate. At a time when the costs of third level education in particular are very high and causing tremendous difficulty to people who can ill afford them, it is wrong to withdraw the child allowance.  In spite of what the Minister said, I find it difficult not to detect an anti-family bias in this matter because the higher payment of the social welfare allowance does not compensate the majority of people involved. They are worse off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2814" /> I fully accept that if you are essentially trying to carry out a social welfare provision you should not do it through the tax code and that you should have less rather than more allowances.  However, the way in which this is done and the extraordinary fact that children are singled out seems to display a bias of that kind which is very regrettable.  The biggest expense in relation to children is not in respect of relatively young children for whom a higher social welfare allowance can be claimed but in respect of those over 16 years of age whose parents are now at a double disadvantage because the expenses in relation to those children are very much higher than those for younger children.  For that reason, the amendment should be accepted and I hope the Minister will reconsider his attitude in relation to this matter.</P>

I should like to thank Deputy Brennan for raising the questions relating to health expenses and the residential property tax.  It is proposed to produce an amendment in respect of health expenses to ensure that, if such expenses occur in respect of dependent children, they will be allowed.  The residential property tax is levied, as far as the income ceiling is concerned on the basis of the previous year and it is not necessary to introduce an amendment until next year.  However, I intend to introduce such an amendment because it should be allowable &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It indicates a loss of balance and sense of reality.  To come back to the points made by Deputy Brennan, I agree the withdrawal of the child tax allowance represents a loss to some families but, even ignoring the benefits of the increase in child benefits, the allowance to which Deputy Brennan referred constituted £150, which is about £58 per child when the maximum tax rate against which it could be set is taken into account, I do not think a sum of £58 will make all the difference as to whether you can pay fees for third level education &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, the purpose of this essentially is to convert what were previously allowances into tax credits. I take Deputy Brennan's point that it would be more desirable to convert all the allowances into credits but, in practical terms, it is probably more sensible to <Col N="2816" /> do it on a incremental basis as we are doing, which is not unreasonable when one bears in mind that changes introduced suddenly can engender a degree of opposition which is not necessarily reasonable, whereas a change which follows a pre-ordained pattern and introduced step by step is more likely to be acceptable to the taxpayers and digestible as far as the administrative system is concerned. In moving this allowance into a credit, the Government are adopting a reasonable course of action.</P>
      <P>I must return to what Deputy O'Malley said because he tended to take a line from Deputy O'Kennedy in regard to an anti-family bias.  There is no anti-family bias as far as I am concerned, if anything my bias would be in the opposite direction. I have already told Deputy O'Kennedy that the Government have given a commitment in the White Paper accompanying the current constitutional proposals to review existing legislation to remove any anti-family bias which might exist.  I should like to assure Deputies O'Malley, O'Kennedy, Séamus, Brennan, Gay Mitchell and others that as far as the tax code is concerned I would be keen to ensure that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners take their part in this review quite seriously.  It is important that the tax code should be seen to encourage families in every way in undertaking the very heavy responsibilities which are theirs in modern times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of loss suffered by the removal of this allowance when compared with the increased child benefit is very small in practically every case.  In most cases of families with children there is a large benefit.  A very large number of children currently are not within the tax code at all because the income of their parents is so low.  They do not benefit by one single penny from the child tax allowance whereas they will benefit very substantially from the increased child benefit.  I should like to quote a document that is frequently quoted by the other side of the House, the 1916 Proclamation, which refers to cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  That is precisely what an equal child benefit <Col N="2817" /> does.  It gives an equal benefit to all children whether they are the children of taxpayers or the children of non-taxpayers. If, on the other hand, one does not want to cherish all the children of the nation equally one goes for the tax allowance approach, which gives a greater benefit to the parents of some children than to the parents of others.  It does not give any benefit to the parents who are paying no tax and it gives proportionately greater benefits to parents paying tax.  I suggest to Deputy O'Kennedy, and others, that that is not in line with the spirit of the Proclamation of Easter 1916.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>5.&mdash;Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1967, is hereby amended, as respects the year 1986-87 and subsequent years of assessment, by the insertion, in the definition of `dependant' in subsection (1), of the following after paragraph (b):</P>
      <P>`and</P>
      <P>(c) a child who, for the year of assessment&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  (I) is under the age of 16 years, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2821" /> (II)  if over the age of 16 years at the commencement of the year of assessment, is receiving full time instruction at any university, college, school or other educational establishment, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  is a child of the individual or, not being such a child, is in the custody of the individual and is maintained by the individual at his own expense for the whole or part of the year of assessment:</P>
    <P>Provided that the provisions of subsections (3), (4), (5) and (7) of section 141 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1986) shall, with any necessary modifications, apply for the purposes of determining whether relief is to be granted under this section as they apply in determining whether a deduction is to be allowed under that section, except that in a case where the child's income exceeds the amount specified in the said subsection (4) relief under this section shall not be allowed,'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is of a technical nature, in that the purpose of the new section is to secure that children in respect of whom the normal income tax allowance has been withdrawn by section 4 of the Bill will continue to be regarded as dependants for the purpose of claims to relief in respect of health expenses under section 12 of the Finance Act, 1967, which is a point raised by Deputy Brennan a moment ago on the previous amendment.  At present that section defines an individual's dependants as including any person in respect of whom he has been granted an income tax child allowance under section 141 of the Income Tax Act of 1967.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill proposes to rewrite section 141 so that in future it will apply only to incapacitated children.</P>

      <P>Hence the need for the present amendment so as to prevent a child who was excluded from a claim for <Col N="2822" /> the normal income tax child allowance also being excluded from the ambit of relief in respect of health expenses.</P>
      <P>The amendment also provides for an increase in the amount of income which a child is permitted to have in his own right before being excluded from the scope of the relief.  This increase is in line with that proposed by section 4 of the Bill for incapacitated children in relation to the income tax child allowance and the income limit which applies in the case of qualifying children for the purpose of the single parent allowance.  The proposed amendment will apply to some 282,400 taxpayers with dependent children who would otherwise lose their entitlement to claim tax relief in respect of any qualifying health expenses incurred in respect of those children.  However, it will result in no additional cost to the Exchequer as its purpose is to maintain an existing entitlement. It was never the intention that the withdrawal of the income tax child allowance would also result in denial of relief in respect of health expenses, hence the introduction of this amendment.</P>

      <P>We support the amendment, but I must say this is the clearest evidence of the failure of the Government to give effect to their own intentions.  This Bill was already three weeks late when introduced into this House in its final form.  The Minister for Finance comes in this afternoon to move an amendment to this already delayed legislation, to ensure that 282,400 people who would be entitled to claim under health expenses would not be deprived of that right which has been theirs.  If this is not an example of the laziest possible approach of a Government to such legislation, I cannot imagine what is.  This, in addition to amendments which the Minister has introduced this afternoon, underlines the fact that it is time this Government, in presenting the Finance Bill decided, first, to present it in time and, secondly, to enable us to look at the Bill as presented and then table our amendments to it.  Here is one time <Col N="2823" /> amongst many in this Bill when the Minister is proposing to amend his own proposals. We agree with that amended proposal but it is an example of their totally unsatisfactory and careless approach which does not give an opportunity for proper consideration of the legislation in this House.</P>

It is the purpose of any Government to consider any improvement that can be made to finance legislation, either to <Col N="2824" /> stamp out evasion and raise revenue or to create better incentives within the tax code.  I make no apology whatever to anybody for introducing any amendment that I can, up to the very last minute that it is possible for me to do so, if it either improves the incentives in the Finance Bill or stamps out evasion that should be stamped out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That the Minister makes no apologies to me does not matter.  However, I insist that this is an example of the Government's contempt for the Oireachtas.  They have delayed the introduction of this Finance Bill by three weeks over and above the date on which the Taoiseach indicated it would be introduced in this House.  In that they failed to honour their undertaking, they have forced this House, made up of the elected representatives of the people, to engage in a procedure which is totally and utterly unsatisfactory in relation to full and proper consideration of this most important annual legislation.  The Minister makes no apology to me for introducing a very detailed amendment at 2 p.m. this afternoon.  It is not to me that he should be apologising.  He should be apologising to every Member of this House and to the people outside for not allowing the elected representatives adequate time &mdash; or, indeed, any time at all &mdash; to consider these amendments which he is introducing to his own legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all want to see the Finance Bill leave the House much improved on what it was when it came in, but that should be as a consequence of amendments, by and large but not exclusively, introduced by Members of the Oireachtas other than the Government.  If the Government are not prepared, at the end of their three months of preparation, to present in final <Col N="2825" /> form what they really want, that is another example of the totally inept manner in which they do their business. At least we should be allowed perhaps just one day to consider what they have spent three months in presenting.  I object to the fact that we are not being allowed even one day.  In respect of much of this legislation the House is being deprived of having even two minutes to discuss amendments.  Much that will be now rushed through the Dáil will not even be touched upon during this debate.  If that is the Minister's notion of parliamentary reform &mdash; the Minister who was going to have a better way of planning the nation's finances &mdash; let him not apologise to me, let him apologise to the public to whom he made a false undertaking.</P>

      <P>In page 13, lines 30 to 32, to delete &ldquo;and (b) `£286' were substituted for `£312', in each place where it occurs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to reduce the PRSI allowance of £312 to £286. Bearing in mind that the PAYE section of taxpayers in general are by far the hardest hit it is quite inappropriate to make this change.  It is probably as a result of some marginal change in a tax rate.  If it is, it is simply taking back with one hand what is given with the other.  It seems to be pointless and unfair to make a change of this kind.  The figure for the allowance should be allowed to remain at £312 because of the burdens which are being carried by those taxpayers especially at present.  I do not think there has been any reduction in PRSI and presumably this is supposed to balance some tax allowance.  If it is, it is an example of an illusory change which has been made because whatever benefit there is in relation to that change is taken away by the amendment which is proposed to this section.  That is why I think it should be left as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has the same effect as Deputy O'Malley's amendment but it goes further than what Deputy O'Malley has addressed himself to in this sense. This is a consequence of the Government's decision in 1983 or if not, 1984, to reduce the level of the PRSI allowance from £312 to £286.  This allowance was £312 in 1982 and the Government deliberately decided in 1983 to reduce it to £286.  Accordingly, each successive year on the Finance Bill we have had the same provision to reduce the level of the PRSI tax allowance to £286.  Logic supports Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa more than it supports Deputy O'Malley and I in that clearly what they are proposing is to update the allowance to take account of inflation and to provide an equivalent sum &mdash; I would not think that it is equivalent &mdash; in this year of 1986 to what £286 represented in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not proposing to go that far. We are proposing only that it be restored to a figure of £312.  That is entirely reasonable on our part.  This is not a case where the Minister can say we are being irresponsible and making extravagant claims or promises.  We are proposing to put PRSI taxpayers in the same condition relative to what they were in 1982.  I say relatively because if we were to go all the way we would have to adjust the figure for inflation.  That we have not proposed to do.  It is also desirable not just from the point of view of logic or equity but also because, as the Minister may be aware, the Commission on Taxation indicated in their first report that all of these deductions should be treated similarly and that what really is of importance for the wage earner is net income.  It does not matter whether net income is reduced by what we call income tax.  PRSI or the levies so beloved of this Government.  In <Col N="2828" /> reality they are all a tax on income.  That is something this Government have not faced in any way consistent with reality or consistent with the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>Far from moving towards the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation the Government have consistently &mdash; you have to give them credit for this &mdash; moved the other way so that they have increased the burden of PRSI while not giving the appropriate tax allowance in respect of the payment.  They have increased the levies or introduced levies which were not there when the commission first sat.  One of these levies, fortunately, has been removed this year. The Government through all these actions far from showing themselves ready to move towards tax reform in the broadest sense as the commission have proposed, are doing the opposite.  For these reasons the very minimum we could propose would be to restore the PRSI tax allowance to what it was in 1982.  I would have to say that logic and inflation support Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa more than they do my case and that of Deputy O'Malley but maybe we are being restrained in this situation.  For that reason the Minister should accept our proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I support entirely the arguments made by Deputies O'Malley and O'Kennedy.  There is a grave injustice being done in this.  The whole purpose of the allowance is to make up for the injustice of the PRSI deduction on gross income.  A wage earner on the relatively low figure of £10,000 would pay, at 8.5 per cent £850 in PRSI.  If that were tax deductible, which it should be, he would save £420 on the 48 per cent rate which is the rate proposed in this Bill.  That is on the lower figure.  There is much more involved with the higher brackets.  The figure of £10,000 is relatively low in current times.  If the Minister does what he is purporting to do.  he should raise the amount to £420.  The amendment is to raise the figure to £400. The reduction from £312 to £286 is inexplicable and has no justification.  A similar <Col N="2829" /> position occurs each year and the Minister has never given in to it.  It is an issue of great frustration and annoyance for people who have such major reductions from their wage packets.  Tax and PRSI is taken from their wage packet and this leads to a miserable take home pay to feed and clothe their families.</P>
      <P>There are increased allowances in this Finance Bill which are without justification. As the Minister would say they are incentives to do something which they may never do.  Here we have a clear case of justice in the allowance for PRSI which should be tax deductible.  We have based the figure of £400 on a very low income of £10,000.  The Minister should yield to one or other of these three amendments. There is grave injustice being done which should be redressed.  I hope the Minister will tell us how much it would cost and also give some other justification apart from the cost to the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The other justification is that account must be taken of all the other measures in the Finance Bill to relieve taxpayers, against the very severe background in which almost the entire income tax revenue is absorbed in the service of the debt.  There are limits to what can be afforded and therefore the cost is probably the most persuasive argument of all.  In regard to the amendments put down by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy O'Kennedy the increase to £312 would cost £4.5 million in 1986 and £7.5 million in a full year.  Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment would cost £19.8 million in 1986 and £33 million in a full year.  Apropos the remarks made by Deputy O'Kennedy in criticism of amendments being introduced, I intend to introduce an amendment in respect of section 8 of the Bill concerning profit sharing, that employees of companies be granted a tax relief in respect of purchase of shares in the companies.  This does not arise on this section but as I intend to introduce an amendment to that effect on Report Stage I am mentioning it now so that it will be in order.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that the proposal made by Deputy O'Malley and myself would cost £4.5 million this year, which is a net cost of about £3 million.  I wish to remind the Minister that his predecessor on one occasion indicated that he would propose as soon as possible to restore the tax-free allowance on PRSI to what it was.  This was changed. Instead of getting back to where we were in 1982 when this was also an issue, what we have done is reduce the tax-free allowance.  Four years later no attempt is being made to implement it.  If that is the way the Minister proposes to act then it is not worth very much.  The cost of this is minimal.</P>

      <P>Recognising the enormous cost of my amendment and the minimal cost of the other two amendments, the Minister has not addressed himself to the injustice of the PRSI system which this allowance was intended to redress.  The allowance goes a little more than half way to redressing it in some cases and not even half way in other cases.  The fact that there is an allowance is an acceptance by the Minister that there is an injustice and this must be adjusted in some way.  Why does the Minister adopt the position that PRSI payers should not be compensated or given relief in the same way as other reliefs are given, all of which are of considerable cost to the Exchequer?  There is a justified case here for total relief on PRSI.  PRSI payments should not in any case be subject to taxation and should have full relief.  Does the Minister think that there is a good case here which he will look at and endeavour to adjust?  He cannot just say, this is going to cost us £19 million and we are not going to do it. Could he say when he intends to give justice in this regard?</P>

      <P>You can call it what <Col N="2831" /> you like.  Effectively it is the same as a tax.  It is not like insurance in the sense that there is no no claim bonus.  There is no actual basis for it.  It is not related to risk.  It is a contribution towards the cost which is levied in an indiscriminate way. The notion of giving a tax allowance to offset what is effectively a tax is not a very tidy way of doing business.  My preference would be to rationalise the system and to remove the necessity for any allowance of this kind.  My basic argument against the case which Deputy Mac Giolla is making is that when one takes into account all the other things that are being done in this Finance Bill, the people on whose behalf Deputy Mac Giolla is making the case are benefiting considerably against a background in which the State has relatively little means with which to give them benefit.</P>
      <P>Let me illustrate this by pointing out that in respect of a single person on PAYE with a wage of £10,000 per annum, prior to the budget the tax he would be paying would be 30.59 per cent and as a result of the budget the tax take on his income will be reduced to 28.15 per cent.  That is a significant improvement by any standard in a year in which the Government's means are still reduced and in which incomes are increasing by larger amounts than inflation.  Taking all those things into account it is not an unreasonable concession.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla has been taking the same approach as Deputy O'Kennedy, taking one particular item and ignoring all the others and speaking in general terms.  Make any case you like, almost, and people will be substantially better off as a result of the budget.  If we were to take what Deputy Mac Giolla is proposing we would add almost £20 million to our current budget deficit or we would have to cut expenditure or increase taxes. Therefore, regretfully I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has invited us to take all the things into <Col N="2832" /> account.  In 1982, when this PRSI contribution was £312, total income tax revenue was £1,415 million.  This year total income tax will yield £2,350 million, close to twice as much.  That is taking everything into account.  In 1982, from this point of view, there were no income levies.  They are there now.  We can take indirect taxation, which has jumped enormously since 1982.  The State take on petrol is 67 per cent &mdash; it was 48 per cent.  The case we have been making is unanswerable and the Minister cannot claim that an increase in income tax of £400 million over last year represents decrease in income tax.  How could he make that case?</P>

I ask Deputy O'Kennedy to contemplate all the Departments of State that would have to be abolished.  We have to pay the interest on debt, much of which accumulated when Deputy O'Kennedy was Minister for Finance, or elsewhere. Deputy O'Kennedy spoke about lack of time to debate the Bill but the type of amendments he has put down and which we are debating are only rehashes of arguments he made outside at the crossroads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 33a:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>`Cospóir' means the National Sports Council (an Chomhairle Náisiúnta Spóirt) which was established by the Minister of State at the Department of Education on the 10th day of February, 1978;</P>
      <P>`tax' means income tax or corporation tax, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>(2)  (a)  This section applies to a gift of money which, on or after the 6th day of April, 1986, is made to the Minister for Education for the benefit of Cospóir and is not deductible in computing for the purposes of tax the profits or gains of a trade or profession or is not income to which the provisions of section 439 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, apply.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Revenue Commissioners may consult with the Minister for Education in relation to any question which may arise in connection with paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a person proves that he has made a gift to which this section applies and claims relief from tax by reference thereto, the provisions of subsection (4) or, as the case may be, subsection (5) shall apply:</P>
      <P>Provided that, in determining the net amount of the gift for the purposes of those subsections, the amount or value of any consideration received by the said person as a result of making the gift, whether received directly or indirectly from Cospóir or any other person, shall be deducted from the amount of the gift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  For the purposes of income tax for the year of assessment in which a person makes a gift to which this section applies, the net amount thereof <Col N="2834" /> shall, subject to subsection (5), be deducted from or set off against any income of the person chargeable to income tax for that year and tax shall, where necessary, be discharged or repaid accordingly; and the total income of the person or, where the person is a wife whose husband is assessed to income tax in accordance with the provisions of section 194 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the total income of the husband shall be calculated accordingly:</P>
    <P>Provided that relief under this section shall not be given to a person for a year of assessment&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if the net amount of the gift (or the aggregate of the net amounts of gifts) made by him in that year, being a gift or gifts, as the case may be, to which this section applies, does not exceed £100, or</P>
    <P>(b)  to the extent to which the net amount of the gift (or the aggregate of the net amounts of gifts) made by him in that year, being a gift or gifts, as the case may be, to which this section applies, exceeds £10,000.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where a gift to which this section applies is made by a company&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the net amount thereof shall, for the purposes of corporation tax, be deemed to be a loss incurred by the company in a separate trade in the accounting period of the company in which the gift is made, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the references in the proviso to subsection (4) to a year of assessment shall be construed as references to an accounting period of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is being introduced in response to a decision by the Government to provide a measure of tax relief to encourage persons to make monetary donations to bodies who are engaged in the various aspects of amateur sport.  It is appropriate that such donations should be channelled through Cospóir, the <Col N="2835" /> National Sports Council.  Cospóir was established by the Minister of State at the Department of Education on 10 February 1978 with the following terms of reference.</P>
    <P>(1)  to act as adviser to the Minister of State at the Department of Education in relation to the implementation of the Government's policy on &ldquo;Sport for All&rdquo;, the policy for which derives from the Council of Europe Sport for All Charter.</P>
    <P>(2)  to promote initiatives and innovative measures in regard to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the development of sport and physical recreation as leisure pursuits, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the raising of standards of performance in competitive sport.</P>
    <P>In the course of carrying out its objectives, Cospóir initiates its own schemes and programmes and recognises national governing bodies of sports which themselves run sporting activities of different kinds.  Recognition is decided by reference to criteria laid down by Cospóir and the Department of Education.  There are nearly 90 such recognised bodies at present.  In general, the activities with which Cospóir is concerned are of amateur status but, in line with modern trends and because of the expenses involved in some particular sports, a certain element of professionalism is tolerated in special cases &mdash; for example, motor sports.</P>
    <P>Cospóir operates in close liaison with the Department of Education, and its chief executive officer is a member of the staff of that Department.  Its funds are in general supplied from the Department of Education Vote, but some small amount of funds is obtained from occasional sponsorship.  The funds from sponsorship are paid into a separate bank account which Cospóir has been given authority to operate, but all funds disbursed by it are sanctioned by the Minister of State at the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Among the many costs which the <Col N="2836" /> organisation incurs are, for example, special assistance to selected sports in need of assistance: allocation of sports scholarships to promising athletes; publication of the quarterly magazine <i>Sport in Ireland.</i></P>
    <P>Because of the great interest in sport throughout the State and because of the importance of sport to the health of the nation, the Government feel that the general public should be encouraged to contribute to the increasing costs involved in the propagation of sport and its allied activities.  To this end the section provides tax relief to persons who make contributions to Cospóir via the Minister for Education.  In order to qualify for relief the aggregate amount of contributions must not be less than £100 in any year of assessment or accounting period and relief will not be given for any excess over £10,000 contributed in a year or period.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate the cost of the proposed relief, which will depend on the extent to which money is donated and on the rate of tax of the donors.  It is likely that donors will be mainly high rate taxpayers in which case it can be taken that the Exchequer will bear between 48 per cent and 58 per cent of the amounts donated by individuals and 50 per cent of the amounts donated by companies, because of the tax forgone.</P>
    <P>This is one of the amendments being introduced on Committee Stage to provide something not contained in the original Bill.  If we were to follow Deputy O'Kennedy's advice we would not be introducing amendments of this kind at this stage but, as I said earlier, when the Government find that they can encourage a useful activity they will use every opportunity open to them up to the last stage of the Bill to introduce improvements.  I wish to pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Seán Barrett, who was very much associated with the suggestion that an amendment like this should be introduced. I had the honour, as had Deputy O'Kennedy, of being for four years the Minister responsible for sport.  I recognise the importance of sport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This amendment will give some positive benefit to corporations not only to gain a tax relief but also to enhance their corporate image and I hope it will give a significant financial and promotional benefit to individuals and companies to make contributions towards the development of sport.  Ireland has earned and deserved a worldwide reputation as a country that has made a distinguished contribution, particularly to amateur sport, at world level. It must be recognised that amateur sport on the part of the distinguished athletes who win medals at the Olympics and other world contests would not be possible but for the training and coaching activities carried out in every parish and suburb in the country.  Were it not for the activities of clubs at local level, it would not be possible for those who ultimately <Col N="2838" /> make the great contribution of winning an Olympic medal to be identified in the first place.</P>

      <P>It is important that individuals should have an opportunity to make a contribution to sport that would be tax deductible.  I realise that individuals may wish to contribute to Cospóir perhaps for a specific activity of interest to them, without looking for any enhancement of their corporate image. When we were thinking of this matter originally it was our intention to confine the relief to individuals but, as a result of discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Barrett, it was decided to extend the relief to corporations.  As he pointed out, there are many corporations who would benefit from the opportunity, not just from a tax point of view but also from the point of view of making donations and therby gaining some public identification with sporting activities.  This tax concession will be a significant new source of funds for the promotion of sports that would not have been available otherwise. In addition to money being allocated each year in the Estimates for sport and for Cospóir, it is desirable that there should be another source of funds from the commercial sector.  The type of activity that sector might wish to get involved with could be different from that which the Government would get involved with in the normal course.  The existence of different stimuli acting on Cospóir will <Col N="2840" /> ensure that every possible source of funds will be identified.</P>
      <P>The development of sport should be seen as having considerable potential for the development of our tourist industry. One of our attractions as a tourist destities on a scale and in an environment not available elsewhere in Europe.  It is significant that in the White Paper on Tourism specific reference is devoted to the need for Bord Fáilte and Cospóir to get together to develop sports-related tourism.  In that way the development of sport will not only be beneficial for our own people but also beneficial to our balance of payments.  I commend the amendment to the House.  I hope it will be possible for the Minister of State to speak further on this because I know he has many plans on how to promote this new incentive in the coming years.</P>

      <P>Regarding the funds coming into Cospóir, can the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, with or without the consent of the Minister for Finance, regulate those funds and designate how they will be spent?  With regard to contributions by individuals or companies, can a company making a large contribution designate any sport, say, Gaelic football or squash or tennis, or any body who should be the beneficiary of such contribution to Cospóir?  Is that possible under the Act or must it be a contribution to Cospóir without any ties attached?  We have seen on television an increasing amount of advertising by football teams.  I think the Kerry team advertise a particular company who make washing machines.  Are we trying tax evasion into this section?  Could a company sponsor a football team and then make a contribution to Cospóir which could be designated for that team, which in turn could make a refund?  Is it possible to designate or must the contribution go into a common fund to be distributed by Cospóir without any strings attached, with the control of the Minister?</P>

Essentially that would be a matter to be determined by Cospóir in consultation with the Minister of State.  He can decide either that the assistance can be given to, say, a coaching scheme that would be available to all sports or, if he wishes, to a particular sporting body in respect of the promotion of a particular sport.  Of course, it will be confined to amateur sport.  The scheme will effectively work very flexibly in order to encourage the best possible benefits to sport.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;(1)  In this section; save where the context otherwise requires&mdash;</P>
      <P>`company' has the meaning assigned to it by section 1 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976;</P>
      <P>`director' and `employee' have the meaning respectively assigned to them by section 13 (1) of the Finance Act, 1972 and who are full-time directors or full-time employees of the company or its holding company;</P>
      <P>`right' means the right to acquire ordinary shares in an employer company or its holding company in the case of a group of companies;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2847" /> `market value' shall be construed in accordance with section 49 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975:</P>
    <P>`ordinary shares' means shares forming part of the ordinary share capital of a company.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person realises a gain by the exercise of an option to acquire shares in an employer company or its holding company and where such person is a full-time director or full-time employee of a company then in computing the gain associated with the exercise of such option relief shall be granted for the purposes of the Tax Acts including Capital Gains Tax as if the person had paid valuable consideration at market value for the shares subject to the option subject.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of granting relief under subsection (2) of this section, relief shall not exceed half of annual salary as computed for the purposes of PAYE subject to maximum annual salary of £20,000.</P>
    <P>(4)  Provided this relief should only be taken once by any qualifying person during his lifetime and shall not apply to any individual who holds now or in the future more than 10% of the share capital by whatever name called of his employer company or an associated company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to amend the section which the Minister himself is now proposing to amend.  It is in relation to the share option scheme.  I want to allow my colleague, Deputy Brennan, to speak to this amendment but before doing so I want to make the point that our amendment to this scheme has been in for four days.  Just one hour ago we got, in the list of amendments the Minister circulated, a very complex amendment to his own proposal.  That is outrageous.  We had no chance to consider it.  It was issued while we were here in the House.  We have no chance at all to analyse it.  I say again that the manner in which the Government are treating this House is outrageous.  They are certainly not clear in their own minds <Col N="2848" /> as to what they want to achieve.  I do not have time now, in the time available, to discuss our own amendment.  I would like to give way at this point to Deputy Brennan because clearly the first proposals in this Finance Bill were totally and utterly contrary to what the Minister wished to achieve.  Our proposals are certainly much more effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak out of turn and will give way to Deputy Brennan in a moment or two. Will this section have a more severe effect on the business community?  The legislation will now apply to assets other than shares.  Since the exercise of an option is the important term, will the Minister outline precisely what he and the Revenue Commissioners have in mind?  What qualifies as an exercise of an option?  This appears to be, in part, a follow up of section 186 of the UK Taxes Act, 1970, but it leaves out some of the more favourable sections of British legislation since that time.  I am sorry we have not much more time to consider this section because it is an important section.  I hope the Minister will reply to the points I have raised.  Will it affect assets other that shares?  What qualifies as an exercise of an option?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important sections in the whole Finance Bill this year.  I really have to object to the way in which the House is being treated this afternoon in regard to the Minister's amendments.  I have been here since 3.30 p.m. engaged in this debate as have a number of other Deputies and I did not have an opportunity to get the Government amendment, nor was it handed to me.  We have been following this legislation since 3.30 p.m. and I would have honestly thought that any amendment introduced by the Government within a few hours of the closing of the debate on the most important section of the Finance Bill would have been made available to the House.  The reason I think it is the most important one, and I object to the way we have been treated here this evening, is that it radically <Col N="2849" /> changes the basis of taxation of stock options.  The Minister intended to do the right thing which was to make it more attractive particularly for foreign executives but also for our own executives to participate in Irish industry.  That is a noble thought and one that I, and every Member of this House, subscribes to.  But when the Minister wrote the legislation what was in it, at least up to 3.30 p.m., was making subject to income tax benefits and gains in regard to share options which heretofore were only subject to capital gains tax.  In one example based on share options of about 20p there was an additional £2,000 or £3,000 taxation on the granting of the share options to executives in companies.  Also, this income tax was being imposed at a time when the executive had to find the money to exercise the option and, at the same time, to pay the tax on the option. So the executive in question was being caught both ways.  Perhaps the Minister's amendment has changed all that.  In the one and a half or so minutes left to the House on this section of the Finance Bill, I would like the Minister to confirm to the House, which has not had an opportunity to study his technical amendment, whether the charge to income tax, which will be a massive disincentive to the whole share option scheme, actually reverses what is in this legislation?  One thing is crucial and that is that we have got to encourage Irish industry; we have got to encourage Irish business.  The intention behind this legislation was quite noble. Unfortunately, the drafting of it was extremely sloppy.  It seems to have had the opposite to the desired effect and will act as a disincentive to people to get involved in share options.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the opening statement on Second Stage I drew attention to the fact that in certain circumstances the new tax treatment, although it was an improvement in respect of the theory of the law as it previously applied, reduced the attractiveness of the existing practice of giving share options as a means of encouraging the attraction and maintenance of <Col N="2850" /> high quality executives to this country. The purpose of the amendment which is now being introduced is to remove any such anomalies and to create a situation in which, where shares are being transferred at market value, the treatment will represent an improvement on previous practice.  I understand that the bulk of shares are made available on an option basis at market value and this section therefore will improve the position of such employees.</P>
      <P>I indicated at the time that I will be introducing an amendment to provide that where an employee or director obtains an option in respect of shares in a company by reason of his employment with that company or another company, and the option price is not less than the market value of the shares at the time the option is granted, the charge under section 7 will not be imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion put down in the name of Deputy V. Brady:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the serious menace represented by nuclear power installations which in the event of an accident could cause serious injury and long-lasting contamination in Ireland, requests the Government:</P>
      <P>(1)  to demand the closure of the Sellafield complex in the light of its deplorable safety record;</P>
      <P>(2)  to undertake a complete review of plans and arrangements for the protection of the civilian population in the event of fall-out from a nuclear accident, take whatever steps are shown to be necessary by this review, and report back to the Dáil within three months on the current state of these plans.</P>
      <P>The disaster at the Soviet nuclear power station at Chernobyl has put the world on notice that all nuclear power, civilian as well as military, represents a threat to the safety of mankind.  The lessons of this latest happening in the unfolding drama of growing nuclear danger are as clear as they are ominous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must now be obvious to sensible people everywhere that there is a real <Col N="2852" /> doubt about our ability to control nuclear power.  Atoms for war or atoms for peace; the distinction between them is becoming less and less significant.  When a deadly nuclear cloud of radioactivity drifts unpredictably around our globe it does not really matter whether it had civilian or military origins.</P>
    <P>While the immediate extent of the fallout and the danger to health arising from the Chernobyl disaster are becoming clear, what is not clear and what we cannot know is the long term effects of this increase in radioactivity levels throughout Europe.  The chilling truth is that nobody can tell us.  We know that the Irish sea and certain coastal areas have already been affected by emissions and discharges from Sellafield.  I have been assured, for instance, by people I trust, that in a town on the coast of Northern Ireland there is an inexplicably high level of leukaemia which is almost certainly related to the Sellafield installation. We also know that these levels have now been added to significantly but with what final outcome we do not know, but we know enough to make us deeply anxious.</P>
    <P>It is no longer enough for countries who wish to do so to remain nuclear free zones.  Our international environment is now polluted by something that happened in an installation in the Ukraine, even the existence of which would not have been known to more than a handful of people in this country.</P>
    <P>Radiation related disease is one of the most insidious enemies that mankind has ever known, particularly because in many cases it cannot be detected or directly and demonstrably related to a particular cause.</P>
    <P>I would like to pose the question whether the people who are in charge of nuclear reactors have the faintest idea of what they should do if a melt down of a nuclear core occurs.  Is it not the position that all they can do is pray that it does not ever happen, because if it does it will be beyond their control?</P>
    <P>There is no safe means of disposing of nuclear waste.  The people in charge do not know how to dismantle a nuclear <Col N="2853" /> power station when its active life is over, yet there are now dozens of these lethal installations in existence which are capable of wiping out large sections of humanity and more are still being built.</P>
    <P>It is, unfortunately, true that the nuclear industry and those who manage it cannot be trusted.  There is clearcut evidence from around the world of lies and cover-ups in the name of national security.  Accidents, leaks and lapses of security have occurred and have been concealed.  The dreadful, inescapable reality is that we are not told the truth about the nuclear threat.</P>
    <P>Immediately Chernobyl happened it was announced in Britain that further tighter controls had been imposed at Sellafield, but how could that happen?  How, after all, we had been previously told, could there have still been room to further tighten the controls?  How could we have been previously assured that the controls were adequate and satisfactory if under the pressure of this latest disaster they can be improved further?  This process of deception has gone on too long. Every time there is an accident or an incident we are told that some new monitoring system or some new safety mechanisms are being installed.  Will this process of deception continue until the final disastrous explosion occurs?  What will they say then?  Will those who have lied and deceived us be brought to trial for crimes against humanity?  These are questions which the time has now come to ask.</P>
    <P>Quite a few days after the extent of the Chernobyl was unlikely to constitute a Minister for Energy said that the Nuclear Energy Board had advised him that the increase in radiation levels following Chernobyl was unlikely to constitute a health hazard.  What does that mean? Does it or does it not constitute a health hazard?  Why is there this constant fudging, these attempts to conceal and cover up?  Even that statement has been contradicted by events today.</P>
    <P>The attitude of this Coalition Government to the deadly danger posed to the Irish people by Sellafield has been feeble and ambiguous.  They have been in gross <Col N="2854" /> neglect of their duty to the Irish people. As the threat to the health and safety of our population became increasingly obvious the Ministers involved have been dragged reluctantly toward a greater but still half-hearted acknowledgement of the reality of the dangers.  As usual, this handler-controlled Fine Gael Party endeavour to conceal their own failures and neglect by personal attacks and by accusing those of us who are trying to discharge our duty to the people on this issue of being alarmist.  I would like to say to the Government speakers in this debate that they need not bother accusing me or my colleagues of being alarmist on this occasion.  We want to sound the alarm and use this debate to persuade, if possible, an aroused Dáil Éireann to act, now that the dangers we spoke about the last time have become a reality.</P>
    <P>In February 1984, after a major leak of radioactive waste into the Irish sea to his eternal discredit, the Minister for Energy declared himself &ldquo;particularly satisfied&rdquo; with the talks he had with the British Government and with an assurance that such an incident could not happen again.  When the now discredited Black report appeared, I called it &ldquo;a dreadful piece of whitewash&rdquo;, and demanded Sellafield's closure and the imprisonment of those responsible for telling lies.  The then Minister for the Environment called this unnecessarily alarmist, and maintained that the level of radioactivity in the Irish Sea was quite safe.  A couple of days later when the British Government themselves decided to prosecute the operators of Windscale for unauthorised discharges, the Minister did a somersault and maintained at one and the same time that &ldquo;a reduction in any contamination will have very beneficial effects for Irish water&rdquo;, and that radioactivity levels did not pose any health risks.  At the beginning of 1985, the Minister of State at the Department of Energy, Deputy Eddie Collins, again stated in the Dáil that I was being alarmist and that &ldquo;there is no danger to people living in Ireland from discharges from Sellafield&rdquo;.  Last December the same Minister stated he had no reason to <Col N="2855" /> believe that the UK was not carrying out its international obligations on the prevention of pollution.</P>
    <P>Only three months later the Minister for Energy stated, in contradiction to all previous assurances, that the safety record at Sellafield had been less than satisfactory, and that he had lost confidence in their safety procedures.  Yet on 12 March last, when it came to a Dáil vote, the Government voted down our call for the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I am indebted to a British newspaper, <i>The Guardian</i>, for the following information on 5 May about the way the German authorities regard Sellafield:</P>
    <P>The state government in Munich has considered it necessary to start a publicity campaign in local newspapers explaining that &ldquo;Sellafield could not happen here".</P>
    <P>It is not up to the Bavarian government to meddle with internal British affairs, but it is our duty to tell our people that the safety of Sellafield, which is more than 30 years old, cannot be compared with that of the new plant at Wackersdorf.  Sellafield, in its present condition, could not operate in West Germany, the advertisement says.</P>
    <P>What a startling contrast with the complacent attitude of this Coalition Government. Their record of weak and contradictory statements have made this Irish Government ineffective and without any real influence in protecting the Irish people from the menace of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The present position of the Government is still unsatisfactory, even though they have recently been forced by the facts to abandon their previous position of telling the people that there is nothing to worry about.  Their response is now the very restricted one of calling for Community inspection.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are urging the Government to discard their present stance of pretending to deal with the menace of Sellafield by looking for European inspection.  That is not an adequate response.  It appears <Col N="2856" /> to us to be taking the easy way out and trying to sidetrack it and avoiding confronting Britain directly on the issue.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Energy realise that the proposal for a Euratom safety inspection force may well require amendment of the Euratom Treaty?  At present, the Treaty provides only for safeguards inspectors, which is a different thing altogether, concerned with ensuring that nuclear materials are not diverted from peaceful to military uses, particularly in non-nuclear weapons countries.  The Euratom inspectors are concerned only with accounting for materials such as uranium and plutonium and have no functions in relation to safety.</P>
    <P>But, in any case, it is no use tinkering with cosmetic proposals for Euratom inspectors or declaring oneself satisfied with reassurances that originate from the nuclear industry.  Nothing less is required than a complete reappraisal of nuclear power by the international community. Ireland, as a member of relevant international bodies, should play an active part in initiating that reappraisal.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Energy adopts the pathetic position of claiming that he cannot demand the closure of Sellafield because it will not be conceded.  We cannot accept that subservient attitude. How can he know that his demand will not be conceded until he makes it and especially if he makes it with the full public support of Dáil Éireann?  It is his duty to keep on calling insistently for the closure of this deadly menace across the Irish Sea.  He must demand the closure of this demonstrably dangerous installation until such time as he succeeds, which we are demanding in this motion.  This is the second time we have made such a demand.  The last time we put down this motion we knew we were right, and the events since then have totally and completely confirmed that we were right in demanding that Sellafield should be closed and refusing to accept anything else.  I cannot understand why the Government still do not accept that position. Their amendment agrees with practically everything we are saying and <Col N="2857" /> suggesting except for the crucial demand to close this dangerous, menacing installation.</P>
    <P>Sellafield is a bilateral issue between the British and Irish Government which should be pursued consistently as such. Our case this evening is that if the Government will not even now after Chernobyl do their duty, Dáil Éireann, as a national Parliament, must give a lead and do it for them.</P>
    <P>What was the state of preparedness here when this latest disaster happened? Did we have in Ireland any worthwhile contingency plans to deal with nuclear fall-out?  Had we even a system in place for measuring the level of fall-out on a countrywide, comprehensive basis? Were the Nuclear Energy Board continually monitoring the level of radioactivity in the air, water and soil so that a sudden rise could be detected from our own domestic sources, something in fact required by the Euratom Treaty?  All the evidence is that we had none of these things.</P>
    <P>There was no preparation whatever for the eventuality of a major radioactive fall-out despite the fact that the possibility of such a fall-out from Sellafield had been there for years and even though the Government are apparently not prepared to offend the British Government by demanding the closure of Sellafield and were not even prepared to take measures here to protect the people in the event of the same thing happening in Sellafield as happened in Chernobyl.  This will have to be probed very deeply.  There was an inexcusable delay in taking any action, even after the announcement of the Chernobyl disaster.  There was a hurriedly assembled <i>ad hoc</i> interdepartmental committee coming together, late in the day, and the very fact that that unwieldy committee assembled in that scrambled fashion proves conclusively that there was no Government plan here to deal with the situation now confronting us and which could have confronted us at any time during the last five or six months or indeed over the last ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board here are little better than a public relations front <Col N="2858" /> for the nuclear industry.  Like the Government, they have been reluctantly forced by the increasing seriousness of the situation into slightly more critical statements, but all always after an event which cannot be denied and then only to the minimum extent they think they can get away with, never publishing these statistics of their accounts but always saying that there was nothing to worry about.  We know now that all along there was something to worry about.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board was set up in late 1973 by Deputy Peter Barry, when he was Minister for Transport and Power, to act as the regulatory agency for an Irish nuclear plant which it was then intended to build.  What we need is a radiological protection institute which will have statutory responsibility for protecting the population against the menace of nuclear fall-out, which will publish full and reliable statistics, and which will speak out fearlessly and independently when necessary.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that the Nuclear Energy Board no longer fulfils any useful function because in our view &mdash; we are determined about this &mdash; there never will be a nuclear reactor built here.  Therefore, there never will be any need for any regulatory agency to supervise it.  What we need, and this has become increasingly obvious, is an impartial institution which will have the statutory responsibility placed on it by the House to oversee the whole area of radiation.  It should take whatever action is necessary, do the monitoring that is necessary and issue the warnings that may be necessary to protect the interests of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The whole area must be reviewed and decisions taken about the extent that dangers can be anticipated and provided for. I should like to make another reasonably important point in regard to this.  These recent experiences have shown also that the fatalist approach which claims that because there is nothing we can do if the holocaust happens we need not bother doing anything, cannot be sustained.  It is now clear that there can be situations short of Armageddon which can be provided against and contingency plans <Col N="2859" /> should be ready to be put into effect as soon as particular radiation thresholds are reached.</P>
    <P>We need to have a co-ordinated plan involving a new radiological protection institute, Civil Defence, the Meterological Service, the universities, the local authorities and relevant Government Departments.  That plan should have been in place long ago but even now we want the Government to take immediate steps to devise it and take all the necessary action it demands.</P>
    <P>On the international side, Ireland should approach other countries which, like us, have no nuclear installations or interests and sound them out on the possibility of convening an international conference of all the countries not engaged in nuclear power production so that they can formulate their position and their demands as countries not engaged in this business of producing nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>As the Italian Foreign Minister, Signor Andriotti, has pointed out, national sovereignty is absolutely irrelevant when considering disasters of the scale of Chernobyl. The accident there has shown that countries with or without nuclear power of their own have an entirely legitimate interest in dangerous and potentially lethal nuclear activities carried out by their neighbours.  The German Foreign Minister, Herr Genscher, has already asked that all plants similar to the Chernobyl plant in the Soviet Union be closed down.  Today there is a widespread recognition that nuclear installations in any one country are not simply a matter for that country alone but are the legitimate concern of all countries but particularly the neighbouring countries.  Certainly, it is axiomatic and basic that the plant at Sellafield is a perfectly legitimate concern to the Irish people and the Irish Government. We claim, and rightly, that we have as much say, and are entitled to as much say in the management of that plant as the British Government and the British people.  We also claim that everything we know about it demands that steps be taken immediately to effect its ultimate closedown.  Does it not frighten the <Col N="2860" /> Minister for Energy, and the Government, that the German Government would use Sellafield as an example in their advertisements of what should not be done in the nuclear industry?  They say that as a plant that is 30 years old it would not be tolerated in Germany but our Government are prepared to tolerate it. Our Government are not prepared to stand up and protest to the British Government about it.</P>
    <P>At the very minimum Ireland should call for an emergency plenary conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency, at which all countries are represented, to discuss the implications and consequences of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl.  There are many things that we should be canvassing international support for at this stage, such as a system whereby, all countries engaging in nuclear power programmes, whether civil or military, promptly notify their neighbours immediately an accident involving the release of radiation has occurred.  The slowness of the Soviet Union in informing its neighbours about the accident was reprehensible and it must be said that the nuclear industry in Britain, and other Western countries, is also extremely secretive and loath to reveal details about accidents.</P>
    <P>We must offer our sympathy to the Russian people on the accident and the deaths and injuries that have occurred but we must also be very critical of the way they handled the effects of that accident in so far as the rest of Europe, particularly their neighbours, are concerned. We should be very active in the international arena in demanding that more openness and frankness be practised in this area.</P>
    <P>In my view there is now an unanswerable case for an international moratorium on the construction of nuclear power stations and other facilities such as reprocessing plants.</P>
    <P>The Chernobyl disaster will have consequences for decades and possibly generations to come.  The consequences for Ireland of a similar accident at Sellafield or other nuclear power stations on the west coast of Britain do not bear <Col N="2861" /> thinking about.  It is clear that no invention, least of all a complex structure such as a nuclear power station, can be regarded as absolutely safe.  The propaganda about well-managed, safe reactors has now been shown finally to be a dangerously misleading palliative.</P>
    <P>The Soviet Minister for Energy said only a couple of months ago about Chernobyl: &ldquo;The odds of a meltdown are one in 10,000 years.  The plants have safe and reliable controls that are protected from any breakdown... The environment is also securely protected.  Hermetically sealed buildings, closed cycles for technological processes with radioactive agents, and systems for purification... Even if the incredible should happen, the automatic control and safety systems would shut down the reactor in a matter of minutes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The incredible occurred after two months not 10,000 years.  We should compare that statement to the official one issued after the Windscale accident in Britain in 1957.  There is a great deal of similarity about what those authorities say about their nuclear situations.  The British said about that accident: &ldquo;It is untrue...that a large amount of radioactivity was released; the amount released was not hazardous to the public and what there was was carried out to sea&rdquo;. Out to sea, of course, meant across to Ireland.  The fall-out from the Chernobyl accident which reached Ireland from 1,500 miles away must surely vindicate the case made by Dr. Patricia Sheehan and Professor Irene Hillery linking the incidence of Down's Syndrome babies among former school girls in Dundalk to the nuclear accident at Windscale in 1957.  Is it not evident from the Chernobyl accident that the treatment of the 1957 Windscale accident by nuclear apologists here and in Britain has been very superficial, if not downright misleading?  The idea that the east coast of Ireland somehow escaped altogether from a serious increase in radiation levals as a result of the 1957 accident at Windscale can now be clearly seen for the absurdity it is.</P>
    <P>I have been appalled by the totally inadequate statement issued by the seven <Col N="2862" /> leaders of the developed industrial world at their meeting in Tokyo about this critical world situation now confronting us. All they could bring themselves to do was to call for better reporting of accidents and emergencies.  One might at the very least have expected that they would call for a worldwide review of the nuclear industry emphasising the need for greater safety.  Far from doing anything of that nature, there is an apparent acceptance by those leaders of the fact that more accidents are going to occur.  They are not apparently concerned about preventing the accidents but only that they should be reported when they do occur.  After that statement one must despairingly ask: is there no one to stand up for humanity, no one to defend the health and safety of ordinary people around the world?</P>
    <P>Ireland must have a clear, independent international stance on this vital life and death issue.  We must not be compromised for any reason.  We must stand out against the proliferation of nuclear power in whatever form it may take.  We must oppose any further expansion, civil or military, and seek the closure of facilities such as Sellafield which pose the most immediate threat to our safety.</P>
    <P>We must demand in the short term the imposition of stronger mandatory international safety controls and the inspection of all nuclear reactors until such time as the only really safe course of action can finally begin internationally.  There are good, sound international examples for us to follow &mdash; Sweden and Austria for example, both of whom have renounced nuclear power.</P>
    <P>The world does not need nuclear power.  It is now apparent that there are other energy resources available which will meet world energy needs for many centuries to come.  It may not now be five minutes to midnight but it is certainly late in the day.  Unless action is taken very soon it is difficult to see how further major nuclear catastrophes can be avoided in the next few decades.  The time for deceptive reassurances and complacency is over.  Countries like Ireland, with no vested interest in nuclear power, must act as best they can in the <Col N="2863" /> interest of the safety if not the very survival of mankind.  I believe that is a solemn duty placed on this country, particularly on us, because we have no nuclear interests and because we have a respected position of neutrality around the world.  From that respected position of neutrality I believe we can do a great deal in this area.  This nuclear menace is like no other because we do not fully understand it and we are helpless before it.  When it arrives there is nowhere to hide and very little we can do.</P>
    <P>The Chernobyl accident must be accepted by all as a deadly serious warning of where our modern world is heading. It is likely that countries over which this particular nuclear cloud has passed will experience deaths, disease and genetic malformations, some of which will manifest themselves many years from now.  Why should we be compelled to live under this shadow?  Sellafield is the immediate issue, but we must now confront the whole issue of nuclear power as such.  Nothing else has the ultimate disastrous potential of a single serious nuclear accident.  I do not want to suggest that those governments who support a nuclear industry in their own countries do not seek what is right for their people, but I do honestly believe they are wrong in their judgment in identifying where the good of their people really lies.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the House a quotation from very unlikely source.  These are not the words of some timid pacifist or misguided environmentalist but a sombre message from a leader whose macho credentials are as good as any of those bestriding the world stage today.  It was Winston Churchill who said:</P>
    <P>The stone age may return on the gleaming wings of science and what might now shower immeasurable blessings upon mankind may even bring about its total destruction.  Beware, I say, time may be short!</P>
    <P>Once again I am asking Deputies on all sides of the House to support this motion.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies to fully understand what is happening in the world <Col N="2864" /> around us today, why our people are so full of fear and apprehension at present. Many of the things that were good, wholesome and beneficial for us have turned sour.  We all know that our parents used to advise us, as children, to go out and get some fresh air, wash in the rain &mdash; because it was good for us &mdash; bathe in the sea, to eat fresh vegetables, drink milk.  These were the good things of life. Today that is no longer the case.  All of those things now in different parts of Europe and here represent potential hazards to health.  Are we losing our senses that we tolerate, without protest, this devastation of our natural environment, this turning upsidedown of our daily lives and the things that matter to us in our daily lives?</P>
    <P>Deputies must now be aware &mdash; if they were not aware when we last discussed this matter &mdash; that there is deep anxiety widespread throughout the country about the implications of a Chernobyl-type disaster for this country.  People have seen pictures of what has been happening in Poland &mdash; children queueing up at hospitals to get some form of antidote.  They now learn that health warnings have been issued in Scotland nearby.  They know that radioactivity from Chernobyl has reached this country.  Indeed, this afternoon we learned that a researcher in UCD has discovered in a sample of milk that there is a level of radiation which is dangerous and represents a serious threat to health if it is repeated in other samples. People know that Sellafield represents a serious risk to their health and safety.</P>
    <P>I believe they are looking to Dáil Eireann this evening, and we must respond. It is our responsibility to take action of a positive nature which will help allay their fears and anxieties.  If Dáil Éireann were to pass this motion and the Government, armed with that declaration of national support, were to raise this matter to inter-governmental level, as a matter of national security, then I believe the British Government would have no alternative but to respond.</P>
    <P>We are urging the Government and the Minister for Energy, in the best interests of our people, to take action now, <Col N="2865" /> not to delay any longer.  As I have said, perhaps it is not five minutes to midnight but it is getting very near it.  First, we want the Government to directly confront the British Government on Sellafield and to demand its closure.  Second, to take a number of initiatives in the international area which would be directed toward dealing with the growing global menace of nuclear power, opposing any further expansion and the imposition of mandatory international safety controls and inspection.  Third, we want the Government to abolish this useless Nuclear Energy Board, replacing it with a new radiological protection institution with greatly revised powers and functions. Fourth, and very urgently, we ask the Government to put in place a comprehensive system involving all the appropriate agencies and Departments which would be designed to protect our population to the greatest possible extent from the effects of a nuclear fall-out.</P>
    <P>The recent disaster has shown a very serious gap in our affairs in that regard. The Government must now move very quickly to put that new type of system in place.  What we are seeking from the Government at this time we are seeking for the vital best interests of the Irish people.  We see these things as necessary to protect the safety and welfare of our people at this stage.  Above all, we want positive action on Sellafield.  That is the most important thing that the Government can and should do immediately to protect the Irish people from this nuclear menace which is now threatening the population in so many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Government once again have put down a sidetracking amendment to our motion. Their amendment agrees with practically everything we are saying in our motion, with the exception of the closure of Sellafield. I ask again for support for our motion from all sides of the House.  It is necessary in the public interest and I particularly emphasise the crucial central signifance of the closure of Sellafield in <Col N="2866" /> the interests of the future health and safety of the Irish people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In immediate response to the Leader of the Opposition, I welcome his conversion and his now anti-nuclear stance. Obviously, that is the position of his party.  It is quite different from and totally inconsistent with the position which he and his party took in the late seventies. Certainly during the period of Fianna Fáil Government between 1977 and 1981, during which time Deputy Haughey was both Minister and for certain period of time Taoiseach, I cannot find any record of any statement of dissent by him in either of those roles in relation to the course of action which the then Minister, <Col N="2867" /> Deputy O'Malley, was proposing in relation to a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point in County Wexford.  I accept the conversion and certainly welcome it.  It is a position which all of us in this country should have in relation to our supply of energy.  We have many alternatives to nuclear energy and should develop them and strive to ensure that we will be able to have sufficient energy without nuclear power stations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey may have been verging somewhat on the alarmist in his remarks recollecting his childhood days and the advice he received to get out and get fresh air, go swimming &mdash; I presume on the north side &mdash; and enjoy the fresh vegetables.  I am not sure why this advice cannot be given in the environment of Kinsealy at this time, but I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that that advice is still being given in County Kerry and in many parts.</P>

A great deal has been done to preserve the environment in the last number of years with regard to pollution and other areas relating to the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House about the accident at the nuclear power station at Chernobyl near Kiev in the USSR.  It also give me the opportunity to reiterate the concerns the Government have been constantly expressing about the safety of the Sellafield operation, I want to assure the House that we are steadfast in our resolution to pursue unrelentingly our request for the establishment of a European inspection force.  The accident at Chernobyl has brought home to the entire world the nightmare and appalling long term consequences which can result from an accident at a nuclear establishment.  If any good can come out of an incident like <Col N="2868" /> this, it ought to be that any complacency about safety in the nuclear industry will now be dissipated for ever.  The consequences of such accidents have an appalling potential for disaster.  The people of the world have a right to vigilance of the highest degree, constant inspection of facilities, constant review of safety procedures and standards, and complete openness about what is going on in the nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed concern in a recent address to the Seanad about the lack of information supplied by the Soviet Union on the Chernobyl accident.  The Soviet accident was not disclosed until some days after it happened and then only after high levels of radioactivity had been detected in Scandinavia.  The amount of information disclosed by the USSR was simply not acceptable.  They have an obligation to fully disclose what has happened.  The Irish Government have requested our Embassy in Moscow to get the fullest information possible about the accident and its effects.  I am happy to learn that, probably due to world outrage, the Soviet Union now appear more prepared to disclose to the world what actually happened.  I understand that the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Hans Blix, and two others are proceeding to the USSR on the invitation of the Russian authorities.  Our Counsellor in Vienna, who deals with International Atomic Energy Agency maters, will brief us on the outcome of the visit as soon as details become available.</P>
    <P>The International Atomic Energy Agency in fact learned of the incident in a casual manner and it was not until 28 April that the Soviet Permanent Representative confirmed that there had been an accident.  The Soviets have told Mr. Blix that the levels of radiation are decreasing but have not said from what level.  I understand that Mr. Blix has also told the Soviets that the function of the IAEA is to act as an instrument of collaboration between member states, and he referred the Soviets to the guidelines agreed by member states in the wake of Three Mile Island, and that only full and <Col N="2869" /> adequate information can stop the flood of speculation.  He has suggested a meeting within the agency where Soviet experts would inform other experts of the nature of the accident and discuss the lessons to be learned.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday, the Nuclear Energy Board have advised me that radioactivity levels detected in air samples taken between Friday, 2 May and Sunday, 4 May are less than 10 per cent of the levels reported in the United Kingdom and are about double the levels of naturally occuring radioactivity.  The board have advised that these levels are not significant from a health point of view.  I am glad to be able to tell the House now that I have been advised by the Nuclear Energy Board that these air levels have dramatically declined since Sunday last.</P>
    <P>Levels of radioactivity have been detected in milk from the Leinster area. One sample tested showed a somewhat higher level than others which, if continued, would have been a cause of concern. However, analysis of later samples indicates that the levels are decreasing. The Nuclear Energy Board have advised that there should be no concern about drinking milk.  This situation is being kept under review, and the testing of milk samples is being extended to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Airborne radioactive contamination is routinely measured by the Nuclear Energy Board on a daily basis in collaboration with the Meteorological Service at two monitoring stations situated in Dublin and Valentia.  In normal times air and rain water samples are measured on a monthly basis at Dublin, Rosslare, Valentia, Belmullet and Mullingar.</P>
    <P>But since Tuesday, 29 April, when first reports of the Chernobyl incident reached Ireland, air and rain water samples have been taken on a daily basis.  In the samples taken up to Friday, 2 May there was no detection of radioactivity arising from Chernobyl.  However, radioactivity was detected in air samples taken in Dublin between Friday, 2 May and Sunday, 4 May.  The Nuclear Energy <Col N="2870" /> Board have advised that in relation to iodine 131 these levels are about one-tenth of the level reported in the UK and only about twice the levels that occur naturally.  This is significantly less than in other European countries.</P>
    <P>Imports of foodstuffs coming from countries seriously affected by the Chernobyl accident will be checked at points of entry to ensure that no contaminated foods are imported.  These will be continuously reviewed, and if necessary such importations will be prohibited.  This would be by Government order under the Restriction of Imports Act, 1962.  The European Commission have submitted a proposal to the Council of Ministers for an EC regulation banning the importation of cattle and certain foodstuffs from east European countries and a recommendation to prohibit trade within the Community of dairy produce, fresh vegetables and fruit exceeding specified levels of radioactivity.  It is expected that a decision of the Council of Ministers will be announced tomorrow.  The customs authorities have been requested to have arrangements in train to implement the expected EC regulation as soon as it is announced.</P>
    <P>The customs authorities have been requested to put procedures in train immediately whereby the Nuclear Energy Board would be informed of vessels visiting Irish ports carrying cargo originating from contaminated countries.</P>
    <P>Screening procedures to assess contamination levels are available for persons arriving from countries which were seriously affected.  Notices about these facilities will be displayed at ports and airports.</P>
    <P>The monitoring system operated by the Nuclear Energy Board has been adequate to determine the level of radioactivity which has occurred to date.  However, in the light of these recent incidents, I propose to have these procedures reviewed in consultation with the Nuclear Energy Board.  I will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we will continue to be in a position to accurately measure future radioactivity, and I have <Col N="2871" /> already instructed the board to recruit some additional staff.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee established following the Chernobyl accident will continue to monitor the situation and advise if future action is necessary.  The purpose of this committee is to ensure that there would be coordinated action in the event of a serious nuclear accident affecting this country. The committee consists of representatives from the Department of Energy, the Nuclear Energy Board and the Departments of Defence, Agriculture, Communications, Industry and Commerce and Environment.  Other Departments or agencies would be called upon, if necessary.</P>
    <P>I should not allow this occasion to pass without making some reference to the number of quite misleading assertions made about Civil Defence, some very prominently featured, and I would be failing in my responsibility to those who serve Civil Defence if I did not correct any suggestion that Civil Defence is not prepared to fulfil its responsibilities.  It is important to bear in mind that, as part of the national defence structure, Civil Defence is established principally to provide for the protection of the civil population in wartime.  In relation to any possible risk from the peacetime use of nuclear energy, responsibility in the first instance rests with the Nuclear Energy Board operating under the aegis of my Department.  In so far as Civil Defence is concerned, the first requirement is regular close liaison with the Nuclear Energy Board, which does occur, and an appropriate contributions from the Civil Defence organisation should the board and the occasion so demand.  Civil Defence does have the capacity and is making trained personnel available to assist the Nuclear Energy Board where such assistance is necessary.  A Civil Defence national, regional and county warning and monitoring network has been established, intensive training has been carried out in the detection, measurement and prediction of radioactivity and the Civil Defence radiac instruments, <Col N="2872" /> to which I have already made reference, are capable of detecting levels of radiation over a range from very high &mdash; such as might be expected to result from a nuclear war &mdash; right down to levels far below those which would be regarded as hazardous.</P>
    <P>I wish to take the opportunity to once again state the policy of the Government with regard to Sellafield.  The Government's position is that radioactive discharges from Sellafield should be minimised and eliminated as soon as possible through the use of the best available technology. This position has been stated at every opportunity in contact with the British authorities and at all appropriate international fora.</P>
    <P>As this House is aware, British Nuclear Fuels Limited, the operators of the Sellafield plant, have commenced a programme which includes measures designed to effect significant reductions in radio active discharges at Sellafield involving total expenditure of almost £900 million on additional safety measures. Notwithstanding this programme, recent incidents at Sellafield have given rise to major concern about the operation of the plant.  At a meeting of the Ireland UK Contact Group on 14 February last officials of my Department conveyed our grave anxiety at the recent incidents at Sellafield and our annoyance at the inadequate notification procedures.  The earliest of these incidents involved the discharge of 458 kilograms of uranium into the Irish Sea on 24 January 1986. This was followed by a plutonium gas leak on 5 February and on 13 February 1986 a fire occurred at the Drigg low level radioactive waste dump near Sellafield. All three incidents were discussed at the meeting on 14 February.  The British authorities assured my officials in the course of that meeting that the radiological emissions to the environment resulting from these incidents were insignificant.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, a prompt notification procedure was agreed at the meeting and notification of more recent incidents at Sellafield has been practically immediate. <Col N="2873" /> There were two such incidents at Sellafield, one at Trawsfynydd and one at Capenhurst.</P>
    <P>At Sellafield there was a leak of 250 gallons of low level radioactive water from a pipe into a containment trench on 19 February 1986.  We were informed that two workers were slightly contaminated on that occasion.  The incident at Trawsfynydd involved the discharge of 15 tonnes of carbon dioxide contaminated with radioactive elements and we were informed that no raised levels of radioactivity were detected off site.  This incident occurred on 21 February.  On 1 March there was a leak of plutonium inside the Sellafield plant and two workers were contaminated.  Finally, on 2 March one worker was slightly contaminated at Capenhurst nuclear power station during the course of carrying out routine maintenance.</P>
    <P>More recently two minor incidents at UK power stations took place.  At Dungeness there was a small explosion during the commissioning of a new piece of equipment.  This occurred on 31 March. At Heysham in Lancashire there was a shut down yesterday of a nuclear reactor after a fire in a part of the plant away from the nuclear installation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no release of radioactivity arising from this incident. The Nuclear Energy Board have assured us that neither of these incidents has any significance for the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government recognise that these incidents are, in themselves, of little radiological significance to Ireland.  Clearly, a balanced view of the situation must be maintained.  However, the frequency of these incidents has caused the Government and the Irish people to lose confidence in the safety of the plant.  The safety record at Sellafield has been less than satisfactory and the frequency of recent accidents poses the possibility of the occurrence of an accident in the future <Col N="2874" /> which could have serious consequences for this country.  This concern is heightened by the recent revelation regarding the errors in the information on radioactive discharges supplied to the Black Inquiry.  I am very much aware of the increasing public concern at the continued operation of the plant &mdash; a concern which is increasingly shared by the British public.  For this reason the Taoiseach, at his meeting with the British Prime Minister on 19 February 1986, urged that there be a review of safety procedures at the plant.  The further incidents which followed that meeting underlined the necessity, as we see it, for such a review.</P>
    <P>I have said that monitoring indicates that the radiation exposure of the Irish public from Sellafield is negligible.  But, as I already said in this House, we are being exposed to a potential hazard from an operation outside our jurisdiction. This makes the problem an international one.  The view of the Irish Government is that this issue must be resolved by the European Commission under the provisions of the Euratom Treaty.  The Government consider that a European inspection force is necessary to determine independently whether Sellafield can operate safely or whether operations should be suspended or cease until it is rendered safe.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Collins, and I have had separate formal discussions with Commissioner Clinton-Davis about this matter.  In various discussions we have had with the Commissioner it was stated that we were satisfied that the Commission has a central and vital role to play in the implementation of the Community's basic radiation safety standards under the Euratom Treaty.  The Irish Government's call for a European inspection force was stressed.  The Commissioner has confirmed that the question of a Community inspection force is one which is being examined under the terms of the Euratom Treaty, and I was glad to not his recent comment on television that the Chernobyl accident had strengthened our case for the question of a Community <Col N="2875" /> inspection force is one which is being examined under the terms of the Euratom Treaty, and I was glad to note his recent comment on television that the Chernobyl accident had strengthened our case for an independent inspection force.</P>
    <P>On 11 April 1986 our Ambassador in Brussels, on behalf of the Government, formally requested the Commissioner to establish a Community Health and Safety (Nuclear Installation) Inspection Force to report to the Commission, and in turn to the member states, on existing or potential health or safety problems at individual nuclear installations in the community.  We are awaiting a response from the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Government have been called upon from time to time to demand the closure of the Sellafield plant.  I have to say that the question of closure is not as simple as it seems.  There is already a large quantity of spent fuel for reprocessing stored at Sellafield.  This would continue to require attention and management even if further reprocessing is not carried out at Sellafield.  The Government must be assured beyond doubt that the plant can and will be operated safely without danger to the Irish public and in conformity with the principles laid down by the Euratom Treaty.  Let me assure the House that I will continue to give this matter my fullest attention and I will decide on what further steps are appropriate in the light of the response from the European Commission.</P>
    <P>We need this assurance that the plant is being safely operated and we consider that the basis for any such assurance must be an investigation by a European inspection force such as we are proposing.  The Irish Government are of the firm opinion that it is in the interest of all concerned to support this inspection force at European level and to support any measure that might be adjudged necessary by an inspection force to improve the safety of Sellafield, even if this transpires to mean suspension of operations or closure of the plant.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise, of course, that the <Col N="2876" /> levels of radioactivity are carefully monitored by the Nuclear Energy Board which is engaged in a continuous monitoring programme which monitors radioactivity levels in fish, seawater, seaweed and sediment taken from the Irish Sea. Independent research programmes are also undertaken by the environmental radioactivity laboratories of University College, Dublin, and Trinity College, Dublin.  The results of these monitoring programmes have clearly shown that contamination has occurred in the Irish sea as a result of discharges from Sellafield. However, the radiation dose to the Irish population resulting from Sellafield is very small and would be, on average, less than 1 per cent of the limits advised by the International Commission for Radiological Protection and by the European Community.</P>
    <P>A joint Irish-Spanish research cruise is planned for this year to monitor levels and distribution of Caesium 134 and Caesium 137 in the area bounded by the north-east Atlantic dumpsite, the south-west coast of Ireland and the north-east coast of Spain.  This will include an examination of the extent to which discharges from Sellafield and Cap de la Hague have now penetrated these more southerly waters.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to reiterate my assurances, based on the best possible advice, that the fall-out which has been detected should give rise to no concern. I will continue to ensure that the situation is fully monitored, and that Members of the House and the public are kept fully informed.</P>

      <P>When the reactors exploded <Col N="2877" /> at Chernobyl in the Ukraine on 25 April and the news broke last Monday week the world was shaken by the disaster. That date, 25 April 1986, will go down in history as the day the impossible happened. It was an accident which made a mockery of the confident statements of the nuclear energy industry throughout the world.  One of those statements said that plants such as Chernobyl, were ones of total safety where a serious loss-of-coolant accident was practically impossible.</P>
      <P>In 1975 the United States Atomic Energy Commission report concluded that an accident big enough even to kill 70 people would only happen once in a million years in a plant such as the one at Chernobyl.  Last week in Britain Lord Marshall, chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board, at a meeting held by the British Nuclear Forum said:</P>
      <P>Radiation inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone would be no worse than smoking a couple of extra cigarettes a year.</P>
      <P>How wrong they all have been.  There are serious lessons for us in this country and let us not be fooled by the nuclear industry's own propaganda or by Britain's sweet talk.  Accidents such as that which happened in the Ukraine could happen here and we must take the necessary steps to ensure that it does not.  The British Energy Secretary, Peter Walker, last week said:</P>
      <P>Russian reactors do not have total containment and would not be permitted in Britain.</P>
      <P>That is a totally untrue statement because none of Britain's magnox reactors have containment zones.  An accident such as that in the Ukraine could happen in Britain. Mr. Walker also claimed that no emergencies involving significant radiological hazards to the public had occurred in Britain.  That is totally untrue.  In October 1975 an accident at Windscale led to at least 30 deaths.  To date we have heard half truths and lies from the nuclear industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accident at Chernobyl presented <Col N="2878" /> President Regan with an opportunity to indulge cold war mongering against Soviet Russia.  It also gave Deputy Haughey an opportunity to beat the Government and beat the Brits at the same time with the weapon of nuclear danger.  While listening to the contribution tonight by the Leader of the Opposition I was quite taken aback by his change of mind in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the motion.  After the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, and Ireland facing the risk of fall-out, we appreciate more <Col N="2880" /> readily the risk of higher radiation levels along the east coast.  Radiation levels on the east coast of Sweden are 100 times normal.  The Swedish Radiological Institute said it would be unsafe within 60 miles of the reactor in Chernobyl which, earlier this year, was hailed as a model of safety by nuclear experts.</P>
      <P>Experts have said that that accident was very similar to the accident at Sellafield in 1957.  Members of the House will know that at that time there were claims in regard to one of the two convents in Dundalk.  Subsequently, we had an unduly high rate of Down's Syndrome babies.  This was never adequately clarified but there was subsequent evidence that radiation levels were abnormally high after that accident.  The fact that such evidence was suppressed indicates that the British had something to hide.</P>
      <P>I represent an area in which the people have been increasingly apprehensive about the proximity of Sellafield to the Louth coast.  Medical practitioners in north Louth and south Down have expressed alarm at the seemingly careless approach adopted by the Coalition Government and the Nuclear Energy Board.  Speaking at a meeting in Rostrevor in March a Newry GP claimed that traces of radiation were found in extracts from a tree trunk cut in Dundalk some time ago.  He pointed out that the ill, the elderly and the feeble were more susceptable to radiation than young people.  A medical practice in Dundalk which has been monitoring the number of still births in the area discovered that the percentage of such births is much higher than in any other community care area in the country.  It is more than significant that that practice is right along the Louth coast, particularly concentrating on the town of Dundalk and the Cooley Peninsula which is very exposed to any fall-out from Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Dáil if we can continue to tolerate these statistics or to ignore them. Can we continue to pretend there is nothing wrong?  Must we allow feelings of fear, worry and apprehension to grow among our population?  Are we allowing our environment to be slowly and surely <Col N="2881" /> destroyed?  Having regard to what has happened at Chernobyl can we continue to reassure ourselves that this cannot happen at Sellafield?  Will we continue to overlook the leaks and emissions from a nuclear plant a mere 60 miles from our more densely populated areas around the east coast?</P>
    <P>If an accident similar to that at Chernobyl were to happen at Sellafield what contingency plans have we to protect our people?  What provisions have we made to save our food production? What future would face the people of Ireland in such an eventuality?  Could our population not be decimated by such an accident?  Would not half our countryside be laid waste and barren in a few hours? Sellafield has an appalling accident rate, yet we are being told that a Chernobyl type accident could not happen there. The British are treating us with disdain and contempt in this matter.  They have plans to expand the nuclear industry and are clearly determined to continue with them.  The time is long past for the Coalition Government to cry &ldquo;stop&rdquo; and immediately demand the closure of Sellafield. The Government owe it to the people to protect their health and their future.</P>
    <P>Can we continue to tolerate the existence of an unpredictable monster on our doorstep, no more than a human error away from activation, a monster that knows no bounds in regard to destruction, a monster that could be as docile as a lamb at 12 midnight and viciously devastating and uncontrollable at 1 a.m.? Sellafield must be closed.  The lesson of Chernobyl must be learned immediately. The Coalition must assert our rights as a sovereign State and member of the EC. They must continue with the demand for closure until Britain accedes to it.</P>
    <P>The world will forever live with the memory of the human destruction in the wake of the Chernobyl accident.  We believe the true statistics have been suppressed. The Russians obviously are not prepared to let the world know the dangers involved in tinkering with nuclear energy.  The nuclear threat must be removed because it is dangerous and lethal. <Col N="2882" /> The future of humanity is at stake and Ireland must play its part in efforts to safeguard the future of mankind.  Pretending that Britain has the know-how adequately to render Sellafield safe is not good enough.  Our future cannot be left in the hands of the British Government or British Nuclear Fuels.  Our medical practitioners along the east coast have told us something is wrong and this must be examined immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,012,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Farm Classification Office.</P>
      <P>In the national plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> published in October 1984 the Government announced their intention to introduce a farm tax based on &ldquo;adjusted acreage&rdquo;.  Under this proposal all farm holdings of 20 adjusted acres and over will be liable for the tax.  Farmers with holdings below 80 adjusted acres will be exempt from income tax when the tax is fully in operation and farmers with holdings of 80 adjusted acres and over will continue to be liable for both the farm tax and income tax.</P>
      <P>The main features of the farm tax as provided for in the Act are that it will be determined on the basis of the number of adjusted acres in each farm.  An adjusted acre is the area of land having the equivalent productive potential of one acre of the best land in the country in ideal growing conditions.  The rate of tax will be uniform for all local authority areas.  The tax will be levied and collected by the local authority in each area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2883" /> The Farm Classification Office comprises the two institutions established by the Farm Tax Act, 1985, the Office of the Farm Tax Commissioner and the Farm Tax Tribunal.  The functions of the commissioner are to compile classification lists of farm holdings according to their adjusted acreage and transmit them to local authorities to enable them to levy and collect the farm tax.  He will also determine appeals, compile revision lists and send copies to local authorities.  The functions of the Farm Tax Tribunal are to hear and determine appeals against determinations of the commissioner.  The commissioner is obliged to amend the appropriate classification list if the tribunal so decide.</P>
    <P>The Farm Tax Commissioner was appointed on 26 August 1985 and the staff of the Farm Classification Office began the field work on inspecting holdings on 27 September 1985.  The field staff of the office consists of 91 inspectors and 97 temporary assessors, mainly recent graduates in agricultural science. The tribunal will be established shortly.</P>
    <P>The commissioner, in settling the valuations, must have regard to certain criteria which are set out in detail in the Act and which have been deleted here.  These factors include the quality of the soil, the prevailing climate, aspect, shelter and so on.  The Act provides for the Farm Tax Commissioner to be independent in the performance of his functions.</P>
    <P>The Farm Tax Commissioner will produce the first classification lists in September next.  They will be distributed to local authorities who will put them on view and any farmer who feels he has a grievance as to how his land has been classified will have the right to appeal initially to the commissioner and subsequently, if he so wishes, to the Farm Tax Tribunal.  I shall be prescribing in due course the level of adjusted acreage which will be liable for tax in 1986 but the figure to be selected will depend on the rate of progress being made by the commissioner and his staff.  To date, about 2,000 holdings, comprising some 600,000 statute acres, have been <Col N="2884" /> inspected by the commissioner's staff and we expect that by October about one million acres will have been inspected.  It is estimated that nine million statute acres remain to be inspected before the statutory target of classifying all holdings of 20 adjusted acres and over is reached. The objective is to complete the classification process by the end of 1991.  The residual functions of the Farm Tax Commissioner will then be incorporated in the Valuation Office.</P>
    <P>The commissioner has started with the largest holdings and is working his way down, as is provided for in the Act.  The income tax system will continue to apply to all farmers for the income tax year 1986-87 and the Finance Bill provides that farm tax paid will be allowed as an income tax credit in respect of farming income.</P>
    <P>The Estimate of £6,012,000 covers expenditure for the first full year's operation of the Farm Classification Office, which embodies for Vote accounting purposes both the Office of the Farm Tax Commissioner and the Farm Tax Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I know that farm tax has been a matter of some controversy among many people.  The fact is that farmers have been paying rates on land almost since taxation was invented.  It was only in 1980 or 1981 that rates were abolished.  While farm tax has a new name, in many ways it is not very different from rates except that it is a less onerous tax in the amount being collected.  Whereas for most of the period that rates and income tax applied to farmers the rates were only allowed as an expense, at present farm tax is allowed not just as an expense but as a credit against the tax.</P>
    <P>I know the case will be made that rates were deemed unconstitutional and to introduce farm tax to replace them is represented by some people as contrary to that decision.  That is not the case. The reason rates were determined to be unconstitutional was simply that there was not a proper system for revising valuations or appealing valuations.  It was not that the idea of levying a tax on land was unconstitutional; it was simply that if <Col N="2885" /> there was to be a tax on land it should be on the basis of a valuation that could be subject to revision or appeal.</P>
    <P>The farm tax in the form now in place does not have the defects of the previous rating system in that it has a system of appeal.  In a way, what we are doing is rectifying the deficiencies that existed in the law prior to the Supreme Court action which led to rates being struck down.  In ways I do not think it is a particularly radical measure.  It is a subject which has evoked a high degree of emotion and objection as if it were something radical, but in fact it is not.  Against the background that we have had rates on land almost since time immemorial, this replacement is really only a rationalisation of the situation in the light of the Supreme Court decision.  When fully operational it will mean that farmers who are below 80 adjusted acres will not have the necessity of keeping accounts for the purpose of income tax and the only tax payment they will be making will be the farm tax payment.  That will represent a considerable relief for the farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>I commend the Estimate to the House.</P>

It will be replaced by a system based on standard results per enterprise and per region, taken from the Farm Management surveys carried out by An Foras Talúntais. These gross results would be adjusted <Col N="2886" /> to take account of capital depreciation, interest payments and other factors, in order to calculate taxable income.</P>
    <P>The system then promised had certain merit and the key words were enterprise, region, capital depreciation, interest payments and other factors.  I am sure the Minister will agree that no such built-in safeguards were contained in the farm tax Bill which came before the Dáil in June last year.  What the Minister has just said runs totally counter to what was being proposed in his party's Programme for Government in October-November 1982.  This tax sets the clock back.  I agreed with that part of the Programme for Government but the tax subsequently introduced, which I know the Minister is totally against, has no regard for the points raised.  There is no regard for enterprise or for quotas, which have now become part of a farmer's way of life.  It has no regard for personal circumstances or ability to pay and no regard for young farmers and new entrants to farming.  It takes no account of the state of development in farming.</P>
    <P>The constitutional aspect of this system of taxation is questionable.  If it is introduced &mdash; and I have my doubts about that &mdash; it will be tested in the courts and will be found to be unconstitutional for the reasons I have outlined, which were also outlined by the Minister's party when in Opposition.  This tax amounts to rates under a different name.</P>
    <P>On the question of adjusting acreages throughout the country, an expert said recently that this task will not be completed for at least 20 years.  The sum of £6 million is now being sought but no yield whatsoever has accrued to the Exchequer from this system.  The Minister has recruited a number of agricultural graduates and others who were employed in positive and progressive work in the Land Commission, ensuring that the land was going into the hands of farmers.  Now they are involved in a work which has no future.  This measure is being introduced in order to keep the two parties in Government together.  It will keep them going until some other crisis arises and <Col N="2887" /> some other diversionary tactic is introduced. The cost this year of setting up this office will be £6 million but we realise that next year, if such an office exists, the amount will be increased.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of all this?  It is a sop to the Labour Party to support the Government in office.  Instead of liability being based on taxable income, this tax on land will be at a flat rate regardless of individual circumstances.  The new system is to be based on the adjusted acreage as determined by the Land Commission.  When this legislation was going through the Dáil, nobody was in a position to attempt to define on a scientific basis the Land Commission's formula for converting land areas to adjusted acres.  Even now we do not have any formula by which this will be done.  I doubt very much if such a formula based on scientific information exists.  If it does, the Minister has an obligation to tell the House.</P>
    <P>We are told that the legislation will provide for a right of appeal against the adjusted acreage.  The Minister can rest assured that there will be many such appeals.  He will find that instead of abolishing the Land Commission he will have to double the staff to deal with appeals. This party are opposed to this Vote and to the principle of the land tax.  The only fair way is to tax incomes, taking into account family circumstances, family expenses, farm expenses, depreciation and so on, as in the case of the rest of the community.  Why should farmers be taxed differently to other sections of the community?  If one system is fair for certain sectors, why should the same system not be so for farmers?</P>
    <P>Land tax is inequitable, even as between one farmer and another.  I know the Minister agrees with me on this point. Income per acre can vary widely between different farming enterprises and in different regions of the country.  It can also vary considerably because of the influence of the weather.  The proposed land tax will ignore all these variations.  In the Government's programme <i>Building on <Col N="2888" /> Reality,</i> the introduction and purpose of the land tax is outlined farily clearly.  It is to draw from the farming sector twice the amount of money currently taken. We are not talking about equity or the ability of a person to pay.  The Government have decided that they must double the take of income tax from farmers and that is outlined in their programme.  I question the wisdom of having this tax introduced without taking into consideration the ability of individual farmers to pay and without taking into consideration the inclement weather conditions we had in the summer of 1985 and the disastrous situation prevailing in the agricultural sector.  Yet the Minister is prepared to go ahead with this mad approach to withdraw from the farming community twice the amount of money being taken at present.  At a time when farm incomes can just keep pace with inflation such a withdrawal will leave little or no capacity for investment.  Not alone will the standard of living of the farm family decline, but agricultural development will just not be possible.  This puts the targeted increase in output very much at risk, and we need this increase badly for the development of the nation.  The weather conditions over the past 12 months clearly confirm what I have just stated.  That is why we are opposing this penal tax.</P>
    <P>When we joined the EC in 1973 agriculture had a bright future.  This was a big thing, because we suffered badly in the industrial sphere when our products became open to competition.  We were hoping to gain from agricultural production in a wider market.  Now we have a situation, for which the Government are not all together blameless, where we have quotas in the main areas of farm production and are going to continue to have quotas.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for your <Col N="2889" /> advice.  I am always glad of it.  I was just making a passing reference to the quotas that have now been imposed by the EC. This will put the farming community in a situation where they cannot increase their production to meet increased costs of farm inputs and this farm taxation. Because of the imposition of quotas the farmers have less opportunity to increase their production, and thus increase their income to enable them to pay this unjust tax, which is inequitable because it does not take into consideration the ability of the producer to pay.  I just wanted to give that example to the Minister to point out to him how unjust this tax is.  This plan and the legislation that was put through the House last year makes it quite clear that there will be future adjustments to the rate of tax.  In other words, the door is open; and I want to warn the farming community that a decision can be taken by any Minister for Finance to increase the amount per acre, say, to £10, £15, £20, £25 or even £30 without taking into consideration the ability of the farmer to pay.  I am not saying the present Minister would do so because I do not think he would, but he will not always be in that seat.  The temptation is always there for any Minister for Finance to increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Or even Deputy Farrelly.  I do not believe the tax will ever be introduced, therefore, we need not worry about it.</P>
      <P>We must have a system of taxation for agriculture where people are rewarded for working and for effort rather than for being idle.  We should take another look at this system now that we have a Deputy of Minister Bruton's calibre in that Department.  He knows what agriculture means to the economy and I am sure he abhors this system.  He has carried out reforms in other areas and perhaps he might take a look at this legislation and repeal it before he leaves office.  Otherwise, Fianna Fáil will repeal it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission has been abolished and the majority of the employees <Col N="2890" /> of that office are now employed in this so-called acreage adjustment, whatever that means.  The Land Commission were involved in land mobility and ensured that there was control on the sale of agricultural land.  As a result of the winding up of the Land Commission this is no longer happening.  It is a pity the personnel of that office are involved in frustrating work, work without any future.</P>
    <P>Many things have been written about this land tax by agricultural journalists, most of whom are against it.  I will not bore the House by repeating what I said on the Second Stage debate last June. Suffice it to say that the farmers can and will pay their fair share of taxation related to their ability to pay, as applies to other sections of the community.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me why people engaged in agriculture should have a different system of taxation from the rest of the community.  We all know administrative delays and difficulties are preventing existing tax from being collected from a small section of farmers.  This should be rectified because it is not the fault of the general body of farmers only this should not be used as an excuse for the introduction of this tax which, as I have already said, is impracticable, inequitable and cannot be implemented because the information which must be provided does not exist at present and the ability of the farmer to pay is not taken into account.</P>
    <P>Neither Fine Gael nor Labour have any mandate for the introduction of a land tax.  Earlier this evening I quoted from the Fine Gael Programme for Government.  The Labour Party's policy on farmer taxation was that all farmers with a taxable income would pay tax and health contributions.  This clearly implies that those without any income should not have to pay tax.  At this stage we should not take any action which would drive a significant number of farmers out of farming, thereby lengthening the dole queues and which is certain to result from the imposition of a land tax.</P>
    <P>Can we devise a taxation policy under this legislation, because that has been questioned, which will encourage rather than penalise farm development?  Can a <Col N="2891" /> new land policy ensure that the land of Ireland makes the maximum contribution to national economic development? I doubt that this land tax will do that.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when as many farmers as possible will have an income which will be sufficiently high to bring them into the income tax net.  I would also like to see a proper taxation system, not a taxation system suited to their individual needs but a taxation system similar to that which applies to the rest of the community.  We have not reached that stage and from what we can see we will not reach it under this régime.  It is a sad reflection on Fine Gael that they introduced this tax which, as I said, is impracticable and inequitable.  Nevertheless, I am afraid they are just going along with the system.  Many organisations have come out against this system as being inappropriate and having no regard whatever for ability to pay.  The continuation of this penal levy is both demoralising and discouraging, particularly to young farmers and young people who want to go into farming for the first time.  It is a very heavy penalty to pay for the continuance of Labour in Government.</P>
    <P>I reiterate our opposition to this tax because of what has transpired, particularly this spring, which should be significant enough to prompt the Minister to do something about this legislation, and I hope he will.  This Minister is forward looking, progressive and a man who intends to carry out his own ideas and policies.  It is important that at this time he should stand up and be counted and he will have the thanks of the farming community in County Meath, many of whom I know very well.  They are looking forward to direction and guidance from the Minister and I hope he will not be found wanting there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take so long.  I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Estimate.  First, on the concept of the proposed land tax, surely all <Col N="2892" /> of us who are involved in the farming community would like to think we will never be in a situation where no tax would ever be imposed on anybody.  That would be regarded as OK in constituencies where there are a great many farmers, but we must take into consideration the overall position and how we arrived at this proposal.  Were it not for a case brought by a number of farmers in the High Court which found the PLV system unconstitutional we would not be talking about a land tax and we would still have rates.</P>
      <P>We all realise the contribution farmers have made to our local county councils for a long number of years through substantial income in the form of rates.  Suddenly overnight county councils throughout the country were short £X million, and individual county councils have not recovered from that or from the abolition of rates on dwellings.  Our Government in the mid-seventies played a small part in starting the removal of rates and in 1977 came the famous abolition of domestic rates which left overall income to local authorities at a standstill Now members of the Opposition claim that no new proposals should be made to improve the overall income of local authorities.  That is evident from the way those Deputies have opposed domestic water charges and the refuse collection charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us who are members of local authorities would like to see more power given to local authorities but we do not want the power to implement charges of any kind.  The collecting of the proposed land tax will be the duty of the local authority as was the collection of rates, including farm rates.  It is interesting to note that a few years ago the reappointed Opposition spokesman on Agriculture &mdash; I am delighted that he was reappointed last week when changes were made which we were not told about &mdash; told in a press release that he was interested in ensuring that a land tax would be introduced, that it was the way forward, a simple way for people on very small farms and, rather than having to pay accountants, it was an ideal way for them to make a contribution <Col N="2893" /> to the State.  Lo and behold, then the present Leader of the Opposition said, &ldquo;No, you must not speak out of turn; there is no way that we will have such a situation.  We will wait until we are in Government&rdquo;.  As a result the Deputy in question said he had made a mistake, that he did not mean that statement, he was thinking of the overall concept of another way of collecting extra revenue for farming.</P>
    <P>When the same party were in Government, when we had not what was talked about here tonight, bad weather for a year, they decided that not enough income tax was being collected from farmers, and they introduced the 2 per cent levy and resource tax.  It is very strange for members of that party to come into this House &mdash; maybe not so strange because it has been known to happen so often &mdash; and, depending on which side they are sitting, change their argument to suit the majority of the people out there who see no point or no need for extra revenue for any section.  Listening to the Leader of that party, the Houdini of Irish politics, one would think we have here a land of milk and honey where no-one has to pay anything for anything because, if the weather improves and buds come on the bushes, there will be plenty of money for everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He is in the Cabinet, not on the Front Bench.  Deputies who are also members of local authorities realise that we have not been receiving money to do necessary repairs to the roads.  As a result, there is a proposal for a land tax to be introduced and the farming organisations are in agreement, although one farming organisation are totally opposed to the measure.  However, from speaking to individual farmers, I know there is a majority in favour of this tax because they see it as an opportunity to make a contribution to the local authority when the land is adjusted.  They will not have to bother with keeping accounts or to keep track of different sales and purchases which require the services of an accountant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that when the budget was introduced this year the happiest people were the accountants because clients whom they thought they would lose as a result of the adjustment still required their services.  Self asessment should be allowed for the majority of farmers who would probably be below 80 adjusted acres.  I suggest self assessment because, as a result, county councils would have an income of X number of £s from individual farmers who adjusted themselves below the 80 acres.  It could be agreed that if there was an overpayment or underpayment as a result of the adjustment the amount could be credited or debited as the case may be.  The majority of the farmers to whom I refer will pay sums in the region of £300 to £500 to accountants in 1986.  More often than not, they will pay the accountants so that <Col N="2895" /> they can prove that they are not liable for tax because of the bad weather.</P>
    <P>As I said, the ICMSA and individual members of the IFA supported the proposal in regard to land tax because it is a positive approach to the whole question of tax.  In my clinics over the past fortnight I have met a number of farmers, well under the adjusted acreage, who are trying to get their books ready for accountants.  This would be a simple way to solve the problem and the Exchequer would benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that details of the tax assessment scheme would be sent to county councils in September or October and that the public could see them then. However, I hope that individual members will be notified of their assessment, as I do not think that the only notification in this regard should be sent to the county councils.  That would not be acceptable.  If land is inspected the individual to whom it belongs should be notified.</P>
    <P>Of course it would be very nice not to have to implement a land tax but other taxpayers must be considered in this whole affair.  When domestic and agricultural rates were done away with, the PAYE sector bore the whole brunt of taxation.  When domestic and agricultural rates were coming into the county councils, there was no mention of water or refuse charges and the overall tax take from the PAYE sector was much less. Not until we get back to the situation where rates are payable will we be in a position to reduce taxation.  The PAYE sector will benefit and there will be more money for repairing roads and so on.  At present some people pay tax and others do not.  Indeed, some politicians advocate not paying anything and they pretend that the same services can be provided without collecting any money.  Irrespective of who is in power or how much we spend the same people will be asked to pay the piper.</P>
    <P>When I spoke to representatives of the farming organisations recently they told me they would accept land tax if everybody else was paying a proportion of <Col N="2896" /> tax on a house or whatever.  I hope the Minister will adopt the suggestions I put forward.  If he does, he will be providing local authorities with the finance they badly need and will be relieving the many people who do not have any idea of how to keep books of the obligation of keeping accounts.  Many of those people never kept a note of what they bought throughout the year and at harvest time paid their accounts.  I accept that the Minister will do his utmost to alleviate the hardship in this area.</P>
    <P>Farmers would welcome a system of self assessment.  Listening to the Opposition one would think the Government were responsible for the bad weather. From the groans and grunts from those benches in the last two weeks one would think they had all the answers, even in regard to the weather.  I must stress that, while it is necessary to keep expenditure as low as possible, we cannot do anything that will diminish the incomes of farmers. Self-assessment is the ideal system for farmers in 1986.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this Estimate.  The last speaker told us it is incumbent on us all to try to reduce expenditure and I accept that, but the measure before us is a classical example of expenditure without return.  The Estimate for £6 million is to enable the Government to continue with this farce of a land or farm tax.  It is a political measure introduced at the behest of the Labour Party to extract money from farmers whether they made a profit or not. In the famous publication, <i>Building on Reality: 1985-87,</i> under the heading, &ldquo;Farm Tax&rdquo; it was stated:</P>
      <P>The new tax will apply with effect from early 1986 and ultimately all agricultural holdings with 20 adjusted acres will be liable for tax.</P>
      <P>Of course, it will not apply from 1986. The publication continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers with holdings of 80 adjusted acres and over will continue to be liable for income tax, but a credit will be given against income tax in respect of <Col N="2897" /> farm tax paid in the year.  Full-time farmers with holdings below 80 adjusted acres will be exempted from income tax with effect from the 1986-87 tax year.</P>
    <P>That will not be the case.  <i>Building on Reality</i> continues:</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will be designed to increase the yield from farm taxation in 1986 to about twice the level produced by the present system.</P>
    <P>That amounts to a continuation of the farce.  Not a single cent will accrue from this tax in 1986 or in 1987.  If the Government were only partly interested in the farm tax as a method of producing revenue they would not have started at the upper end of the scale with large farmers but at the lower end.  Then at least the small intensive farmer with over 20 adjusted acres would pay the farm tax. In the case of the big farmers the farm tax will go as a credit against any income tax liability.  Even if the tax were introduced it would not produce any revenue because it would be set off against income tax by such farmers.  Of course, in that area there is a degree of dishonesty because in section 12 of the Finance Bill under debate in the House farm tax is only allowed against profit for a particular year.  If a farmer is unfortunate enough not to make a profit there will not be any set-off or continuation of the farm tax liability for a further year.  If the Minister is serious about allowing farm tax as a credit against income tax he should amend that section so that any shortfall is carried forward and treated as farm tax paid in succeeding years of assessment. That is the least that should be done.</P>
    <P>The farm tax represents political oportunism, a costly piece of opportunism.  It is an area of public expenditure we could do without and is a classical example of spending taxpayers' money without getting a return for it.  A well known political commentator in the <i>Farmers Journal</i> in the course of an article demonstrated how inequitable the farm tax is.  After 12 months of operation 1,700 farmers have had their acreage adjusted.  We must bear <Col N="2898" /> in mind that nationally there are 170,000 farmers and that gives some idea of the length of time it will take to finalise this programme of acreage adjustment.  The estimate of 20 years may not be too far off the mark because ten million acres remain to be adjusted.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that in this difficult year systems are being devised to extract twice the take from farming.  There was a substantial reduction in farming profits and many cattle and sheep died of malnutrition. It is penal to suggest that finance should be extracted from farmers without taking into consideration their ability to pay when the farming community owe £1,500 million to financial institutions. There is not the kind of bonanza in taxation from farming those outside the industry think, but if there is some money to be got from the farming community there is only one equitable way of getting it, taxation based on ability to pay.</P>
    <P>If a farmer makes a profit in a given year then he should pay his fair share of tax like everybody else.  If he does not make a profit, then equally he should not have to pay tax.  But farmers will be given no credit for paying tax under any other system than that applicable across the board, that being based on people's profit margins and ability to pay.  There is no other equitable or workable system.  The sooner this charade is discontinued the better.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that it will cost probably in the region of £100 million to set up this office for the number of years it will take to complete the acreage adjustment.  Certainly the yield will not justify that expenditure.  I want to ask the Minister &mdash; who is known as a no nonsense, progressive, reforming Minister &mdash; to take another look at this measure before too much of people's money is spent on another bout of empire-building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support our spokesman on agriculture on this Estimate. I concur with what my colleagues, Deputy Noonan and Deputy J. Walsh have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a cosmetic exercise on the part <Col N="2899" /> of this Government to appease the large group of disgruntled PAYE taxpayers, many of whom supported both parties in Government at the last general election in the belief that they would bring about lower taxation, economic stability and financial rectitude.  In the now defunct <i>Building on Reality</i> they promised that farm taxation would make a contribution to the Exchequer from 1986 onwards.  As my colleagues have said, this will not happen.  Indeed it appears that it may not happen until the early nineties.  The Government have engaged in this type of propaganda in order to appease the vast bulk of public opinion totally dissatisfied and disgruntled with the management of our economy.</P>
    <P>This represents an attack on the entire agricultural industry, destroying any confidence farmers had until a couple of years ago.  Yet they intend to extricate more finance from agriculture, further reducing the revenue base of our economy and adding to the misery of Irish agriculture at present.  I cannot understand how the Government are prepared to expend £8 million in two years without any return to the Exchequer, particularly in view of the fact that the present Minister for Finance prides himself on his belief that the taxpayer should get value for money and that there should be seen to be vigilance in the expenditure of public moneys.  Indeed the establishment of this office probably will cost up to £100 million before there would be any yield from farm tax.</P>
    <P>I listened attentively to the Minister and to Deputy Farrelly.  The common denominator in their contributions has been that farm tax really represents rates with a different name.  There has been comparison drawn between agricultural and domestic rates.  It is obvious that the primary purpose of this measure is to impose more rates on people, rate collectors having the job of collecting commercial rated, farm taxation and the now infamous revenue charges being imposed by this Government.</P>
    <P>I have looked at the expenditure involved in this Vote.  I could not but notice <Col N="2900" /> that the postal and telecommunications services will cost the Farm Classification Office some £230,000, a huge amount. The Minister for Finance should recognise the high level of charges for postal and telecommunications services generally, charges which have had a disastrous effect on our industrial base and economic growth.  Indeed these charges infiltrate the service industries and manufacturing industries and affecting industrial output.  We have seen the recent increased charges for telephone calls and the high cost of rentals, which are astronomical when compared with those obtaining in other countries.  The time has come for the Government to direct both these semi-State bodies to create extra revenue by creating an opportunity for their staffs to become shareholders thereby creating funds which would help in their development and expansion and easing the pressure these high charges impose on people generally.  That is highlighted when one notes the small number of staff that will be involved in the Farm Classification Office and the high level of postal and telecommunications charges.</P>
    <P>We note that the Farm Classification Office will contribute in the region of £200,000 by way of employers' share of PRSI contributions.  When one adds the employees' share and the PAYE contribution it becomes obvious that something needs to be done.  I would appeal to the Minister to assertain what, if anything, can be done to reduce the burden that is depriving employers and industrialists of expanding their staff numbers or, in many cases, from maintaining their present levels.  Indeed many lay-offs and redundancies are occasioned by the very high levels of taxation and PRSI contributions. It can be said that the PRSI contributions constitute the final straw breaking the camel's back with regard to economic generation.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister came in to make an unscripted contribution clearly demonstrates that he is not in favour of this type of taxation.  He was not Minister for Finance when this was proposed.</P>

      <P>The normal thing is for a Minister, with the vast resources available to him, to come in here with a scripted speech on occasions like this &mdash; at least that has been the case with regard to all the Estimates I have seen and the Minister is longer in the House than I am.  It is obvious that this represents a passive effort on the part of the present incumbent of that office to deal with this Farm Classification Office Vote, that the Minister, who lives in the lush lands of royal Meath, along with Deputy Farrelly, is not committed to that type of taxation. He knows it to be inequitable, discriminatory and does not make allowances for the family farm contribution, the vast amount of voluntary support given by members of a family farm unit.  The Minister believes that the existing taxation system applicable to agriculture should prevail.  However, he is a member of the Government who have brought about this situation and has no option but to proceed with it.</P>
      <P>How slow the procedure is is shown by the fact that only 2,000 holdings and 600 acres have so far been inspected.  It will probably take ten years before the entire country is classified for farm taxation. The Government have made many cutbacks and put many impositions on the State sector over the past few years and I wonder why they could not turn to another semi-State organisation, very reputable and with tremendous expertise in the field of agricultural development, An Foras Talúntais the Agricultural Institute.  Why did they not ask that organisation, whose services are based in every province, to do this soil survey and evaluation for the Farm Taxation Office?</P>

A very professional survey would be done which would stand the test of time, would be available for many other facets of agriculture and would make a major contribution to agricultural development.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the new Farm Tax Commissioner, a good Galway man, Mr. Fahey.  He comes from a very outstanding agricultural family and is a very reputable public servant.  I wish him well in his new post.  I am sure he will have a busy time dealing with many appeals.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has to check if he has been appointed yet, but that has been confirmed.</P>

      <P>This Government measure is totally unconstitutional and takes no cognisance of a person's ability to pay, or of the large financial input from the industry and the high risk that it is today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly said that the Government were almost being blamed for the bad weather.  We do not blame the Government for that, but we certainly blame them for failing to take the proper measures to alleviate the serious constraints being placed on the agricultural community at present.  The year 1985 was one of the most disastrous for agriculture in our history and vast opportunities and options were available to the Government to relieve the substantial pressures put on farmers, which have resulted in the farmers owing £1,500 million to financial institutions.  There were major financial resources available in the European Community if this Government were prepared to match £ for £.  This would have helped farmers out of their serious financial difficulties as a result of the inclement weather.  The Government went ahead with some cosmetic exercises, with the Taoiseach going to the west with a cheque <Col N="2903" /> for £1 million, supposedly to help the farmers in the Shannon valley.  We now know that only £500,000 of that was spent because a ceiling was put on the assistance to be made available to these farmers. The Government are not prepared to spend the other £500,000 to counter the serious flooding in the Shannon Valley.  The Government do not see the need for immediate action in this regard and many small farmers will be crippled again.  That is why we blame this Government for failing to deal adequately with the critical situation facing agriculture.</P>
    <P>The co-operative managers and directors and the agricultural marketing outlets have taken stock of the serious financial situation of the farmers.  They worry daily about their creditworthiness, their financial stability.  That this is a very high risk financial business is due to the failure of the Government to avail of the financial resources of low interest loans in Europe which could have been made available.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation recently availed of those low interest loans and they are lending that money, coming into the country at 5 per cent, to farmers at 12 to 14 per cent interest.  That is unconstitutional and discriminatory. The Government should have seen that that did not happen.  If the ACC find themselves in financial difficulties, proper management should get them out of that.  The farmers who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in financial difficulty should have had the benefit of the Government negotiating in Europe and making money available under the guarantee of a return at the very minimal exchange rates.</P>
    <P>The Government are asking the farmers through the farm tax to make a major contribution at a time when they are not able to do so.  They expect that the tax rate from farmers in 1986 will be double that of last year.  That is ludicrous. The farmers have not the resources to pay tax and are not taxable.  One would think from listening to Deputy Farrelly that farmers pay no tax here.  We must <Col N="2904" /> realise that farmers make the biggest contribution in indirect taxation of any consumer group.  They contribute by way of VAT payments on general merchandise, agricultural products, farm machinery, fertilisers, steel and many other products. Their spending power and the revenue base they create ensure the protection of many jobs and a cycle of finance which would create some type of economic stability and opportunities, particularly in the PAYE sector, through agribusiness. This contribution has not been acknowledged.</P>
    <P>We oppose farm classification because it will completely destroy the whole structure of the Land Commission.  The staff of that commission have given tremendous service to agriculture and to land mobility in particular.  There is consternation among them as a result of the abolition of the commission.  The Government have failed to transfer some of these staff to the Department of Social Welfare and there is total despondency among them.</P>
    <P>There is also no security for the small farmer.  There is no protective mechanism by which he can be assured that when land becomes available some will be allocated to him through the State agency responsible.  The fact that no Bill has been brought before the House to wind up the Land Commission and change their statutory functions means that the commission still have statutory control <i>vis-à-vis</i> land sales and land mobility.  All the commission are short of is the capital allocation, of which they have been deprived since 1983 when the Government decided that no more money would be made available for land acquisition.  In my own county in the west there are only two staff members of the Land Commission office dealing with land allocation.  The remainder have been put to work on farm taxation and there are thousands of acres still to be allocated to those small farmers in the west who badly need them.  This land is laying fallow in many cases and deteriorating for want of investment and proper management.</P>
    <P>The future for the small farmers of the west looks very bleak.  Because of the abolition of the Land Commission only <Col N="2905" /> those with financial resources will have an opportunity to get land in future.  I cannot understand how the present taxation system has not been utilised to ensure that farmers, along with the other sectors, are given the same opportunities as the PAYE people, the employers, industrialists and others to make their contribution using the same accountancy system prevailing for all others.</P>
    <P>Last year the Comptroller and Auditor General said that sufficient staff was not available to the Revenue Commissioners to deal with the vast amount of accounts which have gathered over the years.  Why have extra staff not been put in there and why has the same accountancy and taxation system which applies to other sectors not been left to farmers?  This is obvious discrimination and it is obvious that the Government want to get a quick take from agriculture and from farmers as they have done in this year's budget through the direct interest retention tax. This tax is totally discriminatory and will help to fill a few holes for the Exchequer which is under serious pressure at this time as a result of the economic mismanagement the country has been subject to for the past three and a half years.</P>
    <P>We are totally opposed to this system and to this Vote because it is only a cosmetic exercise by the Government to try to persuade the taxpayers that some effort is being made to extricate more money from agriculture and from farmers who are already over burdened and not in a position to make any further contribution to the Exchequer than they are making until there are some Government measures created for them which will take them out of the serious economic and financial situation they find themselves in at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the speakers on the opposite side taking the Minister to task for the way in which this aspect of farm taxation has been handled.  They want the benefit of every world.  They criticise the Estimate because there is a charge for PRSI.  They say the PRSI charge is too high and that <Col N="2906" /> farm taxation will be too high.  I wonder where the funds are going to come from to run the State.  This proposal affects farmers differently.  It was, as Deputy Farrelly said, supported very strongly by the ICMSA and opposed by the IFA.  In my county which is slightly south of where Deputy Treacy represents all the small farmers have asked me to persuade the Minister to have self assessment.  They would gladly pay the money because the roads are in bad repair.  They would like to see the county council have funds available.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there are large farmers who are opposing it because they see in this an inequitable charge.  I have some sympathy with them, especially with commercial farmers who, as Deputy Walsh pointed out, hit a bad year.  They are not charged on their profits.  Nevertheless, the Government were faced with a very difficult task.  I do not think they have been unduly harsh in the regime they have produced.  For the people opposite to say that the Government are trying to bleed the farmers and that the farmers themselves are not interested in the system is totally misleading.  It is wrong to say in this House that small farmers in east Galway would not welcome self assessment in the farm taxation area.  I believe they would find that better than paying £400 to £500 to accountants in some of the towns in County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like Deputy Treacy to say to farmers in east Galway that he is totally opposed to the farm tax proposals <Col N="2907" /> and that he wants them to pay £400 to £500 to accountants when they might not in some cases be liable to tax at all.  I do not understand the economics of that if he is really interested in small farmers. So far as I can see, he is trying to add confusion to the system as it stands because very few people especially in the cities, understand the plight of the small farmer.  During the past year they have had a very difficult time.  The Minister for Agriculture made a gesture and brought out a fodder scheme which was intended to supplement their income and to save them from complete disaster.  It was only a gesture.  Yet it has been ridiculed on the far side.  Taxpayers' money was handed out to the tune of almost £20 million.  The Opposition object to this assistance.  I find this very difficult to understand.</P>
      <P>I am in a neighbouring constituency to Galway.  The adjusted acreage in County Clare is likely to be 3:1 or 4:1.  The same type of land exists in east Galway, so the adjusted acreage should also be 4:1 there. I find it very hard to believe that farmers in east Galway would object to farm tax but I understand that there are farmers who have 300 to 400 acres in my area who are worried about it.</P>

Nobody wants to see whether it is going to be of real value. We want to continue with this con but there are many farmers who do not like living a lie.  There may be many fly by <Col N="2908" /> night farmers who turfed out Deputy O'Keeffe when he was a director of Mitchelstown when he put charges on milk in east Cork.  That is why he was turned out and he insists on interrupting me while I am making a case for the honest farmer.  There are many honest farmers who do their duty for this State and who have been blackguarded by those on the opposite side of the House who are saying that this Government are trying to screw them.  Let the question be examined fairly.</P>
      <P>The only people who will lose as a result of farm taxation will be the accountants. I have many accountant friends also.  They are the people who are asked to do the impossible.  I know of many cases of small farmers who are driven bananas from assessments they are receiving from the Revenue Commissioners. They have been receiving £13,000 to £14,000 assessments when, in fact, they do not owe any money or at most £1,000 to £3,000.  This goes on for four to five years.  Yet Deputy Walsh is advocating the accounts system.  The union officials say that farmers are not paying their fair share.  When the assessment is agreed between the Revenue Commissioners, the accountant and the farmer it is found to be 14 to 15 times lower than the original estimate.  Irrespective of whether this Minister for Finance or the next Minister for Finance, even if he is from the other side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Burren where very little grass grows there are acres of stone valued at £1 and £1.25 an acre under the old poor law system.  It was a real joke but the Deputies opposite do not want any value put on land.  They want it to be a free ride all round.  They are badly misjudging the PAYE people who are continuously complaining about being screwed. <Col N="2909" /> Deputy Treacy tried to protect those on PAYE.  The information that will be available as a result of this adjusted acreage will be of more value in the long run to people on PAYE than Deputy Treacy estimates.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the future.  I would like the Minister to turn his mind to self assessment.  I support the plea made by Deputy Farrelly.  This income would be of great value in repairing the county roads which have been rooted up by lorries.  Clare County Council need the assistance which self assessment would generate.  Big farmers do not find themselves in a truly equitable position.  The Government had little choice and they took what was in my view a reasonable course.  The charges which they propose in the adjusted acreage system are not beyond the capacity of those people to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this very important motion.  I am quite sure that after the next election Deputy Carey will get a job as a land tax assessor so he need not have any fears of being unemployed.  I also recommend him to get the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> of 3 May which reveals the new land tax classification system.  It explains the inequity of the system, the appalling method of assessment and the reasons why it is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>If I were in Deputy Carey's position I would resign from the party.  He is convinced that his party are not going in the right direction.  The decision to have a land tax as proposed by the Government is proof of the insane way in which they continue to run the country.  It is an inequitable form of tax coming at a time when the Irish agricultural industry has been robbed of many millions of pounds by the Government.  It is estimated that the cost of setting up the land tax authority is in the region of £6 million.  In an eight year period that will cost in excess of £50 million.  That is a failure before it commences.  To date, there are only 2,000 farmers classified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated in <i>Building on Reality</i> that the land tax would operate at 120 <Col N="2910" /> adjusted acres.  That has been changed and now operates at over 150 adjusted acres.  That is further proof of the contradiction of many of this Government's policies.  The Government are anti-family. Every piece of legislation proposed since this Government took office has been practically anti-family.  They are now making a further attack on the backbone of rural Ireland &mdash; the family farm. The tax does not take into account the individual's ability to pay.  It does not take into account the different crops, their related costs and their profitability.  That makes it a most unfair and inequitable tax.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the difficulties in the agricultural industry.  I am not blaming the Government for everything. There can be failures in family farms and in agriculture generally.  In a year when there is a failure the man with a low income will still be expected to pay his land tax.  There is no provision for deferment or any method of protecting the individual concerned.  I ask the Minister who comes from a farming background and who has a great interest in agriculture to take note of this and to introduce some amendment to alleviate what could be a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice that we have an army of highly paid inspectors.  The method being adopted is unscientific. That has been stated by the teaching staff of University College, Dublin.  Because of this the system is likely to get bogged down in appeals.  There may not be any problem in regard to land tax until the year 2000.  Farmers have to pay very high prices.  Fertilizer prices are 25 per cent above those in the UK.  There is little point in talking about reducing inflation when farmers are burdened with excess costs at every level of production: fertilizers, feed costs, energy and diesel oil. The costs of capital is in the region of 16 per cent to 18 per cent.  It is at an all time high.  Government Ministers boast openly about our low rates of inflation. We were always led to believe that inflation and interest rates worked side by side.  That is far from true.  It is obvious <Col N="2911" /> that this economy is not working properly. It is a grave contradiction to have interest rates at such a high rate and inflation rates so low.</P>

      <P>There are a number of them.  We have a cock-up of a Government who boast openly about inflation. They forgot to tell the Irish farmers about the exorbitant rates of interest which they are paying.  Nearly every other farmer in the country is in trouble, facing liquidation or the threat of it, but the Government have failed to take cognisance of it. Irish farming is being strangled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture said at Baldonnell that he was bringing home £200 million for Irish farmers.  In the Dáil last week he said it had been reduced to £70 million, but from the way things are turning out and the changes I have been talking about, I estimate that the final package for Irish farmers will mean an increase of a mere £30 million, and I challenge anyone to contradict that. Since the Government came to office, Irish farmers have been worse off by £200 million.  Every budget introduced had <Col N="2912" /> more and more cutbacks, and the Minister now in office will go down in history as the Minister for retreats and cutbacks. He is more concerned with running divorce clinics in his constituency of Waterford than in Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Land Tax Office being set up will definitely fail.  The Minister, when he goes around doing his constituency work at the clinics, agrees that the serious problems of Waterford farmers are depressing.  The chairman or the secretary of the IFA there resigned recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister want me to shout?  Farming is in deep depression and we have been presented with another white elephant in the Land Tax Office, like the one on which the Minister for Finance allowed himself to be sold out, the National Development Corporation.  The setting up of that was totally against the Minister's better judgment, but he had to compromise and I am convinced he is well aware that he is setting up another white elephant in the Land Tax Office.  Judging by the recent remarks of the farm tax commissioner, Gerry Fahey, on RTE recently, this tax will be like the residential property tax which will cost hundreds of millions more to administer than will be taken in revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six years is a long time and that is the period it will take to classify all farms in the country.  If the present trend in our agriculture continues there will be only about 75,000 farmers on the land of Ireland by then because of present EC policies. We now have 140,000 full time and 40,000 part-time farmers.  There will be a massive exodus of farmers from the land because of EC policies and because of the failure of the Government to make a special case for Irish farmers.  Our agriculture is 50 years behind England.  There is a special case to be made for us in Europe, we do not owe any apologies to the people of Europe and we should be there arguing our case for agriculture <Col N="2913" /> openly and ably.  It is very evident from Government policy that they want to relegate Irish farmers to the status of Red Indians.  We on this side will not stand idly by and let that happen.</P>
    <P>The Government told us that farmers with 80 or more adjusted acres would have to pay land tax and that all farmers below that would be exempted.  In the budget, all farmers are still required to pay income tax.  I am convinced that in a general election the farmers of Ireland will not be conned as in the past.  We have had too many broken promises.  I am amazed that the Government saw fit in this most difficult year for farmers to introduce legislation to provide the funds for the setting up of this body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

      <P>The land tax legislation was brought forward because of pressure by the Labour Party.  That is plain to everybody.  Strangely, no Members of that party are here this evening.  The implementation of the land tax will continue to fail as it did this year mainly because of problems related to classification. There are problems because of the numbers to be classified and the time it will take to classify the entire country.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Carey said earlier, classification of land is badly needed.  If it is done properly it will benefit the country as a whole, but until classification has been completed it will not be practicable to bring in land tax.  When the appeals begin to come in it will be seen that there are many problems in regard to land tax.  We saw proof of this earlier this year when we were told that income tax for farmers would be done away with.  This has not happened.  I agree everyone should be taxed equitably but this land tax is a form of rates introduced by the back door.  On this side we do not intend to pursue that policy.  Ability to pay should be taken into account and it is clear from last year's accounts that returns were quite poor and they will continue to be so because many farmers are being put to the pin of their collars to continue in existence, not to talk about paying income tax or land tax. That is why I am strongly in favour of retaining the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="2914" /> The new system would suit milk farmers in particular because a farm of 80 adjusted acres can produce a high income for dairy farmers.  Substantial sums of tax will be lost to the Exchequer because of the exemption of milk farmers from the income tax system under the new system of land tax.  If figures are properly correlated it will be seen that the gains accruing from land tax would only be equal to those from the income tax which farmers were being caught for from 1983 onwards.  For about five years before 1983 there were large investments in cattle and buildings but the capital allowances for many farmers meant that the income tax payable by those farmers was quite low. However, the capital allowances that followed on that investment ran out in the majority of cases in the 1983-84 tax year and there was a substantial take by way of income tax on farmers from that year onwards.  The reason for introducing land tax was to hoodwink the public living in urban areas and those who were not involved in farming.  The Exchequer will lose out by the imposition of land tax.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that a sum of £4 million will be spent in 1986 in setting up this office.  If that money had been spent by the Revenue Commissioners in the employment of more field staff the return would be greater than what will be obtained from the land tax.  The Minister should re-examine the whole policy.  He should use his common sense, scrap what is proposed and go back to the fair system of taxing a person on his ability to pay.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the issue of adjusted acres.  The farmers whom I represent will not pay much tax in any event.  I wonder how many acres in my part of the country could be compared with one acre in County Meath?  The Minister represents that part of the country; he has land in County Meath and he is aware of the true facts.  If one leaves Sligo airport on a flight to Dublin one can see that vast difference in the land in County Meath as compared with that in Cavan, Sligo or Leitrim.  Perhaps the farm tax suits <Col N="2915" /> farmers in County Meath and in the southern part of the country but it does not suit farmers whom I represent in the west of Ireland.  I am deeply concerned about the whole matter of adjusted acres.  We are all aware that the accounts system was a more fair system.</P>
      <P>Inspectors employed by the Land Commission are now assessing farmers for tax.  The Land Commission did a good job but perhaps they had come to the end of the road.  I would not like to see people coming into this country and buying up large farms of land when our own people would have been entitled to that land if the Land Commission had divided up the estates.</P>

      <P>The people once employed in the Land Commission are now doing work in connection with farm taxation.  The Dixon estate in County Leitrim was taken over by a Fianna Fáil Government but when this Government abolished the Land Commission they gave the land back to the owner who happened to be a German.  This was done at a time when the small congested farmers in counties Leitrim and Sligo could have benefited by an increase in their holdings.  Unfortunately, now the farmers and their sons are emigrating from the west and are going to England and America because they have not enough land to work.  A motorist driving from Sligo to Dublin will meet a continuous convoy of lorries carrying hay for cattle in the west of Ireland.  Yet, the Government are taxing farmers in the west at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers in the western counties have been continually reclaiming land and now they will be liable for tax as a result of their hard work.  A careful examination should be carried out to see how many <Col N="2916" /> acres in the west of Ireland compare with one acre in County Meath, Limerick, or in any other county that has good land.</P>
    <P>A speaker on the Government side said earlier that if we had land tax the local authorities would have more money.  We know local authorities are starved of funds but that is not because the farmers are not taxed.  It is because they have not got funds from the Government. I must stress my concern regarding the matter of adjusted acres and the matter of how many acres in the west will be compared with one acre of good land in Meath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go back over the debate because it has been merely a rehash of the Second Stage debate on the Bill dealing with farm tax.  All the arguments put forward by the other side of the House were dealt with then and the House took a decision. If we are to have a re-run of that Bill every time the Estimates come before the House, we will not use our time in the best way.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies, in particular Deputy Noonan, for the very kind references they made to me personally which I appreciate.  While I did not agree with the points made by the other side of the House, at least they were made in an unemotional and responsible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer as quickly as possible to Deputy Noonan's points.  Under section 9 (4) of the Act the changes in the rate of tax will be directly related to changes in farm income.  Therefore there is no question of arbitrary increases, a fear expressed by the Deputy.  Section 11 (8) of the Act also empowers a local authority to suspend payment in the event of hardship.  The Deputy quoted figures contained in <i>Building On Reality</i> concerning the yield of the tax.  Those figures relate to the tax when fully in operation, not to this year.  As far as the actual cost relative to the revenue from the tax is concerned, this year the revenue will probably be about £6 million, which is about the same as the cost of the classification. Next year, however, the revenue will rise to about £14 million or possibly <Col N="2917" /> even £20 million, depending on how far we get with the valuation and whether we get down as far as 80 adjusted acres or 60 adjusted acres.  The latter is the desirable target.  In that event we will be getting a much larger yield than the cost of the valuation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred to the soil survey, as did Deputy O'Keeffe.  There were criticisms attributed to some unnamed person in the department of soil science in UCD.  It is important to recognise that this is not a soil survey solely. It is based on a list of considerations, one of which is soil quality, given in the Act. To criticise it as being unscientific, if that is the criticism, on the basis that it is not solely based on soil type would not be correct because the Act requires that a number of criteria should be weighed up and balanced against each other.  To some extent it has to be accepted that there will be an element of judgment involved. It is not simply a question of using some piece of soil chemistry equipment and coming to a decision.  A number of considerations must be weighed up.  There will ultimately be a judgment and if there is an appeal that judgment will fall to the tribunal to decide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Walsh asked if the farm tax credit could be carried forward into subsequent years.  That is really a matter for the Finance Bill but if that were done it would give rise to considerable complaints from business people paying rates. Not only are their rates not allowed as a credit, they are only allowed as expenses. They certainly cannot be carried forward as a credit into subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly asked about self assessment.  There are a number of serious objections to introducing self assessment.  I will give one of them for illustrative purposes.  Let us take the case of a farmer who quite honestly valued his land at 78 adjusted acres and that was accepted for, say, three years until they eventually got around to cross-checking these provisional evaluations.  If on the basis of the final assessment he was deemed to have 82 adjusted acres, which would not be a big difference, the farmer would find that not only would he have <Col N="2918" /> to pay land tax on an extra four acres but he would also have retrospective income tax liability because he would have been liable to income tax in the intervening period on the basis of the defined valuation. If he had not been keeping accounts, he could be in quite a difficult situation. That is one difficulty with self assessment. Another difficulty is that it would require substantial recasting of the legislation which is rather difficult to contemplate when we are already well advanced with the valuation of the land.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will be aware that one farming organisation are pressing rather hard for a system akin to self assessment or a form of provisional valuation to allow farmers to get into the farm tax and out of income tax earlier than would occur in the normal course of events.  I am interested in this, notwithstanding the difficulties I have identified, and I am hoping to have discussions with that organisation to see if they have any answers to offer to the problems which are raised with their proposal, in particular the problem I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>I was not listening as closely as I should at one point in Deputy O'Keeffe's speech.  He made some statement to the effect that the farm tax commissioner had said on radio that that the assessment of the land cost £100 million.  I am advised that the farm tax commissioner said no such thing.  The tape of the interview is available in my Department and has been listened to.  He did not say that.  It is appropriate since the statement was made that I should refer to it.</P>
    <P>A recurrent theme throughout the speeches on the other side of the House was that it is a waste of time to be valuing all this land.  A system of revaluation of land was necessary anyway once the decision had been taken by the Supreme Court which struck down the existing system of valuation, unless we were to abandon all prospect of ever having any system of tax on property.</P>

      <P>Nobody can be responsible for the inferences that Deputy Ned O'Keeffe picks up from anything he hears, no more than anyone else.  We will leave it at that.  The case is closed.  I would have thought that it would have been prudent anyway to do a revaluation of our land, given that the Supreme Court struck down the existing Griffith system. We must remember that land is valued for tax purposes and tax is applied to land in practically every country in Western Europe and in North America.  Practically all these countries have a system of land valuation and land taxation.  There is nothing strange, revolutionary or unusual about it.  Obviously it has to be based on the reasonably up-to-date and adjustable system of valuation.  The Griffith valuation which applied for the past century was struck down because it was not up-to-date and adjustable.  This new system of valuation will be up to date and adjustable and is therefore a necessary exercise to be conducted anyway.  Deputies on either side of the House can argue about what particular uses they are going to make of the valuation once it is done.  We believe it should be the basis for a modest farm tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Deputies might have some cases to make that one can use the valuation for some other taxation purpose.  But to my mind there is no doubt, given the financial problems that this country has and is likely to have for the next ten or 15 years, that any Government in office will want to have some basis upon which property can be taxed on a reasonable and accurate basis. I do not see anything strange about that. We have had taxes of that kind for the past 150 years.  They have been the basis of local government and the sooner we get back to a system similar to that which obtained prior to the start, by all parties on all sides of the House, of doing away with the very fundamental basis of local government which was rates, the better. We need to have some universal system which gives a basis for providing revenue on a regular basis to sustain local government as is the case in practically every other civilised country in western Europe and North America.  The valuation of our land is simply part of a contribution towards achieving that in the long term.</P>
      <P>That is a reasonable objective.  Nobody should object to our land being revalued on that basis.  If we are to have a situation where we have the Griffith valuation struck down and nothing in its place and no basis for assessing the value of land for any purpose, we will be living in a vacuum in our tax code and in assessing what our country is worth.  It should not be left there.  For that reason I think the conducting of a revaluation of our land, whether it is used for farm tax or some other type of taxation or some other purpose altogether, is a prudent and sensible and necessary thing, given the decision by the Supreme Court in the case brought there by the Wexford farmers.</P>

      <P>Considerable progress has been made by the local authorities in recent years in improving the arrangements for dealing with the discharge of sewage.  In 1985 the Greater Dublin drainage scheme, which cost in excess of £50 million, was commissioned. I recently approved Dublin Corporation's proposals to accept a tender in the sum of £5.459 million for the extension of the treatment facilities at Ringsend. These additional treatment facilities, when complete, will further improve the quality of the effluent being discharged into the bay.  In addition, my Department approved proposals for the Blackrock main drainage scheme (Stage II), on 19 June 1985, which will have the effect of linking up the Dún Laoghaire area sewerage system to the Ringsend treatment works.  Dún Laoghaire Corporation recently submitted further proposals to extend their original scheme to take in additional discharge.  These revised proposals are being urgently examined in my Department and I hope to give a decision on them shortly.  These schemes which together are estimated to cost over £14 million will result in further improvements in water quality.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the warranted wholesale price adjustments for premium petrol, regular petrol and autodiesel in each of the months January 1986, February 1986 and March 1986; if he will comment on the extent to which these were implemented; and if he will arrange that these be published monthly for consumer information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I presume that the reference in the question to &ldquo;the warranted wholesale price&rdquo; is to the wholesale price as formerly determined by the National Prices Commission.  The relevant wholesale prices for January 1986, as determined by the Commission on 3 January, were as follows:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Change from December</P>
      <P>Premium Petrol £2.65 per gallon (58.25 per litre) &mdash; 4.8p. per gallon (1.5p per litre)</P>
      <P>Regular Petrol £2.60 per gallon (57.16p per litre) &mdash; 4.0p. per gallon (0.9p per litre)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Autodiesel £2.40 per gallon (52.77p <Col N="2708" /> per litre) &mdash; 7.8 per gallon (1.72p per litre)</P>
    <P>These prices were the subject of an adjustment, arising from a change in the rate of excise duties, on 8 January, 1986. The revised wholesale prices were as follows:</P>
    <P>Premium Petrol £2.69 per gallon (59.16. per litre)</P>
    <P>Regular Petrol £2.64 per gallon (58.07p. per litre)</P>
    <P>Autodiesel £2.48 per gallon (54.48p. per litre)</P>
    <P>The arrangements relating to the determination of wholesale prices for petrol and autodiesel ceased on 17 January 1986 as part of the new measures relating to competition, prices and consumer protection which were announced by the Government on that day. Accordingly, it is not possible to provide information relating to these prices, including their implementation and publication, for the period subsequent to 17 January 1986.</P>
    <P>The question of whether any special measures relating to the provision of price information on motor fuels to consumers may be necessary or desirable is under consideration by me at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement on the concern expressed by the National Prices Commission at the significant increase in the number of outlets selling petrol at prices above the formula price in their November retail survey; and in particular, whether he will (i) publish the formula retail price as a guide to consumers; and (ii) introduce a retail prices display order enforcing the display of price in a prominent place in the station forecourts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware of the concern expressed by the National Prices Commission on this matter in their report for the period November 1985 to <Col N="2709" /> January 1986.  Further survey work carried out more recently has indicated that a significant number of retailers are charging much higher prices than the prices recommended by the oil companies. I am proposing to meet with the relevant trade representative bodies to pursue the matter further.</P>
      <P>The arrangements relating to the calculation of the &ldquo;formula price&rdquo; ceased on 17 January 1986 as part of the new measures relating to competition, prices and consumer protection which were announced by the Government on that day.  Accordingly, it is not possible to publish information relating to that price.</P>
      <P>In view of the current difficulties regarding retail prices, I am considering at present whether further action to stimulate consumer awareness of retail price variations is necessary or desirable.</P>

In addition, many projects form part of continuing works programmes.  They may not, therefore, be relatable to particular years or locations, but may be spread over several years and over different parts of the relevant local authority's area.  Other projects may be carried out under devolution arrangements in force from time to time and applicable to certain types or sizes of projects; in many such cases particulars of the actual projects undertaken would not be known to the Department.

      <P>In so far as the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department is concerned, expenditure on capital projects relates almost entirely to the overall State afforestation programme and, more specifically, to the land acquisition and forest development/management sectors.  Records of such expenditure are not available, on a county basis.</P>
      <P>So far as fisheries is concerned during the years 1981 to 1985 inclusive capital expenditure of £1,070,620 was incurred on the development of the fishery harbour centre at Castletownbere, Co. Cork.  In addition a further amount of £194,773 was spent on capital development of the following fishing harbours in County Cork during those years.</P>

      <P>It is not possible at this stage to say whether the grants payable at present under the forestry element of the western package will continue to be available after the expiration of the relevant EC Regulation in 1990.</P>
      <P>While I would hope that the scheme can be extended beyond that date, the Deputy will appreciate that such a decision will depend on a number of factors including the decision in due course of the EC Council of Ministers, which I cannot anticipate at this stage, and of course the availability of the necessary funds to finance it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is continually being approached for information on setting up private nurseries.  While anxious to promote initiative it is considered prudent not to over encourage these applicants <Col N="2731" /> because of the danger of generating an oversupply of plants.</P>
    <P>Forest plant production is rapidly becoming more sophisticated with the impact of modern technology.  One very large new operation in the private sector with an estimated annual production of six million plants has recently been established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the taxpayer's total income for 1985-86 consisted of a retirement pension from his former employer and a social welfare invalidity pension, both of which are chargeable to tax.  As the aggregate of these pensions did not greatly exceed the general exemption limit for 1985-86, the taxpayer was entitled to a measure of marginal relief in calculating his tax free allowances for that year.  Marginal relief is a device to bring taxpayers <Col N="2738" /> at the lowest income levels from exemption to full liability on a phased basis and, accordingly, the allowance for marginal relief in general diminishes and eventually ceases as income increases.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information available the taxpayer's total income for 1986-87 will exceed the 1985-86 figure. The general tax exemption limit for the current year is unchanged.  This is reflected in the lower figure for marginal relief in his tax free allowances for the current year.  As a consequence the aggregate of the taxpayer's tax free allowances for 1986-87 is less than the 1985-86 figure.  The inspector will communicate directly with the taxpayer on the question of reviewing his tax liability for 1985-86.</P>

      <P>The taxpayer's liability for 1984-85 has been reviewed and a cheque in settlement of the refund due for that year was issued to him on 29 April 1986.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer completed a return of income for 1985-86 on 3 October 1985.  On the basis of that return, a duplicate tax free allowance certificate for that year was issued to her. It provided for the same allowances as were shown on an earlier certificate which had been issued to her in March 1985.</P>
      <P>The correct amount of tax for 1985-86 was deducted from the taxpayer's earnings by reference to her tax free allowances. The position has already been explained in writing to the Deputy and to the taxpayer by the inspector.  The taxpayer has been asked to submit a form P60 for 1985-86 and when this has been received a review of her liability for that year will be undertaken.  The taxpayer has not submitted a claim for an earlier year.</P>

The person concerned did not satisfy this condition and claimed unemployment assistance on 12 February 1986.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for unemployment benefit a claimant engaged in a subsidiary occupation must satisfy a special condition which requires the claimant to have at least 78 reckonable employment contributions in the three years preceding the date of claim or alternatively the remuneration or profit from the subsidiary occupation must not exceed £2 a day.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is a landholder who did not satisfy this special condition and, accordingly, his claim for unemployment benefit was disallowed from 25 November 1985.  He appealed against this decision and an oral hearing of his case is being arranged.  He then applied for unemployment assistance and following investigation of his means he was assessed with means of £72.15 weekly derived from profit from his holding and from capital.</P>
      <P>He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of 10p being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £72.25 less means of £72.15.  Arrears due from November 1985 were paid to him.  He recently advised his local office that he did not wish to receive the weekly rate of 10p.  It is open to him to appeal against the means assessment. A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local employment office.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 121, 123 and 125 together.  Any evaluation of the bovine TB eradication programme for 1986 must have regard to the exceptional level of testing carried out in the 1985-86 round just ended, the <Col N="2755" /> selective nature of the 1986 programme which will concentrate to a large extent on the areas at greatest risk and the full follow-up service which will be available from my Department in all cases of disease outbreak.</P>
      <P>The level of testing carried out during the round just ended is well in excess of the equivalent of a full round and in Counties Louth and Limerick testing activity was intense.  Unavoidable budgetary constraints have necessitated a more selective approach to testing during the remainder of this year and available resources have been allocated to counties on the basis of their respective disease situations.  This approach is designed to make the optimum impact on disease having regard to the varying needs of the counties.  The question of the resources which can be made available for the eradication programme is being kept under continuous review.</P>

Since mid-December 1985, advance payments of 30 per cent of the ewe premium amounting to £4.90 per ewe and totalling £7.2 million have been made to 23,600 sheep owners in the disadvantaged areas.

      <P>The sheep inspection period for a number of years now has run from March until June each year to the general satisfaction of the flockowners concerned.  Furthermore, a ewe breeding for the first time has to be seen to be in lamb or to have lambed to be eligible for ewe premium, and the March-June period was deemed to be the best period for checking this.</P>
      <P>If inspections were carried out during the period suggested by the Deputy, however, it would be impossible to verify whether or not most such ewes are in lamb, and premium would be lost on these ewes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.  The EC Regulations governing the ewe premium scheme require flockowners to keep their eligible ewes for 100 days from the last day of the period for accepting applications.  In Ireland the last day for accepting applications was 14 March 1986.  An examination of the latest dipping certificates would show numbers dipped between 15 September 1985 and 31 January 1986 and could not be used to confirm the number of eligible ewes kept for the 100 days period between mid-March and end June 1986.  Instead, my Department rely on actual flock inspections by their technical staff.  These are in progress at present and I am making arrangements to expedite the premium payments, starting next month, as inspections are completed.</P>

      <P>A number of measures have already operated to assist farmers who suffered losses due to inclement weather and shortage of winter feed.  The winter fodder scheme last autumn consisted of fertiliser and silage subsidies.  The Shannon valley scheme provided relief measures for farmers affected by flooding in the catchment area of the Shannon.  The feed voucher scheme gave further assistance, and recently it was decided to make advance payment of beef cow grants as an additional measure to help farmers with fodder supply problems.  These various measures, together with the transport of hay from the east to western areas by the Army, gave a wide range of assistance to farmers in the west of Ireland to deal with the feed situation.</P>

    <P>A financial allocation of £1,323,582 was notified to the town of Drogheda Vocational Education Committee.  The total financial allocation in 1985 was £1,637,733.  The present partial 1986 allocation represents a 20 per cent decrease on the 1985 total allocation.  However, the 1986 allocation as now notified <Col N="2774" /> to the VEC does not include the following:</P>
    <P>(a) Separate budget in respect of adult education;</P>
    <P>(b) Provision, as appropriate, for the cost of new teachers as from 1 September 1986;</P>
    <P>(c) Cost of the vocational preparation and training programme for the period September-December 1986 and</P>

      <P>Of the ten projects mentioned in the details provided with the Deputy's Question, nine concern national schools and one concerns a telephone exchange, which is not my Department's responsibility.</P>
      <P>The contracts in six of the school cases are between the building contractor in question and the chairpersons of the schools boards of management.  In one of these cases a substantial grant payment was made recently to the chairperson and a balance of grant is being retained until the normal inspections have been carried out and all works are found to be satisfactory. In two others it is expected that substantial grant payments will be made shortly to the chairpersons.  In the case of one of these two a balance of grant is being retained pending receipt of a final account or a draft final account.  Final accounts are awaited in the case of two chairpersons contracts and the question of grant payments will be examined promptly when they are received.  In the case of the remaining chairperson's contract, a small balance of grant is being retained pending the making good of certain defects in the mechanical and electrical installations.</P>
      <P>The three remaining schools contracts are between the contractor and my Department.  In one of these cases it is expected that a substantial payment will be made in about ten days time.  The balance of the amount claimed by the contractor in this case will be paid when a number of defects have been made good and examination of the mechanical and electrical final accounts has been completed.  In another of these cases the final account is being examined with a view to the payment of the balance due at an early date.  In the remaining case, an amount is being sought by the contractors which my Department considers is not payable, and it is proposed to contract the contractor at an early date about the matter.</P>
