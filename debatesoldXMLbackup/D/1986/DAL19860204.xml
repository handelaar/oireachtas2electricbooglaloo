    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the plans he has to bring art closer to the community and, in particular, to young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arts Council, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, who are an independent statutory organisation, operate under the aegis of my Department.  The council are committed to a policy of developing arts centres in significant locations of population so as to provide local communities with access to the professional arts and with the opportunity of participating in the community activities of these arts centres. There are major arts centres in Wexford, Waterford, Cork and Limerick as well as performance venues in Sligo, Tralee, Galway and Cork.  These are in addition to the arts centres existing in Dublin and those which are planned for a number of locations around the country, including the midlands, and for a number of the <Col N="1368" /> satellite towns which have grown up in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>In the course of his Budget Statement delivered to the House on 29 January 1986 the Minister for Finance announced that he would provide a special grant of £100,000 to the Arts Council to enable them to match the very generous assistance of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation to the Arts Community Education Project (ACE).  The aim of that project is to foster the experience of the arts as part of everyday life at work, in school or on the street.</P>
      <P>The National Gallery of Ireland, which also operates under the aegis of my Department, has imaginative and wideranging activities to bring art closer to the community and, in particular, to young people.  Those activities include special exhibitions, publications, educational tours of the gallery, seminars, in-service courses for primary teachers, poster competitions for children and travelling exhibitions.</P>
      <P>Under the social employment and teamwork schemes, which operate under the Department of Labour, projects to promote cultural pursuits have to date been allocated grant-aid in excess of £1 million.  Work undertaken in that context covers a wide range of projects from the employment of unemployed musicians to form an orchestra performing for the general public and theatrical productions to the provision of a workshop for promising young writers and the establishment of social and cultural centres geared towards young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's detailed reply, do his Department see themselves as a major catalyst in the area of encouraging arts in the community, particularly among young people and would he see an outlet through, perhaps, summer projects which would make art in the community among young people a possible replacement for violence which is being used as an outlet by some young people, particularly in deprived areas and those of high unemployment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a central ambition of mine, and one of my aims in the area of visual arts, music, theatre and literature, to ensure that all members of the community &mdash; indeed all artists also &mdash; irrespective of their geographical location and social status &mdash; have access to the arts.  I have given a number of examples of how this is being brought about.  As far as young people are concerned, there are also a number of umbrella organisations such as the National Association of Youth Drama, the Irish Youth Orchestra, the Irish Youth Jazz Orchestra and a number of others.  The whole intention is to develop the interest and ability of young people in these areas.  We are also very pleased with the discussion paper arising from the working party of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.</P>

      <P>Is the Vote for the Minister's Department with regard to the Arts Council up or down on last year?  If so, by how much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and my Department two weeks ago.  The Vote for the Arts Council is marginally up &mdash; 4 per cent &mdash; on last year, and 1 per cent on the outturn of last year, but it will be affected by the various changes made in the Vote for remuneration.  It has kept pace with inflation, but no more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister examine the possibility, particularly in Dublin, of involving the summer projects, particularly in the areas of high unemployment, with regard to art in the community, so that this might become a replacement for some violence resulting from problems among young people in these areas?  Would he specifically see if he can use the summer projects to this end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a look at it.  I wish to pay tribute to the Department of <Col N="1370" /> Labour for their Teamwork and the social employment schemes under which £1 million was made available last year for a whole variety of projects throughout the community.</P>

      <P>What portion of the Art Council's funding is used for community art?  Has that been increased in the current year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a breakdown of the figures, but a substantial sum was made available from the Funds of Suitors, particularly for art centres.  I will be looking for a substantial allocation of the funds from the National Lottery for the arts.  Among the items I have in mind for submission to the Government are the provision of art centres and bringing access to the arts to all members of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the original cover for the recent annual report of the Arts Council was withdrawn and replaced by a new one; if this was done at the request of the Taoiseach's Department or any official of his Department; the cost of replacing the original cover; the reasons for it being replaced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft Annual Report and Accounts of An Chomhairle Ealaíon for the year 1984 was recently submitted to Government for presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The proposed cover of the document was a collage of newspaper cuttings criticising Government funding of the arts without including mention of any of the positive developments which the Government have initiated to the benefit of the arts.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach conveyed his view regarding this imbalance personally to the chairman of the council, and the council decided to use a cover reproducing the work of an Irish artist.  The cost of replacing the original cover was £1,205.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1371" />
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that it is appropriate, particularly in relation to art, that the big stick should have been used in this way to impose the Government's views on the Arts Council? Could the cost involved in replacing this cover have been better used in the community arts projects area which is grossly under funded at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach advised the Chairman of the Arts Council of his views about a matter relating to his Department, as he was perfectly entitled to do.  It was then a matter for the council, and they decided they would change the cover to bring it more into line with the general practice of previous years, of using the work of an Irish painter on the cover.  The original cover had a serious imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister make copies of the original available to Deputies?  I understand they are becoming collectors' items and the art world in general is searching frantically for copies of the original portrait.  Would the Minister acknowledge that this action by the Taoiseach and the Government is censorship in its worst and most blatant form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A petty little act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that it is censorship.  The Taoiseach advised the Chairman of the Arts Council of his views on a matter within the aegis of his Department.  He gave his views on a matter about the cover, not on the contents of the annual report.  I am aware the original cover is a collectors' item and I am pleased at the fact that it is, and that the media has not succeeded in getting hold of it so far despite frantic efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not an attempt to interfere with a statutory independent body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that, if the only matter referred by the Taoiseach to the chairman was the draft copy, the <Col N="1372" /> members of the Arts Council received copies of the report with the offending cover and that they were instructed to return those forthwith &mdash; they had new copies issued to them some weeks later? That does not seem to tally with the Minister's statement that only a draft copy had been made available to the Taoiseach's Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arts Council members were the first to receive a copy of the report.  The report was submitted in the ordinary way before being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Until such time as the report has passed through the Government, in my opinion it is a draft copy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not simply because the Arts Council wished to criticise the niggardly attitude of the Government in allocations to them that this cover of their annual report was so designed?  Is it not a clear instance of stifling criticism of a State body?  Can the Minister give us some indication of what sort of cover the Government would accept?  Would a blank cover be preferable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not mind having my picture on it.  I do not think there is anyone in the House whose picture could more appropriately be put on the cover of the Arts Council report than mine. Does the Minister give some guidelines to the artist who is designing the cover? Is there any political input into the guidelines given to the artist who is designing a cover so that it would be acceptable to the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the usual practice of <Col N="1373" /> the Arts Council to use a painting by a contemporary Irish painter.  They have done that on this occasion and have presented a very attractive cover which, no doubt, Deputies will have seen.  I do not accept the suggestion about censorship. There was a serious imbalance in the cover which was not even in conformity with the chairman's speech inside.  In the circumstances the Taoiseach gave advice or his opinion to the chairman and the council changed the cover.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As statistics are compiled on a regional basis it is not possible to provide figures for individual countries.  The Dublin city and county areas are included in the east region of the National Manpower Service which also includes Counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  In that region there are currently 1,069 persons employed in 437 projects under the social employment scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister make a statement on the negotiations between his Department, through the National Manpower Service, and Dublin Corporation in regard to the fact that <Col N="1374" /> nobody in Dublin city is involved in the social employment scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Chair has no control over the questions but nobody is employed on the social employment scheme through Dublin Corporation. The Minister failed to convince the trade union movement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>Could I ask a supplementary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I declined to answer the question because the responsibility to employ people in the social employment scheme in any local authority is primarily that of the local authority.  If the Deputy wishes to have this matter fully debated in the House I am prepared to facilitate him, but since my interests are more concerned with ensuring that people become employed under the scheme, such a debate might not necessarily be constructive. If the Deputy wishes to explain why the largest authority have failed so far to employ people I would be glad to hear him.  This authority are controlled by the party of which the Deputy is a member <Col N="1375" /> and the Deputy is the Fianna Fáil leader on that authority.  It would not be constructive to have a debate here on this at the moment and that is why I am declining to answer the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite extraordinary <Col N="1376" /> that Deputy Ahern had to come to this House to ask a statistical question of a general nature when he is in a position to ask the officials of the local authority who would be the legal employers the precise position between them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that married men will suffer a financial loss if employed on the social employment scheme; if he has any plans to amend the regulations to <Col N="1377" /> rectify this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>, the social employment scheme is aimed at the large number of productive and energetic persons who have been unemployed for an extended period.</P>
      <P>Due to the present constraints on public finances it is essential that that scheme be as far as possible self-financing and this was a prime consideration when setting the wage of participants at £70 for an average 2½ day week.  For comparison purposes, the maximum rate of unemployment assistance at present for a married person with no child dependants is £60.15 per week.</P>
      <P>It is a feature of the scheme, of course, that participants are allowed to undertake other work during the periods in which they are not engaged on the scheme.  Statistics recently compiled by my Department show that approximately 26 per cent of SES participants are married and more than half of these have child dependants.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing the scheme including the wage rates of married persons.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of another area of financial loss for people participating in the social employment scheme, the loss of the right to go to the community welfare service for assistance to pay bills and that at least one health authority refuse to allow them to keep their medical cards?  What action is being taken in these two areas?</P>

      <P>In the review of the social employment scheme will the Minister consider the position of people who are on benefit as well?  I know of a case where a person has been unemployed for two years but is still in benefit because he spent a year on a horticulture course. Perhaps such cases could be taken into consideration.  This person was offered a job under the social employment scheme and could not take up this employment because he was not eligible.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister in a position to give us an estimate of the figure for this year?  Will he tell the House how it compares with the 1985 figure? Will the cutbacks in his Department announced in last week's budget have any impact on the numbers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give a detailed reply to the Deputy to that question because, as he is aware, changes were made in some of the Estimates, including that of the Department of Labour, within the context of the budget.  AnCO are currently reassessing their position.  I will have the information available within a matter of weeks and I will then be in a position to give the detailed estimates the Deputy has requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the difficulties the Minister may encounter because of the cutbacks announced by the Minister for Finance last week but surely he is in a position to say whether he expects that there will be more or less than the 1985 figure in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there will be more in 1986 but, as the Deputy, a former Minister for Labour, will readily realise, the critical point in all of this is the <Col N="1380" /> number of man years as distinct from the number of participants in individual courses.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The scheme proper did not get off the ground until May. We have had delays in the take up in a number of areas.  In fact, my Department <Col N="1381" /> have approved more than the 10,000 places provided for in this scheme. Tragically in some areas the call down on vacancies has been less than expected.  In some cases, such as the Deputy's local authority area, tragically for the thousands of young people who are unemployed in Dublin city, the local authority have been unable to promote such schemes. The monitoring group have approved more than 10,000 places, including the 6,156 persons to date.  Some local authorities and agencies have not yet drawn down the full allocation of places for which they applied and for which approval was granted.  I am optimistic that we will reach the target of 10,000 in the middle of this year.  I regret it has not proved possible to meet the target faster, despite the fact that the money and approvals have been made available by the Department of Labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the reason the target has not been reached is related to some of the anomalies raised under Question No. 6, the fact that there is a financial loss to married men and a danger that people cannot go to community welfare officers?  Will the Minister accept that another reason is that there seems to be a difference from one Manpower agency to another as to what jobs are eligible under the social employment scheme?  Will the Minister arrange to have that anomaly clarified so that all Manpower agencies will give the same replies as to the jobs that are available under the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme makes provision for 10,000 places in any one year during the three year period of the plan. At least four times that number of people are eligible and receiving less money from the social welfare system than the 10,000 places we made provision for.  When we <Col N="1382" /> constructed the scheme we were not of the opinion that there would be a shortage of numbers.  I do not accept the point Deputy Owen is making.  I am not aware of any discrepancies between different Manpower offices.  They have received co-ordinated information from my Department through the director of the National Manpower Service.  However, if the Deputy has experience of contrary advice I will be happy to have the matter corrected.</P>

      <P>In 1985, 4,500 young people were catered for on programmes and schemes directly funded or administered by the Youth Employment Agency.  In 1985, other programmes funded by the youth employment levy catered for 61,500 young people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply will be similar to the one I gave to the Deputy in regard to the AnCO estimates, for the same reasons.  I had a meeting this morning with the chief executive of the Youth Employment Agency and he informed me that they are assessing their position in the light of changes made in the Estimates. I hope to be in a position to have the detailed projections which the Deputy is seeking within a matter of weeks.  If the Deputy tables a question I will make that information available to him.  Without prejudice to the final decision made by the YEA, I should like to <Col N="1383" /> tell the House that I will be hoping for the same kind of output that was achieved last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not much joy to the thousands of young unemployed people.  The schemes will never be a substitute for employment but, on the other hand, they help young people temporarily.  Will the Minister agree that at a time of high unemployment and when we are almost six weeks into the new year it is rather late in the day, despite all the promises of planning and programming made by the Taoiseach, to be programming the number of participants for courses in 1986?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not.  The Deputy has intimate knowledge of how those agencies work.  He is aware that they have already prepared substantial plans in regard to those programmes.  What is at issue is the impact of the changes brought about in the Estimate.  I have told the Deputy that I do not have the detailed estimate of the projections for 1986 in the light of the changes announced last week and the Deputy should accept that. However, I hope to have that information available within a matter of weeks when I will be able to convey it to him. All the Manpower and training agencies of the Department of Labour are proceeding with programmes.  If the Deputy is trying to convey to the House that things have been brought to a standstill because of changes in the Estimate, it is an erroneous impression which I should like to correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not bringing changes that might be taking place to the notice of the House but the Minister for Finance appeared to bring this to the notice of the House last Wednesday when he announced that he was cutting back the amount of money available to the Department of Labour for areas such as those about which we are talking here. This is very disappointing and the Minister for Finance should be answering this question.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not have thought it desirable to switch money from the programmes for those under 25 to those over 25 in his allocations for this year on the basis that the unemployment levels have clearly shown that there is a big switch in the emphasis to people aged 27, 28 and 29?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that there are many ways in which we can approach the horrendous problem of unemployment.  I have available to me, in the Department of Labour and in the various agencies handling the manpower section, many expert people.  It was on the balance of their advice and within the financial constraints which confront our society that we finally came down in favour of this particular allocation of funding, for which I accept total and exclusive responsibility.  It is my considered political judgment that this is the best way, in 1986, to allocate scarce resources to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister took expert advice, but there is still a great imbalance in the facilities, services, courses and retraining programmes available for those over 25 years of age. While not wanting to jeopardise the opportunities available to those under 25 years, the unemployment figures have shown a clear switch in the period from 1977-1980 to 1985-86.  I think many decisions made on these figures were based on the result of programmes starting in 1977-80.  If the Minister tells me all these figures have been assessed, I have to believe him because I have no way of checking them at the moment.  However, in my view it appears that money could provide courses for people over 25 years of age.  From the figures given here today it does not appear that this is being even considered.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked a comprehensive question and I have given him a comprehensive reply.  I agree with the Deputy; and, if we were in a position to allocate more funds to courses for people over 25 years of age, we would like to do so.  That view is held not just by myself but by other Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs in the European Community. As the House is aware, many of the programmes we run in this area attract more than matching funding from the European Social Fund and we have attempted to maximise Ireland's drawdown from that fund.  There has been a shift within the Community in terms of the profile of those who are unemployed towards people over the age of 25 years. Part of the answer to the Deputy's legitimate question will be found more effectively within the framework of the changed rules for the European Social Fund.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department estimate that in 1985, 437,000 days were lost through industrial disputes.  Of the days lost 394,000 (90 per cent) were due to official industrial action and 43,000 (10 per cent) were due to <Col N="1390" /> action classified as unofficial.  Of the 437,000, 297,000 days (68 per cent) were lost in the public sector and 140,000 (32 per cent) in the private sector.</P>

Would he agree that part of the problem in relation to the operation of the Labour Court may be due to the fact that the conciliation service is not as strong as it used to be in resolving disputes before they actually get to the Labour Court and therefore a confrontation?</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to pay public tribute to the extraordinary work that has been done by the Labour Court and by the conciliation service in particular.  If one excludes the stoppage which arose from the public service and teachers' national and regional disputes, one will see that there has been an enormous decrease in the figures for last year compared with the year before.  That does not come about by accident.  One of the contributory factors to the reduced number of disputes and man-days lost was undoubtedly the work of the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>As regards providing additional resources to the conciliation service, I have proposals which are at present before the social partners involving restructuring the structures which govern industrial relations &mdash; arbitration, conciliation and adjudication.  It is within that framework that we can strengthen what is clearly a very positive arm of the Labour Court.</P>

I expressed my concern that the Act had only a limited impact beyond the notification requirements and <Col N="1392" /> the delay in implementing collective dismissals. I am convinced that there is scope for encouraging consultations which would enable trade unions to put forward opinions as to ways and means of avoiding or reducing the proposed redundancies.</P>

There was no notification that this would happen.

I do not have with me the precise details in relation to the case but I am aware of it and of other cases.

      <P>The proposals on industrial relations reform which were published last March provided for the establishment of a new Labour Relations Commission.  Since then, this proposal has been the subject of discussion with Congress and the FUE.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to its general role in the <Col N="1394" /> promotion of good industrial relations, the proposed commission would have responsibility for the following: a conciliation service; an advisory service; the equality officer service as an independent unit of the commission; the rights commissioner service as an independent unit of the commission; a research function; an industrial relations review and monitoring function and a role in the preparation and operation of codes of practice.</P>

Is he prepared to extend the Labour Court to take in sections of the Civil Service and the public sector who are at present covered by arbitration if they so wish?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish the Deputy to convey an erroneous impression to this House.  The Government are fully in accord with the provisions of all conciliation and arbitration agreements and with the provisions of those agreements. Should we finally come to this House &mdash; as we may on Thursday &mdash; to debate a motion in relation to a particular award, we will still be fully in accord with the provisions of C and A agreements because access to this House is an integral part of those provisions.  We have never so far been and do not propose to be out of line with the provisions of the C and A schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fully in accord with the provisions of the schemes, as is the right in free collective bargaining for either party.  With regard to the second <Col N="1397" /> part of the Deputy's question, the C and A schemes of which there are a number arose when many public servants were not able to have access to the Labour Court.  The time may now have come when the unions and the Minister responsible may wish to consider whether access to the Labour Court or a section of the court might be preferable to the re-establishment of the C and A schemes.  In the first instance that is a matter for them to discuss and to decide.  It might be prejudicial if I offered an opinion in advance of either side coming to their own conclusions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it might be better for industrial relations if the Government were not in the front line as they have been for the past five or six months in negotiations and if the cases could be argued out in the Labour Court with professional people? The Government would still have the right to decide with regard to Labour Court decisions but it would be far better than the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much merit in what the Deputy has said.  The Government will always be in the front line of industrial relations because they are the single largest employer.  Some people confuse the role of employer with that of an adjudicator and arbitrator.  With regard to the latter role, in my view there is considerable merit in that but it must be accepted by the participants if we are to maintain the principle of free collective bargaining, to which I am committed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report on &ldquo;Manpower Policy in Ireland&rdquo; published <Col N="1398" /> by the National Economic and Social Council.  The report contains the most comprehensive and detailed analysis of existing policy undertaken to date and is a major contribution to the general discussion at present taking place on this subject.</P>
      <P>The proposals and recommendations of the report are being examined in the context of the White Paper on Manpower Policy which will form the Government's response to the report.  The White Paper is at present being considered by the Government and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on any specific aspect of the NESC report at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are conflicting views in the report on the question of the establishment of a single manpower agency in as much as the consultants recommended such an approach whereas the council of NESC considered that the adoption of such a radical restructuring proposal was not the most appropriate strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will forgive me for being totally cynical as to the emergence of any White Paper on manpower policy.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole matter is very frustrating.  The last White Paper in this area was published in 1985.  It is difficult to persuade the Minister to talk about this matter at all and I have an opportunity every six weeks only to try <Col N="1399" /> to pressure him into taking some action. Will the Minister confirm that the White Paper will be published?  In May last, without a division, the House agreed on the formation of a manpower authority. As almost 21 years have elapsed since we had the last White Paper on manpower &mdash; that was introduced by the late Mr. Seán Lemass &mdash; the Minister may well go down in history in terms of bringing in the next one.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us now that the NESC report is being taken into account in the context of the White Paper.  On a previous occasion he told us that the White Paper would be drafted following the Dáil debate.  Will it be the case that, if some other group publish another document in this area, we will have to await a study of that before legislation is introduced?  Is the Minister serious in regard to rectifying the total mess that is the manpower service?  Is he serious about tackling the abuses, the ambiguities and the anomalies in the whole system?  The area is complicated but there has been a considerable amount of time in which the Minister could have brought forward the White Paper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that we had a very constructive debate on this matter in the House when the Government accepted the motion put forward by the Opposition.  It was agreed then that it would be preferable to have a consensus in relation to an analysis agreed on by all sides.  We were both <Col N="1400" /> aware then that the NESC were completing their study.  They had hoped to publish their report in October last but for a variety of reasons, some of which we can all understand, there has been a delay in that regard.  I can only repeat that it is my clear intention to produce a White Paper.  I regret that its production has been delayed longer than I would have hoped, but the document will have the benefit of brevity, a feature which the Deputy urged on us.  That brevity will be made all the more possible because of the publication, in advance of the White Paper, of the NESC report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour his policy in the area of job creation over the next 12 months; and the plans, if any, he has to reverse the present levels of unemployment either directly or indirectly to give hope to thousands of Irish workers for employment opportunities in Ireland, without emigrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policies and objectives in relation to job creation are set out in the plan, <i>Building on Reality, 1985-87</i> and in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  The plan sets out the objectives and general economic framework while the White Paper on Industrial Policy sets out the broad industrial strategy. These policies are subject to ongoing evaluation review and, where considered appropriate, have been supplemented by the introduction of new measures as announced in the budget and in the Taoiseach's statement to this House on 23 October 1985.</P>
      <P>The Government's policies are designed to generate as many jobs as possible by stimulating activity in the manufacturing, construction, tourism and services sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Manpower policy, for which I have responsibility, is primarily intended to support and facilitate mainstream job creation measures by improving the technical competence and occupational mobility of the labour force through <Col N="1401" /> training and similar programmes.  It contributes also to employment policy through the adoption of special interventions aimed at alleviating unemployment in the case of particularly vulnerable groups such as the long term unemployed, the educationally and socially deprived young people and the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>Particular emphasis is placed on schemes which create permanent employment.  These schemes include the employment incentive scheme, the enterprise allowance scheme, the youth self employment programme and the community enterprise programme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the job creation schemes, other measures such as temporary employment schemes, work experience programmes and occupational training will continue to be a priority consideration.  Many of these programmes and schemes are aimed at specific groups who have been hard hit by the recession with the express objective of affording them better access to the employment opportunities available. These schemes include the social employment scheme, the alternance scheme, the work experience programme, community workshops and the skills foundation programme.</P>
    <P>The cumulative effect of all these employment and training programmes will be 45,000 man years.  Other possible initiatives to assist the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed, are being considered in the context of the White Paper on Manpower Policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers are becoming longer.  I would not object to the same extension being applied in the case of the questions.  I asked what proposals the Government have for job creation in 1986 and the Minister replied by listing the various schemes.  In other words, whatever we had in 1985 is what we will have in 1986.  Despite the fact that the figures in <i>Building on Reality</i> in respect of unemployment are now 30,000 more than the Government were allowing for in their plan, the Minister has not put <Col N="1402" /> forward proposals, constructive or otherwise, to deal with this problem or to create jobs.  Despite also the statements from the Minister for the Environment and from the Taoiseach in October, no legislation has come before us yet with regard to proposals for investment in the areas outlined by the Taoiseach.  Some of those who were interested in the emergence of such proposals have left the country, taking their business with them.  The fact remains that the Government have no plans for job creation in 1986.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, do you propose to make a statement to the House regarding the termination of a live Radio 1 broadcast of the Budget Day statements on Wednesday last, 29 January, at approximately 8 p.m. which was in direct conflict with an order of this House made on Tuesday, 28 January 1986, Item No. 4?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Leyden raised this matter with me on Thursday last.  On that occasion I told him I would have inquiries made and come back to him.  Lest there be any doubt about it, by &ldquo;inquiries&rdquo; I meant only that I would consult my staff.  I did so, I came back to Deputy Leyden during the afternoon and explained the position to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that it may go on the record of the House &mdash; and I regret to say I <Col N="1497" /> cannot have a discussion on it &mdash; I want to read the following short statement:</P>
    <P>Between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday last my officials drew the attention of the RTE technical personnel in charge of the broadcast to the fact that the order of the Dáil of the previous day provided only for the broadcast of statements by the Minister for Finance and the statements of the Opposition spokesmen, and that the order did not authorise the broadcast of proceedings before the opening statement, between statements, or after the concluding statements.  In fact, I understand that the Chair's intervention before the Minister started his statement was not broadcast.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will refer to the order of the House any reasonable interpretation of it is as it is there.  If in relation to any future broadcast or broadcasts &mdash; Deputy Leyden also raised this with me &mdash; Deputies want to have it more flexible or to cover time instead of persons, then that can be made perfectly clear in the order of the House, as on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, first you are confirming that RTE themselves did not actually withdraw this live broadcast; that is what you are saying basically.  Second, in a sense they were anticipating your decision regarding the proposal put forward by a Member of this House that he had a particular right to speak.  So, in a sense, the officials, by terminating the broadcast, were actually anticipating a decision which you had not taken at that stage.  Those interventions should be in order because they were putting forward a case for their being included in the live broadcast.  It augurs very poorly for the proposed live broadcasting of this House that you, Sir, can now, or possibly will in the future, teminate particular broadcasts at particular times.  That is a dangerous form of censorship and is something about which I <Col N="1498" /> would be very concerned if the live broadcasting of the proceedings of this House proceeds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In concluding on Thursday last I was talking about the teachers' dispute.  Since the Government have since circulated an amendment which they propose to bring to the House on Thursday changing the conciliation and arbitration awards to teachers &mdash; this is based on various clauses, the details of which I will not go into &mdash; I would appeal at this late stage to the Minister for Education to call together the teachers' unions, the ASTI, the INTO and TUI leadership &mdash; what they call &ldquo;teachers united&rdquo;&mdash; to enter into discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister said he was prepared to allow back money to teachers who have retired or who are retiring and taking a lump sum so that they can all at once receive the 10 per cent.  The Government's proposal, which they will attempt to pass on Thursday evening &mdash; and which I am sure will be because of their majority &mdash; breaks the whole principle of conciliation and arbitration which has obtained in this country for 30 years and has led to the orderly behaviour and control of collective bargaining in the public sector over that period.  If that principle is broken, bearing in mind what the teachers' unions have already said, it will lead to disruption. We have heard already today that 68 per cent of the total man-days lost in 1985 were in the public sector because of the teachers' and Civil Service one-day strike involving over 200,000 people. That loss was 38 per cent higher than in the previous year.  The continuation of hostilities between the Government and the teachers' unions, leading to disruption of education and family life and to anxiety for parents, will give nobody any joy.  It should be remembered that it can <Col N="1500" /> be avoided.  The issue is no longer about the dates on which the relevant increases will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service, at a meeting on 2 January last, said that the Government would honour the arbitration award.  &ldquo;Honour the arbitrator's award&rdquo; could only have meant that they would honour it in full and pay the 10 per cent.  The teachers' unions have made it quite clear that they understand fully the financial position.  The arbitrator understood the financial position.  He stated finally that he had taken into account the economic circumstances of the Government. The teachers' unions accept that position.  The impasse has arisen because of the argument about whether when it is paid the full retrospection will be paid. That is the issue.  The teachers united and various sections of them and their leadership have made it quite clear at meetings with me in the last few days that they are prepared to negotiate with the Government a phased payment of the award, but for the Government to say that paying it in three phases in December 1986, December 1987 and July 1988, with no retrospection is honouring the arbitrator's award in full is nonsense. Argument here is not so important in that the Government have the figures to vote it down and apparently they are getting support from the Progressive Democratic Party who do not believe that the teachers merit this increase.  We want to avoid difficulties in future months which could put the educational system under further pressure.  I ask the Minister for Education to try to come to some settlement on that or even to postpone Thursday's debate for a week to give an opportunity for meaningful talks to take place.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to PAYE.  It was stated during the Budget Statement that the Government had made it quite clear that there would be substantial reductions in PAYE and in the take from the PAYE sector in 1986 and a reduction of what the Government would take out of the economy under PAYE headings.  We all know that of the income tax collected by the State 85 per cent is paid by PAYE, 13 per cent by the self-employed and 2 <Col N="1501" /> per cent by farmers.  The argument that the Government put forward does not stand up.  I want to put on the record of the House that more tax under PAYE will be taken from the taxpayers in 1986 than in 1985 regardless of the miserly allowances given by the Government.  The reason is that there will be roughly a 7 per cent increase across the board for people in the PAYE sector and the tiny allowances given by the Government are based on the 1985 position with the same tax bands and allowances and there is no indexation. These small increases will assist only somebody who has no increase in 1986.</P>
    <P>Once you have an increase in 1986, between Labour Court findings, public sector pay agreements, carryovers and 25th round increases it will be about 7 per cent.  People will get 7 per cent on top of their 1985 earnings, then because of the way the system operates and the progress of PAYE they will go into higher tax bands at very moderate and low incomes, pay higher taxation and on top of that will be paying the full whack of the PAYE tax on their increase in salary. Therefore, the marginal increases will not take less tax.  The Government raised the figures slightly for the PAYE sector knowing that because of their increase in pay they will continue to pay double the rate of inflation.  That is the problem. So much money is being taken from the PAYE sector because the tiny increases given by the Government in the last two years are based on the 1985 levels with no indexation while the pay increases in 1986 will all be fully taxable.  A higher proportion of salaries will be taxable and every individual who gets an increase more than about 2 per cent in 1986 will have higher taxable earnings and pay more in PAYE.  The case the Minister made last week on that is false.</P>
    <P>Regarding the withholding of the tax in banks, I want to make an argument on one point.  I argued last week that the Government have tried to put forward a false argument that they have helped the PAYE sector and put taxes on to the banks.  There is no tax on any bank or insurance company.  It is on the people who save with them and comes back to the <Col N="1502" /> consumer.  Most of the money saved in the Irish banking system, £2.6 billion, is deposited by the small saver and earner who would already be paying progressive rates of PAYE anyway.  Over the weekend I studied the Minister's document. At the moment interest in excess of £50 must be declared.  If a person is not liable to tax, if his income from other sources is less than would take him into the PAYE net, he can claim back that tax. That is according to the present tax and accounting system that I have studied and operated for years.  The Minister in his Budget Statement last week said that if a person who is not liable to tax in the normal way has money in the bank and his income generated from that deposit and whatever other income he has is less than would bring him into the tax net, such a person cannot claim that tax back under the tax system.  The person who is on a higher tax rate, who would have 35 per cent deducted at source by the bank because he is paying 60 per cent on his other income, would have to declare that money and pay the difference between what the bank took and what he should have paid when that interest was taken as income.</P>
    <P>Surely that is a total anomaly?  The Minister was badly advised on that.  He should clarify this because it is of great concern to the ordinary person who has money saved in the bank.  The fact that you have money in the bank does not mean that you are rich or a capitalist. Many old and infirm people have saved for their old age and for a rainy day and put whatever little resources they had in the bank, and their combined income on deposit accounts in the bank and investments is less than will bring them over the tax threshold.  Surely a Government cannot say that they are not allowed to claim that back, yet that is what the Minister said in his Budget Statement.  I ask for clarification on this.  I hope that we do not have to wait until the end of the debate for that.  I assume that the official from the Department of Finance here can give to the next Government speaker a clear statement on the position. I know from letters received by my party <Col N="1503" /> and by other people that this is of great concern.  I do not know if I am right or wrong but the perception is that what I have stated is correct.  It is not my opinion, it is the opinion of people outside who are involved in the day-to-day banking system and people in accountant's offices.  I would welcome clarification on it by the next Government speaker today.</P>
    <P>I tried to make a few points at Question Time.  I was trying to get the Government's position on jobs.  What plans have this Government for jobs that have not been announced in the 1986 Budget Statement?  What hope is there for the 240,000 plus who are unemployed? That figure does not take account of the massive numbers emigrating and the 30,000 or so people the Minister for Labour spoke about who are on short term courses.  What about all the other people who for one reason or another, because their families are means tested, are not part of the unemployment register?</P>
    <P>Without any exaggeration, there are certainly 300,000 people unemployed in this State, and what proposals have been made to give them hope?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Government's policies in relation to job creation were outlined in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  If that policy is like their other two policies in <i>Building on Reality</i> and like their Programmes for Government, there is no hope that they will reverse the levels of unemployment, eliminate the current budget deficit by 1987-88 or reduce the national debt, as promised. Since this Government came into office, the unemployment figure has gone up by 70,000.  The figure given in <i>Building on Reality</i> for the autumn of 1983 was 218,000. The Government estimates have allowed for a figure of 240,000, on average, for the whole of 1986.  There is no logic to this.  The Government probably do not know what figures they are working to, or what policies they have.  If they have no policy on job creation, they should honestly tell the public that.</P>
    <P>I put down a question today to the Minister for Labour asking him to outline <Col N="1504" /> the programme on job creation, but he outlined only the courses and schemes being run by AnCO for short term work, social employment, the enterprise allowance scheme, the youth employment scheme, guarantee funds &mdash; everything but job creation.  The definition of jobs is work, not short term courses and retraining, although these help in another way.  The Minister told us today that he has no manpower policy and that no direction has been given on this.  There possibly may be a manpower policy sometime in 1986, shortly before the next election. What good will that be?  <i>Building on Reality</i> is now out of date.  There is just no policy for combatting unemployment.</P>
    <P>We have had to suffer from the massive borrowing of this Government, from the effect on unemployment, from the first edition reports followed by no action. This has led to deep demoralisation, with people feeling that they have no future and might as well emigrate.  What they need is hope, confidence and a future.  We on this side of the House have outlined policies on afforestation and on our other natural resources.  We are trying to develop the Irish economy and build up our semi-State structure to combine with their present services in an attempt to create employment.  We are looking to the policy of the IDA to try to switch money from the capital side to the investment project side and link the grant aiding of firms with the number of jobs created.  This can be done; it has been done in other countries.</P>
    <P>As long as we continue to give billions of pounds to firms on the basis of capital orientated grants and not on the basis of employment, our unemployment figures will continue to rise.  Why can the Government not see that?  Why do they make no attempt to stimulate our industries into job creation and a fight to take on EC markets?  Why do they not step up a programme of import substitution in areas where that would clearly be helpful to the economy?  Why is there not a selective alteration in the embargo on the public sector in areas where this could be cost efficient?  Why is there no clear <Col N="1505" /> policy or combination of policies to try to change the situation?</P>
    <P>Last week we heard of the closure of hospitals and today we hear talk about the closing down of Carysfort Training College.  It is believed on this side that the Government decision has been taken in that regard, but has not been announced. The Tánaiste and the Minister for Education were in the House and would not confirm or deny this.  This famous college in the south of Dublin has provided services for many years.  Is it to be closed down, like the hospitals, with no attempt at justification, no plans, no alternatives?  It is difficult to give fair and credible opposition to a Government who will not put forward policies.  More factories closed yesterday with more redundancies and job losses.  Government intervention which would have helped in several areas was just not forthcoming.  I know that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has a great interest in the trade union movement and has been involved in it. He must be aware of the demoralisation among trade union members, the fear and anxiety they are expressing because of massive loss of members through lost jobs, with no hope, in the short term, of regaining employment.  There are also numbers of people just hanging on to their jobs.</P>
    <P>I have been told on several occasions by accountants that if the Revenue Commissioners were to take action in the PAYE field, thousands more jobs would be lost.  Firms all across the country are using the money collected for PAYE as cash flow to keep them in operation.  This is totally ludicrous, but it is happening. We can only plead that the Revenue Commissioners do not come down hard on these firms.  That is the reason why so much money is outstanding.  It is very difficult to move out of this disquieting position.</P>
    <P>Banks are unreasonable, which results in money being tight.  They are putting pressure on people and putting down deadlines.  The same banks, when in difficulty less than a year ago, put fierce pressure on the political system when everybody thought that the AIB were going <Col N="1506" /> to the wall.  They put pressure on Members to come to an all-party agreement to float millions of pounds for their support to get them out of a mess which they had made of an insurance corporation because they had not done their sums in the first place.  They do not have the same respect for people who have made good commercial decisions but cannot succeed because of the economic environment.  The banks do not practise what they preach.  They hammer those who are overdrawn and cause job losses, while they moralise in the safe knowledge that if they make major errors these will be picked up by the taxpayer, the same taxpayer who is suffering because of their policies.</P>
    <P>A Government spokesman put forward the view that the banks were hit by tax but they have not been caught for one penny by the recent budget.  In line with all other Coalition budgets, this was against the old, the infirm, the workers, the trade unionists, people in small businesses, the self-employed and the PAYE sector.  They will fund the 1986 Exchequer. That is another example of hardship, on top of the removal of food subsidies, which this Government are prepared to force on the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said and written about this Budget, but it would be fair to say that the general consensus is that it has managed, in an imaginative way and in the face of considerable economic adversity, to meet several desirable economic and social objectives.  It has brought us a step further in dealing with the imbalance in our public finances, while avoiding any severe impact on the economy.  Also, as stated by the Minister for Finance, the shift in the balance of income taxation brought about by the budgetary changes in personal taxation and in the taxation of financial institutions and financial assets will tend to shift the pattern of expenditure in a way which will be favourable to the expansion of economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inflation rate continues to decline, having been substantially reduced from <Col N="1507" /> over 8½ per cent in 1984 to less than 5½ per cent last year.  It will fall further in the course of 1986 to an expected 4½ per cent.  For the first time in four years, personal consumption rose in 1985 in real terms and this is expected to continue in 1986.  For families, the effect of these developments is seen most immediately in greater disposable income and increased purchasing power.  The housewife operating the family budget can expect to continue to manage within acceptable limits the weekly grocery bill with prices continuing a downward trend.</P>
    <P>The household's pay packet will show an increase, showing an improvement for many in their standard of living.  While the prices of drink and tobacco are being increased, at least these are areas over which people can exercise discretion.</P>
    <P>There are certain key elements in the budget which will be of particular help to women.  The introduction of the new monthly child benefit payment of £15.05 per child must be welcomed.  While this scheme will replace most of the existing child support schemes it involves a further allocation of £11.1 million by the Exchequer, over and above what would have been spent on the existing schemes. The effect of the new scheme will be to achieve a more selective distribution of resources, with lower income families on social welfare or below the tax threshold benefiting while the position of standard rate taxpayers will be protected.  While those losing the £100 child tax allowance may complain to some extent, it must be remembered that this benefits the higher income taxpayer most, a difference of £25 per year per child between someone paying tax at 60 per cent and someone paying tax at 35 per cent.  Everyone with children will now get the same state child support payment per child.</P>
    <P>In addition there is a transfer of child support resources from the pay packet to the purse, thus giving a more significant independent income to mothers.  Even in homes where husbands divide their income in full consultation with their wifes and where her control of the family <Col N="1508" /> budget is considerable, the tax allowance would tend to be viewed as hidden and already taken care of before the income is divided up.  An extra £9 per month for, say, an average three child family, from April, will be directly payable to the mother.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to consider briefly the history of the children's allowance scheme.  Children's allowances were introduced in August 1944 for families with three or more children.  It has been non-contributory from the beginning and there has never been any means test. Income tax clawbacks between 1944 and 1954, however, confined the net benefit to parents below the income tax threshold, who were the vast majority of parents at that time.  In 1952 an allowance for the second child was introduced. These changes coincided at the time with the general removal of food subsidies.  In November 1963, an allowance for the first child was introduced.  In July 1974, title to children's allowances was vested in mothers instead of fathers.  Up to then, mothers had to be nominated by husbands to receive the children's allowance in about 80 per cent of cases.  That left one in five mothers without discretion in regard to spending.</P>
    <P>Under the child benefit scheme there will be no change in the legal position under which the mother gets paid the benefit directly giving her freedom to spend.  This is very important because some mothers felt a bit uncertain about it.  They thought that perhaps because of the new title of the scheme the payment would be made to the family, either the father or mother.  Though in the vast majority of cases mothers are adequately supported according to the family means, there are cases, more numerous than people care to believe, in which wives get little or nothing from a husband when he is the only breadwinner.  In most marriages there is not a problem, husbands and wives deciding on how the income should be spent, but when the husband is the only breadwinner and may have a difficulty with gambling or alcoholism which turns him into a mean man, the woman can do very little.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> Recently, a woman visited my clinic from a good middle class estate in my constituency.  She has three children and the husband earns £16,000 a year, but gives her only enough money to go out one night a week to do the shopping and then expects her to give him the supermarket receipt and the change. That woman depends on her children's allowance of £36 per month for spending money for herself.  She has to point out clothes which she may want to her husband and let him buy them.  The husband believes emphatically that his income is his alone and that money spent on his wife, for clothes or health or teeth care is a concession to her.</P>
    <P>It might be relevant to refer to a little disagreement between the Minister for Finance and a certain department store advertisement yesterday.  The underlying concept in that advertisement was that the husband who earns has the power to make any concession, or take up a position in the family with regard to spending.  I suggest that the concept in the advertisement concerned in this discussion did not reflect the expectations and the practice in the vast majority of today's marriages.  We cannot legislate for equal sharing in the household budget but I suggest that we should try to change the attitudes reflected in that advertisement. Advertisements should reflect reasonable and fair attitudes and not perpetuate old traditions of unequal and unjust attitudes, and I suggest that the advertising whiz-kids in this case go back to basics and learn the reality of life between today's husbands and wives.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the introduction of children's allowance in 1944 is expressed in a Department of Social Welfare report as follows:</P>
    <P>It became clear that measures were required to remove the relative disadvantages in material circumstances which harassed parents of families, and thus to mitigate the handicaps arising from parenthood.  Any reduction in the economic difficulties besetting parents in the raising of families, would, in the long-term view, have favourable <Col N="1510" /> repercussions on other national problems, such as the decline in the population, the low marriage rate, late marriages, and emigration.</P>
    <P>The reasons today for helping the family through child support policies may be different from those in the forties. However, certain fundamental principles remain the same.  It is generally acknowledged that there are three main stages in an individual's life cycle when he is likely to be in poverty &mdash; as a young child, as a parent of growing children and, finally, in old age.  Social policy attempts to smooth some of the natural fluctuations in living standards over the family cycle and one of the most important ways is the help given to children and their parents.  Social services like free education, child health services and children's allowances help to spread the cost of raising children over the community as a whole and to soften the relative poverty in childhood and at parenthood.  The objectives of sharing the financial burden of parenthood and of redressing inequalities in living standards arising from different numbers of dependent members in different families are valid social goals at all income levels.</P>
    <P>I wonder is it fully appreciated what in fact the relative costs of families are.  A study done in this area shows for instance that an average household with one person costs 60 per cent of that of a married couple at the same living standard. A family with three children aged ten, 12 and 14 would require on average 75 per cent more income than a married couple alone in order to have a similar standard of living.  Put another way, a single person with an income of £60 a week is as well off as a married couple with £100 a week, and a couple with three children aged ten to 14 years with £175 a week to spend.  The same study found no clear evidence of economies of scale in larger families.  While some economies exist with regard to housing, in terms of the overall income scale it was unimportant. Economies of scale exist of course where there are say three to five adults, earning income, sharing.  It is welcome then that our budget provides for a <Col N="1511" /> payment of £21.75 in respect of sixth and subsequent children, reflecting the additional costs of larger families.</P>
    <P>Looking at trends in the value of the children's allowance, it is notable that in the first 25 years of the scheme, children's allowances were only increased three times and these increases in the scheme coincided with particular measures which adversely affected the income of families. However, during those years, inflation was low.  During the seventies, when inflation was high, the allowances, which reached a peak in 1973, fell in real terms after that.  In the 1985 budget children's allowances were increased for the first time since 1982.  As we move progressively towards a full child benefit scheme, as provided for in the national plan, hopefully we can further improve and secure the financial position of families, particularly the less well off.  The principles underlying the introduction of children's allowances in the forties are just as valid today as they were then and regrettably perhaps the rights of families to income support are not always accepted in today's more individualist world.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that social welfare increases will continue to more than keep pace with the cost of living.  As the Minister for Finance has pointed out each of the welfare increases given in the first three budgets of this Government has exceeded the following year's increase in the cost of living.  In the period mid-1983 to mid-1987 it is estimated that the real increase in welfare payments for the long term unemployed will be over 13 per cent, for other long term categories the figure is 7½ per cent and for short term payments is estimated at about 5 per cent. Thus with inflation continuing to fall, the rate of welfare increase which is necessary to protect the real value of social welfare transfers is correspondingly contained, and the general increase in personal and adult dependant rates of welfare payments, from mid-July, will assure the living standards of those on welfare for a further year.  While clearly I would wish to see even greater increases in social welfare payments than those we <Col N="1512" /> are providing, it must be remembered that we continue to have an underlying dependency ratio greater than most countries with broadly comparable levels of development, a problem which has been aggravated by the economic difficulties of recent years.</P>
    <P>While a sizeable proportion of our population are now dependent on social welfare, growing numbers of women enter this category whether as single mothers or women faced with unemployment. While it is a source of regret that it has taken some time to implement the legislation providing for equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security, provision is made in the Estimates for its implementation in the first half of this year.  This will have the effect of removing one of the remaining key discriminations affecting women in our economic life.</P>
    <P>There are certain interesting features of the budget which to date have not received much comment but which will improve the lot of several categories of women.  At present <i>ex-gratia</i> pensions are payable to the widows and children of pensionable public servants who retired or died prior to the introduction of the contributory widow's and children's pension scheme.  Since 1979, the rate of this pension has stood at 5/6ths of the rate payable under the contributory scheme. The difference will be eliminated between now and 1987 at an estimated cost in 1986 of £2 million.  This will clearly be a welcome provision for this category of widows and their children.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposed changes in the family income supplement scheme, whereby the weekly income criteria which determine entitlements to the scheme will be increased in line with the budgetary increases in short term social welfare benefits and changes in personal income taxation.  This will enhance the position of low income employees with dependants, a number of whom would be single mothers trying to cope on low incomes.  It is very important that the details of this scheme are made known to this group.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> The increase in the allocation of onceoff grants to voluntary organisations undertaking projects in the social services area from £650,000 in 1985 to £750,000 in 1986 is most welcome.  Very many of the organisations helped through this allocation are organisations involved with families.</P>
    <P>There is a further, little commented upon, aspect of the budget on which I would like to comment.  This is the provision of £250,000 for the continuation of the measles vaccination programme.  I do not believe that it is fully appreciated how serious a childhood illness measles can be.  In the more developed countries until quite recent times this carried a risk of mortality for many children because of the complications involved.  Even in our own country, measles can be quite devastating in terms of complications, such as possible loss of hearing and in the case of an infant convulsions, as well as the better known risk to the foetus if a pregnant woman is infected with measles.  It is, therefore, essential that parents bring their children for vaccination, which is now a free service.</P>
    <P>We tend to take for granted the basic maternity and child welfare services which have brought down maternal and infant mortality to an extremely low level and which ensure protection from the appalling childhood illnesses which were the lot of many families even as close as a generation ago.</P>
    <P>Moving on to a somewhat different aspect of the budget, I welcome one of the particular taxation measures.  This arises from the Age of Majority Act, 1985, which reduced the age of majority from 21 to 18.  A change will be made in the Finance Bill whereby a parent will be in a position to covenant part of his or her income in favour of a child aged 18 years or over, subject to a limit of 5 per cent of income and for a period of six years.  This will provide a measure of tax relief for such parents which they can put to good use by setting aside funds for their children's third level education.  As more and more young people enter third level education, the length of time in which a parent has to provide for children <Col N="1514" /> lengthens, often until children are well into adulthood.  This is exacerbated by the difficulties in finding employment for young adults subsequent to their graduation. The new budgetary provision will ease this problem for many parents.</P>
    <P>I would refer to the budget for my own office.  There are two separate aspects to my budget this year.  The estimates allocation is £185,000, an increase of £15,000, or over 8 per cent on the 1985 provision.  Through this allocation I will continue &mdash; as in the last three years &mdash; to support projects and activities of assistance to women.  From the response I have had, I know that the grants allocated have been of considerable assistance in a wide range of areas, including adult education projects, play groups, seminars and conferences on major themes of interest to women, publications and research.  Part of this allocation also goes to funding the Council for the Status of Women to enable them to continue their essential role of representing women's voices, outside of Government.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of my budget this year is the special budgetary allocation of £150,000 for a women in business enterprise programme.  In the past year I initiated a range of promotional activities directed at encouraging more women into business careers.  The IDA and SFADCo followed my lead and also promoted a number of activities in this context. The overall result was a significant response from women to the idea of business activity, resulting in a considerable increase in the number of inquiries to the State agencies involved, and a positive follow up in many cases.  We now know from the experience gained on this programme that with special encouragement and advice, a number of women with good practical ideas will respond to specific promotion directed to them and the overall result should be an increase in the number of women setting up, maintaining and expanding their own businesses. In recognition of the great potential, both economically and socially in this area, the allocation of £150,000 was made to intensify and develop our efforts to achieve results.  Within the next <Col N="1515" /> month I hope to give details of how, in broad terms, this money will be spent over the year.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government in the budget have brought us a step further in dealing with the imbalance in our public finances while maintaining increases to the vulnerable sectors in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The fourth budget introduced by the Minister for Finance can best be described as a bandit budget. Once again it has all the hallmarks of the technocrat, the bureaucrat and the academic.  It is yet another stage in the great bluff of the Coalition.  More than ever before it shows that the Taoiseach and his Ministers are running faster in order to stand still.  However, on this occasion the Irish people have had enough.  My message to the Government is: &ldquo;Your bluff has now been called.  You can prolong the agony for as long as you wish, but after this miserable effort your time is up&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was to be the Government of honesty and integrity which was to steer the ship of State on the straight and narrow course as decreed in the document, &ldquo;Programme for Government, 1982.&rdquo; That document stated:</P>
      <P>The unemployment situation with 170,000 unemployed, 50,000 of them under 25 years of age, and the state of the public finances facing a new Government taking office at the end of 1982, are alarming.  Both require firm and decisive action by such a Government. The dual task of halting and reversing the growth of unemployment while phasing out the current budget deficit poses a greater challenge than any Irish Government has faced domestically since the early years of the State.</P>
      <P>The document, under the heading &ldquo;Financial Stability&rdquo;, states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phasing of the elimination of the current Budget deficit between now and 1987 will have to be undertaken with due regard to prevailing economic conditions, and in particular to the <Col N="1516" /> importance of achieving economic growth and dealing with unemployment.</P>
    <P>That was the promise the Coalition made when they took office three years ago.  The position now is that unemployment has increased from 170,000 to 239,867 at the beginning of January and a further 50,000 young people emigrated since 1982.  That national deficit has increased from £12.8 billion or 104 per cent of GNP when the Government took office late in 1982 to a staggering £20.4 billion or 130 per cent of GNP at present. The current budget deficit at the end of 1982 stood at £988 million or 8 per cent of GNP but today it is a staggering £1,284 million or 8.2 per cent of GNP.  Those figures show how the Government have performed since they took office.  After a series of measures that have devastated the Irish economy, after a series of promises that were broken and a series of U-turns they have got the country in a financial mess.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote what Deputy Dr. Garret FitzGerald said on his appointment as Taoiseach on 30 June 1981, which was as follows:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were rejected at the polls basically because of the perception by the people that that party failed to govern, a failure to govern that has no precedent in the annals of this country and which has led to the near collapse of our public finances.  In the couple of hours since I was appointed Taoiseach I have had many things to do because the nature of the changeover on this occasion was such that tasks that might have been undertaken earlier could not be undertaken until this afternoon. However, even in that brief time I have learned something of the scale of the damage done.  I have to say I am shocked to find the position is even worse than our most pessimistic...</P>
    <P>I do not say that without careful consideration.  It is not a propagandist remark; it is a factual remark.  When the facts are disclosed they will validate what I have to say.  This Government have an enormous task ahead of them. <Col N="1517" /> It is many decades since any Government faced the kind of problems we face.</P>
    <P>The most significant sentence in that statement was the following:</P>
    <P>The scale of the mess is beyond anything that had to be faced previously.</P>
    <P>What kind of mess is the Irish economy in today following almost four years of so-called financial rectitude in order to bring the nation's finances into order? What price has the country had to pay in economic and human misery as a result of those misguided financial policies?  What improvement has taken place in the nation's finances?  It is clear from the figures I quoted that no improvement has taken place.  The figures have become progressively worse.  I should like the Taoiseach, and the Government, to answer the questions I have posed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is reputed to be good at statistics and I should like to hear his comment on the catastrophic rise in bank interest rates.  The real rate of bank interest when he took office was minus 3 per cent, 3 per cent below the level of inflation, but at the beginning of 1986 the real level of bank interest was 8 per cent and shortly it will go to 10 per cent.  That trend could hardly be described as a contribution to a climate conducive to industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the taxation trend.  VAT increases, as a percentage of GNP, have gone up from 7 per cent in 1982 to 9 per cent in 1983, to 9.4 per cent in 1984, back to 9 per cent in 1985 &mdash; that was because the Government were not able to collect the taxes &mdash; and the projected figure for 1986 is 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the trend in regard to income tax as a proportion of GNP.  It rose from 12.1 per cent in 1982 to 12.5 per cent in 1983, to 13.6 per cent in 1984, to 13.84 per cent in 1985, and the projected figure for 1986 is 13.9 per cent. One of our most respected commentators, Paul Tansey in last Sunday's issue of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> stated that the projected percentage of income tax take <Col N="1518" /> of GNP will be as high as 14.7 per cent in 1986.  The social welfare payout is up from 13.7 per cent of GNP in 1982 to a projected figure approaching 20 per cent in the current year.  They are the facts.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of his appointment as Taoiseach in 1981 Deputy FitzGerald said:</P>
    <P>I am glad to have assembled a team whose talents will see us through this difficult period.</P>
    <P>The financial trends I have quoted show the talents of the Taoiseach and his team in their true light.  Further comment from me would be superfluous.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the budget under four headings &mdash; unemployment, economic policy, public service reform and taxation.  Last Sunday's issue of <i>The Sunday Press</i> carried a story under the heading, &ldquo;A Heavy Blow For The Old&rdquo;. This has to be the most cruel and callous effort of all in the budget.  Last year the Government made great play of their efforts to get old people to put their money in the banks assuring them that there was no problem and that the tax take would be little or nothing.  That move followed the dreadful attacks on old people, particularly in the west.  Many old people, on the advice of all of us, took advantage of the improvement in the 1985 budget and lodged their money in banks.  However, their money will now be taxed at the rate of 35 per cent.  Such a callous and cold attitude to old age pensioners is hard to believe but it typifies many aspects of the budget.  More than any other feature of the budget, that needs to be changed immediately.</P>
    <P>On the question of unemployment, it is no secret that there are almost 240,000 people on the unemployment register. The Minister for Finance, in the course of his budget speech last year, said:</P>
    <P>Unemployment, taking account of the impact of special employment measures, should begin to level out and, given moderation in pay developments, there should be some pick up in employment.</P>
    <P>In presenting this budget the latest figures <Col N="1519" /> which the Minister for Finance had available to him showed that unemployment stood at 225,000.  He projected an average unemployment figure of 217,000 for 1985 as the basis for unemployment gradually falling to a figure below 219,000.  What was the outturn?  Instead of decreasing, unemployment has increased to 240,000.  Not alone did the Minister get the figures wrong, his projections were in the wrong direction.  It is amazing that the Minister could be so wrong in his projections in last year's budget in regard to the greatest social and economic problem facing us.  It is even more amazing that he has held on to the job to present this year's budget. I have no fault to find with the Minister as a colleague in the House.  He is a nice, courageous fellow but, as Minister for Finance, he has proved to be an unmitigated disaster.  He has constantly introduced budgets which have hindered the general development of the economy, which led to an air of pessimism in the commercial sector and submerged entrepreneurial spirit and initiative under the rising tide of taxation.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the greatest scourge of our time and has attacked all sectors of society.  It represents no class, regional or age boundaries.  As Thomas Carlyle once stated &ldquo;a man willing to work and unable to find work is perhaps the saddest sight that fortune's inequality exhibits under this sun&rdquo;.  To conquer and root out this disease requires strong and decisive Government action.  The Government had a clear objective, as stated in this infamous policy document which I describe as the Taoiseach's book of fairy tales, to commit themselves to a coherent and insistent attack on the lack of jobs. However, there are few incentives to employers to increase employment.  The budget makes incentives available to industry on a very limited scale.  The available incentives encourage firms to invest in equipment rather than in labour. The National Planning Board and the Commission on Taxation proposed that our tax system should at least be neutral <Col N="1520" /> in regard to employment costs and capital equipment costs.  Despite the catastrophic level of unemployment the Government have refused to consider the recommendations of those two bodies although they have had the opportunity to directly affect the levels of employment through the public capital programme.  However, they have refused to use this method.</P>
    <P>If the Government were serious about employment they would look at the areas where it can be created usefully and quickly.  In the construction industry there are now 45,000 people unemployed. With the welcome exception of the belated grants for restoring houses which are going very well in County Galway, the Government have consistently attempted to flatten the construction industry into the mud of undeveloped sites and waste ground.  This has resulted in the output of the construction industry falling by over 30 per cent since 1980.  The fact that the Minister devoted only a paragraph to the construction industry containing no proposals for its stimulation shows their disregard for the plight of the industry.  They have devastated the industry through their penal imposition of taxes, such as the 10 per cent VAT rate and the failure to provide incentives in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to see the treatment which agriculture has been given in the budget.  The Minister devoted only one small paragraph to it and, when one compares that to the pious platitudes in <i>Building on Reality</i>, one can see how serious the Government are about the development of agriculture.  The Government spoke in glowing terms about the farm modernisation scheme; nevertheless they discontinued it.  They are now talking about a new scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It will be a little election gimmick for the farmers and will be awaited with bated breath because the farmers of County Galway have a big problem in relation to their indebtedness <Col N="1521" /> to the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and other financial institutions.  A scheme at this stage will do little to help the plight of so many farmers.  The Government do not have an economic policy, although they have a financial one.  They can encourage economic activity and employment for the climate they create and their economic policies.  This has been recognised by the Commission on Taxation when they suggested that the level of economic activity is affected much more by the general economic policy of a Government than by any set of specific measures or incentives.  The problem with the Government is that they have created a hostile environment for economic expansion.  They have simultaneously increased taxation, reduced capital expenditure and, through their borrowing policies, kept interest rates higher than they need be.  What individual or company in their sane mind would invest in productive areas in Ireland today?  The thrust of the policies of the Minister for Finance has been to drive investment funds into Government gilts where they only serve to prop up an inefficient administration system.</P>
      <P>The other aspect of the Minister's policies, clearly outlined in the budget, is to drive money out of the country as hot money.  The biggest indicator of the lack of confidence in Ireland as an investment location is the way in which foreign multinationals have repatriated the sum of £130 million in profits and dividends in 1985.  The largest growth in exports since the Government came to office is that of hot money, money which is not being disclosed to the Revenue Commissioners. Millions of pounds are leaving the country.  The bond washing exercise in last year's budget, the taxing of banks and building society deposits and the 15 per cent taxation on investment income this year have had one sure effect &mdash; they will further boost the deposit accounts of banks in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After three years in office, the Government are still floating in an economic policy vacuum.  So far, they have pursued <Col N="1522" /> a financial policy which has been detrimental to the economy.  Economic policy has been left out in the cold.  The real economy consists of people, production and productivity and that is where the action is.  However, the Government have hardly addressed the central core of the economy.  The central strategy of an economic policy should now be focused on increasing the volume of national output.  This can be done through better investment decisions and higher productivity which will produce more output. During the last three years this country has received poor value for its investment income.  We have been investing at Japanese levels to attain British levels of output growth.  In the last year, for instance, the rate of expansion in economic activity slowed significantly according to the Central Bank's latest report.  Real gross domestic product grew by only 2¼ per cent and was only 0.5 per cent compared with 2¼ per cent for 1984.</P>
    <P>This rate of growth is clearly unsatisfactory and the outlook for 1986 is for only a marginal improvement.  Our rate of growth since 1980 has been marginally higher than the EC average but, given our initial low base, it is not satisfactory. Our gross domestic product per head of population is less than 60 per cent of the EC average.  The Government do not have the policies to give this country the type of economic growth it needs.  The biggest detriment to economic well-being is our national debt.  In 1985 the Government borrowed over £2 billion, the highest level of borrowing in the history of the State.  The total Government debt is approximately £20.4 billion.  This debt has increased from £12.8 billion at the end of 1982 to £20.4 billion now, an increase of almost 50 per cent in just three years of Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>One recalls the cries of anger and panic from politicians now on the Government's side when the total borrowing by Fianna Fáil Governments was less than half the present figure.  The bulk of the increase in borrowing has gone to finance the current budget deficit.  It might be excusable if it was financing worthwhile capital investment, but the <Col N="1523" /> Government's ability to control the current deficit suggests that they have neither the inclination nor the courage to tackle this task.  Are Ministers incapable of finding those wasteful areas of expenditure in their Departments?  No manager in private enterprise would survive if he followed the example of this Government. My contention is that £1 million per day is being wasted on public expenditure at present.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the very high level of borrowing is the adverse effect it is having on the domestic money market. The amount of indebtedness of the Government to the associated and non-associated banks increased from £1,087 million in December 1981 to £2,321 million by September 1985, an increase of almost 114 per cent.  This enormous increase has led to the demand for money and hence pushed up the interest rates. The real level of interest rates are now higher than they have ever been.  This has created major problems for the business community, exacerbating an already difficult situation.  The cost of working capital has been identified by the Small Firms Association as a major inhibiting factor to continued business expansion.</P>
    <P>There is a moral obligation on the Government to curb this level of borrowing. Let me quote from a speech made by Mr. T.F.O Cofaigh, Governor of the Central Bank, on 14 November 1985, when he said:</P>
    <P>It is a bitter irony that a family conscious society, which has traditionally espoused personal thrift and has sought to help the next generation, is now effectively prevented from doing so. Instead, we have got ourselves into a situation where, in part at least, we are living off the next generation which has been given no choice in the matter. Distributed justice, that which applies over time as well as of the present, demands that we put an end to this practice of banqueting upon borrowing.</P>
    <P>As I said before, what an outrage there was when Fianna Fáil borrowed what was <Col N="1524" /> then considered to be large amounts.  In my view the borrowing of this Government is much more serious because it makes very little provision for capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>I come now to a number of suggestions involving the spending of the money we borrow.  We all accept that a certain amount must be borrowed.  My proposals were contained in a number of the reports from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses, of which I am a member.  Like many other reports, these reports, setting out the wonderful work done by this committee, lie on the shelves gathering dust.  I hope the proposals I am making today will be considered in the context of this debate and of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Our first report, published two years ago, dealt with manufacturing industry and said that the high level of bank interest rates was causing major problems for small firms.  This is of particular concern to small Irish companies facing foreign competitors who have lower interest rates.  However, manufacturing industries in Ireland, and particularly our small manufacturing industries, are still facing the consequences of high interest rates.  Only yesterday the Central Bank raised interest rates by a further 2½ per cent above a previous increase of 2 per cent only two weeks ago.  High interest rates add to the cost burden of our manufacturing firms, impede their competitiveness and cost jobs.  We can only speculate about how many hundreds, even thousands, of jobs will disappear as a result of the latest round of increases in interest rates.  Although I accept that this is largely due to outside factors, this increase has to be laid at the door of the Government, who have no foreign exchange policy and who failed to spell out their proposals on exchange rates. This has led in large part to the kind of speculation which has taken place in recent days thereby increasing bank interest rates.</P>
    <P>The committee's report contains a number of sensible recommendations related to loan finance for small firms and with regard to employment creation <Col N="1525" /> generally.  These recommendations include a system of loan guarantees and interest subsidies to smaller firms so that they would have the same level of access to loan finance as larger firms, and at the same levels of interest, and also a scheme to channel personal savings into loans for small industry.  This was a particularly good proposal and is one which the Minister for Finance should have taken into account when introducing the tax changes for personal savers.  A similar scheme in France proves this point.  Many millions of pounds at present under the bed or else where would be channelled into small industries if the Minister provided a proper tax incentive scheme for small firms.  IDA grants should be optional between additional employment and the cost of fixed assets.  The grant aid package should provide for aid for full time employment in firms not eligible for capital grants.  There should be special income tax rebates to export and marketing personnel who spend more than 30 days a year outside the country and to key technical staff in order to provide a real incentive to achieve export led growth; and there should be a drop in the grant guarantee aspect of VAT at the point of entry.  The introduction of these measures, many of which could be achieved through redeployment of existing State funds in industry, would not cost the economy an extra penny and would go a long way towards reducing the cost burden on our small manufacturing concerns and reverse the trend towards fewer jobs in industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to the burden of indirect taxation, the committee made it clear in the report on the retail and distribution trade and in the report on the construction industry, published recently, that the most effective way of broadening the tax base is to reduce the scale of that other economy which has become rampant, that is, the black economy.  The most effective way of hitting the black economy is by making our legitimate businesses more competitive, particularly in the services sector.  In the report on the construction industry we stated that as long as there is no distinguishable lower <Col N="1526" /> VAT rate for services, including construction and related professional services, the incentive for the black economy operator will be substantial.</P>
    <P>The committee went on to recommend a low 5 per cent labour intensive services rate, which would include construction, and stated that such a move, combined with effective anti-evasion measures, would effect a major reduction in the black economy and in consequence widen the base of the legitimate economy.  The positive implications for real jobs arising from such a move are obvious.  As far as my influence on an incoming Fianna Fáil Government goes, those are the kind of financial and economic policies which will be put in train to put this country back to work.</P>

    <P>The appointment of a full Cabinet Minister to the Department of the Public Service was indicative of the interest of this Government in reforming the public service.  What are the fruits of Deputy Boland's three year term of office?  The cost of Exchequer wages and pensions has jumped from £1,982 million to £2,464 million in 1985.  This is an increase greater than the rate of inflation and this despite a decrease in the number employed.  In the latest debate on pay we have the Minister and his officials not able to produce sufficiently good reasons for denying teachers their pay award and now they are going around like spoiled children whingeing that they cannot afford to pay the award.  This refusal must be seen for what it is, namely, an attack on the system of conciliation and arbitration that has served this country well for decades. What the Minister cannot win by persuasion he is now intent on winning <Col N="1527" /> by force.  This augurs badly for any attempt by him or by this Government to bring the social and economic partners together.</P>
    <P>Of course, the greatest reason for the failure to curb and control public expenditure is the lack of a proper framework within which to take the necessary measures. Public expenditure can be reduced significantly only if it is part of a comprehensive plan of public service reform. The Minister for the Public Service has singularly failed to make any inroads in this important area.  He has made some semantic changes in the policy regarding the promotion of senior civil servants, getting civil servants to wear identity tags and to give their names on telephone calls.  These changes are welcome but we cannot be fooled into thinking it is reform of the public service.  He is tinkering with the system, not overhauling it.</P>
    <P>It appears the philosophy of the Minister and his officials to reform of the public service is still based on the 1969 Devlin report.  I have always thought that this report did not get its approach correct.  If the public sector is to be reformed the approach must be from the top downwards. This means that the first issue to be addressed is to decide on the services required in Ireland, given its size and demographic structure.  Once that has been identified, the next stage is to see how the services can be organised so that they will be effective and efficient, with duplication of effort eliminated.</P>
    <P>The other significant aspect of the Devlin report is that it is more than 15 years since it was published.  We are living in a dynamic era and our needs for the future will not be based on those of the past.  We must base our new strategy on future requirements rather than on past assessments.  This Government are squandering £1 million per day in wasteful and misguided expenditure.  For example, we spend £3 million per week on people who submit doctors' certificates. That was the figure for last year and I am sure there has been an increase.  This is despite the fact that our health services cost in the region of £25 million per week. <Col N="1528" /> Either the health services are very poor or the many people on doctors' certificates are not sick.  It is my belief that many people on those certificates are not sick. Rather, they are mitching from work and are playing the system.  It has been estimated that millions of pounds are squandered each week through abuses of the social welfare and taxation systems.  Millions of pounds are squandered each week on the plethora of youth employment schemes that are leading nowhere but to the emigrant ship.  There are numerous other examples of wasteful expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>How many State agencies are almost competing with each other to spend as much money as possible in the same areas so as to exhaust their budgets?  The system of deciding budgets for the forthcoming year essentially on the basis of what was spent in the previous year is crude and not appropriate to our needs.  However, this system of allocation of funds will continue as long as we do not have properly planned medium and long term programmes of action for each area of Government expenditure.  The White Paper on the Public Service gives me no grounds for the comfort or for thinking that this Government will take the right course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public service reform involves reform of the role of politicians.  Two years ago I said in this House that unless politicians tackle the political process from the point of our own performance in that process we will find it difficult to put right the problems of the country.  The fact that politicians spend 95 per cent of their time acting as messenger boys and 5 per cent acting as legislators is having a damaging effect on the country and on the economy. <Col N="1529" /> The public service is inefficient.  I wish to make it clear I am not being critical of public servants.  By and large they are probably the finest people and are the most hard-working but the problem is that they work in a structure that militates against initiative, hard work and good performance.  As politicians we continually foul up that system with a paper chase in which all of us are involved.  The time has come for us to look at our role as part of the reform now so necessary in the public service. Together with civil servants we have to get our priorities right.</P>
    <P>When one sees the wastage throughout the country, it is shocking that we are allowed to get away with it.  I will give an example of what I mean.  In a parliamentary question in 1982 I asked how much we were paying for the rent of O'Connell Bridge House.  All of us write hundreds of letters every week to that address about £1,000 grants, group water supply schemes and so on.  We paid £552,000 for the rent of the number one spot in the country on O'Connell Bridge so that we could process applications for grants from people in Clifden, Lettermore and Letterfrack in County Galway.  We pay an engineer to travel from Ballyhaunis to Clifden to inspect a house for a grant of £1,000 while, at the same time, there is an engineer employed by Galway County Council living in Clifden who will inspect that same house three times for planning permission and for the payment of a local authority loan.  Incidentally, that is paid by Galway County Council on an agency basis for the Department of the Environment. Yet, this Government and indeed the previous Government &mdash; there is no difference in this case &mdash; insist the another engineer must travel 70 or 80 miles to inspect that house.  The man employed by the Galway County Council will not be allowed to carry out the inspection despite the fact that he has already done so in respect of the payment of a £16,000 local authority loan.  Is it not time that we stopped this sham?  Is it not time for politicians to face up to the fact that by adding more paperwork to the system the payment of grants will be delayed.  The <Col N="1530" /> applicants come to us to speed up the procedure but because of the centralised system of the public service our input only serves to slow it down.</P>
    <P>I will cite another example of what happens in County Galway in respect of unemployment assistance.  The person concerned applies for this help in one room, the file has to be spent to Galway and then to Dublin before it is sent back to another room in the original building for the pension officer to decide on the eligibility of the applicant.  It is time for us to stop that sham.  It is time to decentralise the public service, to allow public servants to be responsible for their decisions and this is something they wish.  It is time for us to keep our noses out of many aspects of public service administration that are none of our business.  We in this House must be the catalysts for action in this area, a role that we have neglected very much up to now.</P>
    <P>While the Government have failed to curb current expenditure, they have attacked savagely the public capital programme.  Their approach reminds me of the story of a manager who was brought into a company to increase the profits and who at the end of his first year had achieved his objective simply by not engaging in any capital expenditure and by selling off as many assets as possible. The following year the company went into liquidation.  The figures in this year's public capital programme represent decreases in capital investment in the various sectors since 1980.  These decreases are 59 per cent at least in agriculture, 39 per cent in industry, 60 per cent in fisheries and 31 per cent in transport. These figures probably underestimate the position because they are based on estimates for 1986.  If the experience of 1985 is to be repeated when the provisional outturn for agriculture, industry and fisheries was less than the actual outturn, we may expect the Government again to tackle the public capital programme as opposed to the current capital programme.  It is interesting to note that the two areas of greatest growth in public investment &mdash; tourism and roads <Col N="1531" />&mdash; were the subject of the biggest increase in 1982 when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <P>Finally, I shall deal with the two areas that come within my ambit as a spokesman for my party, namely, youth affairs and sport.  In a recent article in a national newspaper the Minister of State at the Department of Labour was reported as saying that the national youth policy launched recently represents the single most valuable contribution by any Irish Government to the future of our young people.  That kind of statement indicates how much out of touch the Government are with the conditions in society for our young people.  The long awaited youth policy is a bitter disappointment for our young people.  It is comprised of many pious platitudes and makes no attempt to outline specific action in many vital areas affecting young people.  It is an insult to the army of unemployed and underemployed young people.  Their plight is totally ignored so far as the policy is concerned.</P>
    <P>It contains no proposal for the creation of long term sustainable employment but contains references to other generalisations such as the job creation targets of <i>Building on Reality</i> and the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  There is no reference in the policy to emigration, although between 45,000 and 60,000 of our young people have been forced to leave this country since the Coalition came into power in order to seek employment elsewhere. A youth policy which ignores the greatest problem of our young people cannot be regarded as serious in terms of attaining the Government's stated objectives of helping all young people to become self reliant and responsible and active participants in society.</P>
    <P>However, the publication of this document, together with the meagre financial provisions associated with it, is welcome. It brings to an end a three year wait during which time the Government have not taken any action to deal with the problems in this area.  Unfortunately, the great expectations of a new deal for young people which the comprehensive publication had created has evaporated <Col N="1532" /> on a close scrutiny of its provisions.  The insignificance of this policy document becomes clear when one considers it in the context of Government performance on youth affairs to date.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1981, Fine Gael promised a policy on youth affairs and that was to be an immediate priority in the event of the party being returned to Government in 1982.  After almost 12 months of Government inaction, a discussion document entitled &ldquo;Shaping the Future&rdquo; was launched.  It coincided with the establishment of a national youth policy committee who would make recommendations in respect of youth for consideration by the Government. Though we had already two comprehensive reports on youth affairs &mdash; a policy for youth and sport which was commissioned in 1977 by Deputy John Bruton and the O'Sullivan report commissioned by Jim Tunney in 1980&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  This committee which was chaired by Mr. Justice Costello was clearly a holding exercise on the Government's part, a wish simply to be seen to do something as another year passed.  The irony of this youth policy is that its central strategy, a national youth service based on the Costello recommendations, is a replica of the proposals of the O'Sullivan committee of 1980 with minor changes of emphasis.  Why, then, did the Government not implement the 1980 recommendations?  Why was it considered necessary to set up another committee? After 12 months work the Costello committee produced their report in September, 1983.  That was a comprehensive report and was launched by the Government as a massive public relations exercise.  We were assured then of an immediate Government response in the form of a Government youth policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Costello committee recommended that a fitting inauguration of International <Col N="1533" /> Youth Year, 1985, would be the announcement of the effective implementation of the first stage of the national youth policy.  Finally, the policy document arrived.  That was on the second last day of International Youth Year and 15 months after the Costello committee had reported.  The central strategy of the policy is the establishment of a national youth service.  In essence this means the establishment of an administrative structure involving new committees on a localised basis.  This may be an admirable objective, given the required finance which is estimated at £20 million, but to propose such a service as a central strategy in a Government policy in the absence of the necessary financial provisions will only cause further disillusionment among young people and among those who have dedicated their lives to helping them.</P>
    <P>What is not required in the immediate future is another administrative and bureaucratic structure, though that is what is now proposed.  Local agencies and youth organisations are only too well aware of their requirements.  What are required are the resources to meet those requirements. A developmental and innovative approach designed to complement and expand volunteerism with an input of professionalism, with proper support mechanisms, is required urgently for the provision of a comprehensive youth service. This will be the central strategy in Fianna Fáil's youth policy on our return to Government.  It will involve the support of existing youth organisations and structures where the massive reservoir of voluntary effort and goodwill needs to be supported and expanded with the employment of full time professional youth workers on the lines of the successful development officer concept and with a 100 per cent funding of salaries and expenses.</P>
    <P>Such a policy will involve also the provision of youth facilities throughout the country.  State provision of such facilities would be conditional on community involvement in youth affairs.  In this way the status of youth work would be raised. <Col N="1534" /> For example, if each of the 38,000 primary and post primary teachers as well as each of the 11,000 members of the Garda were to devote voluntarily one hour per week to youth work, there would be the equivalent of a total of 1,200 full time workers engaged 40 hours per week in this area.  Undoubtedly the goodwill for this kind of arrangement exists among those professions.  It is already very much in evidence.  All that is required is an innovative and a motivating approach to harness that resource. This Government are long on reports, promises, discussions and philosophy, but they are short in terms of a commitment to positive action.</P>

      <P>The Government accept the serious error three years ago of transferring youth affairs to the Department of Labour and they have now returned that area to Education where yet another new structure has been established, namely, the community, education and training division.  This, together with three further committees at various levels and with the local youth service boards, indicates that the Government are not in any way short on committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important aspect of the youth policy was expected to be in the form of a series of initiatives to assist deprived and disadvantaged young people.  The Costello committee dealt extensively with this facet of youth affairs.  It made many very worthwhile recommendations. However, the Government response is miserable.  Their policy fails to signify an attack on the causes of juvenile delinquency, particularly in inner city areas.  There are no proposals to tackle the root cause of crime and vandalism in Dublin's inner city, namely poverty, unemployment, poor education, school truancy, bad accommodation and recreational facilities.  They failed to implement a series of measures which are urgently required to deal with drug abuse, such as the improvement of <Col N="1535" /> customs and immigration controls, the provision of custodial centres for drug treatment and the provision of detoxification and rehabilitation facilities for young people in prison.  The only definite provision was for a bed facility in the new Beaumont hospital.  Let us hope it opens soon.</P>
    <P>On the question of the young offender, the policy contains the same kind of generalisations which characterise the policy of this Government.  It is stated that the Government are determined to bring about improvements in the juvenile justice system and as part of their youth policy relevant Government Departments will be required to formulate appropriate proposals for consideration. That is the kind of statement one would expect from a group of people expecting to come into Government in five years time.  One would have expected this policy to contain specific proposals of a preventive nature from a Government who have been three years in office, faced with an increasing army of young offenders.  Measures which should have been included in a Government youth policy include proposals for the extension of the range of services to make probation an effective alternative to prison, the provision of probationary and aftercare hostels, the employment of adequate numbers of school attendance officers, the expansion of the juvenile liaison officer system and the probation and welfare service and, especially, the increase of the age of criminal responsibility to 15 and the provision of a juvenile court system.  These are all urgent requirements and they should be included in Government youth policy.</P>
    <P>The policy document's provision for homeless young people is passed to the health boards who do not have the financial resources to provide their current range of services.  There is no commitment to provide the health boards with the required finance to provide for the homeless.  The provision for homeless young people reaches a cynical level with the information that voluntary bodies can qualify for a £16,000 SDA loan to provide <Col N="1536" /> shelter and accommodation.  The policy on young travellers and the young disabled is merely a restatement of existing policies, many of which are waiting to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with young people in working life is a most disappointing aspect of the report.  There are numerous initiatives which could be taken in 1986 which would lead to the creation of thousands of long-term sustainable jobs.  I want to spell out a number of those initiatives. In the context of the provision of only £2 million in the budget, many of the areas needing urgent attention will have to be seriously neglected.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to take note of the initiatives for employment. First I would suggest the extension of the 10 per cent manufacturing corporation tax to the entire international service industry to entice foreign banking and re-insurance companies to create many prestigious jobs.  One simple statistic bears out the potential in that sector &mdash; 0.1 of 1 per cent of worldwide re-insurance premiums is equal to the balance of payments deficit two years ago. If we could attract even that small amount of re-insurance business it would cancel out the balance of payments deficit two years ago.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the 1983 IDA report on consumer foods and ideas for development should be considered immediately by the Government.  This would follow the appointment of a Minister for food who would co-ordinate and streamline all the agencies involved in food production, manufacturing and marketing with a view to exploiting the vast potential that exists for the added-value manufacture and sale of the finest agricultural products in the world.</P>

      <P>I would advocate the promotion of job creation through the existing small industries sector by incentives for product research and development, export sales programmes, transportation subsidies to European markets and market research.  The small firms association represents 800 firms with expansion potential, given adequate support rather than the regressive environment in which they operate at present.  There are many other areas which can contribute to worthwhile employment creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Millions are being squandered on a series of youth employment schemes, many of which only cause further disillusionment among young people before their eventual emigration.  Temporary schemes have an important but limited role to play.  They must be streamlined and replaced with economic employment proposals.  The transition from school to youth and work training must be geared towards the filling of sustainable jobs. There should be proposals for the provision of cheaper car insurance for young people, the provision of affordable <Col N="1538" /> homes and an adequate scheme for the provision of mortgage finance.  There should be incentive schemes for saving and investment and a &ldquo;start your own business&rdquo; package.  I had hoped that this budget would contain some of those proposals to give young people a break and prevent them from having to leave the country.  Sadly this Government take no interest in those areas which should be to the forefront.  This Coalition Government have again failed to recognise the emergence of a vicious two class society. There is now a striking gap between the haves and the have nots, with an alarming increase in the latter group.</P>
    <P>The Government have succeeded in making youth affairs the greatest talk shop in recent years.  The publication of their recent youth policy has raised this to new status.  There will be no further reports or committees when Fianna Fáil return to office.  There will be actions based on solutions to the glaring problems facing young people.  Our policy proposals will be costed and, realising the severe limitations on our new Government in increasing public expenditure, the cost effectiveness and the return on investment to the economy will be a significant factor in our proposals.  There will be a redirection of current expenditure which is being wasted by this Government in so many areas.  It will be expended on preventive measures rather than fire brigade actions, of which Spike Island is a particular example.  This is the basis of our youth programme.</P>
    <P>I might mention the question of sport dealt with in detail in the budget.  As Opposition spokesman on sport I must say that the Government's handling of sport has constituted a miserable performance. On many occasions they have endeavoured to do a con job.  For example, in the current public capital programme they increased the provision for sport by 19 per cent and then, in the budget, withdrew that money, an effort having been made on their part to be seen to increase the level of expenditure on sport.  The therapeutic and health care benefit deriving from sport necessitates <Col N="1539" /> investment which can yield a good return. All Governments to date have tended to regard sport as having competitive benefits only.  It is my intention that sport be given a new status.  At the next general election, I will be putting to the electorate for the first time ever on the part of any political party a comprehensive policy on the development of sport throughout society.</P>
    <P>I have today attempted to point out the desperate disappointment, indeed the desperate problems this budget and its provisions will occasion.  This Government appear to be determined to continue in office for another year.  One thing is quite clear.  They can continue as long as they wish but it has now become evident that the electrorate are fed up and feel their time is up.</P>

Tá mé cinnte go n-aithneoidh gach éinne go bhfuil dea-job déanta ag an Aire.</P>
      <P>This is the 25th budget debate in which I have had the honour to participate since I became a Member of this House in 1961.  It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Minister for Finance.  I believe he has done a very good job in the preparation of this budget.  He has succeeded despite tremendous difficulties, external difficulties arising from the world economic recession and those arising from the appalling financial mess he inherited when he assumed office in December 1982.  If one is to judge from the reactions of the various commentators it seems evident that most people recognise that this budget package represents the best possible one that could have been devised taking into account all of the circumstances with which the Minister was confronted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> The Minister made it clear in his Budget Statement that he was determined to do some of the things people had been calling on the Government to do for quite some time past.  For example, it was essential in this budget that the Minister for Finance should give practical recognition to the problem of the appalling, almost intolerable, burden of taxation on the PAYE sector.  The Minister has recognised that fact and given them valuable and very welcome concessions. The Minister has also, very wisely &mdash; particularly in view of the need to generate economic activity and to boost our economy &mdash; recognised the need of one most important sector of our economy, the tourist industry, which in 1985 made a valuable contribution to the reduction of our balance of payments deficit and to job creation.  As a Member who has been interested in tourism for many years, I want to place on record my appreciation of the fact that the Minister has given valuable concessions with regard to VAT in relation to the catering, food and restaurant trade.  I am convinced that this concession will act as a significant boost to the tourist industry and that we can look forward this year to this important component of our economy achieving new targets and records.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the positive aspects of the budget.  For example, I welcome its special provisions for sporting and other organisations.  While the previous speaker made a constructive contribution, I must deplore his attack on the Minister for Finance.  In his concluding remarks he advocated the need for an active sports policy.  I am delighted that the Minister has found it possible to give very valuable allocations to our major sporting organisations.  When I see the list of organisations, voluntary and others, I am particularly glad to note those who have received special allocations under the provisions of this budget.</P>
    <P>I welcome particularly the increased financial assistance given to what the Minister described in his statement as voluntary organisations engaged in promoting cross-Border co-operation.  On the occasion of the debate on the AngloIrish <Col N="1541" /> Agreement in this House some months ago I drew the attention of the House to the tremendous practical work being done by such organisations as Co-operation North.  This gesture on the part of the Minister should act as an encouragement to Co-operation North and other organisations endeavouring to break down barriers, create better understanding, an atmosphere of goodwill and understanding on both sides of the Border.  They undertake very valuable work.  I am delighted the Government found it possible to give practical recognition to their work and help them by substantially increasing their subvention.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Government and the Minister for Finance have recognised the many voluntary organisations engaged in projects in the social services area.  There has been tremendous growth in the number of voluntary organisations who engage in a wide variety of what the Minister described as social service activities.  It is only proper that such voluntary efforts should be supplemented or receive subvention by way of State funds.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has given an extra grant to the Arts Council.  While being in favour of the promotion of the arts, I want to ensure that the Arts Council will not be entirely orientated towards the metropolis, that they will not be completely hamstrung by a pseudo-intellectual type policy.  I want the Arts Council to realise that very important groups and organisations in various parts of the country are making a very valuable contribution to the arts.  I have a particular interest in Siamsa Tíre, the National Folk Theatre, to whom I had the privilege of according State recognition in 1975 when they became the National Folk Theatre. I hope the Arts Council will bear in mind the importance of the work of Siamsa Tíre and will assist them in every way possible.</P>
    <P>Naturally as a Limerick man I welcome the grant of £100,000 for the Limerick Civic Trust.  This is another example of outstanding civic spirit and voluntary effort which I am pleased indeed the <Col N="1542" /> Government have recognised.  I have noted with delight the fact that the Government have recognised the work of the emigrant welfare organisations in the UK.  In my 25 years as a Member of the Dáil I have had many an opportunity of going to England and being a guest of many Irish organisations, and I have become very familiar with what has come to be known as the emigrant problem.  I am delighted that this Government last year and again this year have recognised the need for practical assistance in the way of financial help and other assistance that should be given to many voluntary organisations in the tremendous work they do.  I have seen them in Birmingham, Liverpool and London.  I have spoken on this in many debates down through the years advocating State assistance for these organisations.  Let me say how pleased I am that a further subvention is now being given.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a thugann an-áthas domsa mar Iar-Aire na Gaeltachta ná go bhfeicim go bhfuil deontas ar leith tugtha ag an Aire do chomharchumann Rath Cairn sa Ghaeltacht bheag sin i gContae na Mí. Fáiltím roimhe sin mar tá sé 50 bliain anois ó bunaíodh an Ghaeltacht bheag sin.  Is cuimhin liom go maith na laethanta a chaith mé mar Aire na Gaeltachta; bhí teagmháil leanúnach agamsa le muintir Rath Cairn.  Bhí sé de phribhléid agamsa tionscail nua a oscailt go hoifigiúil ann agus ionaid phobail nua a oscailt go hoifigiúil i rith na mblianta sin.  Tá ard mholadh tuillte ag muintir Rath Cairn as ucht an tslí in ar éirigh le pobal beag mar sin an teanga agus cultúr na hÉireann a choimead beo.  Déanaim comhghairdeas leo agus aontaím go hiomlán leis an éacht atá déanta ag an Aire, is é sin deontas fial a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>There is an unfortunate but perhaps understandable tendency to consider the annual budget from a purely narrow, personal perspective, to look at the taxation provisions and price increases <i>per se</i>, without taking into account the underlying fiscal and economic strategy.  The budget is, of course, the major instrument of the Government's economic policy, and any consideration of an <Col N="1543" /> annual budget must place special emphasis on economic development and job creation.  Despite the continuing economic recession this Government have a commendable record of progress on the economic front.  I reject totally the contention of the previous speaker from the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to the performance of the Minister and of this Government.</P>
    <P>I have some figures here which illustrate the very real progress made by this Government on the economic front.  For example, during 1985 gross domestic product rose over 2 per cent.  For the first time in several years the volume of both personal consumption and fixed investment increased.  There was another substantial reduction in the rate of inflation from 8.5 per cent in 1984 to under 5 per cent now.  This reduction in the rate of inflation to a level which is now in line with that of our major competing countries represents a remarkable achievement unparalleled in any other EC country.  During the lifetime of the present Government inflation has been brought down from 20 per cent to 4.5 per cent.  Time and time again over the years in the European Parliament I have heard speaker after speaker, from Germany, Holland and elsewhere say that inflation was the mother of unemployment and the cause of all economic ills.  By any criteria and in the European context the Government must be congratulated and any fairminded person must realise that this reduction of inflation from 20 per cent down to 4.5 per cent in the space of three years is a tremendous achievement. This is significant also for the future.  Naturally, as a country dependent on foreign trading in relation to exports, tourism and so forth, the dramatic reduction in the rate of inflation must have a major input into our cost competitiveness and into the economy and economic development and progress in 1986 and in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As well as the decrease in inflation, there has been a further improvement in both the external trade and overall balance of payments.  The trade account <Col N="1544" /> moved into a surplus in 1985 for the first time in 40 years.  The overall balance of payments deficit fell to around 3 per cent of GDP.  That is the best outturn for ten years.  Therefore, it is quite obvious that the economic and fiscal policies pursued by this Government over the past three years are now beginning to produce results.  These facts and figures cannot be contradicated.  They are official figures in relation to inflation; exports and balance of trade are the acid test in relation to the balance of payments and prove clearly that the fiscal and economic policies pursued by this Government are beginning to work.</P>
    <P>The underlying strategy in the Minister's budget for 1986 comes through from a study of his speech introducing the budget which reveals that he is bearing in mind the need for a more equitable taxation code and the need to cushion the underprivileged and weaker sections of our community which has been done by increases in the various areas of social welfare.  There is also need to reduce the deficit and to try to set the country on a more easy course, fiscally, financially, economically and so forth.  I am very pleased indeed to be able to pay tribute to Deputy Alan Dukes, Minister for Finance. He has borne the heat and brunt of the day over the past three years.  He has been unfairly maligned.  In my 25 years here on both sides of the House I have seen different Ministers for Finance. Deputy Dukes has worked patiently, hard and pair stakingly trying to clear up the horrible mess he inherited and which resulted from squandermania and massive borrowing in the years from 1977 to 1981 and was the price the people had to pay for the manifesto of 1977.  In the light of the progress that is now beginning to be perceived clearly, particularly in relation to the growth in exports, the growth in tourism to this country, and in relation to the balance of payments and the balance of trade, the prospects are looking better than they have done for a long time.  It has often been said that we are looking for a light at the end of a dark tunnel but in view of this budget, the Minister's speech and the <Col N="1545" /> strategies underlying the budget, I clearly believe that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that we can look forward to further progress next year and in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>While giving due credit to the Minister and the Government for the progress made, nevertheless we must be honest and recognise that unemployment remains the most serious problem facing the nation.  While one must acknowledge the efforts and strategy of the Government in job creation and their achievements in bringing down inflation and securing a favourable balance of trade and of payments, one must face up to the plain, blunt fact that new strategies are urgently needed if we are to make any worthwhile impact on the frightening unemployment problem.  The Minister adverted to this and recognised that unemployment is the real problem.  He pointed out that there were indications that the rate of unemployment was beginning to stabilise.  However, we must be honest in relation to the problems confronting us.</P>
    <P>There is a responsibility placed not merely on the Government but on Deputies on all sides of the House to look at the present situation.  Unemployment is not just an evil in itself but an underlying cause of many other social ills in our society today.  It is the worst form of social injustice and all the energies of the Government, all political parties and all sections of our people must be directed to finding solutions to the great social cancer of unemployment.  We cannot afford the luxury of unproductive and divisive confrontation, for example, confrontation between Church and State, between employer and trade union, between farmer and non-farmer.  Nor can we afford ideological argument and debate involving the media and politicians on all sides.  We must generate a national consensus that unemployment is the most serious social evil confronting the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the various employment, special, youth and incentive schemes.  We have the Industrial Development Authority, SFADCo and <Col N="1546" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The time has now come for serious stock to be taken of the role and functions of the various organisations. There is a need for great co-ordination in the activities of the various State organisations.  I say in all sincerity, in no way as direct or indirect criticism of the Government, that there must be a crusade against unemployment.  I would go so far as to say that there should be some form of national forum in which all parties in this House would participate and where the social partners and all sections of the people would be represented. While acknowledging the tremendous difficulties facing this Government when they came into office in 1982 and paying tribute to the Minister for Finance on his tackling of these problems and congratulating him on his achievements which are now beginning to be perceived we must tackle the problem of growing unemployment with new strategies and new determination.</P>
    <P>Every member of the EC has been faced with these problems.  The European Parliament have produced many reports on unemployment and there have been many debates on the subject.  There is no easy answer to the problem.  Progress can be made provided the appropriate strategies are now formulated.  I have been a very vigorous advocate and supporter of the proposal to establish the National Development Corporation for that reason.  There are very major and perhaps exciting possibilities for the intervention of a State body such as this corporation in the development of agriculture, food processing, fisheries and fish processing, afforestation and our other natural resources.</P>
    <P>While we succeeded very well in the sixties and seventies in attracting foreign investment into this country, because of the world economic recession the flow of foreign investment has slowed down to a trickle.  The countries from which we had succeeded in attracting industries were hit by the recession and were not investing abroad.  The outcome has been the creation of great difficulty.  The IDA have been subjected to enormous criticism, most of it unfair, because of the fact that <Col N="1547" /> they put up advance factories which were not utilised.  They had a very difficult job to do.  We cannot rely to the extent that we have done on foreign investment to create the needed jobs to bring us to full employment.</P>
    <P>We have the youngest population in western Europe.  We must rely on our own natural resources and tourism.  It is in these areas that future hope lies for job creation.  I hope that the National Development Corporation will be brought into being as quickly as possible. I do not know what stage the legislation has reached, but if there is to be a further delay I would ask the Minister to seriously consider establishing the corporation on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  There are precedents for this among other State bodies.  I hope no opportunity or further time will be lost in getting to grips with our massive unemployment, which is now frightening.  It can only be tackled through a new national consensus, a national drive, mobilising all the human resources we have.</P>
    <P>We must look at the budget as the major implement of Government economic policy, and employment is the acid test of any economic policy.  However, we must not overlook the fact that national plans and policies must be implemented at local level.  SFADCo in the mid-western region have been an outstanding regional development agency who have blazed trails for regional development. They have been subjected to a considerable amount of criticism.  I am worried about this, because having had 25 years experience of dealing with SFADCo.  I am very proud of their achievements.  That type of agency is now recognised in the EC as the ideal means to promote economic development and social progress in undeveloped regions. In their programme to reform local government I hope the Government will look at SFADCo as a model for similar development agencies, particularly in the four western seaboard regions.</P>
    <P>During budget discussions in any national Parliament of EC member states one must consider fiscal and economic <Col N="1548" /> policies and budgetary strategies and take into account the fact that many of the decisions nowadays which affect the well being of our people and of our country are not taken in this national Parliament or by our own national Government but in the corridors of power in Brussels. Ireland has been a substantial beneficiary from the EC.  There are various agricultural instruments, there is the regional fund, the social fund and the EIB, which have made substantial contributions to the provision of infrastructure, the development of industry and the creation of employment here.  I have no doubt that, when arriving at their final budget presentation, the Government took into account the projected income from the various EC instruments.  One of them which is vitally important to Ireland and which in 1985 gave more than £100 million by way of grants to Ireland, is the regional development fund.  Many projects in operation throughout the country such as construction, infrastructural progress and many industries, would not have been possible if half the cost had not been provided by the regional fund. However, there have been major changes in the administration and the thinking of the regional fund.  This is important from the point of view of the Minister for Finance who has special responsibility for the submission of applications for grant and from the regional fund.</P>
    <P>Until now a simple system was operating, that the regional fund financed projects of a wide variety of application. Since 1 January 1985 a new strategy has been in being.  The emphasis is now on programmed planning on a regional basis.  Instead of submitting applications for a bridge here, or a water scheme there, or a road here, or an industry there, regions are encouraged to formulate multi-annual programmes, covering four or five years, involving all aspects of development.  This methodology has been applied to the Mediterranean countries and a massive input of finance has been given to these countries for what are called integrated Mediterranean programmes. Those of us who come from the northern periphery areas are very <Col N="1549" /> concerned and worried about this because we believe these areas are in need of special attention, particularly this island.</P>
    <P>Last September I tabled a motion in the European Parliament calling on the Commission to look at the problems of the northern periphery areas, particularly Ireland, to try to get the integrated Mediterranean programmes applied here.  I am am very pleased that the EC Parliament passed the motion to the Regional Policy Committee who agreed to have a special report prepared on Ireland.  I am glad that John Hume has been appointed rapporteur to have the report implemented. In the next six or eight months John Hume will be preparing a major report for the Regional Policy Committee on regional development in Ireland.  I hope that report will be implemented by the EC Parliament.  If we are to do anything about unemployment we must look at overall regional plans here.  We have not and will never have a regional policy here.  There is a dire need for it.  We badly need a multi-annual programme for each region, a comprehensive programme for broad comprehensive development. SFADCo is a model which could be copied and applied in the north-west, west and south-west.  Local authorities will have to be directly involved in the implementation of such programmes.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag caint ar Ghaeltacht Rath Cairn, chuir mé fáilte roimh an deontas a cuireadh ar fáil do mhuintir na duiche sin as ucht an deá-obair atá déanta acu chun an teanga a choimeád beo.  Mar iar-Aire na Gaeltachta, ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do na Gaeltachtaí ar fad agus do theanga agus chultúr na hÉireann go ginearálta.  Tá brón orm maidir le staid na Gaeilge faoí láthair.  Ní thuigim na h-argóintí agus an míthuiscint atá ar siúl.  Bhí imní mhór orm nuair a chónaic mé an clár &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; ar Thelefis Éireann le déanaí agus nuair a chuala mé an méid a bhí le rá acu maidir leis an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>The Gaeltacht is only of concern to those of us who have some knowledge of the Irish language.  The Gaeltacht is the source of our language and culture.  I <Col N="1550" /> welcome the special grant to the people of Rath Cairn Gaeltacht in County Meath which has now been established for 50 years.  This small community has made a remarkable contribution towards keeping our language and culture alive. During my period as Minister for the Gaeltacht I visited Rath Cairn on a number of occasions.  I recall opening a major industry there in 1974 and going back there a year or two later to open a fine community centre.  I congratulate the Minister and the people of Rath Cairn on their efforts.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the national approach to the Gaeltacht's language and our culture.  I was appalled by a recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme and the manner in which the Gaeltacht was portrayed. It was not the first time it happened. I deplore this attempt to denigrate our Gaeltacht, our language and our national culture.  Despite the fact that we face enormous economic problems we must not lose sight of the fact that cultural development is an important element of national development.  I do not know why attempts are being made to portray the Gaeltacht as being a place where industries start and then fold up, and there is very little reference to the tremendous success stories in the Gaeltacht.  There have been successes in projects developing our natural resources, such as fish farming and so on.  More jobs were lost in Ferenka in my constituency, and at a bigger cost to the State, than have been lost in the Gaeltacht in the last ten or 15 years.  I hope that the media will present the real facts and a balanced picture in future and will not subject the people of the Gaeltacht to gross misrepresentation of the facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister demonstrated his commitment to the Gaeltacht not merely by grant aiding this Gaeltacht.  I know the Minister to be a man with a deep interest in the language, who speaks it at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this budget has done the best possible job considering the circumstances which confronted him.  I am very happy with the economic strategies <Col N="1551" /> that have been pursued by the Government over the past three years and which are now beginning to show signs of bearing fruit.  There has been a dramatic reduction in inflation.  No other country in the European Community has had such success in reducing inflation.  Inflation is an enormous problem, a major inhibiting factor to investment, enterprise, exports and so on.  The balance of trade and the balance of payments are important yardsticks by which one can measure the progress of an economy.  These show signs of real progress.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget strategy has recognised the problems of the PAYE taxpayer by granting reliefs and he has given a boost to the tourist industry by reducing VAT.  The Minister did not forget the poorer sections as social welfare increases have also been granted.  In recognising the problems of unemployment the Minister made no false claims. Previous speakers tried to accuse the Minister of not stating the facts but the one thing Deputy Alan Dukes has done at all times is to state the facts.  The Minister told the truth in recognising the unemployment problem about which we are all concerned.  Every day we see more and more young well educated people without jobs.  We cannot provide jobs overnight.  We must look at unemployment in a new light and assess our physical and human resources.  We must look at the employment agencies and we must establish the NDC.  More important, the Taoiseach, backed by the Government, the Opposition and the social partners, must launch a national crusade to generate enthusiasm that will lead to an accelerated rate of job creation.

      <P>The budget has been analysed by everybody as a complete failure. The points made by the last speaker about the Minister for Finance are totally inaccurate because Deputy Dukes as Minister for Finance in the last three years was responsible for the major <Col N="1552" /> increase in our level of unemployment. He had a golden opportunity in the budgets he introduced to bring forward measures that would create the right environment for job creation.  There is nothing in the budget introduced last week that will create any jobs.  Ministers of the various Departments have been telling us since last week where the job losses and cut-backs will occur.  For example, the Minister for Health on Thursday announced the closure of eight hospitals.  That will result in the loss of many jobs and a curtailment of the services for many patients.  Today the Minister for Education announced the closure of Carysfort College of Education, a major blow to a college that has been training teachers for more than 100 years. Every day Ministers announce closures and the removal of services from the public.  Many Government Deputies are trembling because they fear the loss of their seats due to the inability of the Government to bring forward policies that will create the right environment for job creation.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to emphasise that 240,000 people are unemployed.  A Government that fail to deal with such a crisis which gets worse daily do not deserve to be allowed to remain in office.  The Government, if they had the best interests of the country at heart, would face the electorate with their policies for the next four or five years.</P>

      <P>I am asked when it will be possible to remove the Government who have been responsible for the loss of so many jobs in the last three years.  I hope that in the next few weeks we will be presented with opportunities that will give Government Deputies the chance to vote against the Government and bring them down like a pack of cards.</P>
      <P>The Government have lost their sense of direction.  Many people described the Government as being like the <i>Titanic</i> sailing towards an iceberg with a captain who is unable to guide it through the troubled waters.  We realise that people are changing the deck chairs in an effort to improve their situation but at the end of the day we know what will happen to the country if the Coalition are allowed to continue on their present course.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday the Minister for Health announced in a cold, callous and uncaring manner the closure of eight hospitals in 1986.  The hospitals due for closure include St. Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital, Castlerea.  That announcement has evoked massive opposition in my constituency which covers Roscommon and part of Galway.  That callous announcement was made without any consultation with the Western Health Board, the staff of the hospital, the patients or their relatives. The first those people heard of the move was on the Radio 15 p.m. news bulletin.  People in the country are united in their opposition to the Minister's plan. Yesterday, at a meeting of Roscommon County Council, a motion was passed condemning the Minister's actions and calling on him to withdraw the closure announcement in regard to St. Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital.  At a meeting of the Roscommon local health committee and the Western Health Board there was unanimous opposition to the Minister's decision.  Fianna Fáil will be tabling a motion before the Dáil, in the name of our spokesman on Health, and other Members, calling on the Minister to engage in full consultations with the health board and interested parties and to withdraw his closure decision pending such negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no justification for the closure <Col N="1554" /> of St. Patrick's.  At present 250 patients are resident in the hospital and 700 patients living among the community are served by 170 nurses based in the hospital. Those nurses provide a 24-hour seven-day service throughout the year for the most deprived people in our society. Those who are psychiatrically or mentally ill are the most deprived people in our society.  They do not have any voice in elections because they are not permitted to vote and they do not have any real power.  We have a responsibility to speak on their behalf.  The patients are sad and anxious following the Minister's announcement. They are able to comprehend what the closure will mean to them.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was caring and sympathetic he would be concerned about the welfare of those patients.  Ultimately, he is the person responsible for the care and welfare of all patients in institutions.  Was it proper to announce the closure of that hospital without consultations?  Does the Minister realise that the hospital caters for a population of more than 54,000 people and that there are three consultant psychiatrists on the staff?  Is the Minister aware that 107 patients in the hospital are over 65 years of age and that 55 patients have been resident in the hospital for between 30 and 65 years?  The Minister should appreciate that the families of those people may not be in a position to provide facilities for them.  We must be fundamentally concerned about the welfare of the patients involved, sensitive and deprived people who are totally dependent on the medical, nursing and back-up staff for their lives.  Now, without any consultation with the Western Health Board, the nursing staff or the unions, the Minister has decided on this closure.  This decision is opposed by everyone in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The Castlerea community have set up a very active action committee who will take whatever steps are necessary in this House through their Deputies and in the Seanad through their Senators, in the county council and, if necessary, through the law courts to prevent closure of this hospital.  The hospital was built in 1934 and occupied in 1940.  Between 1940 and <Col N="1555" /> 1948 it was used as a psychiatric hospital. From 1948 to 1955, at the request of the then Minister for Health, Dr. Noel Browne, the hospital was requisitioned for the care of TB patients.  It reverted to a psychiatric hospital in 1955.  It is set in open countryside in beautiful surroundings, is well maintained and has a farm which is in a position to provide a high percentage of the food required.  It is an excellent facility which the Minister has decided to close down without any prior consultation.</P>
    <P>The pshchiatric, nursing and other staff are prepared to consider every possible new development in the care and treatment of psychiatric patients.  They embarked on the provision of secure homes in different towns throughout County Roscommon and provided for patients who were mentally in a position to be cared for in the community.  They also embarked on home care and home visits, consultation and advice and in 1984 over 1,500 people sought the advice and help of the nursing and medical staff of the hospital.  The people in the area are not against progress but it is not progress to close down an institution which is vitally necessary for caring for mentally ill patients.  We must fight this decision and we appeal to Deputies on the Government side to oppose any legislation which would give a Minister power to close a hospital.  I also wish to remind the Minister that the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1985, is now before the House and its provisions will give the Minister power to close any hospital.  We oppose this Bill because its passing will mean the death knell for many hospitals, including one in your constituency, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We appeal to Deputies who might have influence on the Government side of the House to ensure that the Bill will never be debated and will be withdrawn forthwith.</P>
    <P>We have no confidence in the Minister for Health.  This was a Government decision and, therefore, we call on the Taoiseach to intervene to ensure that the decision is withdrawn and that full consultations <Col N="1556" /> will take place with the Western Health Board and the medical and nursing staff to discuss the development of psychiatric services in County Roscommon and the surrounding area.  There should not be a phasing out of this hospital because of the number of people seeking psychiatric care.  In 1985 and 1986 I came across a degree of mental instability and associated problems due to pressure caused by unemployment.  There are now so many people unemployed that there is immense pressure on them.  It is a psychological problem which will result in a higher demand for the formal psychiatric services which have been provided so ably in County Roscommon over the years by St. Patrick's Hospital.</P>
    <P>I have experienced at first hand the difficulties which people have in relation to repayment of loans which is putting immense pressure on couples.  This is not the time to close hospitals and it is certainly not the time to close the hospital in Castlerea.  Apart from the medical side, the social and economic consequences must also be considered.  There are social implications when families are not given an opportunity of visiting their most deprived family members in an area near their homes.  With regard to the economic side, the closure will result in a direct loss of 250 jobs in an area which has massive unemployment.  The number of people at present on unemployment benefit is 356.  There are 584 people on unemployment assistance and there are 50 on credited contributions, a total of 990 people.  There are 536 people in receipt of smallholders's allowance.  The total number of people signing on in Castlerea is 1,526 including the catchment area.  There is 31,233 sq. ft. of empty factory space and 18.5 acres of development land owned by the IDA which is lying dormant.  There have been major closures over the last number of years and the automation of the telephone service has also caused job losses.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the closure of the hospital will cause a loss of revenue of £4 million to Castlerea and the surrounding district.  It is also estimated that each of the 250 employees has four dependants <Col N="1557" /> which means that there will be 1,000 affected by the Minister's decision.  This should be taken into consideration especially at a time of unemployment. The Government have taken no initiatives to create jobs in the constituency of Roscommon-Galway since they came into office in 1982.</P>
    <P>At this stage my constituency is in a very dangerous economic position.  The closure of a major institution has very serious repercussions for my county.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to formally reply to the Minister's announcement.  I call on the Taoiseach, the Minister and the rest of the Government to withdraw the proposal to close the hospital in Castlerea.  I ask him to enter into meaningful discussions with the Western Health Board, the staff associations and all involved in the development of psychiatric services in the Castlerea and County Roscommon area. Any future developments should take place on a phased basis and people should be aware of what is happening in the area.  The Minister's actions must be condemned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had all but completed my contribution the last evening and there is just one aspect of the Bill about which I want to say anything. On the last occasion I said that despite the very grandiose Long Title of the Bill it is a much more limited measure that one might believe.  For example, despite its claims and pretentions to do <Col N="1558" /> all sorts of things relating to the law on robbery and burglary, the Bill does not address these subjects, good bad or indifferent, for a very good reason.  That is, that the legislation in that area has already been amended.</P>
      <P>There is one substantial area which the Bill does address, and it is an area of importance and those responsible for the Bill deserve credit for addressing themselves to this issue, and that is receiving stolen property.  We are all aware that the level of larcenies, burglaries and robberies is appallingly high.  The fact that there has been a reduction in the last year is welcome but we would all like to see that graph dip much more sharply.  We all accept that one very effective way of getting after those engaged in larceny, burglary or robbery is to make it unprofitable for them to engage in that activity. A very effective way to do that is to make it difficult and unprofitable to engage in receiving stolen goods.</P>
      <P>I agree with the premise behind the Bill that the law relating to receiving stolen property is quite inadequate.  It is inadequate for a number of reasons: first, because it is complex; second, because it is based on the complex definition of stealing, section 2 of the Larceny Act; and, third, because of the obligation to establish that someone received the goods knowing them to have been stolen. Given the nature of Irish society and, in particular, given our economic links with Northern Ireland, it is very easy for someone found with goods which subsequently transpired to have been stolen, and even found with such goods in suspicious circumstances, to say he never knew they were stolen.  Perhaps if pressed he might say he had his doubts but he never knew they were stolen.  Under the present legislation that person might reasonably expect to be acquitted.  I accept &mdash; and I take it this is the view of the draftsmen of this measure &mdash; that such an arrangement is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned Northern Ireland for this reason.  Frequently the evidence that will be available to suggest improper acquisition of the goods will be the fact that the <Col N="1559" /> goods were acquired in unusual circumstances or at below market price.  If one receives a fur coat for a price way below the market value in most situations people would be expected to start asking questions, but the fact that there is such a volume of cross-Border activity means that this person might say she thought the coat might have been smuggled or she knew there was a question mark over it but she never thought it was stolen. That is an unsatisfactory situation and must be addressed.  But attempts to address this problem have been less than happy.</P>
    <P>I commented earlier on the rather incongruous approach adopted by the draftsmen of copying the British legislation. It seems to be a peculiar way for someone who, I understand, holds himself out as being on the republican wing of a republican party, to simply take sections, lock stock and barrel from a British statute and insert them into a very old statute which operates here.  It is a particularly odd way to proceed given the fact that the British Act was passed in 1968 and the comparable legislation in Northern Ireland was enacted in 1969.  A very substantial volume of case law has built up on how that section has been interpreted by the British and Northern Ireland courts.  The courts of both jurisdictions would be of persuasive authority were we to accept the suggestion of the draftsman to incorporate an identical provision.  In those circumstances one might reasonably have expected the draftsman to have taken into account developments in the British and Northern Ireland courts given that they have been interpreting sections with the identical words we are now being asked to include in our legislation.  But that has not been done and the problems, weaknesses and defects that have been identified have not been addressed.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas in which the approach adopted is inadequate.  I have already said that our present legislation, with its requirement that one takes the goods knowing them to have been stolen, is not a happy one; but it is proposed to replace that with &ldquo;knowing or <Col N="1560" /> believing&rdquo;.  This is a step &mdash; no one can say other than that &mdash; but it is a very limited step because in many of the situations I was posing the person will have no positive belief that the goods were stolen.  It may be that if he addressed himself to the question he might have good reason to believe they were stolen, but he may choose for good reason not to address the question one way or the other: he has no views on where the property came from and he does not have any interest in where it came from.  That, I suggest, is probably the most common state of mind of those who find themselves acquiring stolen property.</P>
    <P>The other area in which the legislation seems inadequate is where it purports to deal with the offence of receiving stolen property without dealing with the basic offence of stealing.  If we do not address that question, then everything else becomes a very unhappy attempt to shore up what is already a leaking vessel.  The draftsman was obviously aware of that and he had a second bite at it in the latter half of section 4; but the attempt to recover from the failure to address the basic definition of theft and larceny fails miserably.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this measure does not do what it purports to do.  It is useful in so far as it focuses our attention on one inadequacy in our law, and that is the area relating to stolen goods.  I welcome the indication of the Minister that he will legislate in this area.  The experience we have gained already from the attempts to respond to burglaries and robberies indicates that what is required at this stage is a radical root and branch approach in the whole area of offences against property and that any attempt to tinker around with it will do more harm than good.  While I am sure the motives of the Opposition in this case were admirable, I do not believe that what they propose represents any improvement in the capacity of the Garda Síochána to deal with this scourge.  On that basis, I think the House should have little to do with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ten minutes I have been listening to the Minister of State he has contradicted himself on a number of occasions.  I find it rather strange that a Minister of State in 1986 does not see the urgent need to improve a situation that has been allowed to continue for far too long and which has deteriorated at an alarming rate.  It is silly for a Minister of State to condemn our party with our Republican tradition for taking some sections from an English Act.  It is silly and childish in the extreme for a person who has been Minister of State for three years to make such a point. One expects more maturity from a person holding that position.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State first accepted that what we were proposing was a limited step forward but he finished by saying our Bill would be of no use and would not help the Garda Síochána.  Obviously he is even more out of touch with the situation than his own Minister.  He comes from Dublin, a city where crime is rampant.  He knows that the powers of the Garda Síochána are limited and he ignores the fact that our Bill is proposing some measures to rectify the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State agreed that there has been an alarming increase in larcenies. Any step, no matter how limited, will be welcomed by a suffering community. He also stated that the legislation was complex and he is right but that does not remove responsibility from him, his Minister or the Department to introduce the measure as a matter of urgency.  I am sure that my colleague, Deputy Woods, would have no objection to amendments and improvements once the legislation has been put on the table of the House. For a Government to say they will do nothing in what is a move forward proves they are totally out of touch and do not know how to deal with the matter of stolen goods.  Having listened to the spate of closures mentioned in the House today and to the budget last week and having regard to all the developments that have occurred recently, I suggest that the only growth industry that is allowed to flourish under this Government is that of stolen goods and dealing in stolen goods.  I <Col N="1562" /> understand that in 1984 that industry was worth about £32 million.</P>
    <P>The growth in the crime rate is a matter of much concern but the response of the Minister to our Bill which was introduced on the opening day of the Dáil session has been amazing and unbelievable.  I do not know how he is so disinterested in doing anything to restore the confidence of the community and to thwart the perpetrators of burglaries, larcenies and those engaged in the disposal of stolen goods.  I do not understand how he is prepared to sit back and allow this situation to continue.  I do not understand how he can reject, and advance reasons for so doing, this measure.  In truth, the only real reason for his objection is because the Bill has been introduced by Fianna Fáil in an effort to plug a serious gap in our legislation, one that is allowing unlimited dealing in stolen goods.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister can defend the present situation.  I listened to his contribution in the House two weeks ago and it seemed to be a major departure from the person who tried so unsuccessfully to smear some Fianna Fáil colleagues a number of years ago.  If he had applied the same energy and commitment to deal with the crime problem he would be remembered as somebody who made a worthwhile effort.  His TV appearance at that time indicated a Minister full of verve and enthusiasm.  He was going to make all the changes, he was going to clean up the system almost overnight but three years down the road the situation has deteriorated.  The Minister tinkers around with the statistics.  He tells us there has been a marginal decrease in indictable crime.  He does this as a public relations exercise but I suggest that all of us here have responsibility to endeavour to prevent the criminals from perpetrating crimes in our community. This is a non-party political matter.  The Minister loses credibility for himself and his Government every time he tries to justify marginal changes that may vary over the years.  The truth is that our crime rate is far too high.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Minister was full of intentions and ideas but three years <Col N="1563" /> later he is seen as the most ineffective and unsuccessful holder of the office in modern times.  The prison system is lying almost in shambles around him but yet he defends it with convoluted technical arguments.  They would say in Cork that he engineered and organised the ignition keys in the JCB to have it ready to ease the way into the prison on Spike Island.</P>
    <P>The Minister used technical arguments to show that this Bill is not adequate to curb the increase in the crime rate.  I do not think either Deputy Woods or Deputy Hyland ever suggested that this Bill was so intended.  It was intended to try to get rid of a loophole or an obvious flaw in the legislation relating to larceny and particularly relating to the handling of stolen goods.  It would have been a major step forward.  All the Minister or any other Member has to do is to talk to gardaí, particularly those operating in the major cities, who feel very weak because of the inadequacy of legislation&mdash;</P>

      <P>The area of crime is now our only growth industry.  The expertise and technological development applied by the criminals are incredibly good and I fear that our administration is not moving at a pace sufficient to be able to cope with what is happening.  In my neighbourhood the number of larcenies, break-ins and burglaries has increased at a very fast pace.  The people are very concerned at this development.  The measure before us represents a very logical means of dealing with the problem. Obviously, the Bill is open to amendment and improvement by way of rendering it more effective in the interests of the community, but for the Government to take no action is a very serious failure on their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Judiciary, the Garda and members of the legal profession have been pointing for a long time to the anomalies and inadequacies of legislation relating to stolen goods.  The estimate in respect of stolen goods would be about £32 million for 1984.  That is on the basis of the estimate of the value of stolen goods for that year being £34.5 million while stolen goods recovered amounted to only £2.5 million.  In other words, stolen goods to the value of £32 million were put into circulation and at least some of those goods were sold somewhere.  It all adds up to an extensive business.  Despite this the Minister buries his head in the sand <Col N="1567" /> and says that for technical reasons he cannot accept the measure we are proposing. Someone must cut the red tape. Before the midnight hour is reached in terms of this problem that red tape must be cut.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act of 1984 was defended strongly by the Minister and was put forward as a cure for the whole problem, but it is far from that.  Section 16 of that Act deals specifically with withholding information regarding stolen property and so on.  Subsection (1) of the section reads:</P>
    <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence consisting of the stealing, fraudulent conversion, embezzlement or unlawful obtaining or receiving of money or other property has been committed,</P>
    <P>(b)  finds any person in possession of any property,</P>
    <P>(c)  has reasonable grounds for believing that the property referred to in paragraph (b) includes, or may include, the property referred to in paragraph (a) or, part of it, or the whole or any part of the proceeds of that property or part, and</P>
    <P>(d)  informs that person of his belief...</P>
    <P>When a member of the Garda has done all that, he may require the person to give an account of how he came into possession of the property.  That is fine so far.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
    <P>If that person fails or refuses, without reasonable excuse, to give such account or gives information that he knows to be false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both.</P>
    <P>That is fine so far as it goes.  If the person <Col N="1568" /> fails or refuses to give the information the section takes care of him.  Subsection (3) reads:</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) shall not have effect unless the accused when required to give the account was told in ordinary language by the member of the Garda Síochána what the effect of the failure or refusal might be.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) is very interesting.  It undermines totally the Garda position and reads:</P>
    <P>Any information given by a person in compliance with a requirement under subsection (1) shall not be admissible in evidence against that person or his spouse in any proceedings, civil or criminal, other than proceedings for an offence under subsection (2).</P>
    <P>That means in effect that if a garda apprehends, say, John Murphy who is in possession of a number of transistors, television sets, videos or other goods and if he says that he procured the goods from Gene Fitzgerald who stole them from a certain house, the garda is powerless to take any action.  That is the anomalous situation the Minister must face up to, but he has defended his failure in this area by saying that the Criminal Justice Act covers that sort of situation.</P>

      <P>I shall not enter into an argument with the Deputy because there is not much time remaining at my disposal but he may check the matter with the Garda, for instance.  They are very concerned about this position. If the person who is stopped by the Garda does not give the information requested <Col N="1569" /> of him, he has no problem and if he volunteers the information the Garda cannot use that in evidence against him.</P>
      <P>I referred to the Minister claiming credit for tinkering around with the minimal reduction in the crime rate and trying to win some kudos for that.  Crime is on the increase.  The receiving of stolen goods is a growing industry.  There would have been some merit in the Minister saying to Deputy Woods that there are some inadequacies in the Bill, that some changes would have to be made to it, that these changes would be made and the necessary legislation introduced as quickly as possible.  Of course he has not said that.  He has said that in his own time he will introduce legislation, but meanwhile the position continues to deteriorate. The people deserve better than a Minister who shows no concern for a matter which is their constant worry.  I can understand Deputy Taylor being concerned about this because he lives in a suburban area which must be suffering severely.</P>
      <P>In Cork joy riding is once again on the increase and causing serious injury and damage to property.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> reported on Friday a horror crash between a van in which a husband and wife were travelling and a car driven by joy-riders.  All parties were injured and one of the boys died today.  We have to convey sympathy to his people but it is a tragedy that these things are allowed to continue.  The Garda are doing their job but they need support.  We talk about the growth of technology.  Criminals are very good at using updated technological equipment and the disposal of stolen goods has become more slick and successful.</P>
      <P>Any Member referring to the Garda this week should not forget their football team who travelled to Derry last Sunday. I was extremely impressed that these ambassadors acquitted themselves so well.  It was great to see a Deputy Garda Commissioner being interviewed on the playing field in Derry city.  Media coverage was positive and very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1916 Larceny Act it is an <Col N="1570" /> offence to receive stolen property knowing it to have been stolen, but it is not an offence to receive stolen property believeing it to have been stolen.  The Minister of State made much play about that point in our Bill, saying it was confusing still further an already complex position. He did admit, however, that it is a limited step.  I would say it is a bit more than that and certainly a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the stolen goods business amounted to £32 million and it has been growing.  Not only is it wrong to allow people to deal in stolen property but is is also doing great harm to legitimate traders.  The sum I have mentioned is a substantial turnover in itself and part of it might make the difference between the viability and the non-viability of an enterprise.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House are aware of neighbours who have been robbed on more than one occasion of electrical goods, videos, televisions, radios and personal belongings.  We wonder where all these goods disappeared.  Any stopping of the flow of stolen goods is a positive step forward.  It may not be the whole answer but we can tackle that in time as well.  We must not stand back and do nothing.  It must be remembered that criminals are as well versed in these Acts as Members of this House and the legal profession.</P>
    <P>I regret any inference that the Minister for Justice was involved in a prison breakout. I did not mean that seriously.  I merely quoted what was said in Cork but that was said jocosely too.</P>

      <P>The crime rate in my city is increasing.  The upturn in joyriding is a cause of concern since a second death has been caused by it since Christmas.  This is a matter above party politics.  Efforts to reduce the incidence of crime must be made on a united basis. Our citizens are suffering too much.  They are afraid to leave their houses or to leave their cars.  All this has given an impetus <Col N="1571" /> to the security industry but it cannot contain all the things that are happening. This Bill is fulfilling a national service.  It should be supported.  Cork is screaming for action and what applies to Cork applies to all our other cities.</P>
      <P>I am not always negative in this House. The Minister has made a major contribution to improving the speed with which court cases are dealt with in Cork.  Some of the progress received a setback recently when a number of courts were adjourned because of inconsistencies by a temporary district justice.  Inconsistent fines were imposed and difficulties were experienced with the legal profession, but I am sure the Minister and his Department are capable of putting that matter right.  Let us hope this temporary appointment will not slow down or disrupt a system which has improved.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows the anomaly is there.  He knows there is a need to close the door and that the 1984 Act has not done so.  People throughout the country, but especially in the cities, need protection quickly.  This loophole must be positively sealed off.  If this measure does not go far enough, it will at least be a help. Section 30 was used recently in a case involving substantial malicious damages but the defendants were cleared and section 30 was not allowed to be used.  It has to be tested at a higher level.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept this Bill.  He is welcome to amend it if he wishes.  The community need action quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition are to be congratulated in bringing forward a Private Members' Bill of this nature on a non-controversial subject.  All of us in this House share the wish to bring the escalating crime figures under control and to reduce them.  It must be appreciated that Private Members' time has to some extent been given over to this end by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Indeed, I wish that more of Private Members' time would be made available to discuss issues such as criminal law and other branches of the law in need of reform.  Having said that, <Col N="1572" /> in all honesty I do not feel that the Bill as it stands is capable of making anything more than a small, marginal contribution towards the reform of criminal law and would go no way at all in substance to meet the serious escalating problem with which we are faced, as Deputy Gene Fitzgerald pointed out.  We all agree on that.</P>
      <P>I would contend it is time that a major review or reform of the broad spectrum of the criminal law was undertaken.  A piecemeal approach, picking out one or two individual offences, will not get us anywhere.  We need a complete review. I do not see why the Law Reform Commission &mdash; after all they are the expert body charged, at great public expense, with keeping our law under review and suggesting reforms and proposals &mdash; should not be asked to look in particular at the field of the criminal law. In the main they have concentrated on other branches of the law, many of which do not have anything more than a marginal reference to the lives of ordinary people.  It is an expensive body to maintain. They do very good work, carry out in-depth research and would have the time and resources to undertake the necessary reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the practice of crime is concerned, over the years since the Larceny Act of 1916 the position has changed very much.  The basic nature of the offences of larceny and of receiving have not changed that much.  There have been new types of crime that have entered the scene that warrant the particular attention of law reform &mdash; for example, such things as company frauds, frauds by company directors, frauds on people involved with companies, be they shareholders or people buying things from companies that liquidate, crimes of a fraudulent nature of that sort.  Those criminal offences have not been updated in anyway.  Massive crimes are committed against ordinary people who find themselves defrauded in company situations by company directors absconding, or milking companies of their assets and so on.  There is also in this world of technology, as we have it now, a whole range of <Col N="1573" /> computer frauds involving computers and matters of that nature which were not in contemplation at all at the time that the Larceny Act was passed.  It is time we carried out a review of the criminal law. I would ask the Minister to consider requesting the Law Reform Commission to examine the broad spectrum, to ascertain if we can improve the position in some substantial way that would be of real help.</P>
    <P>Those who commit crime, particularly the kind of crimes that are within the contemplation of the provisions of this Bill, fall into at least two broad categories. There are those young people who become involved in break-ins, in joyriding, taking cars and careering around our cities causing danger to themselves and others.  The second category would be formed of those professional criminals who have developed a high expertise in this field over the years.  So far as those youngsters are concerned &mdash; and they present an increasing problem &mdash; that problem will not be tackled merely by amending measures of the criminal law, nor by increasing the penalties imposed by the criminal law.  There is involved here a major social element that we must face up to.  It is no good just bemoaning the fact that break-ins, smash-ins are on the increase, cars being taken and all that.  That is all true but there is no sense in just wringing one's hands and complaining about it.  One must go somewhat deeper and realise that the appalling increase in the unemployment of our young people is a major contributory factor in these criminal activities.  As has been said, idle hands will soon be put to no good use, and that is what is happening. There is a crisis obtaining in so far as young people in the inner city areas and indeed outer suburbs are concerned. We must find ways of providing work for these young people.  Their energies must be channelled in some direction.  If they are not directed into normal useful work, using their brains and hands, then of necessity they will and have turned towards crime for the thrill, using their brains to some extent in break-ins, driving around in stolen cars and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> There is, therefore, a very big social element involved.  I am afraid that successive Governments have been very lax in tackling this problem in any realistic way.  We have all been too fond of the habit of sitting back, hoping that the economy will lift so that employment will be provided for these people and so that in turn they will not have to turn to crime. But that does not happen of its own accord, as has been shown time and time again.  Governments do have a responsibility, if they want to tackle this crime problem, to ensure that work is provided for these youngsters.  If such employment is provided I would forecast a dramatic reduction in the crime figures.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been advanced here by those who presented this Bill that its provisions represent some kind of panacea for the crime situation, that all we have to do is have Dáil and Seanad Éireann pass and adopt Deputy Woods' Bill, when there will be a dramatic turnaround in the crime figures, when these escalating figures that so frighten us, give us such cause for concern, will in some magical way dissipate or fade away into the background.  I wish it were that easy.  The problem is not that the law does not have at its disposal sufficient armouries in the legal system, a sufficient list of offences that could be availed of with which to charge people.  That is not the problem at all.  In the criminal law books there are offences galore.  That is not the problem. Rather is it that there has been a failure to have a sufficiently high detection rate of the crimes that have been committed. That is the problem, not a lack of sufficient types of crime within which to bring a charge and obtain a conviction.  Crimes are not being detected in sufficiently high numbers.  Deputy Woods gave the relevant figures when speaking in introducing this Bill on 22 January last when, he said:</P>
    <P>For instance, in the Dublin Metropolitan Area only one larceny in every four was detected in 1984 &mdash; the figure is 24 per cent.  Some 75 per cent of larcenies went undetected and the perpetrators went scot-free.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> That is the reality.  Unfortunately, there is nothing in Deputy Woods' Bill, as he rightly pointed out, that will increase the detection rate.  That remains and will remain unchanged and completely unaffected by anything in this Bill.</P>
    <P>How do we increase the detection rate? To increase the detection rate requires a number of things to be done, but the most important would be that we make better use of the detection resources that we have, that is to say our excellent Garda force.  We are not using that force, limited and constrained though they are, to the best advantage.  The gardaí are highly trained men and women.  They are a fine force.  They have acquired an expertise in their practice and in their training, but their time is in many ways and in a substantial way wasted and abused.  If one was to go, for example, into Rathfarnham District Court &mdash; I do not single out Rathfarnham District Court, the same probably applies in any District Court dealing with criminal work up and down the country &mdash; one would find perhaps on Monday at 10 a.m. the court filled to capacity with maybe 40 or 50 gardaí sitting there most of whom will be there for hours on end waiting for their cases to come up.  Many of those cases will not be reached until 4.30 p.m. or 5 p.m.  Therefore, a massive force of gardaí on a regular basis must spend their time twiddling their thumbs waiting for their cases to come up in the District Court and other courts up and down the country.  If one was to calculate the number of garda hours lost, thrown away and wasted by this kind of procedure the figure would be staggering.</P>
    <P>A better procedure could be devised to organise that system which has remained very largely unchanged over the years.  I have no doubt that a better system could be devised under which the lists would be divided up.  These are just a few suggestions and there could be others.  The court clerk could have a preliminary hearing to see which case was going to take five minutes and which case was going to take two hours.  The first case on the list could take two hours, and 50 gardaí are sitting <Col N="1576" /> there doing nothing for two hours while one garda is involved in a case. Preliminary inquiries by the court clerks or arrangements that would require defendants or solicitors to give an indication of what time would be taken on their cases could result in a tremendous saving and the best possible use of Garda resources, which are a scarce commodity.  Specialists in this field, work study experts, are called in by major industrial firms to make a study of the best use of resources and how matters should be planned and organised.  It would be a worthwhile investment if some of these work study specialists were called in to look at the operation of the court system, to devise an arrangement under which large numbers of these gardaí could be released from having to sit there and could go about the business which they are employed to do and whose services are so desperately needed outside in the community.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the crime situation is very serious but this Bill is not going to resolve it.  It touches no more than the fringes of the problem.  Reference has been made to the Oglesby case.  I think Deputy Woods quoted that in his opening remarks.  That case did not really change anything very much.  The position still remains even after that case that if a criminal is found in possession of recently stolen goods that is still a factor that the courts may and do take into account in determining whether he is guilty.  Even the English Theft Act did not change that to any extent.  That still remains the law in England.  It is a factor to be taken into account.  Indeed, the Criminal Justice Act which has now been passed goes a very long way towards, so to speak, improving the position from the prosecution point of view in cases of that nature. Many people in this House thought in the course of that debate that that Bill and that provision went too far in being of assistance to the prosecution.  Deputy Fitzgerald, who has spoken here just now, thought it did not go far enough.  I must admit that I think it struck a reasonable compromise.  Now when a person <Col N="1577" /> is found in possession of recently stolen goods and is called on to give an explanation, if he gives no explanation he commits an offence immediately and is liable to 12 months' imprisonment.  If he gives an explanation he may be charged with stealing, receiving, obtaining by fraudulent means or whatever.  That is provided for in that section and without a doubt when that comes into operation it will be a very valuable weapon in the hands of the prosecution.  There is also the provision that if he fails to give an explanation, the court &mdash; be it judge and jury, justice or whoever &mdash; may draw the appropriate inferences from what he has said or has not said.  Again that constitutes quite a heavy transfer of the normal burden of proof that lies on the prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal position, even aside from the new Act, is as given by District Justice Kenny in the decision in the Oglesby case.  As recorded at page 167 of that report he quotes another case with approval.  He said, and I quote:</P>
      <P>... I think that the proper way in which to approach the determination of the case of recently stolen goods is as follows: if the prosecution have established the fact that the defendant had possession of goods recently stolen and has given an explanation that he came by them innocently, the tribunal, whether judge, justice or jury, must consider whether the facts established admit of any reasonable construction which is consistent with the innocence of the accused.  If they do, and one such construction may be that the explanation is true, he should be acquitted;</P>
      <P>Nobody will want to alter that basic legal position&mdash;</P>
      <P>if they do not, he may be convicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is that he must not be convicted. Whether he is convicted or not ultimately in that situation rests with the trial court, with the judge and jury or <Col N="1578" /> with the justice if that is what it is.  Mr. Justice Kenny went on:</P>
    <P>Where the only evidence is that an accused person is in possession of property recently stolen, a jury may infer guilty knowledge (a) if he offers no explanation to account for his possession, or (b) if the jury are satisfied that the explanation he does offer is untrue.</P>
    <P>Even in the present position, even without the Criminal Justice Act of 1985, a person found in possession of recently stolen goods either gives no explanation or gives an explanation.  If the jury are satisfied that that is inadequate or untrue they are still perfectly entitled to convict him.  The only point is that there is no obligation on them to convict him.  That is the function of the jury and the function of the justice and nobody would want to change that.</P>
    <P>It is put forward that this Bill will be some kind of panacea.  This is a major fallacy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that there may not be a very small margin of cases that will be covered by the provisions of this Bill, situations where the prosecution authorities would detect the crime.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Woods rightly pointed out, the problem is detection and 75 per cent of crimes are not detected. We are talking about the few cases where detection has occurred and the prosecution authorities examine the case and find that the evidence does not quite measure up because while the defendant has been found in possession of stolen goods, the explanation would result in acquittal.  I am not saying that there are no cases which fall into that category.  There may be, but they are precious few.  This Bill will not increase the detection rate.  The increase in prosecutions or convictions would be only marginal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill makes great play of the distinction between a person receiving stolen goods knowing them to have been <Col N="1579" /> stolen and receiving stolen goods believing them to have been stolen.  The proposition is put forward that it is easier for the prosecution to prove that a man received stolen goods believing them to have been stolen rather than knowing them to have been stolen.  The logic behind that escapes me.  I should like somebody to clarify how the prosecution would go about giving evidence as to what the criminal in the dock believed.  Who knows what a person believes?  Can one prove what a person believes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This notion of what a person believes is not new in the legal system.  That is there already in connection with the issuing of did cheques.  It is known how difficult it is to get a conviction where a person issues a cheque which is returned endorsed r/d.  That hinges on the question of whether the person believed that he had no money in the bank at the time and that the cheque would bounce.  It is virtually impossible to secure a conviction in these cases; otherwise there would be a great many more convictions of this kind than there are at present.  This subtlety, this suggestion that changing the phrase &ldquo;knowing them to have been stolen&rdquo; will bring about any dramatic change in the very serious crime figures quoted by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald is nonsense.  Indeed, it might make it even more difficult for the prosecution. What a person believes is known only in his own mind.  It would be a daunting task for the prosecution to establish on evidence what a person believed at the time that he acquired goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the existing parameters of the offence of receiving stolen <Col N="1580" /> property result in a catch-all situation. The man who buys the goods from the nameless person in the pub gets caught and convicted every day of the week if he does not give an explanation.  District Justices are down to earth people, by and large.  I will not say that there are not exceptions; we have had the occasional cases which diverge from the norm. People quite frequently give explanations that they bought a video, for example, from the man in the pub.  I have heard it myself on a number of occasions.  I can tell Deputy Woods, through the Chair, that it does not wash and in those cases convictions apply.  The same applies to people who buy goods at knock-down prices.  I do not say that there would not be situations in which the concepts in the Bill could not or would not produce a very marginal improvement in the bringing of prosecutions.  It certainly will not help with detection.</P>
    <P>If we are to make any major impact on the crime figures we want to increase the rate of detection and the only way to do that is by extending the resources of the Garda Síochána.  We can do that by revising the court system which ties up so many Garda man hours wastefully.  We can also increase Garda effectiveness by providing back-up staff in Garda stations. That is a very important point which was discussed by the crime committee of this House.  One finds highly trained gardaí typing out statements in this day and age, using two fingers, laboriously taking hours to do so.  If a secretary were provided it would release gardaí for other more worthwhile tasks and more worthwhile crime work.</P>
    <P>If we want to show that we are really tackling the problem we must do something about the delays taking place in the prosecution of cases which are detected and in which prosecutions are brought.  It is taking far too long for cases to be prepared and prosecutions carried through.  It is taking far too long for court time to be found for trials and appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal to take place.</P>
    <P>It is very important that when detections <Col N="1581" /> take place it be highlighted that justice operates fairly both for the prosecution and the accused.  We must be very careful not to be carried away by the crime figures and bend one way and accept less than reasonably required proofs to establish that a person is a criminal. Justice has to be fair to both sides and also has to be quick.  As the saying goes, justice delayed is justice denied.  It does not look good in the eyes of the general public and is not healthy in the case of other criminals or would-be criminals that very prolonged delays take place before criminals who have been detected and charged are finally brought to book.</P>
    <P>We have seen cases of adverse comment by justices complaining about long delays in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or with the other prosecuting authorities in preparing cases for prosecution.  Undoubtedly, unacceptable delays are taking place.  I am not putting the blame on the Director of Public Prosecutions, far from it.  He is doing his best with the resources at his disposal.  It may well be that he requires an increase in the resources available. Likewise, so far as court hearings are concerned, it is essential that when the prosecution is brought and the accused returned for trial there should not be delays of six, nine or even 12 months before the case is brought to hearing.  We hear of cases where other offences are committed while that accused is out on bail for a prolonged period.  Speed is essential.  In no case after an accused has been returned for trial should there be allowed a delay of more than one month, or three months at an absolute outside. Our criminal justice system should be revamped to take cognisance of that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the bringing forward of the Bill.  It is a valuable contribution that we have debated the subject here.  I hope that it will produce the legal reform and updating that are required across the spectrum of the legal system, more particularly with regard to fraud, company fraud and so on.  The thanks of the House are due to the Opposition for giving the House an opportunity of conducting that debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Taylor for his kind remarks and his welcome for the Bill, and Deputy Cosgrave for his contribution last week.  In his opening remarks, the Minister for Justice said: &ldquo;The Larceny Acts are rather technical and complex, and the Government accept that the law in this area is in need of some modernisation&rdquo;.  In that way the Minister dismissed the Bill out of hand. I am sure Deputy Woods would be prepared to accept amendments to the Bill if they were proposed because it is very necessary that the country would have legislation along these lines.  All Deputies agree that the crime level is far too high and that statements issued recently that it had dropped by 2.6 per cent will do nothing to relieve the fears of the community.</P>
      <P>In 1983 during my by-election campaign in the sprawling Dublin Central constituency, at every doorstep the major complaint I got, apart from the levels of taxation and unemployment, was about the level of crime, particularly in that neighbourhood.  The catchcry of the people there was what were we doing about the introduction of legislation to combat crime.  In 1984 there was a total of 98,000 indictable crimes and 94,000 of them involved burglary, robberies and theft.  That surely indicates that there is a ready market for stolen property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the 1916 Act is defective in many ways, particularly in regard to crimes committed during the day.  As it stands, the law is outdated and consequently the Garda are frustrated.  We hear and read of cases of culprits being identified and brought before the courts but the cases are thrown out for lack of proof.  Therefore, habitual criminals can continue their burglaries and robberies. If a person is detected and apprehended in a house or other building with the obvious intent of committing a crime he can be acquitted on a technicality.  That is a ludicrous situation.  Most of the burglaries committed in my constituency are done during the day.  Old people leave their homes in the mornings to do their shopping or to go to Mass and later have a <Col N="1583" /> chat with their friends.  When they return they find their homes burgled.</P>
    <P>The law as laid down in the 1916 Larceny Act will never lead to a reduction in the crime rate.  I cannot believe that there has been any reduction in the number of house breakings and, as Deputy Woods said, the existence of receivers or fences means that thieves and robbers can realise on their stolen property.  The prosecution rate is not very high.  Though the Bill before us may not be wonderful, it would go some way towards relieving the position.  At least it would provide a method of identifying and proving stolen property in court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about the crime rate in Cork and said it is dramatic. I did not tell the Deputy about the position in my constituency.  Shopkeepers have to close their doors at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. because they are afraid to stay open. We can see the dead city in the heart of Dublin with shops and stores in Henry Street and O'Connell Street shut early in the evening.  The Garda Síochána are doing their best but even if the detection rate were 100 per cent the criminals can get away on technicalities and go on committing the same crimes.</P>
    <P>Many people these days enjoy the luxury of TV and video sets.  They are a favourite target of thieves and burglars, but if there were no buyers for them there would be fewer robberies.  Deputy Taylor said that detection of these cases can be very difficult because of the method of proving that goods were stolen.  I do not agree.  It may be difficult to prove that receivers are dealing in stolen property, but if the law were updated I submit that proving the goods were stolen would be less difficult.  I know persons who have been arrested and allowed out on bail. Because of delays suspects can be on bail for 12 months without being brought for trial and in the case of one such person the Garda are suspicious that he has being committing similar crimes in the meantime throughout the area in which he lives.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I regard the 1916 Act as outmoded.  Its provisions leave much to be desired.  Therefore, I appeal to the <Col N="1584" /> Minister for Justice and to Deputies opposite not to be so ready to reject this Bill.  There is a good deal of merit in this Bill.  If the Minister with his access to expertise in his Department introduced amendments to make this Bill more acceptable to the House, it would be a good thing.</P>
    <P>According to the Garda Síochána the number of cars being stolen in Dublin has been reduced in recent times.  I doubt that, as people come to me in my clinics indicating that a huge number of cars are being stolen.  In fact my car was stolen three times in the last two years.  I am aware of the crime situation.  Recently I was involved in a mugging, and I can assure the House that it is a frightening experience.  I understand the frustration and fear in the minds of people generally and in the minds of old people living alone.  There are quite a number of old people living alone in my constituency. One old lady told me that she leaves the house at 8 o'clock in the morning, goes to Mass, does her shopping, returns home at midday for a meal, locks the house for the rest of the day and will not even answer the phone.</P>
    <P>Taking that kind of fear into account, surely some legislation should be introduced. Our Bill might not be the perfect solution, but it will go some way towards reducing the crime rate.  If there were no receivers there would be no robbers.  At the moment one can go to certain city centre areas to buy videos, taperecorders, furniture and so on, and if the person approached has not got the merchandise he will make an appointment for the buyer to come back, when he will supply what is required.  Surely it is up to the Minister for Justice to introduce legislation as quickly as possible to attempt to curb the crime rate.  In his speech the Minister indicated that he had a lot of legislation pending and that he could not give priority to this Bill.  The people generally have lost confidence in the forces of law and order and the Minister should attempt to redress that situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> Deputy Woods mentioned the Criminal Justice Bill which has been temporarily postponed until the Garda Complaints Bill is passed.  It might deal with receivers of stolen property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not, except in a minor way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLeonard" hpid="Mr. T. Leonard Mr. T. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The aspect of dealing with the receiving of stolen property should be dealt with separately.  Deputy Taylor says we should not do things piecemeal but, if an initiative is not taken, we will be waiting for the draftsmen in the Department of Justice to draft Bills while the crime rate continues to rise.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see the 2.6 per cent reduction in the indictable crime rate to which the Minister referred has not alleviated the situation in the city centre.  In Dublin people are terrified to walk the streets at night because of break-ins, robberies, muggings and other violent crimes.  The Bill introduced by Deputy Woods may not be perfect, but it should be given a hearing by the Minister.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the Bill he should bring in another Bill to curb crime.  The more receivers there are, the more crime will be committed and the crime rate for stolen property at the moment is astronomical.  Most of the business houses in Dublin city know the criminals but when the criminals are apprehended it is difficult to prove where the goods came from.  The Minister should give serious thought to the inadequate 1916 Larceny Act and bring in a Bill to update the legislation in regard to stolen property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider at least some of the points in Deputy Woods' Bill when he frames a Bill of his own.  I also hope that the crime rate in Dublin will decrease at an accelerated rate.  The position in Dublin at the moment is that car stealing, joyriding, burglaries and robberies are continuing. Cars stolen in Dublin are being used as battering rams in the perpetration of robberies in the rural areas.  Obviously the <Col N="1586" /> rate of car thefts in Dublin is not diminishing to any degree.  Car stealing and thefts from cars are continuing.  No later than three weeks ago I saw three juveniles using jemmies in an effort to break the rear window of a car.</P>

      <P>Deputy Liam Naughten has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of St. Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital, Castlerea, and I understand he has agreed to share his time with Deputy Leyden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this serious matter on the Adjournment.  I note that the Minister of State will be replying to this debate and I regret that the Minister has not come to the House to deal with this because it was he who announced the closure of this institution on Thursday.  Like other Roscommon public representatives, the people of the county and, in particular, the population of Castlerea, I was stunned on Thursday to hear the announcement by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised by the manner and style of the announcement in the course of the Minister's budget speech and the fact that the decision was reached without consultation with the Western Health Board who are responsible for health care in that area.  I recognise the services that the staff at St. Patrick's have given to patients in that institution.  Although I am a member of the Western Health Board, and a member of the special hospitals committee responsible for psychiatric care, I was not aware of the Minister's intentions before Thursday.  In fact, the board were carrying out a programme of rehabilitation of people who were institutionalised in psychiatric hospitals.  We had opened new centres <Col N="1587" /> in Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Strokestown and Roscommon town.</P>
    <P>All public representatives were stunned when they heard that the hospital which caters for 240 patients was to close without alternative accommodation being made available for patients.  The lack of consultation with the Western Health Board is to be deplored.  I cannot understand why the Minister took this decision.  Very few of the patients at the hospital are able to care for themselves and many would not be suitable for participation in a day care programme.  I do not know what will happen to those patients if the institution closes down. Many patients have spent 30 years in the hospital and must continue to be cared for in an institution.  One also must consider the anxiety of the relatives of those patients.  They do not know what will happen to their relatives if the institution is closed down.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the 262 members of the hospital staff if it is closed?  Will they be transferred to other institutions? The Minister said that nurses will not lose their jobs, but where will they be transferred to?  I cannot understand how the Minister can say that the closure of the institution will result in a major saving if at the same time he tells us that staff will not lose their jobs.  If some of the staff are transferred to Castlebar or Ballinasloe they will have to move house because the distance between Castlerea and those towns is too great for them to be able to commute daily.  Is the Minister aware that, due to the way the recession has hit local industries, it is almost impossible to sell a house in Castlerea.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take into consideration the difficulty relatives will experience if the patients are transferred to Ballinasloe or Castlebar.  Many of those patients will not have visitors if they are transferred because their relatives will have too far to travel to see them.  It is difficult to understand why a hospital that was constructed in 1936 is chosen for closure.  It is important to point out that on 16 January an official from the Department of Health visited Castlerea with a view to sanctioning improvements <Col N="1588" /> for that institution.  I am puzzled as to why the Western Health Board were grant-aided for the provisions of lifts in the hospital last year, and it was decided to close it on 29 January this year.  That is an indication of the lack of planning in the Department.  Officials in that Department do not know whether they are going backwards or forwards.  It is time the Minister got to grips with this.</P>
    <P>Some people say that Castlerea hospital is being closed to facilitate the opening of the Swinford centre.  Would it not have been proper to provide the facilities scheduled for Swinford at Castlerea?  It would have been better to utilise the fine cutstone buildings in Castlerea rather than embarking on an expensive new project at Swinford.  That suggests a lack of planning in regard to this and other decisions in the Department.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Government the Minister has a social responsibility to the people of Castlerea and surrounding areas.  The population of the town is 2,000 people.  The conversion of the local telephone exchange to automatic and the transfer of the Land Commission officials meant the loss of 60 jobs.  At the Edson factory 20 employees are on short time. Fenner Stone and IDE Fashions have closed down.  If anything happens to the 261 jobs at Castlerea hospital it will spell disaster for the area.  The Minister should take those facts into consideration when he reviews the position.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister should withdraw the closure order and negotiate with the health board the position of patients and staff in St. Patrick's.  The patients are well cared for in the hospital and are happy there.  It is as economic to look after them in the hospital as it would be under a community care programme.  I also believe that the only way these people can be treated in a humane way is to leave them where they are to avoid their anxiety at being transferred to another institution where they would not know the staff or other patients.  I appeal to the Minister to review the closure order for the hospital and to enter into negotiations with the Western Health Board in regard to its future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for giving me some of his time to discuss this issue as I had also sought a question on the Adjournment.  I do not wish to debate this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, because he did not make the decision to close St. Patrick's hospital.  Nevertheless, he is here representing the Department of Health and he should convey our views to the Minister in relation to this issue. I regard it as one of the most ruthless decisions ever made by a Minister for Health, to throw 250 patients out on to the streets of County Roscommon, and that is what he is doing by closing the hospital.  No provision has been made for these patients.</P>
      <P>There are 250 patients in the hospital complex but there are roughly 700 outpatients being serviced by the hospital in Castlerea.  They are being cared for by a nursing staff of about 170 who provide care and attention for many people who require psychiatric assistance in the catchment area of the hospital.  In all, it cares for an area comprising 54,000 people.  The Western Health Board put forward a document called Report to the Special Hospital Care Standing Committee &mdash; Plan for Development of Psychiatric Services by Pascal McDaid on 24 January 1986.  It is highly unlikely that this document has been studied by the Minister, perhaps he has not even seen it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The psychiatrists and the nursing staff in St. Patrick's Castlerea, are prepared to discuss any development which is in the best interests of the patients, but the announcement by the Minister is not in the best interests of the patients in that hospital.  There are about 250 patients and 55 of them have been in the hospital for between 30 and 55 years.  More than 100 of them are over 65 years of age and they cannot be cared for in any other institution.  They are happy and content although they are the most deprived people in society and we have a responsibility to ensure that they are secure.  The Minister's announcement was a cold, callous act and I wish he was here so that I could say it to his face.  It is the most <Col N="1590" /> ruthless decision that a Minister for Health ever made.  In a letter to the Western Health Board the Minister ordered them to transfer £1.9 million from St. Patrick's, Castlerea, to the new complex in Swinford.  He is playing one location against the other but the people of Mayo have indicated their support for the campaign which was launched in Roscommon over the weekend for the retention of the hospital in Castlerea and its full medical staff.  They want a discussion with the Department of Health in relation to the development of psychiatric services in the Western Health Board area, particularly in the catchment area of Castlerea.  We must maintain these services because there will be a continuous need for specialised, residential psychiatric care for the foreseeable future.  I cannot see a lessening in the demand for these services. In 1984, over 1,500 people sought psychiatric assistance from the hospital.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will be putting down a motion calling on the Minister to withdraw the closure order pending full and detailed discussion with the health boards, medical and nursing staff.  In the document Planning for the Future, the Minister undertook to have full discussions with all interested parties before he implemented the plan.  We now realise that he is using the most deprived people to support financial cutbacks by the Government.  He should seek cuts elsewhere because the hospital in Castlerea is not the place to implement them.  I appeal to Deputies in the eight hospital areas involved to vote against the Minister having further powers when the hospital Bill comes before us in the near future. It will be an opportunity to ensure that the Minister will not have the power to close this or other hospitals.  Fine Gael Deputies are being sold down the river by the so called socialist Minister for Health.  It is about time they pulled the plug on the Government because if they do not face the issue now not only will the patients and nursing staff be removed from the area but any Deputy who votes to give the Minister extra powers will be voting away his or her rights in the future.</P>
    <P>The people of Castlerea are very angry <Col N="1591" /> and this will be a fight to the finish.  All political groups will work together to persuade the Minister to reverse his decision to close.  They have taken action at county council and local health committee level and they will also lobby TDs and Senators.  They will take to the streets and if the Bill is not passed in a certain time.  I hope that they will take out an injunction against the Minister to ensure that he cannot proceed with the closure of St. Patrick's.  I give my categorical assurance that Fianna Fáil will back them in regard to this issue because today's fight for St. Patrick's Hospital is tomorrow's fight for the county hospital, Roscommon, and other hospitals which may be affected by future Ministerial decisions.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State, who is from the west, to use his influence in the Department of Health to ensure that there is a change of heart and that they will come to the table to discuss the whole issue with the Western Health Board so that whatever decisions are taken will be in consultation with the Western Health Board.  The Minister for Health and Social Welfare should be a caring and considerate man but this Government seem to take satisfaction from closing hospitals or factories.  It is a bankrupt administration.  The Minister for Health is responsible for closing institutions, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism has also closed factories throughout the country.  They are the official undertakers.  The Minister for Education announced the closure of Carysfort training college.</P>
    <P>This is an indication of how bankrupt this Government are and how they are prepared to take decisions which are against the best interests of our people. I hope all Members of this House will withdraw any power the Minister has to close hospitals.  I know my colleague Deputy Naughten is deeply concerned about this issue and I have no doubt about his commitment to the retention of St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea.  I hope when it comes to a vote on the new Bill to give the Minister this power that he <Col N="1592" /> will come into the lobby with me and my colleague, Deputy Doherty, to ensure that this Bill is defeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring the message to Deputy Leyden.  The closure of St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, must be seen in the context of national health services policy.  &ldquo;The Psychiatric Services &mdash; Planning for the Future&rdquo; report published last year identified the development of a community based psychiatric service as the most effective way to meet the psychiatric needs of the population. The development of modern treatment methods for psychiatric illness has meant that the concept of large psychiatric hospitals, developed in the 19th century, is now an anachronism.  The Government's plan <i>Building on Reality</i> identified the shifting of resources from institutional care to community care as a major objective of health policy.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; report was drawn up by professionals in the psychiatric services including consultant psychiatrist, nursing officer and chief executive officer representation.  Their report starts by stating: &ldquo;What is required now is a programme to implement these recommendations in all parts of the country. This programme should be initiated without delay so that mentally ill persons can benefit from an effective and progressive service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decision to close Castlerea hospital is based on the need to start this process of change immediately. <Col N="1593" /> St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, was built in 1943, with separate male and female blocks, and was used for seven years in the late forties and early fifties as a TB sanatorium.  The patient population has dropped steadily over the years from 414 in 1965 to 336 in 1975 and down to 251 patients by the end of 1984.</P>
    <P>The psychiatric hospital service, like its predecessor the TB sanatorium, has outlived its usefulness now that more modern and effective treatment methods are available.  The building itself is no longer suitable for good psychiatric care as it was not built to allow patients privacy or independence.  Its sanitary facilities are not of good quality and I am sure the patients have not regarded it as a place of comfort or a home despite the fact that 75 per cent of them are over five years in the hospital.</P>
    <P>The entire in-patient population of Castlerea hospital were recently assessed in order to determine their future needs in line with the &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; recommendations.  This assessment will form the basis for discussions between officers of my Department and those of the Western Health Board in order to determine the appropriate placement of the 226 patients involved, together with the future admission facilities to be made available for Roscommon.</P>
    <P>The types of services to be provided in local towns throughout Roscommon will include day centre and day hospital places; supervised and unsupervised hostels or domestic residences for patients who have no homes of their own and geriatric care as 40 per cent of these patients are now over 65 years.</P>
    <P>The closure of Castlerea hospital will <Col N="1594" /> also facilitate the opening of the new mental handicap centre at Swinford which will have 190 residential places. Mentally handicapped patients should never be placed in psychiatric hospitals unless they also suffer from a psychiatric illness.  Yet in the 1981 census of psychiatric hospitals, the three psychiatric hospitals in the Western Health Board had a total of 321 in-patients whose primary diagnosis was mental handicap. Forty-five of these patients were in Castlerea, 172 in Ballinasloe and 104 in Castlebar.  The coming on stream of the centre at Swinford will allow for the transfer of some of those patients to a centre designed for their care and will reduce the psychiatric hospital patient numbers further.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced his decision in this House last Thursday so that action could be taken to implement this decision in a controlled way.  He has provided funding for the hospital for at least the next six months to enable alternative arrangements to be made.  There will be no hardship on patients or their relatives and I object to the scare mongering tactics of local political interests on this issue.  The staff in the hospital will, as far as possible, be redeployed to other appropriate positions.  Now that the policy is clear, the alternative services will have to be provided and the changes envisaged in &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; will become a reality for the Roscommon area.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 February 1986.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on 6 June 1985 (Vol. 395 No. 4 of the Official Report), when I explained the arrangements to help such apprentices and indicated my satisfaction with them in the context of AnCO's limited resources.</P>
      <P>As I explained, there is a statutory obligation for an employer to notify AnCO one month in advance of a decision to terminate the employment of an apprentice.  AnCO then make every effort to enable the apprentice to continue the apprenticeship, by taking one or more of the following measures:</P>
      <P>(a)  seeking, in conjunction with the National Manpower Service, another employer to enable the apprentice to continue his/her apprenticeship;</P>
      <P>(b)  providing &ldquo;updating of skills&rdquo; courses in AnCO and other recognised training centres;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> (c)  assigning him/her to a block release course in regional technical colleges;</P>
    <P>(d)  placing him/her with a suitable employer on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>All unemployed and redundant apprentices who are notified to AnCO are issued with a brochure giving advice and details of procedures for unemployed apprentices.</P>

      <P>Statistics on the social employment scheme are at present compiled on the basis of national manpower regions.  It is not possible therefore to provide details in respect of individual counties without diverting significant resources to statistical work.</P>
      <P>Although the social employment scheme was launched in February 1985 the first projects did not come on stream until May.  Regional statistics were first compiled in July.</P>
      <P>The regional details, stating the position on the last Friday in each month since July 1985, are set out in the following tabular statement.</P>

Grant aid under the scheme is allocated to individual applications from both public and voluntary bodies throughout the country.  There is no allocation on a county basis.</P>

I am currently reviewing the scheme with a view to widening the eligibility criteria and consequently enlarging the number of potential participants.

      <P>I will be extending the provisions of the Act to six further State enterprises so as to allow worker directors to be appointed to the boards of these enterprises.  The enterprises are: Aer Rianta, Bord Gáis Éireann, Foras Forbartha, National Rehabilitation Board, Irish Steel and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the principle of worker participation not alone at board level but also at levels below the board. As a result the amending legislation will also provide for the establishment of subboard participative arrangements in a broad range of State enterprises on the request of a majority of employees.</P>

      <P>The total number of posts in my Department on 31 December 1985 was 841.  In addition, there are 86 temporary clerical trainee posts which have recently been allocated to my Department.  (Of these, 77 have been assigned).  I propose to circulate a detailed breakdown of the posts by grade in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>For management purposes, my Department is divided into four main areas, each under the direction of an assistant secretary.  These are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  Manpower policy including National Manpower Service and work creation schemes.</P>
      <P>2.  Safety, Health and Welfare.  This assistant secretary also has responsibility for Personnel, Finance.</P>
      <P>3.  Industrial Relations, Equality legislation and new legislation.</P>
      <P>4.  International Organisations, Conditions of Employment, Redundancy and Insolvency.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate more detailed information in tabular form in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1417" /> for Labour if the draft proposals on reform of the Industrial Relations Act, 1906, will provide a right to strike, without conditions; if so will a secret ballot be a prerequisite of such a right, what the position will be on secondary picketing, one-man pickets and inter-union disputes, and the other amendments he considers necessary to achieve an improved industrial relations climate that is less strike prone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March last year my Department published proposals for the reform of industrial relations.  These proposals committed the Department to a fundamental review of trade dispute law.  Since then the Department have had detailed discussions with both sides of industry, have completed their review and last month published detailed proposals for virtually the complete replacement of existing legislation.</P>
      <P>The new system will be based on a positive right to strike.  Under existing law all industrial action is presumed to be unlawful save where the 1906 Act confers immunity from liability for the unlawful actions involved.  I believe that this approach is archaic and that the time is long overdue for the Oireachtas to recognise in a positive way the democratic rights of workers in the latter part of the 20th Century.  The proposals envisage that new legislation would recognise the right to strike and to take industrial action.  Where workers exercised these rights in accordance with the legislation they would enjoy a complete defence in all civil legal proceedings arising from the strike or other industrial action.  The legislation would represent a radical departure from the present immunity-based approach where all strikes or other industrial action are at risk of being unlawful unless very specifically granted statutory immunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that, given the comprehensive nature of the proposed complete defence, limitations on its exercise are necessary given industrial relations, legal and public <Col N="1418" /> interest considerations.  The proposed limitations are set out in full in the Department's proposals.  Among the situations which would not be protected are the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Cases involving personal injury, trespass, occupations or damage to property.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Unlimited picketing.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Industrial action or picketing by or concerning one individual worker where the agreed procedures normally availed of in the employment concerned had not been resorted to and exhausted and where the employer concerned had not acted in disregard of such procedures.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Where a minority of workers took strike or industrial action after a majority in the trade union concerned had formally voted against such a course in a secret ballot.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A strike or industrial action arising from a dispute between &lsquo;workmen and workmen&rsquo; would not enjoy the &lsquo;complete defence&rsquo; unless the dispute otherwise met the definition of &lsquo;trade dispute&rsquo; in the legislation.</P>
    <P>A further important part of the reform proposals is that trade unions will have to include provisions on secret ballots in their rule books.  Where a secret ballot is held and reasonable notice given, major advantage will result for unions in that there would be severe restrictions on the granting of both interim and interlocutory injunctions.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the specific points raised in the Deputy's question. The exercise of the right to strike would not be conditional on the prior holding of a secret ballot.  Trade unions would be required to have a provision in their rule books requiring a secret ballot before strike or other industrial action was taken.  As I have stated, a strike or other industrial action in defiance of the outcome of a secret ballot would not enjoy legal protection, and the main benefits of the proposed changes in injunction procedures would apply only where a <Col N="1419" /> secret ballot had been held by the union and strike notice of at least a week given. Secondary picketing would enjoy legal protection only where the second employer concerned had acted in a way calculated to frustrate the primary strike. One-man pickets would normally enjoy legal protection only where the relevant procedures had been resorted to and exhausted.  Inter-union disputes would not enjoy legal protection unless the dispute otherwise met the definition of &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; in the legislation.</P>
    <P>In response to the last point in the Deputy's question, I do not believe that there are other major changes in trade dispute law which could help to bring about an improved industrial relations climate.  There is a great deal that could be done in other areas, however, in order to help achieve this objective.  Among the other changes I have proposed are the establishment of a new labour relations commission with responsibility for the promotion of good industrial relations, the introduction of codes of practice in a range of areas and the provision of an improved set of incentives to encourage trade union rationalisation.  Both the proposals for the reform of the 1906 Act and for major changes in our dispute-settling institutions will be the subject of consultation with both sides of industry.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to state clearly that I remain convinced that the law, of itself, cannot improve industrial relations.  Real and lasting improvements can only be brought about through the action and attitudes of managers and workers at workplace level.  The State's role traditionally has been to ensure that the legal framework governing our system of industrial relations should be such as to help the parties enjoy sound, stable relations.  I believe that my Department's proposals for the modernising of trade dispute law and the reform of dispute-settling agencies, will contribute significantly to the improvement of industrial relations in Ireland and hence employment prospects.</P>

      <P>There is no specific prohibition on the insuring of the lives of children under ten years of age but any parent or other person proposing such insurance must show an insurable interest.  The Insurance Act, 1936, permits such insurance but limits the sum payable on the death of a child.  The present limit is £20 in the case of a child under the age of five and £30 in the case of a child aged five years or more but less than ten years.  I propose to increase these limits substantially in the forthcoming Insurance Bill; corresponding changes are proposed in friendly society legislation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the serious public concern at the fact that next to Denmark Irish boys and girls under 18 are the heaviest smokers in Europe; that 50 per cent are known to be habitual smokers; that lung cancer deaths have increased in women by 95 per cent even in the past ten years; that Ireland shares with Scotland and Northern Ireland the highest death rate in the world from coronary heart disease, a major cause of which is cigarette smoking; the plans he has to curb the efforts of tobacco companies in advertising their wares to young people by sponsoring sporting and artistic events; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the serious damage to the nations' health which is caused by tobacco smoking.  There are at present approximately 17,000 deaths from smoking related diseases and it is estimated that 5,000 of these are directly due to smoking.  Research also indicates that cigarette smoking is becoming increasingly prevalent among Irish schoolchildren, particularly schoolgirls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> The Deputy will be aware that I recently laid new tobacco products regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas. These regulations increase the restrictions on the advertising of tobacco products.  Advertisements for, and packages of, tobacco products will be required to display in rotation three warnings and there will be an increase in the space in advertisements devoted to those warnings.</P>
    <P>I am also acutely aware of the powerful impact of tobacco-sponsored sporting and artistic events, in particular in relation to young people.  Research in Britain has shown that the most heavily promoted cigarette brand was also the brand most preferred by children.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the tobacco companies spent £2.2 million on sponsorship in 1984 which represents an increase of 84 per cent over their expenditure in 1980.  It is becoming increasingly obvious that tobacco companies regard sponsorship as a vital part of their sales promotion activities.  It is for these reasons that I intend to bring before Government, in the immediate future, measures designed to limit the effectiveness of tobacco sponsorship.</P>

      <P>In calculating his means, the deciding officer took into consideration the gross yearly income of the farm at £3,372 less expenses, amounting to £1,806 incurred in earning that income, leaving a net profit of £1,566 taken as £1,560 per annum.  The applicant was also treated as having capital amounting to £1,925.  The net yearly value, calculated in the prescribed manner, of his capital was put at £172.50.  The applicant's means were accordingly assessed at £1,732.51 per annum or £33.30 weekly.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the legislation governing the unemployment assistance scheme the value of any benefit or privilege derived by an applicant from any source must be taken into account in the assessment of means.  Following investigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned he was assessed with means of £36 weekly, derived from the maintenance portion of a student grant, the value of board and lodging on his mother's holding, and to a small extent from the value, calculated in the prescribed manner, of capital.</P>
      <P>The maintenance portion of the student grant amounted to £1,000 per annum, and the value of capital to £11.36 per annum.  The net yearly value of his mother's holding was calculated at £6,000 and on a weighted basis the person concerned was deemed to enjoy board and lodging calculated at £861 yearly.  The applicants total means therefore amounted to £1,872.36 per annum or £36 per week.  Accordingly, his claim to unemployment assistance was disallowed on the grounds that his means exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to him.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory conditions which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts provide that a person must: (i) have entered into insurance before reaching age 55; (ii) have reckonable contributions <Col N="1447" /> paid in respect of at least 156 weeks of insurable employment and (iii) have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions, paid or credited, over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from the year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching age 65.</P>
      <P>The revised insurance record of the person concerned indicates that he entered into insurance under the Acts after he reached age 55 and that he has a total of 51 reckonable contributions since that entry.  Only 36 of these were paid contributions and the total of 51 is equal to a yearly average of only five in the relevant period.  He does not, therefore, satisfy any of the required conditions and does not qualify for a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts. A total of 50 contributions had originally been recorded on his insurance record and following investigations by the local social welfare officer, one additional contribution was added making a total of 51.</P>
      <P>Prior to his entry into insurance under the Social Welfare Acts he was employed for a number of years in Great Britain. However, in order to qualify under EC Regulations for an Irish <i>pro rata</i> pension, on the basis of his combined British and Irish insurance, he is required under EC Regulations to have a record of paid or credited contributions in respect of not less than 52 weeks in this country.  Since he has a total of only 51 paid and credited contributions under the Social Welfare Acts he does not qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension from the Department under EC Regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither did he qualify for old age contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts nor for a <i>pro rata</i> pension under EC Regulations when he reached age 66.  In relation to old age contributory pension the yearly average requirement is a minimum of 20 reckonable contributions and the relevant period ends at the end of the last complete contribution year before the one in which the claimant reaches age 66.  The requirement for 52 <Col N="1448" /> contributions in order to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension under EC Regulations also applies.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 23 September 1985.  According to the Department's records he did not satisfy the contribution condition of having 26 contributions paid or credited in the contribution period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 which governed his entitlement to unemployment benefit from 23 September 1985.</P>
      <P>The matter of non-payment of contributions by his former employer was investigated by a social welfare officer. The investigations have now been completed and his claim has been allowed at the appropriate rate of unemployment benefit of £38.05 weekly, from 23 September 1985.  In addition, based on his earnings in the tax period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984, he is also entitled to £2.15 weekly pay-related benefit from 14 October 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements have been made to commence weekly payments of £40.20 this week and when the amount of supplementary welfare allowance advanced to him pending a decision on his claim is <Col N="1458" /> known, the balance of any arrears due to him will be paid.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate an applicant must satisfy certain conditions, including an assessment of means.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 1 August 1985 and the case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of her means.  She was not, however, available for interview when the social welfare officer called to investigate her means and consequently no further action could be taken in her case.

      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment benefit, on his claim of 23 December 1985, cannot be determined until a number of inquiries have been completed.  A claimant for unemployment benefit who is a beneficial occupier of land but who does not satisfy the contribution condition of having 78 <Col N="1461" /> contributions paid in a three year period is not entitled to unemployment benefit if the income from his holding exceeds £2 daily.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is a beneficial occupier of land who does not satisfy the condition of having 78 contributions paid in a three year period.  Accordingly, inquiries are being made to establish if the income from his holding exceeds £2 daily.  Further inquiries are being made to ascertain the reason his latest period of employment terminated.  When all inquiries are completed his entitlement to unemployment benefit will be determined. The Department has no record of an application for a refund of pay-related social insurance contributions by the person concerned.  However, if the Deputy will furnish further details the matter will be investigated.</P>

The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 15 July 1985 and on the information available, his claim was disallowed on the grounds that he was not available for employment.  He appealed against the disallowance and at an appeal hearing on 29 October 1985 the person concerned attended and was given an opportunity to present his case but the appeals officer <Col N="1462" /> also decided he was not available for employment.</P>
      <P>He continued to sign the unemployed register and following inquiries to establish his availability for employment from 30 October 1985 his claim was again disallowed. He appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing on 15 January 1986 but the appeals officer again also decided he was not available for employment.  He has been informed of his right to continue to sign the unemployed register and his claim will again be reviewed regarding his availability for employment from the day following the appeals officer's decision.</P>

      <P>The amount voted for Agriculture for 1985 was £252 million and the provisional outturn of expenditure for the year was £225 million &mdash; a difference of £27 million.

      <P>It should also be noted that, if the large number of claims under the weather damage relief schemes could have been dealt with before the end of 1985, £20 million of the £27 million would have been spent in that year instead of having to be met from the 1986 Vote.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The financial provision for bovine TB and brucellosis eradication in 1986 was decided by the Government in the context of the overall budgetary situation and having regard to the various demands on scarce Exchequer resources.</P>
      <P>It is expected that anticipated activity in 1986 on brucellosis eradication and depopulation of badly infected herds &mdash; met from subheads C3 and C5 respectively &mdash; can be accommodated within the amounts provided.  In the case of tuberculosis, the emphasis will be on the counties and areas of highest disease prevalence.</P>
      <P>Building on the experience of the current round ending in March and during which the national herd will, on average, have been TB tested about one and a half times, special programmes will be drawn up to concentrate activity on areas which can be expected to give the best return in terms of identifying reactors and reducing disease spread.  The increased provision under subhead C4 is intended mainly to cover a possible liability, the precise outcome of which has still to be determined.</P>

As part of this strategy ACOT have drawn up a specific programme for reducing calf losses involving improved animal husbandry and management, disease control and prevention in addition to the supervision by the farmer of every calving.</P>

      <P>As indicated in reply to a question on 22 January it has not been possible to take account of the quality of fodder in the assessment of the fodder deficiency of individual applicants as this would have necessitated on-farm inspections of some 80,000 applicants.  However, in calculating individual allocations a generous allowance has been made for the generally poorer feeding quality of fodder.</P>
      <P>Assessment of fodder deficiency under the scheme is based on the particulars of the quantity of fodder and the livestock numbers given by applicants themselves and appeals can only be considered on the basis of these particulars and the conditions of the scheme.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this is an application for registration of a transfer of part of property.  It was originally lodged in the Land Registry on 8 January 1985 but was rejected on 17 January 1985. It was subsequently relodged and rejected on 17 and 27 February 1985 respectively. It was relodged on 20 March 1985 and rejected on 17 April 1985.  It was again relodged on 30 July 1985. Because of the pressure of work in the Land Registry consideration of the application has not yet been completed but is expected to be completed in the near future.</P>

      <P>The main factor which has influenced the timing of the introduction of this legislation has been the range of legal issues, primarily of a technical and definitional nature, which have had to be addressed in drafting the Bill.  It is my aim to circulate the Bill after the Easter recess although no firm date for circulation can be given at this stage.</P>
      <P>Under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, worker directors have been elected to the boards of seven State enterprises (i.e. Aer Lingus, B &amp; I, Bord na Móna, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, CIE, ESB and NET).  The amending legislation will allow the appointment of worker directors to the boards of an additional six enterprises (i.e. Aer Rianta, Bord Gáis, Foras Forbartha, National Rehabilitation Board, Irish Steel Limited and the VHI).  In addition, the amending legislation will enable the introduction of participative arrangements below board level in a broad range of State enterprises on the request of a majority of employees.</P>

      <P>The levels of statutory lump sum payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1984, are based on multiples of the wage levels of the individual workers concerned.  Accordingly, the amounts of such payments increase automatically in line with increases in general wage levels. The Acts do provide for a ceiling of a maximum amount of wages to be taken into account in calculation of individual lump sum entitlements.  The level of that ceiling, which has been increased from an amount of £5,000 per annum set in the Redundancy Payments Act, 1979, to £11,000 at present, is kept under review.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any review of the amounts of redundancy lump sum payments must take account also of the costs for employers and for the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund.</P>
