      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question on the Order of Business which will be very brief.  Will the Taoiseach inform the House, in view of the serious situation that has arisen in regard to the total breakdown of law and order in Northern Ireland and the gross breaches of security that have taken place, of the role of the Inter-Governmental Conference in this whole area?  When is it proposed to have a meeting of the Conference to deal, as a matter of urgency, with this very serious on-going problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy was present yesterday when we had this for quite a while but I must point out to him that it does not arise in this way.  I am sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I should like to make is that we have here the only democratic assembly on this island in the form of Dáil Éireann and this is surely the place where matters of this kind should be debated.  Yesterday the Ceann Comhairle refused to allow our party leader to pursue the matter and yet the Taoiseach proceeded to make a statement outside the House which got widespread publicity. Indeed, it was an innocuous anodyne statement but it was made outside the House rather than in here in the Irish people's democratic assembly.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I went to considerable trouble yesterday to explain &mdash; I thought I had explained &mdash; that this matter does not arise in this way.  It is not in order on the Order of Business.  We do not have a procedure here for an impromptu Taoiseach's question time.  It does not fall within Standing Orders and I am not going to allow it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach to make a serious comment in the House about his perception of the role of the Inter-Governmental Conference which was regarded by the Government during the debate on the Hillsborough Agreement as a central element of that treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I wish to protest about the sporadic manner in which the Order of Business arrives at our office. We did not receive it today and this happens quite frequently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am requesting the people responsible to do something about this.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to make a statement to the House expressing the opinion of the country regarding the death of the Swedish Prime Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that that can be done by putting the question to the Whips.  I have just ruled out of order a question by Deputy Lenihan and I regret to say that Deputy Mac Giolla's question falls into the same category.  If the Chair were to allow serious and interesting matters to be raised on the Order of Business we would not get to the Order of Business until midday.</P>

      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate when the Government propose <Col N="895" /> to circulate the Finance Bill?  In asking that I am relying on the rules and procedures of the House.  I should like to have a clear indication regarding this matter so that we will have sufficient time to debate the Finance Bill this year, unlike last year.  The Bill must pass all stages by a certain date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I was making the point that this section would do very little to resolve the problems relating to the licensed trade which were raised here by a number of Members.  While by way of his amendment the Minister is going some of the way towards dealing with that problem, if he had accepted in full the amendment tabled by us the matter would have been resolved more satisfactorily and the Bill would have been improved.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister to give further consideration to the section.  Am I allowed deal with the section generally?</P>

      <P>No.  We are on amendment No. 11 and with that amendment are being discussed amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 16.  When we have disposed of those and of any other amendments to the section we will deal with the section itself.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 11 was introduced to allay fears expressed by Deputy Hyland and by representatives of the Licensed Vintners' Federation that the Revenue Commissioners were being given discretionary powers in relation to the renewal <Col N="900" /> of intoxicating liquor licences.  For drafting reasons, which were explained earlier in the debate, it was not possible to accept the wording of amendment No. 12 which was tabled by Deputy Hyland but the point is met by amendment No. 11.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion on which the Bill was debated Deputies Hyland and Cowen welcomed this amendment and said it met their objective but later Deputy Hyland expressed the fear that in some way the provision would undermine existing controls including the power of objecting to the renewal of the licence. At that point he spoke in favour of his own amendment, No. 12, which would substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; in subsection (2) of section 4.  Deputy Hyland's amendment would not have made any difference to the power of objecting to a renewal.  That power is built into section 4 by virtue of the provisions of subsections (5) and (6). Accordingly, it is not clear as to how Deputy Hyland logically can object to amendment No. 11 on the basis that it would diminish the powers of objecting to the renewal of liquor licences.  That would not be the case.  The powers and facilities for objecting to the renewal of licences continue unchanged and are not affected by the amendment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is clear.  It simply removes the necessity for the production of a District Court certificate except in the cases referred to in subsection (5) which include the case of an objection being made to the renewal of a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about subsection (2) and there is not much I can say that would clarify the matter further.  However, for the record it might be useful if I outlined briefly the purpose of this subsection which forms the central provision of section 4.  Subsection (2) proposes to give to the Revenue Commissioners power to renew intoxicating liquor licences without the applicant having to produce a certificate of the District Court.  The purpose of the proposal is to contribute towards a more streamlined and simplified working of the Court.  The advantage will be seen by way <Col N="901" /> of a major reduction in the preparation for the licensing sessions by the court clerks.  Consequently, they will be able to concentrate on more important work and undoubtedly a more straightforward system of renewal will be of more benefit to licence holders.</P>
    <P>The power of objection to renewal by members of the public will not be diluted in any way.  The only difference will be that a future notification of intention to object will have to be given in writing in advance of the annual licensing sessions. There is general agreement that a system whereby people can stand up in court and, without prior notification to anyone, object to the renewal of a licence was rarely used and could be abused.</P>
    <P>Deputies Hyland and Cowen expressed the fear that under the new system for renewal of licences people who wished to object to the renewal of any licence might be unaware of the date of the annual licensing session at the District Court where such objections would be heard.  I appreciate their concern on this point, concern that has been expressed to me by a number of other people also but the experience has been that people with a genuine interest are aware of the date of the court.  It has not been the general practice to place advertisements in the newspapers advising people of the date of the annual licensing court though for special reasons advertisements did appear in 1954 and in 1984.  However, in view of the concern that is being expressed I will consider having advertisements placed in the newspapers in advance of the date before which objections must be notified.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, amendment No. 11 is intended to allay fears that the Revenue Commissioners were being given a new discretion in relation to the renewal of liquor licences.  I should hope that the wording of the amendment is such as to make it clear that there is no foundation for this fear and that the amendment together with the associated amendments, Nos. 13 and 16, which are purely consequential, can be accepted without further debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the appointment of the new Minister for Justice and I wish him every success in his new role. I do not have to remind the House that the Minister has assumed a very onerous and difficult task.  The Minister made the point in relation to this section that the transfer of responsibility for the renewal of liquor licences from the District Court to the Revenue Commissioners was a streamlining and a simplifying of the procedures in the District Court.  He made the point also that this would remove some of the burden of work at District Court level.  The Minister must be aware that the amount of time involved annually in the District Court in the matter of the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences is minimal.  The ground work is done by the District Court clerks and the granting of the licences, except in cases where there were objections, involved only some ten or 15 minutes at the court sitting.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I reiterate the point I made on Second Stage that the Bill does nothing to simplify the procedure or to lessen the volume of work at District Court level. I appreciate that the Minister has gone some of the way towards meeting the concern expressed by Members and in particular the concern I expressed on the last occasion, but the proposal outlined in the Bill is over-simplifying the system of renewal of intoxicating liquor licences from the public point of view.  I say this particularly at a time when there is growing concern among the community about the increase in the use of alcohol and also about the great abuse of alcohol, particularly among young people.  Any move towards legislation that would simplify and liberalise the licensing laws would be a move in the wrong direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of liberalising and making more flexible the licensing laws we should be doing the opposite.  I had intended on the last occasion to bring to the attention of the Minister the free availability of, for example, wine in supermarkets.  I meant on the last occasion, under this section, to bring to the Minister's notice and attention the free availability of, for example, wine in supermarkets where <Col N="903" /> young people can go and purchase unlimited quantities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>To be more specific and to confine myself to the section, as I already outlined, we should endeavour in relation to the licensing laws to ensure that we have a situation whereby the public can feel free to object and express a view as to how they operate at present. From a vintner's point of view, the ordinary decent vintners, the vast majority of whom conduct their business in a creditable fashion.  There are always the cowboys who abuse the system.  Therefore, the vintners regard the annual licensing court as an opportunity for them to be given a certificate of fitness in relation to their own performance.  Many vintners expressed that viewpoint to me since the introduction of this Bill.  It was an endorsement of their ability to run what is known in the trade as a &ldquo;good house&rdquo;. They also, confining myself to the section, saw the licensing court as an <Col N="904" /> opportunity both for the public and themselves to raise objections in relation to premises which were not well run and where abuses of the licensing laws took place.  It is for that reason I regret very much that the new Minister could not find it possible to come further along the road towards meeting the amendment which I tabled.  As I already indicated, it is an area which needs tightening up rather than more flexibility and liberalisation. The Minister has already indicated that between now and Report Stage he will give serious and sympathetic consideration to going all of the way towards meeting our views and wishes in this area. I can assure the Minister there is no political gain in this.  It is simply an amendment tabled out of extreme concern for the many people at present who hold strong views on the licensing laws and what this House should be doing in relation to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Hyland in wishing the Minister every success in the Department of Justice.  He was an excellent Minister for Finance.  In connection with this amendment, Deputy Hyland made the point that he would be against liberalisation of the existing laws.  I do not think this section is going to liberalise the laws in any respect.  Deputy Hyland would not be in favour of prohibition either on the sale of drink.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider the amendment.  I would be reluctant to take away from the District Courts jurisdiction over annual licensing which comes up in September. Normally they are finished inside 20 minutes. It does necessitate the District Court clerk having to go to the trouble of preparing the list of licensees and publicans of a particular area.  There is a certain amount of work which has to be carried out physically by the District Court clerk in every town.  Nevertheless, and experienced people will agree, over the years problems do occur about licences on the death of a holder of a licence, and on the sale, transfer or letting of a property.  It is a great safeguard for the holder of a publican's licence to know <Col N="905" /> that the matter was checked out by his solicitor, the District Court clerk, by the District Court justice and the Garda.  He has that safeguard in the back of his mind that everything is perfectly in order once the renewal is confirmed in the District Court.  It is good to have it recurring each year.  There are never any great problems which cannot be sorted out in the District Court.</P>
      <P>I will give the Minister a few examples of problems which I could see.  I came across one instance of a person selling a licence where between the date of the selling of the property and the transfer to the new owner the original licence holder died.  Confusion arose over the title which went on for a long time, extending into a second year.</P>
      <P>Such a situation can cause enormous problems.  The Revenue Commissioners stick rigidly to the regulations.  I do not mean in any way to be disrespectful to the Revenue Commissioners but if you get in touch with them you find you are not able to put forward your viewpoint, have a discussion and get their viewpoint. If a difficulty arises on a licence in the District Court, where the power is with the District Court as distinct from the Revenue Commissioners, the district justice will have a certain amount of discretion in sorting out the legal problems. There are vast areas of potential pitfalls for anybody involved in the transfer of a licence.  The district justice analyses and sorts out the problems there and then with the help of the Garda and the solicitor for the applicant.  The Revenue Commissioners may not be well versed in the law or approachable.  You may not be able to put forward the case properly and I can foresee many problems. I am saying that from an objective viewpoint. I have no personal interest in any way.  Nobody pays a fee in regard to the renewal of licences.  The work is carried out by the District Court clerk and the District Court justice.  It is something I would not rush into and I would ask the Minister to be very careful.  I do not know if the Ceann Comhairle will allow me, but section 4 (3) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> Where a renewal of a licence is granted by an officer of the Revenue Commissioners in pursuance of subsection (2) of this section and false or misleading information was given to the Commissioners in support of the application for such grant...</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Enright should keep to the amendment which is concerned only with the dispensing of a District Court certificate on renewal of a publican's licence where the premises had been licensed in the preceding year.  We will deal with the matter being raised by the Deputy when we come to that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In an instance such as that in section 3 the Revenue Commissioners can grant a licence after false or misleading information is given.  A person with the best will in the world can furnish information that to him is neither false nor misleading.  The person may not be clear about what precise licence he has. There is a great variation in the licences, and there is a grey area.  When the Revenue Commissioners grant the licence the publican is later convicted in the District Court and may lose his licence.  Once the case is dealt with in the District Court the Revenue Commissioners will not be able to analyse the position in regard to the licence.  Because this cannot be done they will grant a certificate even though information may be false or misleading but it may have been given in honesty and in good faith.  For a person to find himself in this difficulty is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points raised by Deputy Hyland about the amount of time taken up at the annual licensing sessions. Nevertheless, the procedure proposed in this Bill will bring about a useful simplification of work for the District Court clerks.  They can therefore devote that amount of time to other pressing matters. As pointed out earlier, the measure we are talking about is one that was recommended by the rules committee for inclusion in the rules of the courts.  That was done for a perfectly sensible reason which seems to be that this is a streamlining in <Col N="907" /> procedures that can be brought about with convenience both to the court and to the licence holders.  I am glad Deputy Enright agrees with me that this is not a liberalising measure.  It does not liberalise the licensing laws.  It will not result in there being an extra facility for people who apply for a renewal of a licence.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hyland mourns the prospect of the passing of the licensing sessions in the courts on the basis that the court is the place to raise objections.  I fully agree with that.  We are not interfering in any way with the ability of people to raise objections in court, or with the availability of the court as a forum in which to raise objections.  As regards Deputy Enright's comments, in any case where there is contention between the average midland solicitor, not to speak of the above average ones, and the Revenue Commissioners my experience has been that the solicitor has no difficulty whatever in holding his end up in an argument. Transfers of licences for whatever reasons have to come before the court. The provision now being discussed does not in any way affect that.  In the case referred to by Deputy Enright the transfer of the licence would come before the court, would be subject to the kind of scrutiny to which it is already subject and would be open to be discussed in the same way as such transfers are now discussed.  I do not intend to stray into subsections (3) and (4) now but I have noted the comments made by Deputy Enright and will refer to them later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Minister's amendment is that where a renewal of a licence is required for a premises which has been licensed in the immediately preceding year it shall not be necessary to produce a certificate of the District Court to an officer of the Revenue Commissioners empowered to grant a renewal of such a licence.  If the renewal application is for the immediately preceding year it will not appear in court.  We all appreciate the value of speeding up court procedures.  The Minister <Col N="908" /> will naturally have our full support in that.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear more from the Minister about the extent to which this will bring about savings in time.  Has the Minister done any quantification of the savings which will result?  When I saw this originally in the recommendation in relation to the rules of the court, it seemed like a very good idea in that it would bring about reasonably substantial savings.  When you look into it further you find in fact these are dealt with fairly summarily and quickly each year.  The savings which we thought might be involved initially will not be of the order we first thought.</P>
      <P>The renewal application can be presented publicly in open court.  There are two elements to this.  On the one hand an application is being made where everyone can see and hear it in public, in open court.  Anyone who happens to be in the court will see, perhaps even by accident, that these things happen and that a person is free to go into open court and make objections.  That element is being withdrawn from the normal procedure. On the other hand, if the publican is a very well-meaning, wellintentioned businessman carrying out his business in a proper and upright way, he will no longer have his name presented in court as being a suitable and fit person to do this business.  These are not major elements.  A change is taking place which we do not see at first sight.  We are all very anxious to remove the heavy workload from the courts and to do everything we can to assist in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points made by Deputy Enright and my colleague Deputy Hyland are relevant.  Perhaps we cannot have that kind of progress without losing something. Should there be some form of annual publication of a list of the people being approved in this respect?  It is taken back into the domain of the Revenue Commissioners who have the power to grant renewal and it will no longer be necessary in the vast majority of cases to have a court presentation at all.  On the grounds of management by exception it is a good idea and something we will <Col N="909" /> support.  The distinction between these matters seen to be placed before the court and before the people and being placed before some well meaning official in a room which is not an open court, is something we are removing by this measure.  One could say it is the price of progress but there might be some way of compensating by publishing a list.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister, as Minister for Finance, was concerned to publish a list of people who were late or were defaulting on the Revenue Commissioners.  That sort of list is now circulated with all the VAT returns.  It is a routine thing.  It applies mostly to the decent generally law abiding citizen who, when he slips a few days behind in payment, gets a notice to say that if he does not catch up quickly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Here we are going away from the open court.  In his calculation would the Minister estimate the projected savings resulting from this measure?  Does the Minister think there is any merit in any form of publication within the District Court which would at least maintain the continuity of the presentation of the person as being a fit person and the fact that a control process takes place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be a misunderstanding, I will refer to what Deputy Hyland said earlier.  The Deputy was under the impression that I had said I would give further thought to the question of the certificates.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the savings, Deputy Woods said it now appears that the savings are not as great as was originally thought.  I cannot quantify the savings but the rule committee took the view, and I take their advice, that there would be significant savings. Going back through the debate I cannot find any suggestion on the part of my predecessor in this office that the savings would be enormous.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but one usually stands up to speak.  If there is a disappointment in regard to expectations, they are expectations which Deputy Woods built for himself rather than any claim made for the Bill.  One of the criticisms of the Bill, in spite of the very straightforward approach taken to it by my predecessor, was that this was not a fundamental reform.  It was never represented as a fundamental reform.  I do not want to introduce unnecessary contention into the debate but I detect a certain inconsistency in the argument being made by the Opposition.  I fully understand their concern with controls and so on, but the amendment put down by the Opposition which proposes to substitute the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; by the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is totally out of keeping with the kind of concern they are expressing.  The effect of that would be to require an officer of the Revenue Commissioners to renew the licence on application without having regard to whether the requisite duty had been paid. <Col N="911" /> The amendment put down by the Opposition would dilute the controls.  My amendment does not in any way dilute the control that we would have on the issue of licences.</P>
      <P>Where there are objections to the renewal of a licence the court procedures still apply.  Where there is a transfer of a licence, the court procedures still apply. It is in the vast majority of cases, where there is no objection to the application and no difficulty, that the measure I am proposing brings about this gain in both the administrative practice, the time of the court and in the time of the applicant.</P>

      <P>This section is to some extent confusing in relation to structural alterations.  Earlier the Minister made the point that the whole purpose of the Bill was to streamline procedure in the District Courts.  I suppose it would be difficult for the Bill to specify what is meant by structural alterations, but in view of the progress and the need for constant upgrading of licensed premises I can see this section presenting great difficulties for the licensed trade generally. What does the Bill regard as structural alterations?  Because of the general vagueness of the section I can envisage that the applicant for the renewal of a <Col N="913" /> licence, because of doubts in his or her mind, will notify the Revenue Commissioners or will apply to bring that instance to the notice of the courts, which will lead to more confusion and more complication of the system at District Court level.  The Minister should be more specific in this section and try to give some indication as to what is meant by structural repairs. My interpretation of structural repairs as it should relate to this Bill would be where planning permission is required, say, from a local authority.  We will have to have some method by which structural repairs can be identified&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will be happy to wait to hear the Minister in relation to it. However, I want to say to him in advance of his reply, and to speed up the general process of debating Committee Stage, that this is a great weakness which has been brought to my notice by members of the licensed trade and could lead to utter confusion at either commissioner or District Court levels because people will not know at either level where they stand in relation to it.  I would like the Minister to be more specific and keep my point in mind that structural repairs should relate only to instances where planning permission is required in the first instance from a planning authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I moved amendment No. 14 and No. 17 is being taken with it.  They derived from the fact that, where licensed premises have been altered in area since <Col N="914" /> the license was granted or last renewed, it is a matter for the courts to decide whether the premises as altered remain substantially the same.  If they are substantially the same the District Court has jurisdiction to grant the renewal certificate. If the court decides that the premises are not substantially the same then an application must be made to the Circuit Court for a certificate enabling the issue by the Revenue Commissioners of a new licence.  This usually happens when licensed premises are extended.  However, it appears that it can happen also even where there is no extension in area but there is a substantial change, in the identity of the structure, so to speak.  In addition to that, at the request of the licensee the renewal certificate granted by the District Court can specifically restrict the licensed portion of the premises. Section 4(11) (a) was designed to ensure that licences would not be renewed by the Revenue Commissioners where the structural alteration was such that a new licence was required.  We have received representations to the effect that this provision requiring the applicant for renewal to inform the Revenue Commissioners of every structural alteration would impose an undue burden on the licensee since in many cases minor alterations are carried out which do not affect the existing licence.  The fact that there has been structural alteration which may necessitate a determination by the courts as to whether a new licence is required is normally brought to the attention of the court by way of objection by the Garda. Such an objection would be covered under section 4 (5) (a) and (6).  If on the hearing of such an objection the District Court decides that the premises are not substantially the same as the premises previously licensed, then the licensee will have to apply to the Circuit Court as a preliminary to the grant of a new licence by the Revenue Commissioners.  In the circumstances it appears that section 4 (5) (b), 4 (11) (a), referring to cases where there have been structural alterations to premises, can be safely omitted without diminishing the existing controls. In that way the amendments we are now <Col N="915" /> discussing meet the points raised by Deputy Hyland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point made by the Minister, while I appreciate that the amendment will go some way towards meeting our reservations in relation to that matter, it does nothing for the individual applicant in terms of being able to decide whether the minor alterations which he has carried out to his premises during the year require notification to either the Revenue Commissioners or the District Court clerk.  The Minister even strengthened my argument when he referred to the fact that improvements other than structural alterations could also affect the application.  Therefore, one would not have to build, for example, an extension to a licensed premises before having to notify the Revenue Commissioners or the District Court clerk.  For example, the applicant may carry out internal alterations, perhaps knocking down an internal wall and allowing two sections of a lounge bar into one, or whatever alterations he might find necessary to carry out during the year.  This will create a great dilemma for the applicant in terms of knowing in advance whether he should notify the authorities, be they the Revenue Commissioners or the court, as to the extent of the alteration.  One way or the other, the applicant is not going to take a chance.  He is not going to put his licence in jeopardy.  Therefore, every alteration to a licensed premises is going to be notified either to the Revenue Commissioners or the courts and that is going to jam the situation instead of streamlining it, which was the Minister's intention in bringing in the Bill in the first instance.  I can see tremendous confusion and duplication of applications and everything else which will slow down the process and lead to unnecessary work in terms of the application to the courts or the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The Bill as it was proposed without the effect of the two amendments I am now putting forward might be claimed to have potentially the effect that <Col N="916" /> Deputy Hyland has just mentioned, but the amendments that I have proposed are designed to take those factors out of it. The normal way in which the question of structural alterations is brought to the attention of the courts is by way of objection from the Garda.</P>
      <P>With the two amendments that I propose, any publican would be perfectly within his rights to consider that he could remodel the interior of his premises, change the furnishings and make all the improvements that publicans make without extending the premises and be happy in the knowledge that would not affect the renewal of his licence.  It is also quite clear, both from existing practice and from what is in the Bill, that if a publican undertakes a major extension of his premises that is clearly a case where structural alterations have been brought about.  The question then as to whether, in terms of the legislation, that means that the premises are not substantially the same as before is one that would have to come to court and be decided there.  If the court were to decide that the premises were not substantially the same, it would be a question of going on with the procedure of issuing a new licence.  If on the other hand the court, having looked at the presentation made to it, decided that it could conclude that the premises were substantially the same, it would simply be a question of renewing the existing licence.  Taking out the two parts of the two subsections mentioned in the amendment would make it clear that it is the existing practice which continues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>We have spent much time debating this section in general.  The only conclusion to which one can come in that <Col N="918" /> respect is that the section does nothing to relieve the burden, congestion or additional work in the District Court.  As I explained in my opening comments, the procedure for the annual renewal of intoxicating liquor licences was a very small fraction of the court's work which took place on one set day of the year and was disposed of within the court in a half hour.  On the other hand, it had the advantage that the decision making took place within the county in which these businesses were being conducted.  The system always was that the annual renewal date for these licences appeared in the local papers as a matter of routine, which brought to the notice of the public that on a fixed day at a fixed time the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences was being considered by the District Court.  The provisions in this Bill in relation to such renewal is a retrograde step because it does nothing to remove the burden of work at court level and takes away from the local scene the function, which perhaps is more important than ever before, of the renewal of these licences. This Bill which was introduced in the interests of court reform generally is just another statistic in legislation which does very little, if anything, to streamline or reform the operation of the District Court.</P>
      <P>The Bill could have been useful and this section, in particular, could have been broadened to deal with off-licence premises to which I referred earlier. Before we reach Report Stage, the Minister should give very serious thought to the fact that young people in this city and many rural towns have direct access through supermarkets to unlimited quantities of wine.  Wine happens to be a cheap drink with a high alcohol content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not tell me last January that wine was cheap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a different portfolio today.  We have to address him in terms of the administration of his new Department, that of Justice.  I am sure the Minister shares with me the concern of parents, teachers <Col N="919" /> and community leaders throughout the country expressed daily in our newspapers, on radio and television about the present very high level of alcohol consumption. I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would not allow me to, but I am not going to go into the broader area of alcoholism except to say that it is becoming a national disaster in terms of lost man days from work and of continual family distress caused as a result of the abuse of alcohol.  I have no objection to the reasonable use of alcohol but in the present social climate with very high levels of unemployment and young people having no real alternative outlets for their daily activities, these young people find themselves to a great extent depending on alcohol to boost their morale.</P>
      <P>When we have this forum to debate and discuss the availability of alcohol, it would be a great tragedy if we did not avail to the greatest possible extent of the opportunity of tightening the law with regard to the availability of alcohol, particularly to young people.  A boy or girl of 11 or 12 years of age can walk into a supermarket, provided he or she has the money, and bring out one or two bottles of wine and go into a retreat with comrades&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person applies for renewal of his licence and there are no problems, the application has to go through the superintendent, so the superintendent will be involved in the process. It may well be that a licence or a premises may have been brought to his attention during the year.  The superintendent will know when the annual licensing session comes about and he can object to a licence. Otherwise, the licence would be renewed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure the Deputy understands the process.  If a superintendent feels he has reason to object to the renewal he will have made a particular note of the matter during the year and he will be able to object to the renewal at the licensing session.  It is the kind of thing I would expect the superintendent to do during the year when premises are brought to his notice.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be an improvement in administration but the Minister will appreciate that he, as Minister, can deal only with things that are brought before him.  In the case of the superintendent, if licence applications go to the Revenue Commissioners and do not come before him formally, he may not know about them.  There has been some discussion about the lack of quantification. The original recommendation from the rules committee was that there could be savings in this area.  It is a deplorable state of affairs in any Department, given that a committee make a general recommendation which would result in savings, that now, several years later, we have never actually quantified the position. Bringing a measure like this before the House without quantifying it shows a very serious lack in the Department.  The Minister may say everybody is very busy and that may be the case, but if it is, there <Col N="923" /> is need to change the operation so that when we come to look at questions like this the Minister will be in a position to have some reasonable quantification to put to Deputies.  We are not in a position to do this.  We are not running the Departments.  As far back as 1984 there were newspaper references to the substantial savings which could be made in this area.</P>
      <P>This Bill was introduced on 14 December 1984 but nothing has been done about it since.  This is a very poor reflection on the way this House is operating and the way factual information is being brought before this House so that Deputies can take decisions on matters like this in the knowledge that there is a well quantified position and if a change has to be made, we will know it is being made for very good reasons.</P>
      <P>Deputies raised a question about how valuable this might be in practice.  They said that all we may be doing is excluding the overview of the Garda from these routine renewals.  That in itself may not be a good thing, although it may be desirable if there are substantial benefits to be obtained.  All we can do at this stage is to take it in good faith that there is reasonable benefit to be obtained, even though it has not been quantified for us, and in that spirit we support this measure. Other elements raise question marks about controls which in practice will exist.  The opportunity to object will be there because it is written into the Constitution that the laws will be conducted in open courts where they will be subject to the scrutiny of the ordinary &ldquo;Joe Soap&rdquo; who comes into the courts and asks what happens in courts, what things are done there and so on.  We are removing this area from that kind of open inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hyland pointed to the fact that a decision which up to now was taken in a specific county will no longer be taken there but will be referred to the Revenue Commissioners.  That is getting back to a removal of local delegated control.  I have no objection where there are substantial benefits and where because of rationalisation <Col N="924" /> and modernisation we have to go along with that kind of development, but I wonder if we are taking away some of the control that exists in those areas.  That is why I ask the Minister to give some consideration to that element before Report Stage, particularly in relation to the publication in the open court of these matters, even though they are being treated as routine.  In that way, the supervision of the open court could still apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two brief points in reply to Deputy Woods. It is not a question of the local Garda inspector or superintendent losing control in any way because at present he does not exercise any control.  What he can do, and will continue to be able to do under the provisions of this Bill, is to object in cases where he believes an objection is appropriate, having given due notice.  As I mentioned before, for somebody to stand up in court and for the first time voice an objection, is unfair to the licensee and is undesirable as a matter of proper procedure.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure that I can agree with much of the rest of what Deputy Woods said.  He claims to find it deplorable that we have not quantified the savings.  We can be sure that any District Court clerk coming to an annual licensing session, since he will not have to prepare for the session, review all the applications, put them in order and make arrangements for the court, will have been saved more time than Deputy Woods spent this morning expatiating on the issue.  This is that kind of issue where it would be very difficult to quantify in terms of numbers of man hours per court clerk, depending on the size of the district being covered by the court.  I am not particularly impressed by that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Bill &ldquo;being left for a long time without being proceeded with&rdquo;, it was published in 1984, the debate was taken as a matter of agreement between the Whips and it was organised for various times during 1985, and now today.  It is always open to the Opposition Whip to ask that a particular Bill be included in the Order of Business for any <Col N="925" /> day in the session.  The Whips meet every Thursday afternoon, or Thursday morning, and fix the business for the following week.  Therefore, there is the opportunity every week for the Opposition to make their concerns known in that way. Although I am happy that today we have got agreement to conclude Committee Stage, I hope the Report and Final Stages will not be delayed.</P>

      <P>I endeavoured to bring to the Minister's attention a point which was represented here by a number of Deputies this morning about the open court aspect.  In relation to the publication of even these routine cases within the court precincts or somewhere locally, I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect.  Deputy Hyland pointed out that because these sessions take place and are published locally each year, ordinary people get to hear about them, not merely people at the various levels of officialdom.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the Minister is not impressed with questions about the savings involved.  It is deplorable that a Minister comes into the House, gives no quantification whatever and can give none.  It should be said that Committee Stage affords Deputies an opportunity to extract that kind of information from various Departments.  It is deplorable that the Minister cannot say, for example, that in such a case this is what would happen.  I would ask the Minister to endeavour to get more of that type of factual information in the future.  I accept that he changed to this Department only recently.  It should be remembered also that all other Departments must quantify every piece of information they supply to the Department of Finance.  Therefore, the quantities are available.  Why conceal them from the public?</P>

      <P>In the same way that there is a specific date laid down for the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences in the District Court, it would be a help if the Minister would arrange that there be laid down a specified time, within certain limiits, within which licences could be renewed through the Revenue Commissioners. I would hope that the Minister would take whatever action is necessary to advertise in the national and local papers, the timespan within which licences can be renewed annually, thereby affording the public an opportunity of having an input into their renewal.  He would also be bringing to the notice of the public &mdash; sometimes these things escape the public mind &mdash; that within that period of time decisions are being taken by the Revenue Commissioners or within the courts system in relation to the renewal of licences.

      <P>The provisions of this section propose an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  On Second Stage I made the point that there is urgent need to update and consolidate all of the Acts under which our laws are administered by our courts.  The Minister would be doing a solid day's work if he would put in train arrangements for the consolidation of all legislation, particularly that under which our courts operate. It is a farce to suggest that our laws are understood by the average citizen. Indeed, it is a reflection on this House that they are not fully understood.  Even if one were to circulate this simple Bill, give it to any member of the public and ask that person to explain in simple language what the Minister is endeavouring to do in regard to its provisions, I would hazard a guess that that individual would be unable to explain or to understand what the Minister is endeavouring to do. On many occasions I burned the midnight oil trying to understand what the Minister was endeavouring to achieve, not in relation to this Bill only but in regard to legislation generally.  The Minister is a practical man.  He should give some thought to having these Bills written in simple, everyday language, easily understood by members of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this section it should be said that the public do not understand the law under the Criminal Procedure Act of <Col N="928" /> 1967, an extremely complex Act.  Even solicitors in court sometimes find it difficult to disentagle its many provisions. One of the great problems is that its provisions are dealt with under so many different Acts.  Therefore it is extremely difficult for an individual, or a solicitor, to pull together all of the strands of law affecting a given case.  If these Acts could be consolidated it would lead to a saving of time and greater efficiency in the judicial and legal system generally.  Apart altogether from that, the citizen has the right to know and to understand the laws governing him.  Burying part of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1967 in this Bill will lead only to further confusion, greater difficulty for the legal profession and the ordinary citizens wanting to define how it will affect them.</P>
    <P>Parts of the section represent a limitation on a citizen's right to liberty.  Nobody is querying the right of a court to remand a person in accordance with section 24 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1967 but the effect of subsection (2) is that if a person is remanded for a period under the Principal Act and the court does not sit on the appointed day he will continue to be held in custody until the next sitting of that District Court.  The example I shall give may be a rare one but it could occur.  We are all aware that on Holy Thursday, Good Friday, Easter Saturday or Easter Monday the courts do not sit and an individual remanded to a sitting of a court on any of those days would be kept in custody until the next sitting day.  In other words, a person who is innocent is remanded in custody until the next sitting of that court.  Something similar could occur at Christmas time although, generally speaking, the legal people are sympathetic to people at that time of the year. It is possible that a citizen may be remanded in custody unfairly and for an excessive period of time.  We must protect the rights of accused people who are considered innocent until found guilty by the courts.  We should not include a provision under which people could be detained for an excessive period in custody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with <Col N="929" /> the first point raised by Deputy Hyland, in relation to the consolidation of legislation. There is no argument that over many areas of our existing legislation it would be desirable to go ahead with work on consolidation.  The Deputy had in mind something that is not all that unusual, a particular part of our body of statute law that goes back over a century and considerably more than a century in some cases.  We have a proliferation of statutes that have to be taken into account in order to arrive at a conclusion on a particular point.  That is entirely desirable but I must point out &mdash; I am sure Deputy Hyland will agree with me on this &mdash; that it is a very time consuming business.  The work involved in carrying out a consolidation process is very time consuming and, given the fact that we do not have an unlimited amount of resources to devote to the drafting of legislation, we have to strike a balance. Generally, the balance tends to come down more in favour of current legislation or legislation that is needed immediately or in the near future.  The Deputy can be assured that I understand and largely share his concern in that regard.</P>
      <P>I am not quite sure what the language of legislation has to do with section 5.  We should not exaggerate the facility with which we might call ordinary everyday language can properly be used in legislation. I have seen cases, and I am sure other Members have seen them, where attempts were made either wittingly or unwittingly to do this and problems arose afterwards in terms of the interpretation of what was in the minds of the legislators at the time.  I will not speak at all about the most celebrated recent instance of attempts to accommodate ordinary everyday language to a highly legal and rather contentious matter.  It is not a simple matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to refer to Deputy Hyland's suggestion that the change we are proposing to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 in effect means that we are burying part of it in this Bill.  That is not what we are doing.  We are not burying <Col N="930" /> anything in the Bill.  We are bringing forward today a particular proposal to make an amendment to an existing statute and I cannot see how that could be classified as burying anything.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Hyland's concern with regard to the protection of the rights of those remanded in custody but I should like to draw his attention to the fact that there are two separate provisions, one concerning those remanded in custody and the other concerning people remanded on bail.  We should be careful that we do not go too far either in second guessing the courts or in restricting or predetermining the results of what a court might decide in any particular case. The Deputy will be aware that courts always have a good reason for remanding somebody in custody rather that on bail. We should be very careful not to second guess the courts on issues like that or to restrict the freedom of courts to take a particular course of action in a case.  The two periods mentioned by Deputy Hyland, Easter and Christmas, are the only times in the year when the problem may arise.  One is tempted to advise anybody who might be in a position of being remanded by a court that if he does not wish to be excessively circumscribed in his liberty he should take care that he does not get into that position approaching Easter or Christmas.  I am fully conscious of the fact, as Deputy Hyland pointed out, that in the case of one of those periods the courts tend to lean more in one direction than another for the reason he mentioned.  The provision we are making is required in order to clarify the position with a view to facilitating the courts and those who appear before them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the section, the Minister proposes certain amendments to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  It provides that if, because of illness, or for any other reason, a district justice conducting the preliminary examination of an indictable offence is unable to proceed and the preliminary examination is continued by another district justice that the latter may, for the purposes of the <Col N="931" /> 1967 Act, treat a deposition or statement taken or signed by the former as if it had been taken or signed by him.  I do not wish to bore the House unduly about this but I must suggest that this amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 should not be contained in a Bill dealing with the courts.  I accept that the Minister did not introduce the Bill but I must point out to him that this provision is lost in the Bill.  It is not hidden from Members. The Minister is openly saying what is happening, but that is not the point.  It would have been possible to bring this criminal procedure amendment forward as a simple Bill and to pass it so that it would be noted in its own right.  Anyone checking on criminal procedure would know that such a change had been made, whereas there is much greater difficulty in finding it in a Courts Act.</P>
      <P>Something similar was done in an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, when it was amended by a very short Act in 1973.  If Bills relating to criminal procedure are incorporated in Bills dealing with the courts it is bound to create difficulties.  The Minister may say that this is related to a Courts Bill in that District Courts are involved but that is not really the case as the amendment is straight forward.  The Bill says that it is an amendment of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, and that is quite clear.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Where under Part II of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, a preliminary examination of an indictable offence is being conducted by a particular justice of the District Court and, owing to the illness of that justice or for any other reason, is continued by another justice, a deposition or statement taken or signed by the former may for the purposes of that Act be treated by the latter as if it had been taken or signed by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no problem in regard to that section but it would be preferable to have it contained in a small Bill which could pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="932" /> quickly and make life much more simple for everyone who has to check on measures of this kind.  Deputy Hyland made the point that these matters should be consolidated and I hope that can be done.  However, until this happens the confusion will remain.  Perhaps the title should be the Courts and Procedure Bill because it deals with two main items, the courts and criminal procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (5) of section 24:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) (a) Where there is no sitting of the Court on the day to which a person is remanded in custody, he shall stand so remanded to the sitting of the Court next held in the same district court district.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where there is no sitting of the Court on the day to which a person is remanded on bail, he shall stand so remanded to the sitting of the Court next held in the same district court area.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This measure is simple in relation to a person on bail because the person is obviously free.  Deputy Hyland raised the question of Christmas and Easter and the Bill mentions the fact that a District Court justice may not be available due to illness, that someone else may have to be called in and that there may be a gap in time.  All that hardly matters to a person on bail, but it is very different when applied to someone in custody.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister thinks I am labouring points but he should remember that the Bill covers a very wide area.  The offence of larceny may be very minor but it is still an indictable offence.  One can also be sent to prison for the nonpayment of fines of the order of £50 or so.  If a person is remanded to Mountjoy he or she is mixing with convicted prisoners, some of whom are serving long sentences.  There is no centre where remand prisoners can be treated differently from those serving sentences.  It <Col N="933" /> would be desirable to have a special remand centre but that is not the case at present.  Our prisons are all overcrowded which creates further difficulties.</P>
    <P>We cannot take a measure like this too lightly because it could be a limitation on a person's right to liberty.  We are obliged to ask questions about writing into law something which is convenient from the point of view of administration but is not very helpful to the person concerned.  A proportion of the individuals concerned will be found to be innocent, regardless of whether the charges against them are serious.  That proportion might be 25 per cent.  We were given percentages in this regard in respect of Mountjoy but obviously the figures vary from time to time.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a system in which people found subsequently to be innocent will have been remanded in custody.  That sounds simple enough but in practice that means, in the Dublin area anyway, being remanded into the company of persons who have been convicted of very serious charges.  I do not know what the practice in Mountjoy is today but earlier the practice was that people from the hospital wing exercised with people on remand. In this day and age that is very undesirable. It is for these kind of reasons that we as members of the Opposition are asking questions about the extension of the remand period.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the subsection is fine. It is a question of remanding on bail and the provision ensures that the system is tidied up administratively and that there are no loopholes.  Likewise, paragraph (a) helps the courts in managing the situation but it involves also a limitation of the citizen's right to liberty.  From that point of view we would wish to be reassured that there is no possible extension of that limitation and that the circumstances in which it might occur would be rare.  There may be prolongation in some parts of the country.  This is a matter that the Minister might consider for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>When we are passing this kind of legislation we do not have available to us all <Col N="934" /> the information from the different situations that can occur throughout the country.  These circumstances are very often brought to our attention by the press.  We might find that there is some provision in the law whereby given exceptional circumstances, even circumstances outside those outlined by Deputy Hyland, a person would be remanded and incarcerated for a period while on remand in custody.  That is the concern we would have in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is included in the Bill because to a large extent what we are doing here is providing for matters for which we should make provision in the context of the court rules.  To that extent it is appropriate for these matters to be dealt with in a Courts Bill.  It seems to me to be absolutely unarguable that if one is talking about giving effect to court rules, a Courts Bill provides the appropriate opportunity.  I ask Deputies on the other side to take that into account.</P>
      <P>It is not without precedent to have criminal provision dealt with in courts legislation.  One example is the Courts Bill, 1980.  Section 31 of that Bill deals with criminal provisions.  So far as I recall Deputy Woods was in a different position then from the position he is in now.  I do not know what his opinion was then but I am putting forward the case as one precedent for the kind of situation we have here now.</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) we are enshrining in legislation something that is covered already in court rules.  Rule 40 of the District Court (Criminal Procedure Act), 1967 Rules, 1967 reads:</P>
      <P>Where in the course of a preliminary examination by a justice such justice is, by reason of illness or other unavoidable cause, unable to complete the preliminary examination and another justice is proceeding with the preliminary examination, the depositions (if any) already taken before such first mentioned justice shall be deemed to have been taken before such last mentioned justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are doing here is removing any <Col N="935" /> danger that there might be grounds on which in such cases it might be considered that proceedings would have to be recommenced. I am sure Deputy Hyland would agree that a sentence which reads:</P>
    <P>the depositions (if any) already taken before such first mentioned justice shall be deemed to have been taken before such last mentioned justice.</P>
    <P>is not one that we would use in common language.  The reason for that kind of phraseology in the rules is to make it absolutely clear that the effect has the precision that is required and that the complete absence of ambiguity would be a characteristic of legislation and rules in this area.  There are times when apparent circumlocution and legal jargon are needed in order to ensure precision.  I only mention this in passing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to take issue with Deputy Hyland.  While he and I will understand that terminology &mdash; he perhaps more than I with greater facility &mdash; there are many people who would not understand it, including those whom we might call mythical people who walk in off the street to the licensing sessions of the District Court and who wish to know what is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Woods wishes to follow that line, I can pursue it too. The provision in section 5 (1) removes any danger of a challenge to rule No. 40. So far as subsection (2) of the section is concerned, I assure both Deputies opposite that the concerns they have expressed in relation to persons remanded either in custody or on bail are very much in my mind in bringing forward the proposal. The House will note that there are two different provisions here.  One relates to someone who is remanded on bail where <Col N="936" /> the provision means that he is remanded to the next court sitting in the same place so that he is not remanded to a court that might be some distance away.</P>
      <P>In regard to a person remanded in custody we are taking the opposite view. We say he is remanded to the sitting in the District Court area that is nearest in time to the first remand.  It might be at a distant location.  In order to ensure that the period of remand in custody is kept to the minimum we are providing that he will go to the next nearest sitting date. This is with a view to ensuring that people are not remanded in custody for a longer time than they need to be before the court, and get the opportunity to hear the case and come to a conclusion.</P>

      <P>That is a fact.  I do not intend to bring in a provision in this Bill to oblige the courts to sit in Easter week. Our Judiciary and court officers need a rest in Easter week just as much as anybody else does.  There are other provisions in other cases as the Deputy will know where, when required, the Judiciary can react quickly to an emergency situation.  These are not the ones we are dealing with here.  I want to assure the House that the concerns which have been expressed about the length of remand in custody are being met in so far as that is possible by the provisions in subsection (2).</P>

As I pointed out, some of these people will be innocent and they are all innocent until proven guilty.

      <P>The collective citation &ldquo;the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts, 1961 to 1986&rdquo;, shall include this Act (other than section 4 and the First Schedule in so far as they relate to the law on intoxicating liquor) and the said Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts, 1961 to 1986 (other than the said section 4 and the said First Schedule in so far as they relate to the law on intoxicating liquor) shall be construed together as one Act.</P>
      <P>Within this Bill we have a fairly serious amendment of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  In relation to the short title can we include in any way the fact that there is an amendment to that Act?</P>

      <P>As I explained when we discussed that provision, what we are doing in relation to section 5 (1) is ensuring that a particular part of the court rules will not be open to challenge.  The same applies to the remainder of section 5. What we are doing is properly dealing with court rules.  The business of dealing with that part of the court rules requires an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  That is why it is in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 7 this Act may be cited as the Courts Act, 1984, followed by the short title.  I would suggest to the Minister that, while he is very concerned about the court rules, I am concerned about people.  We are making an important change in relation to the remand of people in custody and the <Col N="939" /> question of bail.  It is a problem.  The Minister may say it happened before, but that is no reason for doing it again.  The Minister mentioned 1980.  In 1980 I was very busily working on the codification of the law on social welfare.  We produced an Act after enormous difficulty, great pain and suffering as any of the Members of the House who were involved will know, which brought all the previous social welfare legislation up-to-date into one Act.  It is marvellous to have it and we suggested at that time that it should be reviewed every five years as much social welfare legislation goes through the House.</P>
      <P>While consolidation is very valuable &mdash; it does not exist in relation to this area but hopefully will come in the future &mdash; it costs a lot of money as it means that you have so many specialists trying to find out these things for you.  If they are all put together, the legal costs we talk about from time to time for barristers and solicitors etc, are simplified.  The Minister describes this as an amendment of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  If barristers or solicitors, who cost a lot of money, search for this for their clients they will not find it under the short title. They will have to read the Bill itself.  The Minister could consider on Report Stage including in the short title the fact that this Bill also involves an amendment of the Criminal Procedure Act.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Procedure Act deals with the basic rights of citizens, their freedom, their liberty and the circumstances in which they can be detained and incarcerated. If the Minister does not want this mentioned in the title and if he feels that this is principally a Courts Bill and that this is included in a secondary way, is there a possibility of including it in the short title? We have discussed this enough to realise that there are problems in that area.  We are compounding those problems for some reason.  The Minister may give as his reason the fact that it comes from the court rules.  Hereafter it will be included in this Bill.</P>

      <P>This again is a technical amendment. Section 6 when read with the First Schedule amends the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904.  It is therefore necessary to include this amendment in the collective citation of the Registration of Clubs Act, which is what the amendment brings about.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 32, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) This Act, other than sections 2, 3(1), 3(3) to 3(5) and 5 the repeal <Col N="941" /> of those provisions of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, and of the Small Penalties (Ireland) Act, 1873, provided for in section 6, and section 7, shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed therefor by order or orders of the Minister for Justice, either generally or with reference to a particular purpose or provision, and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes a commencement provision in accordance with which certain provisions of the Bill would not come into operation until a commencement date, or commencement dates, to be fixed by the Minister by statutory instruments, are made under the commencement provision.  The reasons for the amendment are that the operation of section 1, which provides for a new section 15 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, depends on new District Court rules.  It now seems that they are unlikely to be promulgated before the Bill is enacted into law.  That operation must therefore be deferred. Section 3 (2) of the Bill proposes a change consequential on section 1 so that the operation of section 3(2) must also be deferred.  Section 4 of the Bill relating to intoxicating liquor licences could probably be operated without the new rules. However, depending on the time of the enactment of the Bill, administrative problems could arise.  It would be preferable to be in a position to delay the operation of section 4 accordingly.  The amendments and repeals provided by section 6 relate in the main to section 4 and therefore likewise fall to be deferred. The only amendments and repeals that do not refer to section 4 are the repeal of the Petty Sessions Act, 1851, the provisions of the Small Penalties Act, 1873, which can operate together with section 2 of the Bill, and the amendment of the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904, for the operation of which the new rules may be required and which should accordingly also be deferred.</P>

It is only after that that I would be in a position to concur with the making of the proposed rules.  It will be done as quickly as possible.

      <P>The introduction of new District Court rules is perhaps the one great merit contained in this Bill.  While I appreciate that the Minister, for obvious reasons, is not in a position to indicate when the rules will be available, would he consider that with the contents of the rules and the extent to which the new rules will alter existing District Court procedure, the changes should be brought to the notice of the House?  I am not saying that they should be done in full detail, but if there are any widespread alterations in relation to the procedure in District <Col N="943" /> Courts surely the Members of this House should be informed of those proposed changes.  It seems strange that we are discussing a Bill the main function of which is to bring into operation new District Court rules.  Yet I, along with my colleague Deputy Woods, do not know what is contained in the new District Court rules.  We do not know how they will affect the performance of the District Court.  We hope that they will lead to greater efficiency and output from the District Court system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems wrong that we should be legislating almost in a vacuum because we are legislating for the introduction of new procedures for the District Court.  I would have hoped and expected that the Minister before the conclusion of this debate would have been able to outline to the House in the broadest details what is envisaged in the new District Court rules.  We have talked a lot in this House over the past 12 months of the need for court reform.  We have expressed the view on many occasions that as far as District Courts are concerned there is a need to increase and strengthen the jurisdiction of the District Courts.  Will the proposed new District Court rules do anything to broaden the jurisdiction of our courts system at District Court level? What other changes are contained in the new District Court rules?  We on this <Col N="944" /> side of the House could not give blanket approval to proposals which hopefully will bring about major District Court reform.  The Minister could not expect blanket approval in a vacuum where we do not know exactly what is contained in the rules.  Before Report Stage, for the purposes of the credibility of this debate, we should be informed in the broadest possible sense as to what is contained in the District Court rules.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Hyland's contention that we are legislating in a vacuum.  We are taking measures that for a variety of reasons appear to be justified.  The new District Court rules would of course come before the House and the Deputy can be assured that they will come before the House in this instance, not necessarily before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 30 together.  I have had two meetings with representatives of the teacher unions, at which the pay dispute was discussed.  These meetings were held on 19 and 28 February 1986.</P>
      <P>An agreed statement was issued after the meeting on 28 February as follows:</P>
      <P>Mr. Patrick Cooney, TD, Minister for Education and Senior Officials met representatives of the three teacher unions this afternoon.  The meeting lasted one hour.  There was an exchange of views on outstanding issues.  The parties were unable to resolve their fundamental differences of opinion.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a willingness within the teachers' unions to have productive talks, and could he in turn drop what apparently is the Government's dogged attitude and so try to end the deadlock?  I know that he is aware of the anxiety and the uncertainty surrounding the holding of the State examinations.  In order to defuse this anxiety, to allay the legitimate fears of parents and to prevent the spread of uncertainty among the students, will he immediately as a matter of urgency initiate these talks again and keep at them until something productive emerges?</P>

Will the Minister agree that in the end no problem is insoluble and every problem must have an ending point to it?  The Government persist in saying that their line is as it was, as it was, as it was, and yet there is a willingness on the part of the other side to be productive.  Would the Minister not agree that it behoves the Government also to be imbued with a fruitful and productive spirit in this very important matter?</P>

A sum of £1,025,500 of this amount was allocated in direct grant-in-aid to national sports organisations under various schemes to assist in the areas of coaching, administration, equipment, international competition and special projects designed to increase participation or improve standards.</P>

May I put it to the Minister that, even with the increase that he boasts about, the amount being provided for sporting organisations is negligible?

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I understand that the committee who were established to examine the requirement of the national sports centre will be submitting their report to me by the end of May or early June.  In the course of their active examination of this proposal the committee, <i>inter alia</i>, have received submissions from the national governing bodies of sport and other interested parties, have met many of these bodies, have carried out a detailed survey of the requirements of the sports bodies, and have inspected <Col N="958" /> possible locations for the siting of a national sports centre.</P>
      <P>Until I have received the report of the committee and have considered their findings and recommendations I regret that I am unable to give any detailed information to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>This is the first time that I have met the Minister of State in his new office and I congratulate him on his appointment.

      <P>This is the first and only major initiative by this Government on the development of sport and it is rather late in the day, three years after this Government came into office, to hold the first meeting of a committee which was set up simply to be seen to be doing something about the national sports centre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="960" /> Education the number of schools built since 1970 which have since been found to have serious structural defects; if his Department have investigated these buildings and can explain the situation; if any estimate is available as to the repair andor replacement cost in these schools; if any action has been taken against builders or architects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if his Department are aware of the serious structural and allied problems in schools (details supplied) in the Dublin 13 area which have resulted in the closure of one of these schools recently and are likely to lead to the closure of another in the very near future; if his Department have assessed the hazards to the schoolchildren and staff; and if he will allocate the necessary funds to allow essential remedial work to commence immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>As regards post-primary schools, my Department have been involved in the financing or grant-aiding of approximately 600 capital building projects at post-primary schools which were completed in the period in question.  There have been four cases among those where serious structural defects have come to light.</P>
      <P>In three of these cases the defects have been remedied at no additional cost to the Department or school authorities concerned.  In the other case the private school authority concerned were advised by the Department in 1981 to take legal advice on the prospect of successfully obtaining legal redress.  The Department have received no further communication in the matter.  No expenditure in respect of remedying the defects has been incurred by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to national schools is that my Department does not maintain a register of applications by reference specifically to structural defects. I have, however, had an investigation carried out by my Department's Primary Buildings Branch, and eight applications <Col N="961" /> have been noted in respect of defects of the type which I believe the Deputy to have in mind in Question No. 9 and which have occurred in schools built since 1970 with grant assistance from my Department.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to two of these schools has been dealt with at some length in the reply given on 30 January 1986 to Deputy Manning's question about two schools in the Dublin 5 area, and I do not think it necessary to repeat what was said on that occasion.</P>
    <P>An application for grant assistance in the case of the four schools referred to in Question No. 22 is under investigation and my Department await submission by the school authorities of detailed reports which are being prepared by the schools' professional advisers.</P>
    <P>My Department in 1984 paid a grant towards the cost of rebuilding a portion of a wall in a national school in Dublin 7.  The collapse had been found on investigation to have been caused by the use of an incorrect type of wall-tie between the school building's inner block wall and its outer brick wall.  The school was unable to take action against the builders as the firm in question had gone into liquidation.  No design fault could be imputed to the professional team which designed the building.</P>
    <P>The eighth case occurred in a County Wexford school built in 1972.  The circumstances were similar to those which obtained in the Dublin 5 schools referred to, where there was a potentially dangerous roof defect.  This defect was not the result of neglect to maintain the premises, having arisen from a feature which was an accepted form of construction at the relevant time.</P>
    <P>As regards the cost in respect of which grants have been paid, it is not my Department's practice to divulge the financial details in individual cases.  I am, however, in a position to say that the total cost of works in the projects in question came to £175,000 approximately, portion of which sum was paid by the school authorities themselves.</P>
    <P>To put the matter in perspective, the <Col N="962" /> Deputies may wish to note that since 1970 my Department have grant-aided a total of 1,379 new schools and major extensions, involving a total grant expenditure of £251 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he was awaiting detailed technical reports from the management.  Would he clarify that in view of the information given to me, and to others, that detailed technical reports on the condition of the schools &mdash; the roofing, lack of insulation and so on &mdash; have already been submitted to his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of new covering to roofs in schools has been deemed as not being structural and therefore has been excluded from consideration of the costs.  To be specific in relation to the information given in reply to the Deputy's question, the manager submitted an independent architect's assessment of the cost of remedying the defects but the Department have asked that a report be submitted from one of the original design team and they are still awaiting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the legal implications for the original design team, given the inaccessibility of the original design team to the management board, and given the likely litigation that might follow, would the Minister not accept that it is next to impossible for the board of management and the community in this area to hope to get one single syllable of a response from the design team?  They have made several efforts to obtain a response but to date they have got nothing. I take it the Department have the engineers' structural report in relation to the community hall.  If what we hear from these technical experts is true&mdash; and I do not think anyone in the area has any reason to disbelieve them because we are not technical people and we depend on them &mdash; that this hall is in a very dangerous condition and could collapse, would the Minister accept first, that there will be no response from the design team and, second, that his Department must <Col N="963" /> come up with the necessary finance to remedy this dangerous situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's concern.  I am following up, through the Department, the request to the original design team.  I too am concerned about this building and I am prepared to discuss the difficulties which have arisen with Deputy Manning and Deputy L. Fitzgerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it is fair that the Department should follow a policy where there is no way these schools can be further grant-aided when structural damage occurs?  I think one of the schools the Minister has in mind is in my constituency, and the Department are not prepared to give further grant aid when a problem arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I have is that the provision of new covering to roofs in schools is not deemed as being structural but, if Deputy Farrelly has a particular case in mind, he might bring it to the notice of the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the present position with regard to the construction of a new vocational school at Gort; if he will outline the future planning stages and a time scale for each stage; and the results of his recent discussions with the educational authorities of all second level schools in Gort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with all post-primary school building projects, the Gort project is subject to review under the terms of paragraph 5.12 of the &ldquo;Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987&rdquo; which stipulates that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions will be initiated... to ensure the maximum of co-ordination <Col N="964" /> and integration in the provision and use of school facilities.  Each building project in course of planning ... will be examined in the context of post-primary school resources generally in the catchment area to determine the practicability of integration or, alternatively, co-ordination of facilities.</P>
    <P>In this context discussions have been held with representatives of County Galway Vocational Education Committee and the secondary school authorities. These discussions are confidential.  Further discussions will be necessary before a decision is taken regarding the future development of post-primary school facilities generally in the Gort area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the <i>Building on Reality: 1984-1987</i> document was published in 1984 which brought about the change the Minister mentions, would he not agree it is about time a decision was taken on this matter? Furthermore, is he aware of the very serious accommodation problem obtaining in Gort vocational school, where there are prefabricated buildings, where one can see the light of day at several points because they are so dilapidated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The document the Deputy referred to is called the <i>Programme for Action in Education 1984-87,</i> a seminal document, prepared and published by my predecessor.  One of the matters for which it provided was discussion with regard to the post-primary requirements of particular areas. Gort is an area where these discussions are taking place.  These discussions are important, quite complex and sensitive because their outcome will, in effect shape the future of post-primary education in Gort for possibly the next 50 years. It is a question of going slowly and, above all, of getting the consent of the various parties concerned so that the new developments in the post-primary area will be contention-free.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern that the matter be moved on as quickly as possible, but discussions of <Col N="965" /> this kind have a certain pace of their own and it is difficult to inject momentum into them.  But, so far as we can, I will ensure that the matter is followed up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that this is simply a holding exercise, that the plans for the new school were at an advanced stage of preparation and that the discussions are merely an excuse to put off the commencement of the construction of the building.  When does the Minister expect to have a final decision on his proposals for the commencement of the Gort vocational school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy was not listening to my reply.  My reply was that because of the policy objectives set out in the document <i>Programme for Action in Education 1984-87</i> discussions would be initiated between all the schools in an area with a view to investigating the practicability of integration or, alternatively, co-ordination.</P>

They are sensitive and confidential and they will continue with all possible haste having regard to the complexity involved. I might repeat to the Deputy that these discussions and their outcome will effectively determine the shape of post-primary education in Gort for the next 50 years.

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the <Col N="967" /> Minister for Education the total estimated savings to the Exchequer from the closure of Carysfort College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated savings to the Exchequer arising from the Government decision to close Carysfort college as a teacher training college must take into account the achievement of a better utilisation of resources in the remaining colleges of education, the future role of Carysfort and the extent to which this might offset projected expenditure in the provision of third-level places and the arrangements made for the re-deployment of staff.</P>
      <P>As the two latter arrangements are dependent on the outcome of detailed discussions which it is proposed to hold at an early date with the management authorities of the Carysfort college and the representatives of the staff respectively, it is not possible at this stage to give a firm estimate of savings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister now saying that the Government's position in relation to the closing of Carysfort college has changed, that they are now negotiating to keep it open?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should define what we mean by &ldquo;closing&rdquo;.  Carysfort, as a teacher training college, will no longer be used for that purpose.  What will happen is that there will be discussions to identify alternative uses for Carysfort in the future, uses which will take account of the more rational utilisation of resources and which might offset projected expenditure in other areas, thereby generating a saving overall for the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In taking the decision, I take it that the Government must have had some idea as to what kind of saving would have been involved?  It would appear from the announcement that it was intended to effect this closure or to put the college to some other use for the purpose of saving money.  Could the Minister indicate what figure the <Col N="968" /> Government had in mind in relation to the saving involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify savings because the amount of savings to be realised will depend on the extent of the rationalisation achieved and the avoidance of duplication of resources and of expenditure.  I am hopeful that, in the final conclusion of this process of discussions, a new regime will be put in place which will be much more cost efficient, effective, and will be, in effect, a rationalisation procedure which will bring with it substantial savings which might not be immediately or readily quantifiable in precise money terms to the last penny.  At that stage undoubtedly it will be possible to indicate an order of magnitude, but it would be premature to do so at this stage having regard to recent developments.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister is telling us now that he has difficulty in relation to quantification.  I want to take up with the Minister the term &ldquo;closure&rdquo; because it would appear that the wording used by Deputy De Rossa was entirely consistent with the wording used in items of correspondence emanating from the Minister's Department &mdash; the closure of Carysfort college.  Therefore, I think that should be put on the record first of all.  Could the Minister give an approximate figure for the saving?  The Government and the Minister's Department must have arrived at some estimate in relation to the net savings about which the Minister talks.</P>
      <P>In regard to the new situation the Minister outlined, in the general sense: are we talking about new management, about the displacement of the Sisters of Mercy?  Are we talking about arrangements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will be speaking on the matter this evening in the debate when I will deal with the points the Deputy raises. But I am not prepared now or this evening to go into any details because I think that would be a bit previous, if I might put it like that, pending discussions with the people who are deeply interested, that is, the management of the college and the staff representatives.  We will be having discussions with them.  I am sure all of us in the House should have common case in this.  We all want to see the best and most rational use made of these excellent facilities.  I take it that the people on the other side are not here to try to score political points out of this. The question on the estimated savings is based, if you like, on the false premise, that being a misunderstanding of the term &ldquo;closure&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Closure&rdquo; refers to the cessor of the college as a teacher training college as we have known it.  That is not to say it will not have another role or deal with other facets of that particular discipline in time to come, depending on the outcome of the discussions.</P>

      <P>Recent psychological tests indicate that he is functioning intellectually in the lower end of the mild mental handicap range.

      <P>I have no plans to restore the senior cycle to Caritas College.  With the introduction of vocational preparation courses in the school the facilities available there are fully utilised.

I am advised that the educational requirements of the area are best catered for by the existing arrangements.

      <P>It is estimated that it would require the appointment of some 3,000 additional teachers, at a cost in excess of £28 million per annum at current rates, to bring the average pupil-teacher ratio in national schools in line with that obtaining in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratio I gave is an average pupil-teacher ratio and has to be calculated over the country as a whole. The average figure may not be representative of schools in the areas to which the Deputy referred, no more than the pupil-teacher ratio in a small rural school.  It may be distorted in some urban areas because of the fact that four year olds are attending schools and perhaps they might be better off at home or in play schools. The average ratio in Northern Ireland in 1985 was 23.3:1 and in the Republic in the 1984-85 school year it was 27.1:1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the early part of his answer the Minister said that <i>Building on Reality</i> envisaged a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio if and when finances permitted it.  Could the Minister say when the Government intend to make finances available for a gradual reduction in this area?  Could he also say whether that is still their objective?  I was alarmed to hear the Minister say that four year olds might be better off at home or in play schools in view of the commitment on all sides of the House to allowing four year olds to attend school.  Could he explain the reference to play schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's commitment to reducing the ratio still stands and even in straitened economic circumstances, which we inherited, it has been dropping slowly and steadily over the past three years, from 27.5 in 1982-83 to 27.1 in 1984-85.  As resources permit, the ratio will continue to improve.  Deputy De Rossa raised the question of the numbers in classes in disadvantaged areas where the average number might be higher than the national average ratio.  In some urban areas averages can be distorted in particular schools because of the presence of a large number of four year old children consistent with the decision to admit children of that age into primary schools. I do not disagree with this decision.  I merely make the point that the provision of schooling for four year olds could be done in various ways.  Some educationalists recommend play schools while others think it is better to take them in at the commencement of the primary cycle. However, we are not talking about educational facilities for four year olds but of the pupil-teacher ratio and I was making the point that the average can be distorted in some areas because of the circumstances peculiar to a particular area.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say what percentage increase is represented in each of the four instances?  Can he say whether he regards the fees as excessive in view of the fact that the regional technical colleges and colleges of technology do not enjoy the same facilities in any respect as those enjoyed by the universities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have details of the percentage increases and it would take too long to work them out at Question Time.  I do not consider the fees excessive.  In many cases they are less <Col N="982" /> than half the fees for equivalent courses in the universities.  In addition, grant aid is available for students on the same lines as it is available to university students. A large number of students are totally exempt from paying fees by reason of their being recipients of payments under the European Social Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, that is totally misleading.  Students are grant aided for two years of a certificate course but if they proceed to diploma or degree courses they are not grant aided.  That red herring is brought up constantly.  The Minister has said that there would be too much trouble involved in working out the percentage increases in the fees for the regional colleges and colleges of technology. I am not a great mathematician nor have I great back-up service, but I calculated the fee rise to be within the region of 25 to 33 per cent per course per student in a regional college and in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  In the light of the commitment in <i>Building on Reality</i> that increases in fees would be just slightly above the inflation rate, would the Minister consider increases of up to 33 per cent in one year to be only slightly above the inflation rate?  Even at this stage would he consider this whole matter with a view to redressing the position and preventing the grave hardship that increases of this order will cause?  Surely there is some more equitable manner of dealing with the question of fees.</P>

      <P>My Department have issued circular letters to the authorities of all post-primary schools enclosing copies of the document, &ldquo;Ages for Learning, Decisions of Government, May 1985&rdquo;, and explaining how schools are to apply for approval to introduce the types of courses described in that document. Schools have also been given copies of the document &ldquo;Transition Year Programmes: Guidelines for Schools&rdquo;, published by the Curriculum and Examinations Board.</P>
      <P>The necessary arrangements have been made in my Department to process the applications from the schools.  It is not envisaged that any additional cost will arise in the coming school year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding that last sentence, can the Minister explain how a school which up to now has had a five year second level cycle can implement a sixth year cycle without engaging extra teachers and, consequently, involving extra costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The transition year relates to the provision of an extra year for pupils so as to enable them to spend six years in secondary school.  I understand that secondary schools have a six year cycle but that many students complete <Col N="984" /> only five years and leave at 17 years. That is not desirable educationally.  In the event of approval being granted to a school for a transition year, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant will be made and the standard pupil-teacher ratio will apply in respect of all the classes involved.  What I meant was that it is not envisaged that any cost in addition to what is provided for in the budget will arise so far as the Department are concerned to deal with the transition arrangements. Applications for the transition year are in the course of being examined but we are disappointed that not very many such applications have been made yet.  We are anxious to approve applications as quickly as possible because of the value of this transition year and because of the welcome it has received generally from educationalists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that half of the places at second level are at present provided for a five year cycle only and that if a six year cycle is to be provided they will need more teachers? That is why they are not taking it up. Many have put it on the high shelf.

      <P>I am aware of the advice of the Curriculum and Examinations Board and that they are as yet only an <i>ad hoc</i> interim board.  Any submission by them in the matter, whilst it would warrant careful consideration, would not have the validity of a departmental announcement or edict on the matter. Would the Minister deem it appropriate now for his Department to initiate a formal review of the operation of the primary school curriculum, particularly in view of the fact that there has been great delight at the efficacy of the new curriculum in that it has taken fear from primary schools although it has lead to misgivings among the general public that the very freedom it gave can now be reviewed in the light of more formal needs for pupils in the latter classes of primary schools?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the Curriculum and Examinations Board document shows that the very fine proposals in it will not be implemented unless they are preceded and accompanied by rigorous and comprehensive in-service courses for teachers? Is the Minister also aware that in other European countries, such as Holland, where curriculum changes and assessment in examinations were introduced without the necessary in-service courses for teachers, those advances were not a success?  The Minister is in a giving mood today so would he be prepared to agree with me that curriculum changes must bring with them in-service courses for teachers particularly at second level?

I am anxious that in-service training would be extended and when the Curriculum and Examinations Board are statutorily established and start producing recommendations on the new arrangements it is clear that enhanced in-service training will have to take place.  This matter will take a lot of consideration and probably some extra funding.  It will be part and parcel of the enhanced educational service which this Government are determined to provide for the children in bringing into being the programme for education initiated by my predecessor.

      <P>Amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa.  Acceptance of this amendment involves the deletion of section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Pronsias De Rossa Pronsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Pronsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;When an order under this Act is proposed to be made, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the <Col N="1042" /> order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put down this amendment because it is a matter I have raised previously on other Bills.  It arises directly from the difficulties which I and other Members have had in having orders made by Ministers debated in the House.  As the existing section 5 stands an order will stand unless annulled by a motion of the House. Under Standing Orders at present it is not possible for an individual Deputy to have a motion taken annulling an order. The only way it can be done is if the Government agree to debate such a motion which so far as I am aware to date has not occurred.  I have gone through some of the debates and have not found any precedent where a Government have agreed to debate having an order annulled.</P>
    <P>The only other way it can be done is if the parties who control Private Members' time are prepared to allow such a motion to be taken in that time.  During the life of this present Dáil that has not happened. On a number of occasions I have tried to have motions moved seeking to have orders annulled.  I failed.  The amendment I have down is to make it necessary for orders made under this Bill to be positive orders which must be placed before the House.  The draft order should be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas and not made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.  That amendment is standard wording from making positive orders.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill the Minister accepted the inclusion of such a positive section in relation to orders that he will have to bring in under that Bill.  I ask the Minister for Communications to agree also to this amendment. It will affect, so far as I am aware, section 9 which deals with orders which the Minister might make providing for additional functions and also for the extension of the area of the Authority.  These are important areas and, while the orders the Minister may bring in under this section may not require a long debate, at least <Col N="1043" /> the opportunity would be presented to Members of this House to debate them if they so wished.  As a general rule we should tend towards that type of presentation of orders in this House rather than the one which seems to be the practice of making orders which are capable only of being annulled by negative motion of the House.  In practice this means Deputies cannot have those kind of negative motions moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty here is that there are four sections which would be affected by Deputy De Rossa's amendment.  Section 3 allows me power to make orders to vary the commencement dates of different sections.  This is purely for administrative convenience.  It would be absurd if I had to come to this House to debate every order for the commencement of every section which the House was in the process of agreeing. Section 4 provides for the establishment day of the new Authority.  It would also be absurd if the House were agreeing to the setting up of this Authority and then sought a separate debate on the order setting it up.</P>
      <P>Sections 9 and 10 are more relevant to the points being made by Deputy De Rossa.  Section 9 already provides for the positive orders that he seeks.  This section enables me by order to extend the functions of the Dublin Transport Authority, which requires a positive order by both Houses.  Section 10 allows me, for different purposes, to vary the functional areas of the Authority.  When I say vary, it may well mean that we may wish to extend certain functions of the Authority to cover places like north Wicklow, Bray, Naas, Leixlip, Maynooth and Dunboyne which might become part of the greater Dublin area as far as transport is concerned in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may also wish to say no, that the Authority's functions in that regard should be confined to Dublin city or to an area so many miles from the GPO.  It would be unduly restrictive if we were to accept Deputy De Rossa's amendment in <Col N="1044" /> that regard.  Each time we wanted to do something in this respect we would have to come back to the House for an order.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that we have so many Bills on the Order Paper.  The Dublin Transport Authority Bill has been on the Order Paper for months and months.  Because there are so many Bills, progress is very slow and it is very hard to get things done.  To suggest that we should overload Parliament even more &mdash; there is a mechanism by which Parliament can, if it wants to, draw attention to these orders &mdash; would be wrong.  I take the point Deputy De Rossa makes that, while a provision in respect of section 10 refers to an annulment order of the House within 21 sitting days, that <i>de facto</i> precludes an individual Deputy from debating that order as time is not allowed for it.  That is a subject that could be raised with the Committee on Procedures and Privileges or with the Leader of the House.  As Deputy De Rossa knows, many reforms have been brought into the House during the lifetime of this Parliament. The new Leader of the House has other reforms in mind for discussion and that would be the appropriate forum in which to discuss them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's position and appreciate the section 9 and 10 provisions on the draft being laid before the House.  In the light of the last sentence or two of the Minister's intervention, I should like the Chair to enlighten me with regard to section 5, which is the one being amended by Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa, how a resolution annulling an order could come before the House.  Could this be achieved with two signatures or only by the Government or the main Opposition party?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Minister for misreading section 9 which provides for a positive order to be made. That is very welcome.  The position still holds in relation to section 10.  I accept the Minister's point in relation to sections 3 and 4 that it would be unduly restrictive. <Col N="1045" /> Unfortunately quite a large number of these negative-type orders are made during the year and, as the Minister said, it could take a considerable length of time to debate all of them.  I do not believe that the Dáil would be anxious to debate them all, but a number of them may be of legitimate concern to Members of this House.  The Minister is responsible for one of them, section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.  An order has been made every year for the past ten years under that Act and there has never been a debate on it.</P>
      <P>That is an example of how a situation can arise where on the face of it we have the right to debate these orders but in practice the rules of the House prevent it. The Government are unwilling to permit time to be given for discussion of those issues.  That problem could be overcome. A procedure could be initiated whereby the Government could set aside time in any Dáil session for the debate of such orders, particularly the more important ones and ones which have a wide-ranging effect, such as section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.</P>
      <P>I have adopted an attitude in relation to all Bills that where I see these negative orders being included in the Bill, I will propose that positive orders be made. Independent Deputies and Deputies who belong to the smaller parties do not have the same opportunity as Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party have their motions debated in this House.  The Minister referred to the fact that Dáil reforms have been introduced in the life of this Dáil.  That is true.  We made representations to the former Leader of the House, Deputy John Bruton, in relation to this matter.  Our information up to about a month ago was that he was not prepared to consider our suggestions basically because he felt that the time of the House would be unduly taken up with such discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to press the amendment because it would cover sections 3 and 4 which do not necessarily need to be dealt with in the way I am proposing.  Section 10 shall be dealt with in this way.  In my introduction I mentioned section 9 which already has a procedure for orders to be <Col N="1046" /> made only after agreement by the House. That should be the general approach by Ministers in introducing legislation in relation to functions they have which have fairly widespread effects on people's lives.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 29 to 32, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Authority shall within one year of its establishment, or within such other period as the Minister may direct, make a transport plan and at least once every five years thereafter, review the plan and make in it any changes considered proper, such plan to indicate the measures <Col N="1049" /> which in the opinion of the Authority, should be taken to meet the transport needs of the Authority's area, over such period as the Authority considers appropriate through provision, operation and management of transport infrastructure and services and such plan to be consistent with national resource allocation priorities, as between the transport sector and other sectors of the economy as set out in Government planning documents.</P>
    <P>I would like to start with No. 2 and to say in support of this amendment, what I said on Second Stage, that we on this side of the House consider the Bill as put before the House to be weak.  It establishes an Authority with great potential for good but, because of its lack of teeth, or bite, it will fall short of the powers that will be necessary to deal with the transport problems in Dublin city.  I regard the transport plan as being the essential thing as far as the Dublin Transport Authority are concerned.</P>
    <P>I mention in the words of amendment No. 2 what the plan should cover.  The period of time when that plan would be effective should be determined.  I mention also the areas which it covers.  The Authority would have an overall function in the promotion of integrated planning and transport operation.  In the area covered by the Bill it was originally three local government body areas.  Now with the new reorganisation it is the Dublin borough council area and the Dublin county area.  It is essential that the statue demand that the Dublin Transport Authority should produce a plan and take some time to produce that plan, and for that plan to be in place for, I suggest, five years.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; is used a great deal in various Departments, especially in the Department of the Environment, probably within some tight definition and we are really talking about roads, railways, bus ways, car parks etc. The whole impetus for the DTA came <Col N="1050" /> originally from a realisation that too many cooks were preparing the broth, too many fingers were in the pie, take any metaphor you like, and you could have, for example, planning for rail services and the consequential necessity to close roads and planning for roadways and road transport going on and coming at cross purposes.  You could have Dublin County Council doing one thing, Dublin Corporation doing another thing at the time and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council doing something else.  The <i>raison d'être</i> of the idea of a plan was that all the inputs would come together.  No doubt there would be a little infighting &mdash; maybe &ldquo;little&rdquo; is the wrong word &mdash; but in the end the matter would be settled between the DTA, the various councils and the Government of the day and we would have a logical plan that could be adhered to.  This would cut out a great deal of what the original commission who considered all this business pointed out, the confusion with regard to planning.</P>
    <P>The plan would give an indication of what is necessary in the infrastructure by way of road, rail and so on, what kind of public transport services would be in the designated area of the DTA, city bus services, suburban trains etc.  The task force have been very successful, unsung heroes, in this whole business because they have made great progress with no statutory authority.  Indeed, if they had not almost reached the end of their tether when the statute was needed to support them they could have achieved a good deal of what we hope the Authority may achieve now that they are getting their muscle but without the plan they will not be as successful as they should be.  It is &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; without the prince.  I am sure there will be achievements, in particular along the area of traffic management, as a result of the Authority being established, but I am not satisfied that the proper coordination will exist without having this plan.  As my amendment affects sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and as you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, said that they should be taken altogether&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>And 9, sorry.  I hope I have the right terminology here.  I mention the county borough of Dublin and the administrative county of Dublin as the area where, so to speak, the writ of the Authority will run.  My idea is that this plan should come before the two local authorities.  They should be given an opportunity to discuss, debate and suggest improvements.  Then the Dublin Transport Authority should take cognisance of these suggestions coming from people who are dealing with some of the problems at even closer range.  One could envisage even a conflict of interests between local authorities.  This, in the first instance, would perhaps find a solution or a resolution of conflict in discussions between the local authorities concerned.  The Dublin Transport Authority, if that could not be achieved, would then have a role to play.  As I mentioned already, if the Authority could not resolve difficulties the final word would be with the Government.  I do not envisage the Government being brought in to deal with every little detail of the problems which would arise between the local authorities but, in a major conflict or a major clash of interests which the Authority could not resolve, the matter would then be referred by the Authority to the Government.</P>
      <P>The next stage is outlined in amendment No. 4, which refers to the publication of the draft plan.  There is the drawing up of the plan, submission to the local authorities and the third stage of the publication of the draft plan.  Here interested people, ordinary members of the public, or representative groups such as An Taisce and the like, would be invited to make their comments on the draft plan.  The word &ldquo;draft&rdquo; as mentioned by Deputy De Rossa is an important one here, in that it is the building up of something from a basic structure, through consultation with local authorities and finally through a submission to the public by way of public inquiry.  All those stages would polish the diamond which would finally be in operation for a period of four to five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> Amendment No. 5 which I am proposing advocates the submission of the draft plan and the report of the public inquiry to Government.  I might mention that in amendment No. 2 I suggested a period of within one year of the establishment of the authority.  Perhaps there is a weakness there, but I leave an opening for the Minister with &ldquo;or within such other period as the Minister may direct ...&rdquo; It might be a little impracticable to think that the submission to the local authorities, the public inquiry and the Government decision could all be achieved within one year.  If the period of one year acted as a kind of guideline, then the Minister could alter it if pressure on time precluded completion within that time.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 states as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall submit the draft Plan, together with the Report of the Public Inquiry, to the Government.</P>
    <P>The following part is important:</P>
    <P>The Government may approve the draft Plan...</P>
    <P>In other words, as it came through the Authority, through the local authorities, through the public inquiry or, if the Government did not want to approve it, they could alter it and then approve it. Then the plan would be published.  That is where the real muscle comes into it. This plan has gone through all those stages and has got Government approval.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 states as follows:</P>
    <P>This Government approval of the Authority's Plan shall have the effect of requiring the Dublin Local Authority to amend, where necessary, their development plans to accord with the Authority's Plan as approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Authority and the Government would be behind it.  Anyone who has been in administration will know how pressure can be exerted by various sectors of the administration.  That is why the build-up to this stage where it gets Government approval and has that kind of muscle behind it is important.  You have a better <Col N="1053" /> and more authoritative plan, one which can bring about improvements in transport in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 7 the provision is interesting in that none of the Dublin local authorities shall give a planning permission either while an amendment to their development plan under section 8 (6) &mdash; that is my section 8 (6) &mdash; is pending or after that amendment has been made, which would be inconsistent with the Authority's plan as approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>In other words, that just underlines what I have said already, that when it has got Government approval then the local authorities would have to take cognisance of it and carry it out, or:</P>
    <P>Vary their development plan to alter or omit a proposal inserted in their plan by an amendment under Head 16; except that a local authority may do either (a) or (b) with the agreement of the Authority given with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, amendment No. 8 is highly relevant to the process:</P>
    <P>In page 7, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(8)  The Authority shall have an involvement in relation to funds for compensation or land purchase arising out of any transport proposal which, by virtue of the Authority's Plan, was (or had been for a period) contained in a development plan of a local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That amendment speaks for itself with regard to how far the Authority's writ would run in that case.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 9 I hope that the lines mentioned are correct because much of this work was done in a hurry and I must pay tribute to the Bills Office for their help.  The amendment is as follows:</P>
    <P>In page 7, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(9)  Before making any variation <Col N="1054" /> of a development plan the purpose of which is to provide for transport infrastructure or services, the Dublin local authorities shall have regard to the views of the Authority, at two stages in the variation process:</P>
    <P>(a)  in relation to the terms of transport proposals which are to go on public display; where the Authority and a local authority cannot agree on the terms of proposals for display, the Minister for the Environment shall settle the terms of such proposals,</P>
    <P>(b)  before the local authority makes a decision on whether or not to include the proposals in their development plan.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The authority's plan as envisaged by my amendments would be concerned with all transport proposals for the Dublin area over the period for which the plan was made &mdash; I mentioned a five year period. The actual plan would draw attention to any significant proposals not contained in the development plans for the period being enforced of the Dublin local authority. These proposals could be for new roads, new rail lines or perhaps multistorey car parks.  I am talking particularly of the requirement of Dublin local authorities having to amend the plan to fall in with what Údarás Iompair Bhaile Átha Cliath will decide.  The amendment of a development plan means just that, a change or alteration to a plan.  It is not exactly the same as the variation of a development plan as mentioned in the planning legislation.  The Authority's planning function is central to all my amendments.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the task force already and the great work they did even without statutory support.  They dealt with the implementation of plans also.  I want to quote from the report of the Transport Consultative Commission with regard to the implementation of plans.  They said:</P>
    <P>If agreed plans, be they short-term or long-term, are not implemented, their development is a waste of time and resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> As far as the plan I am pushing is concerned, the whole process and the importance given to the plan would imply measures to have it implemented.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already, one of the dangers is that the local authorities would not in the normal course of events act in accordance with the plan made out by the Dublin Transport Authority.  The fact that the local authority had an input into it, in the sense that they would be given permission to review the plan, would be helpful but local authorities could, if not precluded by statute, persist with their own plans which might be in conflict with the overall plan.  In other words, the Dublin Transport Authority plan would be the paramount consideration as far as planning and development were concerned in the area which will be defined in the legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to my suggested section 8 (8) and compensation, the report from the task force indicated that it would be the Department of the Environment which would consider the compensation question in detail, that is giving the Authority an involvement in it.</P>
    <P>I have made the general points in favour of my amendments but I would like to sum up by saying that we regard the plan as an essential for the effective working of the new Authority.  We regard it as important that the people chosen for the Authority should have special expertise in this field.  We regard it as important that the local authorities concerned &mdash; now two &mdash; should have their opportunity to express themselves and to argue their case either between each other or between themselves and the Minister or with all three involved.  We regard it as important that the public, by way of public inquiry, should have an opportunity of making their input.  It would have to be controlled, of course.  We regard it as important that provision should be made for an input from interest groups, such as An Taisce.  Finally, the plan should reach the Government where it would be adopted. Muscle would be given to the plan as such and any outstanding major conflicts or difficulties would have to be <Col N="1056" /> decided upon so that there would be a positive plan and the authority would know where they are going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give the reasons why I strongly oppose these amendments.  When I became Minister for Transport Deputy Wilson was my immediate predecessor.  The draft heads of the Bill had been almost completed and they included the provisions now tabled.  I would like the House to reflect on what is intended here and what the effects of Deputy Wilson's amendments would be.</P>
      <P>First, Dublin Transport Authority would need a large staff of planners, draftsmen and so on, replicating the staff of local authorities and to some extent the staff in the Department of the Environment.  Second, the local authorities have gone through the five year development plan and the public inquiry procedure, which is painstaking and extraordinarily slow.  Having done all that, we now superimpose a transport plan with more public inquiries, as if transport was not an intrinsic part of the overall development plan, and then require the local authorities to change their development plan.  Then what happens? We have Government Ministers from all over the country acting as a super planning committee for Dublin.  That does not make sense.  To say that it is top heavy is understating the case.  This is totally unnecessary.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides the right for consultation. The Dublin Transport Authority will have the right to be consulted by the local authorities in drawing up their development plans.  They will have a right of appeal to the Minister for the Environment if they are dissatisfied with the manner in which their advice was treated. They will have a right of consultation on all planning applications to the local authorities and, on all planning appeals, to An Bord Pleanála.  With great respect, I contend that makes an awful lot more sense and is much leaner, fitter, much more effective and less costly.  I urge the House to support this section and the provisions in my Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> I should say that there are a number of differences between the proposals now before us and those contained in Deputy Wilson's original Bill which he seeks to reinsert here.  We are dropping the disbursement through the Authority of all Exchequer moneys to local authorities for roads and to CIE for public transport. That would give the Authority an unnecessary function.  There exists already an elaborate arrangement between the Department of the Environment, the local authorities, my Department and CIE.  It would be unnecessary and, taken overall, unhelpful to bring the Dublin Transport Authority in between us.  As I have said, we have dropped the Dublin transport plan. But we have included the right of consultation and of appeal to the Minister for the Environment.  In addition, we have provided that four members of Dublin local authorities should be members of the board of the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
    <P>Another important addition in this Bill about which I should like to say a few words, in the light of modern conditions in this city, is that we are now giving power to the Dublin Transport Authority to restrict wholly or partly the use of public roads by vehicles through the erection of bollards and to restrict vehicle speed on public roads by the use of road ramps.  Many of the older estates in this city were very open.  As the volume of traffic increased over the years, problems have arisen through traffic caught up on main roads taking what are described as rat runs through estates, speeding through them, causing great danger to the children living there and so on.  In more recent times we have experienced the dreaded problem of the stolen car speeding through.</P>
    <P>To date there was no legal authority to change that position, perhaps to convert long roads, open-ended, into two culsde-sac by erecting bollards in the middle. Neither has there been any legal authority for the erection of ramps on public roads.  We are providing that authority in this Bill.  The power we are seeking to give the authority in this respect will not <Col N="1058" /> be confined to estates of the kind I have mentioned.  It will be possible to use that power in respect of some main roads where, in their opinion, it is considered desirable to slow down traffic in the interests of safety.  That is an important new power.  I believe it will be used extensively by local authorities to effectively transform and reduce the flow of traffic within such residential estates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is definitely a need for the Dublin Transport Authority to have a long term plan in regard to the development of infrastructure and transportation in general in the area under their control.</P>
      <P>I agree with much of what the Minister has said in relation to the kinds of procedures Deputy Wilson proposes, which strike me as a very complicated way of having a plan produced.  At present Dublin local authorities are engaged in reviewing the draft development plan in their areas.  Indeed, just a week or so ago they discussed a document on transportation prepared by An Foras Forbartha for their area.  Therefore, there is an urgency for the input by this Authority into the review of the draft plan.  The procedures Deputy Wilson proposes would prevent that kind of input taking place as a matter of urgency.  They would unnecessarily restrict the capacity of local authorities to prepare and proceed with their development plan.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of points which strike me in relation to the amendments. For example, amendment No. 6 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following: &ldquo;(6) The Government approval of the Authority's Plan shall have the effect of requiring the Dublin Local Authorities to amend, where necessary, their development plans to accord with the Authority's Plan as approved by Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is putting the cart before the horse. The preparation of the draft development plan is a function of the elected representatives and of the planners for the area. <Col N="1059" /> It would seem to me to be much more logical for an agency like the Dublin Transport Authority to have an input into the draft plan rather than the reverse which is proposed in the amendment.</P>
    <P>While amendment No. 3 affords opportunities to local authorities within the area of the Dublin Transport Authority to comment on the draft plan, that would not be sufficient to provide the co-ordination needed.  It has to be said also that other agencies which would have an interest in a transport plan do not appear to be mentioned in the amendments.  In this instance there is no reference whatever to how CIE would fit into this planning process.  It should be remembered that they are the major transport company operating in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is mentioned later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the question of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, or whatever may replace them when they have been done away with or whatever.  They too should have some say in the kind of transportation plan proposed.  They have a major part to play in the development of the port and the resultant traffic which will be generated on our roads and rail network.  I agree fully that there is need for a plan to be co-ordinated with the draft plans for Dublin city and county.  I honestly do not see that the procedures proposed by Deputy Wilson would achieve that objective in the kind of expeditious way required, particularly bearing in mind that the local authorities at this very moment are involved in reviewing their draft plan for the area.</P>
      <P>I might quote from a report of a study undertaken by An Foras Forbartha for Dublin Corporation in which they point out that, by 1990, it is expected that the figure for private cars in the Dublin area will be 297,000 and by the year 2000, 396,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever way the transport Authority will proceed in terms of their day-to-day operations, how they prepare plans or <Col N="1060" /> have an input into transport plans, there is one thing they must do, not to take trends and project them into the future and plan accordingly.  There is a need to try to alter the trends that are projected particularly in relation to the number of private cars.  The Authority should discourage the use of private cars for travelling to and from the centre of the city. The Authority have a major role to play in indicating how the public transport services, rail and bus, can be developed. Obviously, it is not possible to restrict the entry of private cars unduly but we will pay a heavy price in terms of the environment and the physical shape of our city if we allow projected trends to materialise and permit cars to park for long periods in the city.  We will have bigger and bigger roads, bigger and bigger car parks but fewer people living in the city as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister's view that Deputy Wilson's amendments are taking a sledge to crack a nut but it is a very important nut.  We have not had any effective transport policy in the city.  Like Deputy De Rossa, I am concerned that the Bill as now constituted in giving the Dublin Transport Authority the right to make suggestions to local authorities or CIE about their investment programmes or to the Minister about year to year spending is in the realm of suggestion.  I do not think that suggestion alone is sufficient in this case. We need to give the Dublin Transport Authority an effective sanction of some sort over decision making that is going on independently in the local authorities, CIE and so on.  Without some sanction effect where the DTA can pull up in their tracks proposals by different authorities at the very least we will have wasteful investment but, even more serious, I do not think we will get a co-ordinated strategy together for transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose the DTA went for an attempt to do what Deputy De Rossa has suggested, to get people not to use their cars to drive to work at peak time and to use the buses, we would be imposing heavy loss-making on CIE because peak hour transport <Col N="1061" /> by CIE is loss-making.  It will always be loss-making because the fleet has to be beefed up to deal with peak hour demand.  Unless the DTA have some way to compensate CIE for this social demand and some strategy that makes those things hang together, in other words, a subsidy to CIE for their services and their strategy, we will be in difficulty.  We will find at the end of the day that CIE are proceeding with their own investment programmes subject to ministerial subvention and the DTA, who should be making the decisions about the type of transport policy we want to see emerging in the city and therefore dispersing funds to those bodies who will have to execute it, will find themselves falling between two stools.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the existing development plans prepared by local authorities are essentially still marking out zones on maps.  They have not linked services into the various colourings on the maps. That is particularly acute in the transport area where our existing local development plans have not become effective transport plans.  Unless the Authority can be given some more direct say and something more powerful than just the ability to offer advice this will be stillborn.  I favour the type of approach originally envisaged by the Transport Consultative Commission which was that the DTA would have their control via the purse strings, that money going to the Dublin city buses, for road investment by the local authorities and so on would go through the DTA as a fund.  While I do not think there is any sense in having them re-invent the wheel and doing appraisals for those different bodies I think the DTA should be in a position to vet the appraisal work done by the other bodies and, while falling short of having the right to sanction or refuse, would have a very central role in ensuring consistency between different investment plans and so on.  Deputy Wilson's proposals are too unwieldly to be viable and a more sensible approach could be evolved if we put more financial sanction in the hands of the DTA to try to pull the <Col N="1062" /> various component authorities in the direction of where they want to go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton's statement that the section is more of a suggestion and does not have any teeth.  That is the basic fault in it. Over the years Ministers have made <i>ad hoc</i> decisions as problems arose and in the long term they were not successful. Deputy Wilson's amendment goes to the heart of the matter by making it necessary to provide a long-term plan.  We are all aware that Dublin is growing and for that reason it is essential that there should be forward planning.  It is important that there should be an overall authority to co-ordinate the plans of the different local authorities in Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and Naas, as has been suggested.  Unless there is such an Authority to co-ordinate the plans of the local authorities the provisions of the Bill will be meaningless.  It is not necessary, as the Minister suggested, to appoint a large staff of planners if the terms of Deputy Wilson's amendment are to be implemented.  He is not proposing the establishment of another semi-State body or Government Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to the statement by Deputy De Rossa about the expected growth in the number of cars in Dublin by the year 2000 I should like to suggest that the Government again take on board a policy of decentralisation of Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the problem of transportation in Dublin is that there are too many fingers in the pie, too many different roles.  The county council, the corporation, the traffic study group, CIE and various Departments deal with the problem and we are not adding another layer, a new quango, in this Authority.  I do not know whether we are clear in regard to what we are doing because Deputy Wilson's amendments envisage a kind of authority which will have the resources, expertise, professionals, roads, planning, transport and finance and all the other aspects which require a very big staff to prepare a plan and to ensure that all other authorities involved <Col N="1063" /> would have to abide by that plan.  One can sympathise in a sense with that position which would involve subsuming CIE and the traffic sections of Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation.  There would be sense in that suggestion but all that is proposed here is yet another advisory body.</P>
      <P>As the Minister clearly indicated, there is no intention by the Government to provide anything like the resources or staff necessary to give a meaningful role to the Authority.  One does not need a Dublin transport authority to allow ramps to be erected in an estate or to decide that a particular road can be turned into a cul-de-sac.  If one wants to allow ramps to be erected and so on, it would be very easy to amend an existing Act to allow the local authorities to do so. I am a little concerned that the Authority will be relegated to little more than an advisory capacity, that a certain amount of money for transport will be provided by the Government and, instead of their being answerable for the spending of such money, we will be told these things are now a matter for the Dublin Transport Authority.  If one feels that a rail link should be provided for Tallaght &mdash; I am sorry to be parochial &mdash; the Minister will merely say money is being allocated to the Dublin Transport Authority and they are now responsible.  Members of that Authority will not be in the House to answer our questions although they will be in charge.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the power in regard to traffic planning lies with CIE and nothing will change in that regard.  Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council will still be responsible for roads and I should like to ask if the Borough of Dún Laoghaire are left out of the transport Authority.  Are we talking only about Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council?  Reference is made to the administrative county of Dublin and I do not know whether that includes Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>A radical input into the public transport system is necessary because major improvements could be achieved with the right kind of planning. There could be a major transfer to the use of public transport if the right service was provided at the right price.  Many car users would be happy to use public transport if the service was readily available.  However, if we have to rely on the Dublin Transport Authority to do that task for us, they will have to be provided with staff to enable them to draw up the sort of plan about which Deputy Wilson is talking, and to enforce it.  They cannot do that by making observations and recommendations and hoping that the multifarious collection of organisations involved in transport in the greater Dublin area may take them up. That sounds too much like a cop out.  We need an authority with teeth which will have the power and the resources to enforce these things.  Such an authority should not be a duplication of the traffic study groups and so on.  The Garda control traffic arrangements and the role of the local authorities are secondary in that regard.  There is no point in setting up a transport authority unless they are responsible for all aspects of planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> When the greater Dublin council are set up they should have a traffic committee which would obviate the need for new advisory bodies which seem to be sprouting all over the place to very little effect.  Give the Authority the powers and the staff so that they are in a position to prepare plans and implement them. The Minister said that kind of authority is not envisaged and, consequently, there seems little point in Deputy Wilson's amendment in the context of the kind of authority which is proposed here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely the type of authority about which Deputy Taylor was speaking &mdash; one with teeth &mdash; that I had envisaged and which I am trying to produce by these amendments.  I said on Second Stage that the kind of advisory terminology we have negatives any good that could come from the Dublin Transport Authority.  Such wording as, &ldquo;the Authority shall on request advise the Minister or the Minister for the Environment&rdquo; upsets the idea of an effective Dublin Transport Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is full of that type of phraseology and that is why I am objecting to it.  I submit that the Authority should have teeth.  Deputy Taylor says it will be another advisory body.  If that is so, I am in agreement with him.  We are wasting our time here because such a body would have no effect.  Deputy Taylor said also that the power will rest with CIE.  I envisage CIE acting as the agent of the Dublin Transport Authority, in other words, that CIE would do what the Dublin Transport Authority would tell them to do, that they would provide the kinds of services and the frequency of services at costs which the Dublin Transport Authority would require of them.</P>

    <P>Deputy Taylor mentioned also the rail link to Tallaght.  It is not too far-fetched to envisage the following operation: CIE plan a rapid rail link to Tallaght while, <Col N="1066" /> without their knowing it, Dublin Corporation are planning a fast six lane road to Tallaght with committed and highly qualified experts on both sides beavering away, not knowing what the other was doing.  The role envisaged for the Dublin Transport Authority would be that they would know there was a transport proposal for an area such as Tallaght, that they would make a decision and, as Deputy Bruton said, would control the funds and decide that the big investment should be in a rapid rail link to Tallaght and not in a six lane motorway.</P>
    <P>In the past there have been examples of rail and road development cutting across each other.  All the points made by Deputy Taylor are valid in the context of the study that was made and which set off the idea of a Dublin Transport Authority. If my memory serves me correctly, there was a plan on one page of that report showing all the convoluted procedures surrounding a simple job like enacting traffic law.  There was a whole page showing how the Garda, the local authorities, the Department of the Environment and so on would be involved.  That held up the whole process.  If there was a proper Dublin Transport Authority, perhaps the kind of authority envisaged here, they would have that kind of power.</P>
    <P>What I am talking to here is an amendment designed to convince the Minister that an overall plan is necessary.  I recall, while in charge of the Department of Transport as it was then, considering the whole business of staff duplication or, as the Minister said, staff replication and the study at that time became serious. The best advice available to me then was that no such massive investment would be required provided the Authority were organised and structured in a certain way. The conclusion arrived at by the people I asked to study the matter was that very little would be required along with the expert advice and the qualified people available then.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the Government would find themselves in the ridiculous position that Ministers from all over the country would be setting themselves up as planners for Dublin. <Col N="1067" /> There is little of the Dublin ideology in that.  What I said was that where there was a major and unresolved difference of opinion in regard to the area which the Dublin Transport Authority would be responsible for, the Government ultimately would have to make the decision. I made the point that not every little difficulty which arose should go as far as Government.  I was talking about major decisions that would be referred by the Authority to the Government who would have the responsibility of resolving them. If Vitruvius could come from Ventry or Virginia, there is no reason why a Minister who was not a native of Dublin City should not be able to give a solemn judgment on a problem relating to Dublin County Council or Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The point was made by Deputy Bruton that he favoured the idea of the authority having the power of disbursement.  That is part of what I wish to advocate.  If the disbursement decisions were coming from the Authority, they would be a real Authority but there are all kinds of little empire builders in local authorities as there are in any form of administration. We could have Dublin County Council, Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation all standing very much on their own kind of rights and so on.  As of now there is no way of saving ratepayers and taxpayers money as a result of unresolved difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the inclusion of members of local authorities.  He is legislating for a 12 man Authority with four members of the local authorities. That represents one third of the total which is considerable but, in a majority vote, one of the hazards would be that the man from the Dún Laoghaire area might be of the opinion that his judgments would have to be subjective in regard to problems pertaining to Dún Laoghaire while the same might apply to the representatives from Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  Therefore, objectivity might be difficult but if these representatives were not in the majority on the authority perhaps the least damage could be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> Originally it was envisaged that experts who were non representative might be better because they would be less liable to come under local and representational pressure.  I have noticed that, since the new bridges were built across the Liffey and since the numbers of unemployed have risen, the traffic problem in the city is not as bad as it was four years ago when we were trying to put together a Bill to deal with the problem but, as Deputy De Rossa said, an authority with power would not play with the wind but could help to direct or tunnel the wind so long as they had the necessary power.</P>
    <P>The time will come when something will have to be done so far as the traffic in the city centre is concerned.  I have been in seven different cities in the past 14 months and I have found that in large areas of these cities motor traffic is not allowed.  People have come to live with that situation and the day may come when we may have to think seriously about doing something similar.  Any such move would bring out the vested interests and the pressure groups, but the existence of a strong Dublin Transport Authority would be our only means of resisting such pressure in the interests of good planning and good transport management.</P>
    <P>I do not accept what Deputy De Rossa has said that what I was talking about is very complicated.  It was, I would submit, highly democratic in that every stage took account of proper consultation.  The hard edge of decision was required in the end, which is important.  Nobody could complain if that process were gone through. Extend the period if you like&mdash;I put down one year in my amendment&mdash;extend it to two years or to whatever time the Minister may decide, and go through it and have a hard plan.  Stay with that plan.</P>
    <P>I know one road in Dublin city which over the last 12 months or so has had visits from the ESB and Telecom Éireann. Now Dublin Corporation are doing a major job on it.  I must say that Dublin Corporation workers are the tidiest and the neatest of the three groupings.  They all came at their own time.  Liaison is now <Col N="1069" /> intended as and from the date this Bill goes on the Statute Book.  They do not seem to have consulted each other at all. They did their own thing when their own thing was required in that area.  One grouping undermined several beautiful white beam trees.  Luckily enough, the people in the area got up in arms immediately and started objecting and protesting. Otherwise, a beautiful line of white beams would have been destroyed.  They did not care a tinker's curse.  The corporation have now raised the concrete kerbing and are putting another layer on the road on which there is heavy traffic. Dublin Transport Authority would come into their own in that kind of situation. They would require from Telecom Éireann, the ESB and Dublin Corporation their plans so that co-ordination would take place.</P>
    <P>I did not mention the Ports and Docks Board and Deputy De Rossa reminded me of their input into the plan.  Of course the Port and Docks Board, or as Deputy De Rossa said whatever will replace them when they are replaced, would naturally have an input in their own area.  The process will not be too slow which is the main criticism Deputy De Rossa made of my amendment.  I would envisage as near a perfect plan as possible at the end of the line and one which had the statutory backing to see it through.  Deputy Richard Bruton was in agreement with me at least in regard to the disbursement of moneys.  There is a Spanish proverb which says, <i>Un poderoso caballero es don dinero</i>&mdash;Mr. Money is a powerful gentleman. For that reason, if the Dublin Transport Authority had the disbursement of moneys they would be able to deal with CIE, corporations and councils, Telecom Éireann and the ESB, etc., within their own remit.  I am urging the Minister to think again about this plan. The major criticism that he made was that it would be very expensive.  I am submitting that in his own Department there are documents which, if studied now, would still have the validity they had in 1982 when I studied them, indicating that the type of authority with plan and budget which I am advocating would <Col N="1070" /> not necessitate a large bureaucracy and a large expenditure of public moneys.</P>

      <P>I want to answer a few points raised.  I will read from Deputy Wilson's amendments.  This is comment enough on what he has said about not involving Government as a super-planning committee.  It would be great gas at Government meetings deciding on what roads and bus stops should be in Dublin &mdash; in the process, upstaging all local democracy in Dublin and overturning not alone the transport plan proposed but also the draft development plan.  The Deputy's amendments Nos. 3 to 6 state:</P>
      <P>The County Borough of Dublin and the Administrative County of Dublin shall be given an opportunity to comment on the draft Plan, and the Authority shall have regard to the comments of the Local Authorities in finalising the draft and the Authority shall then submit the draft Plan to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister shall publish the draft Plan, and shall cause a public inquiry to be held into it; to provide that the report of the inquiry shall be made to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister shall submit the draft Plan, together with the Report of the Public Inquiry, to the Government. The Government may approve the draft Plan or alter it and then approve it and the approved Plan shall be published.</P>
      <P>The Government approval of the Authority's Plan shall have the effect of requiring the Dublin Local Authorities to amend, where necessary, their development plans to accord with the Authority's Plan as approved by Government.</P>
      <P>It is like the Government being county council for Dublin city and county.  That is in the original draft Bill produced by Deputy Wilson as Minister.  It is clearly not a good idea to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson in the latter part of his most recent comments talked about the visits to a certain road in the area which people were digging up every other week. Telecom Éireann this week, the Gas <Col N="1071" /> Company another week and so on.  One of the powers that is being given to the Authority is section 40 which will enable them to regulate and control the timing of road works.  In addition, the Authority will become the traffic authority.  The powers of the Garda Commissioner are being transferred to the Authority.  The powers of the Minister for the Environment in relation to taxi services are being transferred to the Authority.  The traffic wardens' service and responsibility for all traffic management schemes are being transferred to the Authority.</P>

      <P>The renting of bus services will be a matter for the Authority and they would have a major input into fare levels.  This is an Authority with teeth.  It is a relevant Authority and is not going to cost a fortune.  It is not going to usurp local democracy in Dublin such as it already is.  It is going to have a local participation which will add to local democracy in Dublin.  That is the way it should be.  Finally, I should say that there is provision in the Bill to add to the functions of the Authority if that becomes wise.  By virtue of Deputy De Rossa's amendment which I have agreed to insert on Report Stage it would be a matter for this House to approve those additional functions.  If and when the Authority get off the ground there is a feeling additional functions should be given to the Authority, some of which have been suggested by Deputies today, it would be a matter for the House to consider giving them those additional functions at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in the course of his first reply to Deputy Wilson's amendments made the point that the Dublin Transport Authority would not be geared up sufficiently in the way of staff to produce the kind of plan envisaged in Deputy Wilson's amendment and again in his second contribution just now he mentioned that the Authority would <Col N="1072" /> not cost a fortune.  Could the Minister tell the House the cost and what kind of savings he envisages as a result of the setting up of this Authority?  If we look at the explanatory memorandum of the Bill we will see that the main functions of the Authority relate to transport planning:</P>
      <P>... it will be responsible for appraising and making recommendations to the relevant local authorities and to the Ministers for Communications and the Environment, as appropriate, on the long term planning of road and rail transport in the Dublin area, both as regards infrastructure (roads, bus and rail facilities, etc.) and public transport services.</P>
      <P>It would require a fair amount of staff to do all that and it would require a fair degree of expertise to plan out transport across that spectrum.  We cannot do that without a substantial number of engineers, economists and so on.  The second main function of the Authority relates to transport funding:</P>
      <P>...it will make recommendations annually to the same two Ministers in relation to priorities in both capital and current expenditure on road and rail transport in Dublin.</P>
      <P>To deal with that heading would require a fair degree of staffing, a fair degree of research, planning and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It would need so many experts that they could disburse the money just as easily as advise about it.</P>
      <P>In relation to transport planning Dublin County Council have already a department dealing with that.  The DTA will be given an overlapping function there.  I have no doubt that Deputy De Rossa can confirm that the Dublin Corporation have departments also dealing with public transport services.  The DTA:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...will set service objectives and standards to be achieved by Córas Iompair Éireann in the Dublin area within its Exchequer allocation, and will monitor <Col N="1073" /> Córas Iompair Eireann's progress. It will also be responsible for the licensing of private bus operators to provide public transport services and for the control of taxi services in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It will require a fair degree of staff and widespread expertise in planners, engineers, economists and so on.  Another aim of the DTA is traffic management, to design traffic and parking schemes and make the subsidiary laws to give effect to them.  It will also control the traffic warden service and so on.  That would require a fair number of staff.  We are going to have all that staff yet the Minister says it will not cost a fortune, and that the staff will not be there to prepare a plan.  Could the Minister clarify what he means when he says it will not cost a fortune and when he says that the staff will not be there to draw up a plan?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated cost of the Authority in one year will not exceed £600,000.  It is estimated that they will have no more than 20 staff.  Savings can be achieved by the co-ordination of transport and will amount to a great number of times more than £600,000.  That is the main reason for the Authority.  Great savings can be made by better co-ordination of transport.  I do not want a bureaucracy employing a set of engineers, architects, road planners and so on.  I want to avoid a duplication of what the two local authorities already do.  The long list of things that Deputy Taylor read out reiterates the point that this Authority will have teeth and contradicts a point made earlier that this was an Authority without teeth.  This Authority will not cost an excessive amount of money.  This Authority should achieve great savings not only in terms of money but, also because of more efficient transport, in terms of pollution and health and in terms of time saved in travelling.  This is a very worthwhile approach, a very worthwhile Authority.  When the House considers that additional functions ought to be given to that Authority we have the enabling provisions in this Bill to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I stress the two main provisions that I have advocated.  The Authority should be compelled to make a plan, an all embracing co-ordinated plan for Dublin city and county.  This proposal of having an overall plan was opposed by the Department of the Environment as was the other major power for the transport Authority, the budgetary power. Discussion and argument went on between the Departments for a long time and finally the Department of Transport succeeded in having their view somewhat modified but accepted.  There was one very sophisticated opponenet of the plan from another Department since then, I regret to say, and the process of teasing it out took a long time.</P>
      <P>What I see before me in this Bill seems to be what existed before the discussion took place between the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment, and before the Government decision was taken.  Part of the Government decision was that there should be a comprehensive plan and that the Dublin Transport Authority should have budgetary powers.  I know the Minister for the Environment was the Tánaiste, and I have a suspicion that he was very strong in advocating the Department of the Environment point of view when this Bill was being put together.</P>
      <P>I regret that the two major proposals which are essential to this Bill have been dropped.  I agree fully with the Minister when he says that there is an area, which was in the original Bill also, where the Authority will be effective.  The statute is giving power in certain areas but, although these areas are important, they are not central to my thinking about the Dublin Transport Authority.  The two central ideas in the original proposals with regard to this Bill were that of the plan, elaborated in the way in which I have outlined to the House in some detail this afternoon, and the budgetary powers of the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various criticisms have been made that this was too complicated, too detailed and too slow-moving.  I am aware that most people who have been critical are, <Col N="1075" /> and have been for some time, involved in local government.  Needless to say they will develop a proprietorial attitude towards powers that local authorities have.  That does not mean we have to accept this as something which should bear on the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not Deputy R. Bruton is involved in local government. He was, but I do not think he is now.  He brings a good mind, as far as transport matters are concerned, to bear on any transport problems that come before the House.  I am pleased he feels that the second major item in the Bill, <Col N="1076" /> that of budgetary powers, is desirable.  I am also pleased that Deputy Taylor who has served a long apprenticeship in local government finds that the Bill, with words such as &ldquo;advice&rdquo; and &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;, is too weak and watery to be effective in doing some of the major jobs we would like it to do.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (3), between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  promote the greater use of public transport within the Authority's functional area.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This simply adds a third definition to the general duties and functions of the Authority under section 8.  My reason for putting forward this amendment &mdash; and I hope the Minister can see his way to accepting it either as it is or in a revised form &mdash; is that I feel strongly that there is a need to shift the balance in favour of public transport.  At this point I am not referring to the distinction between privately run public transport and State owned public transport; that is a separate <Col N="1081" /> issue.  I am talking about the necessity to ensure that our roads and streets over the next 20 years are not clogged up by hundreds of thousands of cars travelling into and out of Dublin at peak hours. Indeed, peak hours will stretch and become ever closer together if the projected numbers of cars materialise and we will have a continuous traffic jam in our city.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we should attempt to give a particular direction to the Authority as regards how we see transport developing in the region.  The Eastern Regional Development Agency carried out recently a fairly detailed study of what they expect in future population trends in the eastern region and pinpointed various areas of development but, for one reason or another that I do not know of, they did not address themselves at all to the question of the development of the transport services to cater for the projected population increase.  The main function of transport, whether by car, bus or train, is to shift people and goods as quickly as possible, as comfortably as possible and perhaps as cheaply as possible from one point to another.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that there will be a need to restrict, to some extent at least, access of private transport into the city in order to maintain some kind of reasonable living environment.  It is also necessary for us to attempt to influence the development of our tranportation and the purchasing decision of people in relation to transport.  It seems that there are many people, for instance, in Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown, who can ill afford it but are being forced to buy &ldquo;bangers&rdquo; of cars and perhaps drive them untaxed and uninsured, because of the inadequacy of the public transport network.  There is a wastage of national resources investment in a large number of private modes of transport. Investment in public transport would be far more cost efficient.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can see his way to adopting my amendment in its present form, or in some amended form which might be more appropriate to parliamentary <Col N="1082" /> terminology.  The need is to indicate a necessity to move away from the idea that over the next 20 years of development people, singly or in pairs must buy cars in order to get from our suburbs into work.  Indeed, some of our suburbs are fairly distant from the city centre.  We can include Leixlip, for example, although it is in County Kildare and outside the greater Dublin area in terms of administration. One can think in terms of Mulhuddart, which again is a fairly long distance away.  These areas need public transport if people are not to be forced into buying cars, clogging up roads and creating the necessity for even greater investment in roads, bridges and so on.</P>
    <P>It has always struck me that in the debate about the viability, for instance, of DART we are told that the subsidy will be X number of pounds and cost of producing it X number of pounds.  We have never seen a comparative study of what the costs are of major road developments and buying land to provide major road developments, the by-passes, which are required and the ongoing cost of maintaining these new road developments. I have no hard figures to back it up, but it is my view that in terms of the actual cost in pounds there will not be that great a divergence between developing a public transport system and providing roads for motor cars.  The better living environment one would have as a result of fewer cars on the road and avoiding the necessity of driving on great laneways through our cities and suburbs are costs which are rarely considered when balancing the development of roads against the development of rail.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to include my amendment in the Bill and to give a direction to the Authority that we feel there is a need for greater emphasis in the promotion of public transportation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the central purposes in setting up the Dublin Transport Authority is to encourage the use of public transport and to give it the impetus Deputy De Rossa has spoken of.  For that reason I have much pleasure in accepting his amendment.  I believe that when the <Col N="1083" /> Authority are set up and working more people will opt for public transport.  That, of course, assumes that the Authority will achieve one of their other principal purposes, that is, to bring about an efficient, a reasonable, in terms of cost, and speedy transport service.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa spoke about Blanchardstown, one of the new western suburbs which is fairly distant from the city centre &mdash; it is in my constituency.  It is true that the transport service for people of this area who do not have cars is not as good as it should be, but there are a number of reasons for this.  Some of the remarks I am about to make would apply equally to places like Tallaght, Clondalkin, Swords, Leixlip and so on, but there is a special factor to be taken into account in the case of Blanchardstown.</P>
      <P>In Dublin city and county the prevailing planning policy is one of low rise, low density development.  That planning policy has very general support.  Everybody in all parties supports the approach of the planning authorities not to have high rise flats &mdash; indeed to have hardly any flats &mdash; but to have houses with fairly large gardens and wide open spaces, but that policy has inevitable implications for transport.  First, it slows down transport because people will walk only so far to a bus stop.  This means there have to be more bus stops and the more bus stops there are, the slower the service.  It also means that within the walking range of that bus stop there is a lower population than would otherwise be the case, and that also adversely affects the economics of running a transport service.  This fact has been brought out by different studies.  An Foras Forbartha highlighted the fact that this planning factor greatly affects the transport options available to us, particularly the future extension of the DART &mdash; the Dublin Area Rapid Transit.  It is not possible to have rapid transit if there are many stops and yet, with a low rise, low density planning policy there will have to be many stops, otherwise people will not use the service, and this is very costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> In the case of Blanchardstown there is another factor.  Blanchardstown is separated from the city by the Phoenix Park. People have very strong views about whether buses should be allowed to go through the park.  I have posed this problem to my constituents by way of questionnaire in the past and it has been studied by an interdepartmental working committee.  People in the greater Blanchardstown area who do not have cars &mdash; women and children who may have to use the bus because the husband has taken the car to work &mdash; have to travel by bus, which has to drive around the park.  This takes much longer because of traffic jams.  Yet car owners can merrily drive through the park in a fraction of the time it takes to drive around it.  There is a very strong lobby led by An Taisce, and there is some merit in what they say, which holds that buses should not be allowed to run through Phoenix Park.  If we ban buses from the park, are we to allow the cars to continue going through the park to Blanchardstown?  If buses were to go through the park they would be less of an intrusion as far as aesthetics, the environment and the air in the park are concerned than cars.  It would be hard to ban cars from going through the park.</P>
    <P>Because there are no other roads to take that traffic, we will be increasing the length of time it takes for drivers to get to their place of work; we will be increasing air pollution, traffic jams and so on. It is very hard to see that as a realistic option.  Yet there is a school of thought that all traffic should be banned from the park.  It is very hard to see that as a realistic option because the roadworks required to be done in order to take up that traffic would be very significant.  I do not see which of the communities besides the park would like to be knocked down to make way for new roads simply because people want to stop existing traffic going through the Phoenix Park. If one does not stop existing traffic, then can one justify stopping the bus?  I do not think one can justify stopping the bus &mdash; if one feels as I do and as Deputy De Rossa does that one wants to encourage people to use public transport.  Yet when <Col N="1085" /> I sent out a letter to nearby areas in my constituency to test opinion on this I know that the very mention of the issue created controversy.</P>
    <P>These are precisely the sorts of issues that have to be addressed taking into account the transport needs of all the people, especially those who do not have their own transport.  Of course the environmental issues and the very special position of the Phoenix Park have to be taken into account.  The issues need not be discussed in an atmosphere of rancour or emotion.  They should be discussed, dispassionately examined and decisions taken.  There is now a report on the subject on my desk advancing the two arguments, detailing the time savings that would be achieved by allowing buses to go through the park, the savings on fuel and so on.</P>
    <P>I raise this in the context of Deputy De Rossa's amendment and what he said about it.  He is right, people in the outer suburbs, like Blanchardstown, and the greater Blanchardstown area, because they are so distant from the city centre, have very special transport needs.  The least we can do is endeavour to provide them with as cheap as possible speedy, reliable transport services.  That goes for the other suburbs as well.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in accepting Deputy De Rossa's amendment because it reiterates one of the central purposes of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to support the amendment.  I might make a few comments on the purpose behind the amendment and on what Deputy De Rossa said.  The activities of the task force have improved the quality of service available.  The Minister and Deputy De Rossa mentioned the importance of quality service.  When my party asked me to put heads of a transport policy together some time ago I linked a separate Dublin city services bus company with the idea of a strong Dublin Transport Authority. My objective at that time was that there would be an efficient and well run city bus service.  Given the population I simply could not see how such a service could <Col N="1086" /> not pay its way or even make a profit. There are in the conurbation practically one million people.  If the emphasis were placed on public transport &mdash; and a strong Dublin Transport Authority would be able to put certain brakes on private transport at least in parts of the city &mdash; then there should be a commercially viable Dublin city bus service provided for the capital.  I know it would require tight management of the company, leadership and good marketing.  All of that would be needed, leadership of the company covering the Dublin city services, good marketing of what is available and a continuation of the type of provision, bus lanes and so on, that has made somewhat for an easier flow as of now.  I know that linked into it is the whole problem of the one person bus service.  I mentioned in the House already that I had found a one man bus service very much in place in parts of the Soviet Union last summer, operating very efficiently, providing a punctual, efficient and good service.  One could purchase the tickets in a slot machine and punch them oneself on board the bus.  That kind of idea might apply.  We should at least explore that kind of possibility.</P>
      <P>I remember getting the figures for other Euro-cities with regard to subsidisation of transport.  If my memory serves me right &mdash; it may have been that same old study &mdash; Dublin did not come out too badly.  I carried out a more up to date study of cities roughly the same size as Dublin.  There is no reason why we should not have that kind of service.  There is no question or doubt about it, people will use it.  I do not know whether it is simply because there is not always an efficient public service that people invest in bangers and drive them around sometimes at certain risk even to themselves.  Certainly in some age groups there is a fascination in having something of one's own to drive around in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Fianna Fáil Government who thought out, planned and brought to execution the whole DART system did come under severe criticism. I appreciate the remarks made by Deputy De Rossa, that there never has been a <Col N="1087" /> comprehensive, all embracing study carried out of costings, taking everything, but everything, into consideration.  It is not all that easy to glibly say: this was not worth the investment or that was not worth the investment.  There is a superficial way of looking at it, of proving that the investment was too high and the cost too great.  There is also the comprehensive one suggested by Deputy De Rossa, which is the only one relevant when one thinks of the transport problems of a city the size of Dublin.  I suppose it is a small city, but it has become a sizeable one with approximately one million people in its conurbation.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister mention the Phoenix Park and Blanchardstown. I use the Phoenix Park at least twice a week.  I must say it would go very hard on me if buses and trucks&mdash;now banned&mdash;were allowed to go through it. Even though it would be a considerable inconvenience for me, if it were a question of banning cars&mdash;in other words banning all motor traffic from the Park&mdash;rather than acceding to the request for trucks and buses to go through, then for the sake of the environment and for the park itself, I would prefer to see everything banned.  Admittedly it would cause a certain amount of chaos.</P>
    <P>I should like to recall to the House the story of how the Phoenix Park came to belong to the people of Dublin.  They owe it to the Duke of Ormonde.  It was to be given to George I's mistress&mdash;I think she was the Duchess of Cleveland.  As an architectural historian of Dublin city said&mdash;the Duke of Ormonde succeeded in having that attempt to give it to her, following the old principle of rewards in Ireland for services rendered in England, blocked and in saving it for the city of Dublin.  Indeed, it was not his only input into the planning of Dublin city.  I think he was responsible also for the quays being the way they are.  We have an obligation to preserve it.  If necessary cram the Navan Road, cram Chapelizod but do not let the park be despoiled.</P>

      <P>I will not pursue that line.  I should like to comment on the success of the task force.  There is no doubt that they have been very successful in introducing the bus lanes, the contra flow for buses, co-ordinated traffic signals and so on, things I suggested many years ago.  However, I wonder to what extent the drop in the number of cars on the road as a result of the recession contributed to the freer flow of traffic.  If people were buying the cars they would like to buy I wonder if the flow of traffic would be as good.  I accept that the buses and cars are running better as a result of the efforts of the task force.  The rearrangement of traffic on the quays also assisted the flow of traffic.</P>
      <P>Another matter that contributed to the improvement in the flow of traffic was the decline in work in the docks area. However it is important that we plan for the future.  Hopefully we will soon emerge from the recession and industry and business will prosper but when that occurs we should have in place the proper transport infrastructure to ensure that our streets are not once again clogged up and overburdened with juggernauts.  We do not want them tearing up and down our streets and polluting the atmosphere. I hope the transport Authority will have power to restrict access by juggernauts in certain parts of the city, particularly in residential areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been reading with interest the debate in regard to access to the Phoenix Park by buses.  My inclination is towards assisting those who cannot afford a car or, for whatever reason, are not in a position to drive a car.  They should be facilitated at least to the same extent as owners of private cars.  I have not seen the report which is on the Minister's desk <Col N="1089" /> but I would tend towards the view that buses to a limited extent should be permitted to use the Phoenix Park, even on an experimental basis.  I will be facetious and suggest that the Phoenix Park be restricted to green buses in order to blend in with the scenery.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I share the views of Deputy Wilson that we should restrict traffic going through the Phoenix Park.  Many people are concerned about the speed of cars travelling through the park.  Many accidents have occurred and a number of deer killed.  I would not agree with Deputy De Rossa's suggestion that buses should be permitted to use the park.  I agree that people should be allowed to drive their cars to the park but things have got out of hand up there.</P>
      <P>With regard to juggernaut traffic, I am sure the Minister will recall that some years ago when he was a member of Dublin Corporation concern was expressed about the speed of those vehicles through the city.  There were complaints about the parking of such vehicles in residential areas.  It appears there is little the Garda can do about such parking.  At meetings of residents' associations people express their concern about the way juggernauts park in residential areas but the Garda have said that there is little they can do if the vehicle is not causing an obstruction.  I hope a provision will be inserted in the Bill compelling the drivers of such vehicles to park in certain areas. At one time Dublin Corporation prepared plans for parking space for juggernauts but they were not implemented.</P>

      <P>I had a series of amendments to this section which were opposed by the Minister.  I cannot allow the section to pass without expressing my regret that an effective authority &mdash; there are areas where, as the Minister has said, the Authority will be effective &mdash; will <Col N="1090" /> not come into existence in the areas I mentioned.  I must express disappointment that my amendments which were geared towards making it mandatory on the Authority to produce a plan were not accepted by the Minister or the House. Although I did not get support, generally speaking, from Deputy De Rossa I note that the next amendment we will be dealing with was partly covered by one of my amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This section states:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service, and where matters within the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment are concerned with the consent also of that Minister, may by order confer on the Authority such additional functions, in relation to road and rail transport planning, resources or operations in its functional area, as the Minister thinks proper and specifies in the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the fact that we have the Ministers for Finance, the Public Service, the Environment and Transport included &mdash; one would be inclined to say Uncle Tom Cobbley and all &mdash; the section is an important one.  Earlier the Minister indicated that enabling powers were being granted by him in the Bill.  Subsection (1) seems to be relevant in that regard.  One could be cynical about anything being enabling which would have to take on piggyback the Ministers for Finance, the Public Service, the Environment and Transport.  It beats me.  I should like the Minister to indicate to the House if he thinks that the section could be used on some day of enlightenment to make provision for the type of plan that I have been advocating if he so decided.  Are the <Col N="1091" /> enabling powers given there enough to cover such an eventuality?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This section will enable me to table for the prior approval of the House an extension of the functional areas of the Authority.  Let me be clear about that because section 10 also deals with functional areas.  I may specify additional functionings for the Authority in respect of their entire area or part thereof but that will require the prior sanction of the House.  The sort of thing we could include would be the requirement of a transport plan on which Deputy Wilson is so keen, disbursement of Exchequer funds for the purposes of transport in the Dublin area and other matters which we might wish to add in later years.  However, in the light of experience of how the transport Authority proposed by the Bill will operate and in the light of events and developments, we will be able to take these matters on board.  If Deputy Wilson has the misfortune to return to 28 Kildare Street as Minister he will be able to institute his transport plan if he wishes to do so.</P>

In 1982 we were talking about Dublin Corporation, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and the Dublin County Council area.  The Minister said he would have powers to extend the functional area also.  What is the exact legal position in regard to the three bodies which I have just mentioned?  I know Deputy Raphael <Col N="1092" /> Burke is chairman of a huge council but does that cover the original Borough of Dún Laoghaire as well as the whole of the county council area?

I understand that a Bill will be introduced in the near future to give effect to the arrangements in respect of splitting Dublin county into three county councils and the abolition of Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  I should point out that, even though Dún Laoghaire has been a borough for a long time, it is also represented on Dublin County Council and has been for many years.</P>

      <P>(2)  The Authority shall comply with any direction under this section.</P>
      <P>With regard to subsection (1) I presume the Minister for the Environment is in the back of the Minister's mind.  I am strongly opposed to the section because it gives too much power to the Minister. If the Dublin Transport Authority are to have any role or function and if we are not wasting time this is the area where they should have competence but it is in this area that the Minister is taking power to himself to give direction in writing concerning the traffic management objectives of the Authority and the Authority must comply with any such direction. I should like to hear a justification from the Minister for his taking that power in section 12.  This is a provision that the House should oppose.  It smacks of an administrator afraid to allow any little bit of power out of his hands.  It is giving the last word to the Minister in regard to general directions on traffic management.</P>

      <P>Earlier we had extensive amendments on section 8 from Deputy Wilson which proposed not only to give the Minister power but to make the Government the effective authority for Dublin.  Now the Deputy is objecting to my having a reserve power in relation to the management objectives and administration.  This is a very unreasonable line for the Deputy to adopt.  Surely it is reasonable to provide in the Bill for the Minister to be able to give written directives should the need arise in relation to traffic management objectives and administration.  All of this costs money and the Exchequer will be footing the bill.  I or my successors will be answerable to this House for any such directive and for any costs involved so I do not know why there should be any concern about the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister harps back regularly to what was the coping stone in my suggestion for a plan to be made statutorily by the Dublin Transport Authority. In great detail I went into the procedures with regard to the plan.  I repeat that there could be nothing more democratic than the process I outlined with regard to that plan.  I envisage an authority with expertise in transport and planning.  I envisage their constructing a plan and the next step in the process was to be consultation with the local authorities. The Minister has said that three county councils will be formed eventually together with the Corporation of the City of Dublin.  I envisage careful consideration being given to suggestions from the local authorities and publication of the plan, all steps away from the Minister and away from the Government.  I envisage people with knowledge, experience and judgement making the assessment and there being a public inquiry giving an opportunity for those interested in areas of the plan with regard to the city or to transport in the city to air their views.  I do not think one could have a blueprint for a more democratic process than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public inquiry having been held and due note taken of what emerged from <Col N="1096" /> it, the plan as finally settled by the Authority would be sent to the Government for acceptance by them.  The purpose of that is not to give the Government a major role in the affairs of the Dublin Transport Authority but to give them the authority that acceptance by the Government would give them and which is sadly lacking in the splinter process of decision making in this area as of now.  I have the full support of Deputy Bruton in that regard.  He does not consider that there is enough in this Bill in that regard nor does Deputy Taylor consider there is enough bone and muscle for the Authority as envisaged.</P>
    <P>The role that was to be left to the Government was merely to settle any disputes that might arise between one and another local authority or between the Dublin Transport Authority and any one local authority.  That might never occur but it is a different matter from what is involved in section 12.  The provision is so out of place that it sticks out like a sore thumb.  Even the vagueness of the phrase that the Minister may, with the consent of any Minister concerned, and so on, is irritating in a Bill that is to become a statute.  What is meant by the phrase, &ldquo;any other Minister concerned&rdquo;? The phrase, &ldquo;the Minister may give to the Authority such general directions in writing&rdquo; is included to give more bite concerning the traffic management objectives of the Authority or of their administration as the Minister considers appropriate.  I do not know how the Minister will have the knowledge that will authorise him, as it were, to write to the Authority and give them directions. Where will he acquire the expertise to match the expertise available by definition to the Dublin Transport Authority Furthermore, there is the case in subsection (2) that any Czar would be satisfied with, that is, that the Authority shall comply with any direction under this section.  This looks like a foreign body, like something that was added after the remainder of the Bill had been put together.  It is not in harmony with the rest of the Bill and for that reason I am opposing it.  If I had time now I would <Col N="1097" /> put it to a vote but when we take this Bill again I will be calling a vote on this aspect because it should not have any part in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister drew a parallel between what he is claiming for himself here and what I was claiming for the Government in my amendments. There is no such parallel.  The Minister is comparing the lesser with the greater.  He knows that the argument he was putting forward was not paralleled by my suggestion in regard to powers for the Government.  The Minister in his heart of hearts knows that the argument he was putting up was not paralleled by my suggestions regarding powers for the Government.</P>

Other Deputies have also tabled amendments.  I sought through your office for time for Deputy Mac Giolla to speak in this debate.  In the past, before this practice of introducing lists of speakers, you did endeavour to provide some few minutes to us in order to address ourselves to our amendments. I must protest that this procedure of introducing lists at this point, which specifically excludes those of us who have amendments to the motion before the House, is a restriction on our right to speak.

      <P>As one of the local Dáil Deputies for the constituency of Dún Laoghaire, I was very concerned at the proposed closure of Carysfort Training College.  I am, in the nature of things, over the wall of Carysfort college in that I am a next door neighbour and have been so in excess of the last 20 years. One can imagine the horror in the local community when it was proposed that the college be closed.  There is another additional feature to this.  I have discussed the philosophy, the economics and educational problems etc. in my 20 minute contribution last evening.  The local economy will also have been affected by this proposed decision to close Carysfort.  The local community in the Booterstown, Blackrock, Monkstown and Dún Laoghaire areas, which the Minister seems to have forgotten, depend for their livelihood on Carysfort &mdash;landladies, shopkeepers and all those people who in one way or another support the local community.  In addition to the shopkeepers and the landladies, there is the support and maintenance staff of the college itself who will be made redundant. The college is a vital part of the local economy and it is not good enough to seek to undermine units of vital economic significance to a locality, especially when there are no tenable arguments for such an action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very interesting that all elements of the community came out strongly against the proposed closure, including the Blackrock Businesses Association and the Blackrock Community Council, which I have supported and will continue to support until this matter reaches its proper conclusion, namely, that the Minister this evening in his remarks, hopefully, will make a definite statement once and for all clearing the air and giving <Col N="1102" /> back to the staff, to the community, to those people working in Carysfort college &mdash; the maintenance staff and students&mdash;&mdash; peace of mind.  Let them settle back into their traditional role once and for all. That is what they want.  That is what they are entitled to get.  I am discussing the educational and economic sides, therefore, the Government's curt statement on Carysfort college is both a reflection on their unwillingness to contribute to educational progress and on their intrinsically flawed economic policies.  It is also a comment on Ireland under this Coalition. In her day the foundress of the Sisters of Mercy, Mother Catherine McAuley, was to the forefront of the movement for the advancement of women.  Moreover, as has been pointed out by various commentators, the women teachers whom she and her successors trained to staff her schools served the nation well.  They enhanced the role of women as leadership figures in their own communities even before there was a formally organised women's movement or women's liberation in this country.</P>

      <P>There was an expectation when the Opposition put down this motion and moved it in Private Members' time that we would have a contentious and acrimonious debate on a subject which has <Col N="1103" /> been controversial.  I am glad to say that that expectation has not come to pass because the constructive contribution from my constitutency colleague made it very clear that on this issue there is a common case between both sides of the House.  Too often there is a feeling on both sides that we must approach matters in an adversarial spirit, that we have to get into confrontation, that the Opposition are not doing their job unless they automatically oppose red tooth and claw and that the Government are not doing their job unless they respond in kind.</P>
      <P>Some debates provoke that sort of adversarial situation.  In a case like this where there is clear common case between us adversarial politics are out of place.  Deputy O'Rourke set the tone for her party, which I am sure will be followed by the remaining speakers on that side, notwithstanding the unfortunate lapse from that standard by Deputy Andrews who had not the graciousness to wait ten seconds for my speech having concluded his remarks by expressing the wish and hope that I would make statements that would satisfy what he was looking for.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Orders, if I may be so bold, the only people who are entitled to use scripts are Ministers who are proposing or moving debates.  It is an unfortunate practice that has crept into the House that Deputies invariably come here with scripts and nobody knows whether they are their own production <Col N="1104" /> or whether they are merely reciting the views of somebody in a backroom upstairs.  I do not have a script.  The Deputy will have to listen <i>viva voce</i>.  I welcome the constructive approach because it is my objective to be equally constructive.  I hope that the controversy which arose over the whole Carysfort issue can be put behind us.  At this stage, close to the actual event, one's perspectives are not unnaturally narrowed by that closeness.  I have no doubt that with the passage of time it will be seen that the words in the Fianna Fáil motion, arbitrary and precipitate, were unfortunate. To suggest that the decision was arbitrary in the sense that it was taken as a stand alone without being placed in any budgetary or educational context, will be seen in the fullness of time to be a misdescription. Likewise, the use of the word precipitate, with the passage of time and the benefit of hindsight, will also be seen to be an inaccurate word.  I do not propose to reopen the controversy.  That would be unfortunate.</P>
      <P>Another unfortunate aspect which will be cured in time is the way in which the controversy focused in a very personal way on my predecessor.  The impression went abroad that she was a person somehow less than caring and lacking in consideration. People who know her character will have no doubt that any accusations along those lines are totally misplaced.  Deputy O'Rourke is not long in the House and if &mdash; and it is a big if &mdash; in the fullness of time she achieves office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Time will show that the amount of work which my predecessor has done in her few short years in the Department of Education has been quite outstanding and unique in its innovative character and <Col N="1105" /> in the depth of reform which she has initiated throughout the whole educational field.  That has been acknowledged by the professionals in that field.  It is unfortunate that the controversy broke out.  It is the wish of all parties involved that the book would be firmly closed on this controversy and that we now move forward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; recognising the problems that have to be tackled and the positions and responsibilities of the various parties involved in Carysfort College. First, we must consider the position of the Sisters of Mercy who are the legal owners of the college.  They founded it, built it and serviced it over many years, a century plus.  It must also be recognised that there is considerable State investment in the campus, measured in money terms not insignificant by any means.  We must also think of the teaching staff and the student body.</P>
      <P>With regard to the present student body it has been made clear to them that the courses on which they have embarked will be brought to a conclusion on the Carysfort campus.  That decision eased a lot of unrest and anxiety for the present corps of students and enabled them to pursue and successfully complete their studies leading to graduation.  I want to join with Deputy O'Rourke in paying tribute to the work of the Sisters of Mercy over the years.  She had an anecdote to show her family connection.  I might cap it if I might be permitted to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will not pursue that any further but he was a wise man to go twice for a teacher.  My anecdote is that my first day at school was in the caring hands of the Sisters of Mercy.  I am glad to say that the kind sister who received me that day, when I was four years old, is still hale and hearty and living in St. Joseph's in Longford.  When religious have a responsibility they do not discharge <Col N="1106" /> it in the same way as a lay person, as a livelihood and a profession, but as a vocation.</P>
      <P>The Sisters of Mercy were founded with two specific vocational objectives, the training of teachers and teaching and providing nursing services for the poor. It is quite clear that the objective of that vocation will have to be honoured and taken into account in whatever new role is devised for Carysfort.  Lest there be any doubt, Carysfort as a teacher training college will have to have a new role.  The numbers needed in our primary teaching system have declined to an extent that there is now a surplus of training places in that whole area.  There is no rational justification for maintaining three training colleges when two training colleges provide more than enough space to train all the teachers we can foresee as being needed over the next number of years. That is a fact of life about which we cannot be sentimental.  We must face it. It was that unfortunate fact of life that precipitated the present issue.</P>
      <P>I visited Carysfort last week for two purposes, to meet the sisters, staff and students and to see the premises and get an idea of the size of the campus and the range of facilities there.  It was essentially a courtesy call.  I regret that when I was coming out of the building I allowed myself to be door-stepped by a television reporter.  I regret this because somebody of my political experience should not have allowed that to happen to him and it may have given the impression which was adverted to here, I am sure with the best of intentions by Deputy Andrews last night, that I was somehow in breach of faith, having said that my visit was one of courtesy.  It was intended to be a courtesy visit, not a business visit and was not to be accompanied by a statement to the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in Carysfort there were other ladies and gentlemen of the media present and they can confirm that I did not give interviews.  I spoke to the staff and students there and it is possible that they talked to the press afterwards.  That is part and parcel of what happens and, if somebody repeated what was said at <Col N="1107" /> these meetings, it is unfair to attribute that to me.  I make this clear because there was an accusation of bad faith against me.  It was not my intention to act in bad faith and I did not do so.  If there is any misunderstanding I am glad to clear it up.  It is essential that we go forward without misunderstandings and that we trust each other.</P>
    <P>I cannot, as Minister for Education, decree what is to happen to Carysfort College because I do not own it.  The State has an investment, an equity, a high interest in it because of its importance in the educational scene.  Likewise, neither can the owners and management say exclusively what is to become of it because they are interdependent with the State.  Like considerations apply to the professional staff.  I have no doubt that between the three components interested in and responsible for the future of Carysfort with goodwill, and one common basic objective, the betterment of the educational system, we can devise uses for Carysfort in future that will fulfil and recognise the vocational aspirations of the Sisters of Mercy, that can give satisfaction to the professional staff and that can produce immense benefits for the educational system.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to speculate about its future uses.  The question of in-service training was mentioned by Deputy O'Rourke as a possible option.  It is, but it is something that is very technical.  The nature, scope and funding of this option is a very technical issue but it is a very valuable and important element of teacher training and the educational scene.  Undoubtedly, that is a subject that would have to get close examination. There are other options but I will not speculate on them because that might raise apprehensions or expectations that could not be fulfilled or that might be misplaced.</P>
    <P>I intend arranging and setting up structures whereby discussions will get under way between all the interested parties. Submissions will be invited from appropriate technical people and I invite Deputy O'Rourke, and any other <Col N="1108" /> member of her party who would be interested, to make submissions into these structures that I propose setting up so that we can preserve this feeling of common case, that we share a common concern for those involved in the educational system.  I hope to be able to devise these structures and commence discussion in the very near future.  That will be an exciting and interesting development when one considers it in parallel with the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board with its potential for innovation and change.  Everyone interested in the educational scene will see an interesting and exciting time ahead for education.  However, it will take a little time.  It is essential that the area should be free from controversy.  Deputy O'Rourke has contributed greatly to that in the spirit of her contribution to these proceedings.</P>
    <P>I will expand on why it is not possible to continue Carysfort as a teacher training single purpose institution.  The numbers are not required.  There is excess capacity in the system which nobody can deny. All our training colleges since their foundation have operated as single purpose institutions to educate and train teachers and they have done their job outstandingly well.  In 1974-75 the training course was lengthened to three years. At that stage the colleges took advantage of that to strengthen and enrich their courses and form associations with the universities and this led to the award of the degree of Bachelor of Education to the graduates of the colleges.  We have had a core of professional teachers second to none in Europe.  That statement would stand objective examination.</P>
    <P>One must remember that all those outstanding people were the products of single purpose colleges devoted exclusively to the training of national teachers. Two colleges will continue to be so exclusively devoted, but I put this slight emphasis on the question of single purpose institutions to indicate that what might be in some people's minds, the hope that some people might have for the continuance of teacher training as we know it on a reduced scale in Carysfort with the implication that along with it <Col N="1109" /> other activities will be taking place, would be totally out of line with the traditional way in which teachers have been trained.  The traditional way has been outstandingly successful, and to have an educational regime in Carysfort that would try to marry the traditional way and some new developments is <i>a priori</i> risky and should not be embarked on when there is no need to embark on it because already we have the two other colleges to continue the outstandingly successful training methods that have served us so well for so long.  I make that point lest anybody be unwittingly misled after our discussions here this evening as to what precisely my view on that issue is.  That is not to say that some facets, some elements, some specialised areas of primary teacher training could not continue to be dealt with in Carysfort, but even saying that I am getting into an area from which I have excluded myself, speculation on what might be the eventual use to be made of Carysfort.  I want to get away from that; I do not want to get into it because that is best done within the structures we will set up by the people best qualified to contribute to those structures and, above all, away from controversy and publicity.  I have no doubt that when we finish our discussions &mdash; there is adequate time for them to take place in a comprehensive and detailed way because the college will be busy with the present student body until they graduate, albeit reducing &mdash; we will be able to put together an interesting package.</P>
    <P>Ideas have been put to me from a great number of sources, ideas which I find exciting and innovative and which will be of immense benefit to our educational system.  Changes are now taking place in Irish education which are fundamental because the shape of our education today will to a very large measure determine the shape of our society in years to come. We must be careful that the changes we make will be appropriate, consistent with the type of society we want to see on this island in the decades ahead.  A heavy responsibility lies on all of us who are interested in the educational scene to ensure that all the facilities available to <Col N="1110" /> us are used in the best way possible so that the great challenge will be discharged and when future generations come to look back with their perspective on education they will be able to say that in our time we were at least not unwise and possibly wise.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made it clear why I cannot answer Deputy O'Rourke's invitation in the course of her speech that I would make a commitment on the lines she asked.  I can make a commitment in general terms that the facilities in Carysfort, the ownership, management and staff there, will be involved in exciting and interesting work for the benefit of Irish education.  I want to make that commitment here seriously, and a commitment that I would expect to see fulfilled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It will be seen also as a beginning of a new, equally important role for a wonderful institution.  I look forward to participating in that work.  I conclude by expressing the confident hope that all the parties involved in Carysfort will join with me in looking forward to discharging that task.</P>

    <P>I want to address a number of issues in relation to Carysfort as an educational institution, its proud tradition and the reasons as to whether one should or should not change the present arrangements in Carysfort or develop other structures and facilities in line with the existing services there.  Before I do, however, and not in any way intent on opposition for opposition's sake, or on being antagonistic towards the Minister, I wish to raise a number of very serious fundamental issues arising directly from what he said, hinted, suggested and inferred and what he did not say.  He talked about not wanting to raise expectations but wanting to be constructive and positive and wanting an all-round forum for discussion.</P>
    <P>I cannot be sure of what he said but I have some reasonably professional acquaintanceship with the whole issue of teacher training since I spent a few years with my colleague across the floor, Deputy Kenny, in one of these institutions some years ago and spent some years as a teacher in this city.  I am going to address a number of things that the Minister said or inferred and perhaps we will have some clarification before the end of the evening.  I shall point out to the Minister some very important, fundamental reasons why we should have that clarification.</P>
    <P>First, the Minister called for &ldquo;the closing of the book on this controversy&rdquo;.  I hope I am quoting him correctly.  In some way he implied that this side of the House initiated the controversy.  I should like to knock that on the head.  I know the Minister will have to agree with me when I say that on 3 and 4 February last two letters issued from his Department, the first to the office of His Grace, the Archbishop of Dublin, informing the Archbishop after going into some slight detail about the great honour that Carysfort college had bestowed on the nation and the tremendously important role in had in education down through the decades, that Carysfort college had to be closed.  I believe what I was told and they were the words I was told were used in that <Col N="1113" /> correspondence &mdash; that Carysfort college of education was to be closed.  On the following day there was subsequent correspondence with the management of the college using the expression &ldquo;the closure of Carysfort college&rdquo;.  It is quite clear what that means.  One can only come to one definite conclusion in interpreting those words, that Our Lady of Mercy College of Education, Carysfort, was to close.</P>
    <P>There are a number of senses to all this and one sense on which we could all agree is that we have come a significant way tonight from that situation where letters issued from the Department of Education telling the management of Carysfort college that their college was to be closed without consultation, without discussion, without any due regard having been given to the very impressive set of proposals that have been put from that college as a response to their acknowledgement that there was under-utilisation of the resources. In one sense we have come a considerably long way tonight.  I am acknowledging that, on the part of this side of the House.  At least we are hearing a lot now about consultation, about a forum for all-round discussion with all the interested parties, of invitations, even to this side of the House, to make an input into these fora for discussions and consultations.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I still must put a question to the Minister once again because much of what he said here this evening, contrary to dampening expectations, must be raising them in many ways. The Minister went to some lengths to define the vocational role of the Sisters of Mercy.  He then went on to suggest in some way that any agreement arrived at would give expression to those vocational aspirations of the Sisters of Mercy.  He talked about the need for setting up structures for the proper resolution of the problem in the interests of the future of education and about the college in the future, the institution, the structure, having a very important and exciting role in the provision of Irish education.</P>
    <P>What the Minister did not say clearly one way or the other and he is reported <Col N="1114" /> as having said it last Friday &mdash; his Minister of State certainly stated it last night &mdash; is that the resources hitherto available to Carysfort college in the context of the milieu of teacher training must be reallocated and the role of the college redefined.  There is one and only one interpretation that the management of Carysfort can put on it, and indeed all Deputies in this House who want objectively to interpret it, that is, that teacher training in Carysfort is to cease.  Why the Minister did not state that clearly this evening is beyond me.</P>
    <P>I put it to him that there are at present leaving certificate students who wish to apply for teacher training and are still confused as to whether Carysfort college will be one of the colleges prepared and able to offer those courses.  Added to what we heard last Friday and what has been said over the past couple of days, in the House here this afternoon, in response to question from Deputies O'Rourke and De Rossa, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I do not want to be previous in anything I will or will not do, I will rule out or will not rule out, and I will not rule out teacher training.</P>
    <P>That is what I took down verbatim from the Minister this afternoon.  The record of the House will show that what I am saying is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know precisely what the Minister has been saying here.  Talk about ring a ring a rosies! That is how we have been going, following the words, turns of phrase and <Col N="1115" /> expressions.  At the end of the day what I see is confusion.  It suggests &mdash; but I hope that I am wrong in this &mdash; a deliberate attempt to confuse on the part of the Minister this evening in the House.  No definitive statement was made in relation to the central kernel issue here.  Is there or is there not going to be teacher training or teacher education, as we know it?  The Minister knows what we mean.  The Irish public know; the board of management, staff and students of Carysfort college know what we mean.  Will there or will there not be teacher training at Carysfort college in the future?  In accordance with the responsibilities and duties placed on him in his office I hope the Minister will give an unequivocal statement on that this evening, one way or the other.</P>
      <P>It is a very sad day for Irish education, and indeed for the nation as a whole, for its culture and traditions, that a motion such as this has to be put down by Deputy O'Rourke.  Indeed, only for the vigilance of that Deputy in this matter, her constructiveness and positiveness, the manner in which she treated this entire episode, the wish expressed by the Minister about keeping the controversy down might have been realised.  I commend Deputy O'Rourke for putting down the motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the arbitrary and precipitate decision of the Government to close down Carysfort College and requests that immediate action be taken to ensure that this great and valuable institution be retained as an integral part of our higher educational system, with a specific role in teacher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to commend Deputy O'Rourke for being positive and constructive about this and for the manner in which she has handled this entire controversial episode over the past four weeks.  The discarding of such a proud tradition of educational <Col N="1116" /> service as Carysfort is not only alarming but must be totally deplored.</P>
    <P>I think it is only appropriate that we in this House should reflect for a moment on the enormous contribution to education made by the Sisters of Mercy at Carysfort and before that at Baggot Street.  This proud tradition, selflessly committed, extends over a century and a half of our history.  The hallmark of this great institution known as Carysfort college was of a spirit fired by a vision which was inherited from Sister Catherine McAuley herself. From its very inception, this college saw its role in the training of teachers who would go forth to educate the nation. This vision and commitment to the Irish people is equally personified today in the present custodians of that proud inheritence. These sisters and their colleagues have turned out many generations of competent, dedicated teachers whose spheres of influence have enriched every parish and every home in Ireland.</P>
    <P>At a time when educational services in Ireland demand responsible and realistic action, the insensitivity of the previous Minister &mdash; and I make no apology for referring to her in view of the evidence which is there in abundance as to what she did and how she went about what she definitely proposed to do &mdash; in this instance sadly reflects a failure on the part of the Minister and the Government to understand the educational requirements of the eighties.</P>
    <P>Invitations extended over the past few years to interested parties, such as parents, teachers and others to identify the important issues for the future of education ring rather hollow when juxtaposed against what has happened over the last four weeks.  The previous Minister's encouragement to these parties to process solutions through the establishment of such bodies as the Curriculum and Examinations Board was obviously no more than a public exercise in deception. I hope the invitation extended this evening from the Minister, given against the background of what he said about the college and its potential, will not also be a public exercise in deception.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> The consultative and discussion documents emanating from the Curriculum and Examinations Board all highlight the urgent need for educational reform.  It was obvious that this reform had implications for all levels of education.  However, this peremptory decision made by the Minister on 3 February has made a complete farce of the whole process of consultation.  It showed a failure to appreciate the crisis in education in Ireland today and the tradition, pride and value that the Irish people have always had for education, and for the various educational institutions that have made such a unique contribution to the establishment and development of the teaching profession in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over the past 60 years Ministers for Education have always indicated a willingness for consultation and discussion. It is regrettable that the previous Minister was the first to break that carefully nurtured tradition.  She compounded the insult by attempting publicly to misrepresent the facts.  Statements subsequent to the announcement ran contrary to the now known outline of the events and can only have been interpreted as an attempt to discredit a responsible and most competent manager in the interests of selfpreservation.</P>
    <P>Everybody acknowledges the need for rationalisation of educational services. Deputy O'Rourke acknowledged that last night, as did Deputy Andrews.  At a time of spare capacity in some sectors contrasting with a rapidly increasing need for additional resources in others, it is only reasonable that responsible authorities should seek the more efficient utilisation of these resources.  We on this side of the House freely acknowledge, as do the Government and Sister Regina Durkan and her management board for their part, that there are spare capacity and resources at Carysfort College. Nobody denies that.  The facts are known and they are acknowledged publicly.</P>
    <P>The college itself, recognising this situation, responsibly acknowledged it and indeed as far back as 1982, a college development committee were set up to identify priorities for the college for the <Col N="1118" /> future.  Early the following year, the college board endorsed a series of proposals from this committee which reaffirmed the commitment to preservice training, proposed extensive involvement in inservice provision and it envisaged diversification outside of teacher education for the first time.</P>
    <P>In April 1984, the college board made a detailed innovative and positive response to the Government's Programme for Action in Education 1984-87 which took account of the Department's reduction in the number entering all the colleges of education in the State and the increasing requirement for third level places arising from the expanding youth population. The response document contained proposals relating to certificate and diploma level, to inservice courses for primary level teachers and in addition to an explicit offer to provide places and courses for third level students other than trainee teachers.</P>
    <P>The college requested a meeting with the Department of Education to discuss these proposals and I am reliably informed that this request was not responded to until subsequent to a telephone call in November of that year, when a meeting was eventually convened in December.  The portion of that December 1984 meeting given to discussion of the college response document was deliberately restricted to some consideration of the proposals concerning inservice education.  No follow up response to this December 1984 meeting emanated from the Minister's office. Nevertheless, conscious of their responsibilities and obligations at all times to the nation, the college once again took the initiative in June 1985.  They submitted a second document which contained a comprehensive review of all developments. The only response was a letter of 3 February 1986 from the Minister to his Grace, the Archbishop, announcing the closure of Our Lady of Mercy College of Education at Carysfort.</P>
    <P>Contrast this ministerial edict with the caring responsible approach of the college authorities.  Surely anybody who is reasonable in this House, who is fair and <Col N="1119" /> who is honest, will admit that this was grossly unfair to the college management. It was insulting, it was demeaning to a board who had acted so responsibly, who had acted so caringly and who had addressed this serious issue so comprehensively. It must also be regarded as a blot on the career of any Minister who would behave in such a fashion.</P>
    <P>I am told that this exclusion was on the grounds that they were outside the mandate of the colleges and their role in teacher training.  It would appear that outmoded administrative structures obtaining in the Department of Education were preventing an all round discussion on a document that was clearly thought through by the college management and took full account of the resources, the capacity and the goodwill of the college authorities at Carysfort to meet a new situation.  In this way it was preventing the college from pursuing their objectives in relation to diversification.</P>
    <P>Surely the very least the college authorities could have expected was to have been listened to, or did the Minister believe, like her colleague in Health, that to consult was to concede?  Is there anything wrong with conceding to reason, to better alternatives and to wiser counsel? More importantly, the apparent absence of goodwill on the part of the Minister to have this issue addressed within her Department is a serious comment on the competence of the then office holder.</P>
    <P>Indeed, one has to ask if the present Minister is terminating the teacher training at Carysfort for these very same reasons.  If he is, then he should spell it out.  What is he doing in relation to teacher training, as we know it, at Carysfort? I believe the view still prevails that the issue or question of diversification, and as to whether it should refer to Carysfort, can be addressed only in the context of the closure of teacher training.  In other words, nothing can happen until the teacher training is scrapped &mdash; gone.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that the time is now appropriate for the concentration of minds within his Department to enable the administrative <Col N="1120" /> problems or structures which are inhibiting progress for an all round forum to be pushed aside.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, and myself, and I am sure everybody on this side of the House, are very happy to observe that that very august body of people, those very dedicated and loyal civil servants, have recently resumed their rightful place in the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>There are a number of very important issues in relation to Carysfort, and whether the college should close.  The education and the economic arguments are the two main arguments advanced.  I believe the decision itself is neither economically sound not educationally valid. The Government put forward one main justification for their decision &mdash;&ldquo;To contain public expenditure and to achieve a better reallocation of resources&rdquo;.  This justification does not stand up to scrutiny and neither does the justification that the resources available to the college, so impressive, so caringly built up over the years by the Sisters, cannot be married into innovations which the Sisters are so anxious and so willing to bring about at Carysfort.  If the decision, as it has been understood to be, to close down teacher training at Carysfort is persisted in, then this Minister and his Government can legitimately be accused of the national sabotage of a fine and proud institution.</P>

      <P>It seems to have been the practice during this debate last evening and again this evening for people to specify their pedigree.  Let me go one further than my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, or the Minister, in saying that not alone was I educated at primary school by the Sisters of Mercy but also in secondary school.  Indeed I have the great privilege of being the only Member of either House of the Oireachtas to be a former student of Carysfort college.  I express our sincere debt of gratitude to the college, staff, the students and most particularly to the person who has handled all of the controversy, all of the emotional issues that <Col N="1121" /> have been raised over the past month, Sister Regina Durkan.  She was my lecturer in English &mdash; I do not think she made such a bad job of it.  She has dealt with this matter in a cool, calm, unemotional way ever since the news broke four weeks ago.  The attitude adopted by the Minister this evening, and the Minister of State last evening, is not at all the type of attitude that should be adopted in relation to the college, and in particular, Sister Regina.</P>
      <P>The type of courtesy Carysfort warrants at present is that of open and constructive consultation about its future in respect of the central purpose for which the college was founded, that is teacher training.  I do not think the Minister, the Minister of State or departmental officials can seriously ask the college authorities now to enter into negotiations or consultations about future types of higher education in the college.  The creation of any kind of a positive future for the college is dependent on the restoration of the trust between the college authorities and the Department which has been destroyed over the past four weeks.  If the college authorities were to enter into consultations with the Minister or his Department in relation to any future educational facility in the college, one must ask are they to be told in another 100 years, another 20 years or maybe less, &ldquo;Sorry, we do not need your institution any longer&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Níl paróiste sa tír, faoin dtuath nó in aon chathair, nach bhfuil rian Charysfort fágtha air: is iad iar-scoláirí an choláiste na ceannairí ina gceantair féin, ó thaobh an oideachais, an chultúir, an teanga agus an saol sóisialta go minic.</P>

Le go mbeadh seirbhís den tsórt sin sásúil ar fáil sa tír ní mór dó a bheith ar dtús lárnach agus é a bheith eagraithe mar ba chóir agus creidim nach bhfuil aon institiúid nó aon ionad oideachais sa tír go bhféadfaí é sin a dhéanamh ná i nDún Chéire.</P>
    <P>Tá coláiste uainn freisin a choinneos beo, bríomhar an tradisiún cultúrtha, ceoil, spórt agus teanga náisiúnta len é sin a fhuineadh agus a fháisceadh sna glúnta de dhaoine óga atá le teacht sa gcaoi chéanna go bhfuil sé sin déanta ag údaráis an choláiste le blianta 'sna glúnta de mhúinteoirí na tíre atá imithe.</P>
    <P>Tá coláiste riachtanach freisin a dhéanfadh forbairt ar chúrsaí nua oideachais: cúrsaí cumarsáide, seirbhísí gnó, seirbhísí eolais, staidéir ghinearálta agus rudaí nach iad sa gcaoi go dtabharfaí deis do na micléinn atá anois sa dara leibhéal agus a mbeidh áiteacha tríú leibhéal riachtanach dóibh amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Tá coláiste ag teastáil freisin a ofráileann taithí beo oideachasúil i ndrámaíocht, i gceol, i bprós atá agus a bhí ar fáil ag micléinn an choláiste agus gur féidir iad sin a leathnú agus a fhorbairt mar chúrsaí nua de éagsúlacht mhicléinn sa gcoláiste amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Tá coláiste ag teastáil go géar a thabharfadh chun cinn an chuid is fearr de thradisiúin oideachasúla an ama atá caite agus na tradisiúin sin a shnaidhmiú i gcúrsa oiliúna leathnaithe mar chuid de chóras oideachais na tíre.</P>

      <P>Ní thoghfaidh mé an oiread sin ama.  Tá coláiste ag teastáil a thaispeánfas na láidreachtaí praiticiúla agus na h-idéalacha a thuill clíú agus cáil i bhfad is i ngearr, i gcomhngar agus i gcéin mar ionad léinn a thuill Carysfort agus iad ag plé le hoiliúint múinteoirí 'sna blianta a chuaigh thart agus a bheadh anois ar fáil mar ionad léinn níos leithne sa todhchaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>D'éist mise go géar aréir leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Kenny.  Agus mé ag caint air ba mhaith liom treaslú leis as ucht a cheapacháin mar Aire Stáit.  Chreid <Col N="1123" /> mise i gcónaí gur cheart go mbeadh an Roinn Oideachais agus oifigigh na Roinne sin ag breathnú rompu an t-am ar fad, go mbeidís i bhfad chun cinn ar aon Aire nó ar aon Rialtas, nach mbeidís ag brath ar aon Rialtas le polasaithe áirithe a chur ar aghaidh sa Roinn, go bhféadfaidís féin a bheith i bhfad chun cinn ar rudaí den tsórt sin, San am ghearr a chaith mé féin sa Roinn ní chreidim go daingean gur mar sin atá.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil a locht ar pholaiteoirí nach dtugann cead a gcinn do na oifigigh breátha sin, a luaigh an Teachta Fitzgerald, atá ag obair sa Roinn agus dá dtabharfaí cead a gcinn dóibh go mbeidís in ann teacht anios leis na cineálacha polasaithe sin.</P>
    <P>Agus mé ag éisteacht le óráid an Aire chonaic mé arís agus arís eile ag teacht tríd an óráid sin nach bhfuil aon tslánú in ann do Carysfort agus é a bheith coinnithe mar ionad d'oiliúint bun-mhúinteoirí.</P>
    <P>Ní comhlacht gnó é Carysfort.  Ní comhlacht gnó a bhí ann cheana, a bhí nó atá ag cailliúint airgid don Stát.  Is ionad oideachais é an coláiste de ard chaighdeán nach bhfuil á húsáid in iomlán ag an Roinn ná ag an Rialtas ná ag an Stát.  Tá sé mar dhualgas ar an Rialtas insint don phobal na fáthanna nach bhfuil úsáid iomlán á déanamh den choláiste.</P>
    <P>Tá sé feicthe againne ar an taobh seo den Teach le trí bliana go leith anuas anois ó thús ré an Rialtais seo nuair atá futhu comhlachtaí Stáit a dhúnadh go ritear síos iad ar dtús sa gcaoi go mbeidh an Rialtas nó an tAire atá ciontach in ann a rá gur gá stop a chur le dul chun cinn an chomhlachta mar go bhfuil an comhlacht ag cailliúint airgid.  Meas tú, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, gurb é sin an cleas atá ar bun ag an Rialtas, ag an Roinn nó b'fhéidir acu beirt i leith an choláiste seo.</P>
    <P>Creidimse go bhfuil freagra iomlán tuillte ag údarás an choláiste agus ag an bpobal.  Níor thug an tAire é anseo anocht.  Níor thug an tAire Stáit é aréir. Seachas rud ar bith eile, is cinneadh polaitiúil é an cinneadh seo.  Ní cinneadh é ar chuir oifigigh na Roinne os comhair an Rialtais.  Ní cinneadh é a bhí ag teastáil <Col N="1124" /> nó riachtanach ó oifigigh na Roinne.  Is cinneadh polaitiúil agus tógfaidh sé cinneadh polaitiúil deireadh a chur leis an gcinneadh atá déanta.  Creidim gur féidir leis an Aire an cinneadh sin a dhéanamh agus iarraim air é a dhéanamh chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>

      <P>Ordinarily one would view six to seven minutes as being much too short a time in which to contribute to such a debate, bearing in mind the breadth of education, not merely as it obtains at present but &mdash; as this debate has shown &mdash; its future and the enormous changes that have taken place.  The contributions of the Minister, the Minister of State and others represent the beginning of what I hope will be one of the most exciting debates in the history of education here.  The manner of the announcement in regard to Carysfort was traumatic but let us hope that the focus now will be on the change in structures that are needed.  As Deputy Liam Fitzgerald said, the debate on all sides should concentrate on the potential of Carysfort and what the college has to offer.  It must also concentrate on the structures in the Department.  The openness of the debate and consultations between the staff and the Sisters of Mercy fill me with hope for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an opportunity to explore all avenues.  The Minister, in the course of his amendment, focused on the structures and traditions of Carysfort, the expertise of its staff and the developmental requirements of education generally.  We should operate in the broad boundaries of that amendment with goodwill on all sides.  If that happens we will achieve a result that all of us will be proud of.  I hope we will even strengthen the tradition and competence of Carysfort college.  The debate has helped to remind us of the past when much less was offered to people in regard to education.  Education was the foundation stone and great liberator for <Col N="1125" /> all of us.  We should all acknowledge that we owe a debt in this regard.</P>
    <P>I must stress that there is a sense of urgency about the setting up of the structures mentioned by the Minister.  At a time when dialogue is taking place there is a certain amount of insecurity and of not knowing what the future holds.  For the staff that amounts to a tremendous amount of pressure.  The sooner this issue is resolved to the satisfaction of everybody the better.  We must always remember the human element when we are considering changes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is open to considering all types of new concepts.  Deputy O'Rourke spoke with great feeling last night about the enormous changes that need to be brought about in education.  I hope that with others I will be able to contribute in a constructive way to the debate that is about to take place.  I recognise what Carysfort has done in the past and I hope it will continue its good work for another 100 years.  A submission I should like to make is that the resources should be used as a women's studies unit.  I recognise that for a long time this was a women's college, one of the liberating forces for women in Ireland, and the tradition of that should not be lost.  I shall continue that dialogue in private with the Minister.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa cuidiú leis an fogra tairisceana i leith Fianna Fáil agus cuidiú leis an moladh comhgháir dais don Aire Stáit nua atá ceapaithe as mo Dháil-Cheantar féin agus an tAire, é féin a ainmníodh mar Aire Oideachais. Is ábhar buartha dúinn uilig agus cúis imní agus díomá an tairiscint tubaisteach, maslach don oideachas a bhí i gcinneadh an Rialtais i leith choláiste Carysfort.  Tá an cinneadh sin le cáineadh.  Athnaíonn chuile dhuine a bhfuil suim acu i gcúrsaí teangan a dhílse is a bhí coláiste Carysfort don Ghaeilge agus an sár-obair atá déanta ag Roinn na Gaeltachta sa choláiste sin.  Tá coláiste Carysfort ar cheann de na fíor-bheagán coláistí tríú léibhéil <Col N="1126" /> a bhfuil iarracht fónta déanta acu chun freastal ar pholasaí an Stáit i leith na Gaeilge.  Cuid lárnach bhunúsach de réimse oibre choláiste Carysfort is ea an Ghaeilge.  B'fhíor sin na blianta fada ó shin agus is fíor fós.  Dá thoradh sin tá sé le maíomh ag an coláiste go bhfuil freastal ar leith á dhéanamh acu ar pholasaí an Stáit i leith na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Oibríonn an coláiste ar son na Gaeilge ar bhealaí éagsúla: I dtosach báire, soláthraíonn Roinn na Gaeilge sa choláiste cúrsaí léinn, atá aitheanta ag Ollscoil na hÉireann, a chuireann ar chumas na mac léinn céim ollscoile sa Ghaeilge a bhaint amach.</P>
      <P>I dteannta na hoibre a dhéanann roinn na Gaeilge sa choláiste luíonn dualgas ar Roinn an Oideachais mic léinn a ullmhú i scileanna mhúineadh na Gaeilge.  Tá obair den scoth déanta ag an rannóg sin le blianta fada agus ní bréag a rá go mbíonn comhoibriú an-bhreá idir léachtóirí agus mic léinn chun múinteoirí inniúla Gaeilge a chur ar fáil don chóras oideachais.</P>
      <P>Tá ceangal nach beag idir coláiste Carysfort agus an Ghaeltacht.  Tá sé ina chuid riachtanach dá gcúrsa léinn go bhfreastalódh gach mac léinn céad bhliana ar chúrsa Gaeltachta, mí iomlán sa Ghaeltacht ag deireadh na bliana sin. Toisc an spéis a bhíonn ag na mic léinn féin sa Ghaeilge, bíonn siad ag lorg deiseanna le filleadh ar an nGaeltacht i gcaith eamh a gcúrsa trí bliana i gCarysfort. Is léir go músclaítear spéis sa Ghaeltacht in aigne an ábhair oide agus í ar a cúrsa oiliúna i gCarysfort.</P>
      <P>Ach tá ceangal tábhachtach eile ag coláiste Carysfort leis an nGaeltacht. Coinnítear 10 faoin gcéad áiteanna do mhic léinn Ghaeltachta sna coláistí oideachais agus le tamall de bhlianta anuas tá an cuóta sin á líonadh i gCarysfort.  Fiú nuair nach n-éireodh le coláistí eile an cuóta a líonadh d'eireodh le Carysfort &mdash; rud a léiríonn an tuiscint do thraidisiúin na Gaeilge a bhraithfeadh mic léinn Ghaeltachta a bheith i gCarysfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is léir go bhfuil cúinsí fábhracha chun timpeallacht Ghaelach a choinneáil beo i gcoláiste Carysfort.  Cruthúnas ar bheogacht <Col N="1127" /> na timpeallachta sin is ea a líonmhaire atá cumainn agus eagrais Ghaeilge sa choláiste.  Tá Coiste na Gaeilge ann a bunaíodh chun polasaithe i leith na Gaeilge a cheapadh agus a chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá cumann Gaelach, a eagraíonn imeachtaí i nGaeilge do mhic léinn.  Tá cumann díospóireachta, cumann béaloidis, cumann drámaíochta, cumann iriseoireachta agus an cumann siamsaíochta, iad go léir ag obair ar son ár dteanga dhúchais agus ár n-oidhreacht.</P>
    <P>Cruthaíonn rannpháirtíocht na n-ábhar oidí agus na foirne sna cumainn sin uile timpeallacht Ghaelach ar leith sa choláiste. Dá gcuirfí deireadh le hoiliúint mhúinteoirí sa choláiste scríosfaí an traidisiún Gaeilge sin.  Dá gcoimeádfaí coláiste Carysfort ar oscailt chun múinteoirí a oiliúint agus chun cúrsaí tríú leibhéal eile a sholáthar d'fhéadfaí traidisiúin na timpeallachta sin a chaomhnú.</P>
    <P>We do not accept that there was no other way to deal with the numbers difficulty affecting Carysfort.  We see the decision to close that college as shortsighted and an error of judgment on the part of the Government.  The decision has generated a level of resentment and anti-Government feeling not often experienced in the country.  It is a blow to what is regarded as a fundamental bastion of Irish education, not just an institution for training of teachers but a place where our culture and language are nurtured, loved and passed on to successive generations of educators.  The Gaelic ethos is tied up with the training of teachers there and only an unconcerned and ill informed Government would be unaware of this.  To change Carysfort to an RTC or some other educational arrangement without an element of teacher training being present simply means that you cannot maintain the Irish ethos.  The value of that ethos is inestimable and to value it at £1 million per year is to treat our heritage as a worthless asset to be discarded at will. That evaluation is not acceptable to this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The staff in Carysfort always insisted on excellence of standards in Irish and in <Col N="1128" /> all things Irish.  The State has a policy on the Irish language.  The facility, staff and capacity exist for the protection of the Irish language and that policy in Carysfort, and not to use those assets would be an act of gross irresponsibility by the Coalition Government.  There is a proud record of proficiency in the Irish language, speaking and teaching, in Carysfort which, when it is destroyed by the Government, cannot be restored or easily replaced.  The closedown syndrome which permeates the mind of the Government is difficult to understand.  We have seen examples of it over the past few years in regard to Irish Shipping, the closing of hospitals, educational colleges and factories.  This beleagured Government are seeking to justify their failed fiscal policies by doing hard, brutal and insensitive things.  People do not want their educational system sacrificed for the sake of a temporary financial expedient.</P>
    <P>Recession is not the time to skimp on education and teacher training.  We should be building on our assets as an investment for the future and planning to improve our pupil-teacher ratio.  We should give lessons in hope, not despair, to our people.  When one considers that at Question Time today the Minister stated that it would take an extra 3,000 primary teachers to achieve the same pupil-teacher ratio which exists in the Six Counties, it is obvious that he has failed in his commitment to deliver on an improvement in the ratio.  By closing Carysfort, the Minister is ensuring that we will never again be able to improve on the ratio.</P>
    <P>There was no response in the Minister's contribution this evening and I took careful note of what he said which was that he could devise uses for Carysfort for the future which would give satisfaction to the professional staff there and benefits to our educational system.  The only satisfaction the staff of Carysfort want is an opportunity to continue to do what they know best, the training of teachers for our educational system.  The Minister asked for Fianna Fáil submissions as to how that could be achieved.  Two years ago the people in Carysfort gave the Minister a submission in that regard, but <Col N="1129" /> he did nothing about it.  His only response has been to say that it will not continue to serve the people as a teacher training college.  I took careful note at 7.30 p.m. of something the Minister said, that only two colleges of education would continue in this country.  He stated that some facets of Carysfort could continue.  What kind of commitment is that?  It was a sweetmouthed response which gave half promises to consider certain things but which gave no commitment to Carysfort.  The staff and students at Carysfort must have been further disappointed and distressed by the Minister's speech this evening.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he wanted a new and equally important role for that great institution, but the only role which will satisfy us and benefit the people is a reversal of the Government decision to close it.  That is what we expected to hear this evening, but the Minister has failed in his commitment to the people in that regard and he has not given any hope that there will be any change in the original decision which the Government took.</P>
    <P>There is a Fianna Fáil alternative which has been spelt out in clear, unambiguous terms.  We want Carysfort to continue, as our motion says, as a teacher training centre with other items added such as inservice teacher training courses, new curriculum development courses, third level education courses in the humanities, education in psychological training for teachers, computer training and a whole host of other things which we have submitted. Do not look for submissions from us in this regard; we gave them yesterday evening through our spokesperson.  The Coalition philosophy seems to be, in this as in so many other things, that our history, traditions and our noidhreacht mean nothing and must be kept in the background.  Many people put great store on the ideals and traditions of the past and the Minister, by his decision, is trying to dismantle one of those great traditions.</P>
    <P>Our motion sets out our aims clearly and concisely.  We want Carysfort to be <Col N="1130" /> an integral part of our higher education system with a specific role in teacher training.  The Minister's decision was arbitrary and precipitate because he confirmed this evening that there will not be a change of heart.  The Minister has tampered with the sensitivities of the living generations of graduates of Carysfort who value the memory of their <i>Alma Mater</i>.  He is trampling on the graves of ten generations of former students and teachers of this highly respected college of education.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response this evening does not go any way towards satisfying the needs of Carysfort college.  There is no point in being mealy-mouthed about what might happen over the next few months.  A clear decision has been taken by the Government, and it was reaffirmed by the Minister during the week, that Carysfort would close and could no longer fulfil its role in our educational system as a teacher training college. We reject that out of hand. Carysfort means something special to this side of the House.  It stands for something in Fianna Fáil thinking and in the minds of the people.  The Minister brings shame on the magnificent and mighty traditions of Carysfort.</P>
    <P>We are bringing to the Minister's notice what is being said outside the House, that Carysfort should be allowed to continue as a teacher training centre. We do that in the hope that, even at this late stage, the Minister will recognise the folly of turning his back on a revered tradition in our educational system.  We ask him to take note of the generally accepted point of view in regard to Carysfort. Over the past three years no single decision has generated so much heat and resentment from the people.  The Minister should reverse the decision and he will have our support in bringing about a reasoned and considered situation whereby Carysfort can fulfil its tradition and continue to serve the people as one of the leading colleges of education.</P>

      <P>In my contribution on the last day I stated that any Government would find themselves in a vicious circle with the demands to reduce the high levels of taxation and to maintain services. I said that there were a number of ways in which we could break out of this vicious circle.  I outlined the ways in the time I had and said that what was required was more efficiency in public spending.  I said that a greater emphasis was needed on wealth creation and I broke that suggestion down into the need for a review of our energy policy and the need for the development of indigenous industry.</P>
      <P>Since I spoke, I note that the Opposition party have brought forward a policy on food.  There is much merit in the proposals put forward but I do not agree with the idea of setting up another board. This is the third or fourth new board which Fianna Fáil have proposed to set up.  The setting up of new boards means further public spending, further layers of bureaucracy and more tax.  The appointment of a Minister to deal specifically with food and its development into processed and added value foods for the European market is the way to do it.  To set up a new board is not practicable.</P>
      <P>In relation to efficiency in public spending I will deal with an area where further spending could be avoided before firm decisions are made.  This relates to the announcement by the former Minister for Education to build a new dental school in Dublin.  That affects our budgetary policy.  The plans as set out by the Minister include facilities for training 50 dentists</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> in Dublin and facilities for continuing educational post-graduate training of dentists.  The most recent surveys carried out show that we need 50 or 60 dentists per year.  The Minister's proposal to spend £17 million contrasts starkly with the setting up of a new dental school in Cork some years ago at a cost of £2.9 million.  These figures are at present day prices.</P>
    <P>The decision to allocate an extraordinary level of expenditure on dental teaching should be reconsidered for a number of reasons.  In the past 20 years in common with other developed countries there has been a vast improvement in dental health here.  Recent surveys funded by the Department of Health show that there has been a dramatic decline in the level of dental decay and that 50 per cent of five year old children in the EHB area are now free of dental decay.  European figures show that the need for dental care is reducing.  Dental education is under-financed here at present and, looking at the current annual running costs of the two dental schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £17 million spent on a major undertaking in Dublin which would cater for 50 dentists per year, almost the total needs of this country, is a serious case of needless spending. It is a waste of resources and it puts the future of the dental school in Cork under serious threat.  The day will come when we will decide to limit output from the dental schools to the required number of dentists and that raises questions of rationalisation.  Decisions should be <Col N="1138" /> made now to cater for the foreseen needs. Decisions should be made taking into the account the output from Cork, Dublin and Belfast.  We should re-examine this proposal before we spend this money.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increases in personal allowances, the reduction in the top rate of tax band and the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy.  This should provide a reduction in direct taxation.  I welcome the Minister's confirmation of the commitment in the national plan to ensure that tax bands and allowances are adjusted so that the overall income tax burden will not be increased.  As a matter of future policy, will the Minister provide for automatic indexing of the bands and allowances by reference to the consumer price index from year to year in order to provide a statutory protection for the taxpayer?</P>
      <P>I had hoped that this year the Minister would have come out in favour of introducing a current year basis of assessment for the self-employed.  I am sorry he was unable to do so for administrative reasons.  I ask the new Minister to look at this again and speak to his officials as there seems to be a blockage in relation to introducing a current year basis of assessment for the self-employed.  The changeover from a preceding year basis of assessment to an actual year basis of assessment was achieved for corporation tax purposes in 1975.  My experience is that the preceding year basis of assessment is a major irritant for the small and not so small businessmen who cannot understand the situation whereby they are required to pay tax, say, in OctoberNovember 1985 in respect of the accounting period which may go back as far as May 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to introduce relief in areas of research and new product development.  Research and new product development in this country are receiving one of the lowest financial supports of developing countries.  I hope the Minister will not allow the legislation branch of the Revenue Commissioners to surround this relief with broad ranging anti-avoidance measures which may lead to this scheme becoming unworkable and <Col N="1139" /> unattractive as so many schemes have become in the past.  Regarding the retention tax on deposit accounts, with many of my colleagues I am disturbed about the effect this will have on small deposits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will give the Deputy a chance to vote against it on the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to put forward a few views here without interruption.  The Deputy did not put too many views forward in his speech after the budget.  It has been suggested that to allow for any exemption in the deposit retention tax proposals would be too administratively difficult.  I believe that that is not the case.  All it would require is some positive thinking on the part of legislators and the financial institutions.  How could it be done?  There are probably quite a number of ways in which those exempt from this tax could be facilitated.  One would be a tax free limit.  It would be possible to exempt from tax a certain amount of interest in all deposit accounts.  If the first, say, £100 interest was exempt from tax it would eliminate all deposit accounts up to almost £2,000 depending on interest rates.  The drawback to this would be that big depositors would split their accounts in several ways to qualify for this relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would also be possible to set up a system to allow those depositors who have been taxed but who have no tax liability to reclaim the tax.  Investors who receive tax dividends could receive dividend counterfoils enabling those eligible to reclaim the tax deducted at source. The financial institutions already issue certificates in respect of loan interest so that the appropriate tax allowances can be applied where eligible.  Similarly, these institutions could issue certificates either for the deposit retention tax itself or the net deposit interest paid.  Eligible depositors could then claim a refund of tax from the Revenue Commissioners. This solution, while quite possible, might be administratively very costly in terms of both people and time for the Revenue <Col N="1140" /> Commissioners and for the deposit institutions.</P>
    <P>The banks and other financial institutions have a facility through their computer systems both to charge and to pay at different rates.  For example, in the Associated Banks at present over a dozen different interest rates are being charged and about half a dozen rates are used for paying deposit interest.  The exclusion of the accounts of genuine non-residents from the deposit retention tax proposals seems to mean that all deposit takers will have to operate separate rates of deposit interest for residents and non-residents. It would be administratively as easy for the Minister to exempt other categories as to exempt non-residents.  The financial institutions must make special arrangements to cater for non-residents.  Therefore, it would not create undue problems for them to include other categories such as long term social welfare recipients. In those cases I believe that exemption certificates valid for 12 months could be issued by the Department of Social Welfare. In the case of charities, exemption certificates could be issued by local tax offices, and arrangements could be made also in the case of children's deposits, although there would be special difficulties there.</P>
    <P>All the financial institutions have an important role to play in the growth of the economy despite their different roles, and the new proposals on deposit retention tax remove one of the anomalies which existed in the past between the different categories.  I hope that any further proposals now being made will apply equally to all institutions and will avoid the favouring of one over another, thereby creating further anomalies.</P>
    <P>A major problem at present in relation to job creation is the non-availability of insurance such as employer liability and public liability insurance.  At present we are investing large amounts of money in public service projects, but there is a huge reservoir of jobs to be created in the private sector if a number of major barriers can be eliminated in job creation in that area, and one of the most serious <Col N="1141" /> barriers is the non-availability of insurance. Any attempt to create jobs at present cannot ignore that major problem, and I am glad to see that the Minister responsible for that area is here tonight.  We need to look at that problem urgently and to address ourselves to the root causes of the non-availability of insurance for employers at present.  I am aware of at least four individuals in my constituency who have good business ideas with an employment potential of 200 to 300 people, and these individuals are prevented from setting up business because of the problems they have with insurance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is very familiar with one project with a potential of 15 jobs which is now killed because of non-availability of insurance.  We must address ourselves to this issue and to the root cause of it which is the high rate of claims and the high cost of litigation because of the inefficiency of our court system.  Over-representation in the courts is a subject that I have spoken about previously and I will not bore the Chair tonight by going over it in detail again.  However, we must address ourselves to major reform in this area of litigation. It is costing insurance companies enormous amounts.  It is so serious at present that I would like to read for the House a circular that has issued to a number of employees in a firm in Cork. I shall read it out to show the extent of the problem.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling.  The point I am making is that we can invest large amounts of money in projects and temporary jobs but there is a vast reservoir of jobs to be created if we tackle the root causes and we are not doing so because we are afraid to in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with the question of investment in our roads infrastructure. Several EC studies in recent times have highlighted the fact that an adequate road network is an essential prequisite to economic and social development.  The legacy of underinvestment in the major roads in the sixties and seventies has left us at a great disadvantage with respect to our European trading partners, notably Northern Ireland.  It is interesting to note that the hourly transport costs in Ireland are about 25 per cent higher than the EC average in circumstances where road <Col N="1143" /> conditions enable road transport operators to achieve significantly higher mileage within the limits of the eight hour driving day.  It is obvious that investment in major road improvements can be justified on economic grounds.  In that area I am pleased to see the allocations for the coming year continuing with the investment of previous years.  I should like a greater emphasis on efficiency in public expenditure in this area.  Too often in the past we have seen too many examples of inefficiency in road construction.</P>
    <P>I conclude by welcoming the main thrust of the budget to create greater employment and reduce tax levels.  I hope that the trend in the reduction of tax levels will continue in future years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget of 1986 is a very serious attack on investment and I propose to give some precise examples in the first instance of how it has undermined what is already a very weak investment climate.  Then I shall deal in more general terms with its lack of direction.</P>
      <P>The budget in a mistaken, naive, and ideological attack on financial institutions has succeeded instead in seriously damaging the flow of investment for productive purposes.  The most major problem which Ireland faces today is that of mounting unemployment on which we are all agreed, and the ESRI tell us in a recent study that the figure will reach 250,000 by the end of the decade if we continue on our present course.  Viable long term jobs can be earned only through the production of goods and the performance of traded services.  This means that viable long term jobs can be earned only by enterprises in the private and public sectors. An enterprise cannot even come into being unless there is investment.  The budget in attacking the flow of investment to productive enterprises has made a direct attack on jobs and on living standards. There are at least six specific ways in which this attack has been made, although it is undoubtedly possible to find very many more negative points in the budget that I shall deal with later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to section 84 the stamp duty <Col N="1144" /> of 12 per cent on interest paid in respect of section 84 loans must be borne by the industrial and commercial borrower.  The conditions under which most of these loans have been negotiated clearly state that any tax, duty, or charge will be met by the borrower.  The additional imposition will, therefore, add directly to industrial costs at a time when the competitiveness of Irish industry is being seriously eroded on international markets. The erosion has been intensified in recent weeks because of the strengthening of the Irish pound against sterling which has made the price of our exports to the UK far less competitive than heretofore.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second point, capital allowances, it may seem on the face of it that to calculate capital allowances for taxation purposes in business and industry on a basis net of grants is just and equitable.  The change does, however, add to industrial costs.  What is far more serious is that the change increases significantly the cost of leasing.  Many industrialists are forced to acquire plant and equipment through leasing because they do not have adequate capital to purchase the equipment.  Financial institutions have been able to give competitive quotations for leased equipment because the institutions were able to obtain the benefit of full capital allowances.  In extreme cases, the cost of leasing for industry will now increase by up to 54 per cent.  This takes money directly out of industry which could otherwise be used to maintain or expand output and employment, and in other cases it will place the cost of leasing beyond the financial capacity of the enterprise and will thus mean that the project does not proceed.</P>
    <P>The third element of disincentive against investment can be seen in the insurance levy.  It is a direct attack on policy holders because the vast majority of life assurance companies operating in Ireland are mutualised.  This means that the profit, or a substantial portion of it, goes to the with profits policy holders. From the point of view of business and <Col N="1145" /> industry, there is another serious detrimental effect.  The life assurance companies are significant investors in productive enterprises and in property. Any attack on the funds of the life assurance companies will inevitably lead to a diminution in the funds available for investment.  It must be emphasised once again that a diminution in the funds available for investment is a direct attack on jobs and living standards, which is the central theme to which I am addressing myself now &mdash; this is an attack on investment, jobs and living standards at a time when this is the fundamental national priority.  A fourth element arises in relation to the advance corporation tax.  The budget in this instance is silent and this means that unless there is an appropriate transitional provision in the Finance Bill, full advance corporation tax will now be payable.  There are a number of serious points which I would like to illustrate in this regard.</P>
    <P>First, there is no transitional arrangement for indigenous Irish companies which have invested heavily in the past and which now have a significant volume of unexpired capital allowances.  This means that there is no net liability to corporation tax, and such a liability will not arise until all of the unexpired capital allowances have been used.  Notwithstanding this, such a company which now pay a dividend will be required to make a payment under advance corporation tax which cannot be offset against a liability to corporation tax until such a liability actually arises.  This eventuality could never have been foreseen when the original investment was made, so that the entire viability of the investment is now altered, and the cash flow situation is significantly damaged.  Remember that I am talking about indigenous Irish companies which have invested heavily in the past.  These are the companies which we are now penalising.  The payment of advance corporation tax for a 50 per cent corporation tax company will be 54 per cent of the amount of the dividend, that is, 35-65 tax credit and it will be about 5.56 per cent, that is 1-18 tax credit for a <Col N="1146" /> 10 per cent corporation tax company.</P>
    <P>There is also the serious anomaly that a company which sutters a current loss and which pays dividends out of accumulated reserves in order to maintain its position on the investment market will have to pay advance corporation tax although it has no profit, and the advance corporation tax cannot be recouped until there is a profit in a future year.</P>
    <P>There is a serious anomaly in respect of companies entitled to export profits sales relief.  A company in this category which earns a profit will have a zero tax credit, and no advance corporation tax will, therefore, be payable.  A company in this category which does not have a profit will not be able to obtain export profits sales relief and will, therefore, become a 50 per cent corporation tax company.  Such a company if it pays a dividend will be required to pay full advance corporation tax at 54 per cent. It is obviously the height of nonsense to penalise further a company which is already incurring a loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of paying a dividend out of losses.  If a company has accrued profits it can be liable for tax on losses in the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to turn now to the retention tax of 35 per cent in so far as it affects investment, and I will deal with it later in so far as it affects other things in terms <Col N="1147" /> of equity.  Quite a lot could be said about the detrimental impact of the retention tax of 35 per cent on deposit interest. What has not been emphasised to date, however, is the detrimental effect which this can have on some investment funds. It is important to realise that pension funds will not be able to recoup the retention tax and any deposit interest earned by pension funds will be diminished by the amount of this tax.  This will tend to cause a switch in deposits made by pension funds to securities which will not attract the retention tax.</P>
    <P>It must be noted that the Minister for Finance very deliberately excluded Government gilts from the impact of the retention tax, thereby further distorting what is already an unduly heavily balanced market in favour of gilts. This will tend to cause a switch in deposits made by pension funds to securities which will not attract retention tax. Deposits made in banks and certain other financial institutions covered by the retention tax form the basis on which loans are made to business and industry for productive purposes.  This is what we should be encouraging at this time.  This Government keep soaking more available funds thereby distorting the market and putting pressure on interest rate to ensure that our interest rates are way out line with those obtaining elsewhere.  I pointed this out many times to the former Minister for Finance but unfortunately he did not listen and the consequence is that the current climate for industry and business here is further penalised by unnecessarily high interest rates.  We now have the situation where these types of deposits will be diverted to Government funds rather than be retained in a system which will pass them on as loans to the productive sector.</P>
    <P>I want to make a brief reference to the bank levy which is my final example of the disincentive in this budget against investment.  The bank levy is being continued at IR£25 million despite the fact that the levy has been judged to be unnecessary and inequitable by the Central Bank.  The impact of the levy is not <Col N="1148" /> on some remote financial institution; it impacts directly on depositors and borrowers. The levy reduces the capacity of the banking system to lend, and it directly reduces the ability of the banking system to support investment in the productive sectors.  I give those specific examples to illustrate that what we need is to encourage investment in the private sector.  This budget does the opposite.  In line with anything else the Government have done in terms of economic policy particularly, this shows the Government have no sense of direction or purpose.</P>
    <P>This House has been treated with contempt by both the Taoiseach and the Government.  Five weeks after the presentation of the budget by the former Minister for Finance, the Government have refused to give details of the £55 million additional budget reductions on the amendments published in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The procedures of this House require that the allocations of public expenditure should be published in advance of the budget to enable Deputies and the public at large to consider the budget proposals in their proper context.  The major unspecified reductions announced in the budget this year make a nonsense of Government accounting practices.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Finance in his widely proclaimed &ldquo;A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances&rdquo; in 1981 announced his firm intention to ensure that the Estimates would be published in October each year to enable full and detailed examination by the Dáil well in advance of the budget debate.  The same Minister now resolutely refuses to make the full Estimates available five weeks after the budget when the debate in the Dáil has all but concluded.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in particular has deliberately refused to account to Dáil Éireann for his Government's budget. Despite the fact that on Wednesday, 5 February, he sought and got agreement from the Dáil to extend the time for his budget contribution to one and a half hours, he has failed to make any statement <Col N="1149" /> to Dáil Éireann on the budget proposals. Having witnessed the outraged reaction of the public to the budget, the Taoiseach sacrificed the former Minister for Finance in the famous Cabinet reshuffle in an effort to shield himself and his Government from public attack.  He is the first Taoiseach in recent years who has not come into this House in the days immediately following the budget to make a statement as Head of Government in support of the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government.  He has allowed the former Minister to take the opprobrium of public attack and, in a cowardly fashion, having sacrificed and relegated that Minister, will not come in here to make the statement which each of his predecessors has made for as long as I can remember.</P>
    <P>The budget is a collective decision of the Government and as head of Government the Taoiseach must take full responsibility for its obvious inadequacies at this critical time in our economic experience.  It may be that as a consequence of this he may be shamed in the last week of the debate, and before the Finance Bill is introduced, to make a rushed, hasty statement.  He is not short of words on many occasions and this is one occasion when he should have come into this House to justify his position and that of his Government.</P>

      <P>The record is there and the Minister of State knows it.  The budget aggravates the problems which have been all too obvious in the country for some time.  Its provisions increased total taxation, already the highest in the whole OECD area, by £536 million to <Col N="1151" /> £6,117 million.  Within that the hard pressed income tax payer has been burdened with an extra £217 million this year, bringing the total figure, including levies, to £2,477 million.  This imposition of record and penal tax levels by this Government has brought the economy to its knees and has killed incentive and enterprise in every sphere of activity.</P>
      <P>Unemployment and emigration have drained the morale and energy of the nation, particularly of our young people. This Government treat our young people as a major problem when the reality is that they are the richest resource we have and the key not only to our survival but to our growth and prosperity.</P>
      <P>In this area of technology it is essential to invest in knowledge and expertise, thereby generating added value and employment in this country, and not elsewhere as is happening under this Government with the drain by way of emigration of our skilled young people.  The Government's cutbacks in education at every level are in direct contrast to the huge increase in expenditure for short term schemes and agencies which now total almost £200 million.  I can assure the House that Fianna Fáil will pursue a better, more enlightened policy by switching our resources &mdash; I want to place this on the record &mdash; from training for short term schemes to education for permanent employment.</P>

They can see for themselves their effect on our young people, that of demoralisation.

      <P>I will listen to the flow of the Minister's eloquence any time, but will he allow me to continue my speech?</P>
      <P>The dramatic fall in oil prices has already had a major effect on every other developed economy in the world.  Growth projections in the EC this year are the highest for 15 years.  For example, the Federal Republic of Germany is projecting a growth rate of 4½ per cent which will give a major boost to all European economies.  The international economy is expanding at an unprecedented rate as of now.  One country alone is going backwards, as it did in the fifties &mdash; this open economy of ours &mdash; because of a lack of direction or purpose on the part of our Government.  Instead of increasing the opportunities for exploiting that growth to our advantage the Government persist in negative measures which stifle our growth and reduce out capacity to expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's attitude to agriculture and the agri-food industry is but a <Col N="1153" /> dramatic example of their failure in this instance.  The added value in processing, packaging and distribution in this vital sector of our economy is less than one quarter of the average added value in the member states of the EC and they are not agricultural economies.  That figure is based on the published figures of the Community itself.  Our food industry is in crisis at a time when it should be expanding at an unprecedented rate. Government cutbacks in investment in agriculture and in all the related research and marketing programmes are indefensible at a time when this great natural resource has such huge development potential.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister of State who knows something about sporting commitment and achievement has come into the House, might I use the analogy that it is high time in this nation we played to our strength and launched an all-out attack in expanding world markets instead of retreating into a defensive formation which can only guarantee that we continue to fall back even further?  For instance, the Government have propagated the nonsense that any development in our economy is dependent on increased public expenditure and taxation, whereas the opposite is the case. Many economies as disparate as India, Spain and Japan in recent years have proved that selective reductions in tax levels actually generate more tax revenue for the State.  Reputable journals, such as the <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> and professors of economics have shown that this is demonstrably the case.  But our Government persist in adopting the opposite approach.</P>
    <P>Here I should mention that my scripted text is slightly inaccurate.  The cumulative shortfall in tax revenue of £545 million in the last three to four years, almost £200 million in 1985 alone is a direct and inevitable consequence of the penal tax levels introduced by this Government.  I want to put on record that in the last 12 months, as Opposition spokesman for Finance, I have had numerous inquiries from potential investors around the globe, investors who recognise the huge <Col N="1154" /> potential in our economy, whether they be from Hong Kong, the United States, Britain or elsewhere, and all of those regions have been represented.  They were all agreed on the investment opportunities that should exist here.  Unfortunately, they were all equally agreed on the fact that current policies actively discouraged such investment.  We must no longer tolerate the attitude of this Government which ignores the great potential in our land, forestry, fisheries, tourism and indigenous sources of energy.  The Government have turned their back on our resources, concentrating instead on discouraging any productive investment in the private sector.</P>
    <P>For instance, tourism has been a major growth area internationlly in recent years, even during the international recession.  Yet this Government persist in erecting official barriers against tourists by the high level of indirect taxation and protective air transport restrictions. It is high time we participated, like every other country in Europe &mdash; and this does not cost one penny of taxpayers' money &mdash; in common fares from long distance locations like Japan, Australia and New Zealand which would give a major boost to our tourism industry and the employment and revenue that would follow directly therefrom.  It is bad enough that we discourage investment or spending from abroad, but it is beyond comprehension that we should encourage our people to place their funds elsewhere.  That is precisely what the Government seem hell bent on doing.</P>
    <P>The final example of the consistency of a Government who believe in discouraging investment coming in and encouraging investment going out is the inequitable and shorsighted retention tax about which our party made a statement. That tax which was announced in the budget is another example of a Government hell bent on gathering tax revenue from every available source, whatever the consequences.  While many successful economies, particularly Japan, give significant tax incentives to savings, not to borrowings, our Government blindly impose taxes on young people, <Col N="1155" /> old age pensioners and voluntary organisations who have no liability to tax.  They discourage prudence, independence and self-reliance.  The Government's motto seems to be: &ldquo;Save at your peril; we are determined to get you anyway&rdquo;.  It is time for the people at large to give a resounding reply to this hopeless, helpless Government: &ldquo;Stay at your peril; we are surely determined to get you.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Deputy O'Kennedy has left the Chamber because he never fails to amuse me.  The debate relates to a budget that was introduced almost six weeks ago but nonetheless I am glad of the opportunity to make a contribution on it.  In doing so I want to reflect on the achievements of the Government since they took office in 1982.  We are all aware that at that time we had a rampant upward spiral of inflation well in excess of 20 per cent.  In fact, in May 1982 it was between 23 per cent and 24 per cent and had been growing at an average rate of 5 per cent per annum. Unemployment was growing at a rate of 40,000 per annum.  We inherited a taxation system that was the most punitive in the European Community.  By far the greater share of that taxation was <Col N="1156" /> being borne by the PAYE sector, a group that was growing smaller annually.  The value-added tax system was acting as a disincentive to industrialists who were slow to explore markets.  The tax system was a disincentive to workers.  That may not have changed dramatically but there has been an improvement.</P>
      <P>The Government were faced with the daunting task of carrying out an onslaught on public expenditure which had reached the highest rate in the history of the State, reducing direct and indirect taxation and halting the upward spiral of unemployment.  That seemed almost beyond the ability of any Government to redress.  I should like to remind Deputy O'Kennedy, and his party, that we are still suffering gravely from the consequences of the extravagant borrowing policies pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government paricularly from 1977 to 1981.  I always try to be positive in my condemnation of the policies of any Government and, if I felt it necessary to criticise this side of the House, I would not refrain from doing so.  As I understand it, because of the position in which we found ourselves in 1982, it is becoming more difficult to redress the problem. Unless there is a miracle in the next ten years the position will get worse instead of better.</P>
      <P>In 1981 Fine Gael, in their Programme for Government, preached a policy of endeavouring to tackle the high borrowing requirement, the cutting of inflation and the reducing of taxation.  It is exceedingly difficult to achieve such major objectives but the Government have performed remarkably well in their efforts in that regard.  In 1982 the public had to be convinced of the difficult times that lay ahead.  That was achieved because, against the background of a very severe budget in February 1982, the people were prepared to support the Coalition in spite of the propaganda spread by the Opposition during that election campaign. Having convinced the public to accept something, it is then the responsibility and obligation of politicians to ensure that policies are carried through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> Public sector expenditure and indebtedness are still suffocating the private sector with a tax system that is destroying the incentive to work here.  Progress has been made to change that ever so slightly and the budget is a further step in that direction.  In spite of what the Opposition might like to see happening, it should be pointed out to them that they did precious little in that area when they were in Government.  The public sector borrowing requirement, the main barometer of how an economy is moving, in 1981 represented 20.3 per cent of GNP.  In spite of the many difficulties which the economy experienced in the past three years it has been reduced in the current year to 14.2 per cent.  Irrespective of what economists may say, that represents an achievement. The target for public sector borrowing requirement should have been three points less if the Government were able to stick to their projections in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  That plan represented the first real attempt to programme in a proper way.  It must be remembered that many of the problems encountered by the Government were ones over which the Government had little or no control.</P>
    <P>Progress has been slow and I hope this year's budget is not an indication that the spirit of the Government, or future Governments, to reduce the borrowing further is faltering.  We should compare our position with that of the UK where the Government are concerned to keep the public sector borrowing requirement at 2 per cent of GNP but here we are happy to continue with a borrowing requirement that is six times greater.  The public sector borrowing requirement is a clear indicator of how our economy is growing and progressing.  Consequently, because we have to compete on all fronts with our EC neighbours, the years ahead will be exceedingly difficult.  That will be the position for any Government whether the people decide to let us continue or choose another Government.</P>
    <P>Although we raised £6.1 billion in tax revenue this year the State will have to borrow another £2.4 billion to meet its expenditure requirements.  That is an enormous figure.  Borrowing is a postdated <Col N="1158" /> form of taxation which some future generation of Irish people will have to pay.  Future citizens will have to put their hands in their pocket and pay for the borrowing requirement that began in the mid-seventies and spiralled towards the end under a grossly incompetent Government who were afraid to face up to their responsibilities because they had their eye on the electorate.  They were afraid to meet what they regarded as the hostility of the electorate.  They will meet that hostility again unless they adopt a more positive approach in that regard.  The policy they promoted in 1981 was one I could support because I believe it represented a proper way forward but Fianna Fáil have moved from that position.  If one were to cost all the proposals put forward in Private Members' time in the past three years one would realise that it would require a level of borrowing far in excess of our capacity to pay.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the Republic had no public sector external indebtedness but it now amounts to £8 billion or £7,000 for every employed person.  Relative to other countries, particularly in those with whom we compete, our indebtedness has reached appalling proportions.  The high level of public sector borrowing is causing banks and financial institutions to channel loans towards the public sector and away from the private sector to an increasing extent and one can easily understand this practice.  The lending institutions are out to make a profit and why should they lend to the uncertain private sector when the Government are prepared to guarantee an almost gilt edged return on their lending?  I do not say that lightly or to criticise the Government, but that is the way things are and any attempt to redress it would have a serious effect on other aspects of the economy.  The process, therefore, of reducing the public sector borrowing requirement and current budget deficit has really only begun, although there has been progress.  Of course, those who propose the policies of the Government and who would like to see them out of office <Col N="1159" /> will say the opposite.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the new found Messianic group, what they promote and their recipe for success in the future.  They are looking for more stringent cuts in public expenditure.  If the Government were to adopt this approach what would happen? There could be no pay rise in the public service this year.  Would The Workers' Party support such a measure?  Would any party support such a measure?  The trade unions and the workers would not support such a policy and, much as I regretted voting against my own colleagues on a pay agreement which was part and parcel of a negotiating process over a long period of time, I did so because there was no other course open to me.  If that claim was met in full, as demanded, taxation would have to be increased. Industrial action is not the answer.  They should try to find some formula whereby their claim could be settled.</P>
    <P>We had a three hour debate in this House on the proposals of the Minister for Health in relation to hospitals.  A further pruning in expenditure on health would mean a considerable reduction in an already diminishing service.  We all demand improvements in educational facilities but there is not much prospect of them in the immediate future.  The construction industry is also in a very depressed state.  Could anyone envisage cuts in social welfare and giving no increases in this area?  All Members meet these people every weekend and we understand and recognise the great difficulties they have in making ends meet on a small income.</P>
    <P>There are abuses of the system but I am sure the new Minister &mdash; I wish her well &mdash; will try to tackle the problem. However, I do not believe that the abuses are as widespread as those mentioned in a recent newspaper article.  I did not have an opportunity last week to put a question to the Minister but I understand that 37 or so additional civil servants have been recruited to monitor these abuses.  I suggest that they should all be concentrated in one area to see if there is any reduction in the level of welfare demand in that <Col N="1160" /> area.  I do not believe there would be a significant reduction in claims.  Nobody condones abuses because they prevent the Government from giving real increases to those who badly need them.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats demand lower taxes, a lower current budget deficit and, at the same time, higher public expenditure on a range of services.  They have not publicly accepted the grim and unpleasant truth that any increase in the public service must be paid for by higher taxation, which is unthinkable.  Many Opposition speakers referred to <i>Building on Reality</i> with obstinate and arrogant derision and went so far as to suggest that it should now be granted a decent burial.  The basic structures of the plan remain reasonably close to what was conceivably possible when it was drafted.  Arising from the best economic advice available to the Government at the time, the plan is a realistic document.  This was the first plan which set clear targets of expenditure for each Government Department over a three year period.  This means that all Departments knew three years in advance what the extent of their expenditure would be and how they could make cuts in certain areas over that period.  All Departments and local authorities like to hold on to the money which has been allocated to them but that is the wrong approach and has led to our present troubles.</P>
    <P>This Government pioneered a new approach to budgeting.  The Opposition have short memories.  When they were last in office they could not get their projections right for a single year.  Their budget meant an increase in turnover tax from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent.  No thought was put into their budgets and during their term of office from 1977 to 1981 they experienced overruns in current budget deficits of the order of 70 per cent, 50 per cent and 30 per cent and yet they say that the Government are failing to meet their responsibilities.  At least that is one major achievement of this Government.  They cannot be accused of overrunning their projections.  They are very close to what was targeted, a pattern begun in 1983 and followed through to 1985.  Despite an <Col N="1161" /> increase in unemployment greater than the figure projected at the beginning of 1985, the Government were able to remain remarkably close to the target set at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>For some time the Opposition were shouting about the restructuring of VAT but when in Government they did not have the courage or the commitment to do anything in that area.  However, in the 1985 budget the Government acted on that question and, in addition to restructuring the VAT system, some rates of VAT have been reduced substantially. There are some who will say that certain taxation cuts are self financing.  I do not necessarily accept that.  Our experience so far in the matter of VAT reductions has not proved that they are self financing though, perhaps, there may be some evidence to the contrary in 1986.  Last year Exchequer borrowing was less than 13 per cent of GNP and, with the public sector borrowing requirement continuing to reduce the prospects for the economy are better now than they have been for some time despite what some of the pundits might say.  I doubt if anyone could convince me that we might have moved faster in our determination to bring matters under control.</P>
    <P>Inflation at about 4½ per cent is the lowest since the early sixties.  It may even reduce this year to 3½ per cent.  This reduction must bring about some form of economic upturn.  Otherwise, what would be the point of theoretic economics? For the first time since the forties the trade account showed a surplus in 1985. That did not happen by chance.</P>
    <P>In 1985, too, the figures for tourism were very good.  The reductions in VAT levels in this budget will bring about automatically a further improvement in this area and an increase in jobs in the industry.  What happened in the North on Monday will not help to convince people that Ireland is the right place for a holiday in 1986, but we had to contend with a similar difficulty a few years ago when the then Taoiseach made some remarks in relation to the Falklands conflict which were not very well received by our friends across the water.  That episode had the <Col N="1162" /> effect of reducing considerably the level of tourist income, but we have recovered from that.</P>
    <P>There are a considerable number of jobs in the tourist area.  I am one of those people who for a long time have been advocating investment in that industry. We still enjoy the climate and the conditions in which people can enjoy their holidays in relative peace and contentment. Our roads are not congested and the air here remains reasonably free from pollution.  The same applies to our beaches.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the single biggest difficulty facing the economy and, although the indications are that the upward trend appears to be slowing down, the problem is one of grave concern to all of us.  The outlook so far as the international scene is concerned has been more favourable than has been the case for some time.  The fall in the value of the dollar and in interest rates last year will have a considerable impact on the cost of borrowing to industrialists, to farmers and to the State.  Who would have envisaged in 1981 when oil was almost 30 dollars a barrel that it would have fallen by now to about ten dollars a barrel?  The very high price of this commodity in the early eighties put a very great strain on our finances.</P>
    <P>The creation of jobs must remain the single and central economic and social priority of this or any future Government in the years ahead.  By way of the various taxation measures and of incentive policies this Government have created a better climate for employment.  I disagree with Deputy O'Kennedy who cast serious reflections on the various schemes devised by this Government to help those who are unemployed and who can foresee no escape from that position.  Those of us who are in touch with the public realise the trauma and the depression that accompany unemployment especially when jobs are lost in employment that was considered reasonably secure.  Many people between the ages of 40 and 50 particularly have great difficulty in coping with unemployment.  These people still have to pay their mortgages and so on. <Col N="1163" /> At least this Government have done something worthwhile in reintroducing many of those people to the workplace and by providing the incentives to allow them to establish their own businesses. Anyone who says that is not an effective policy either does not understand or does not wish to understand the difficulties being experienced by the people involved.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the house improvement grants should stimulate considerable activity in the much depressed building industry.  The CII have alleged continually that this Government have depressed the industry, have withdrawn resources from it and have caused problems by increasing the VAT rate in that area from zero to 10 per cent and consequently have reduced considerably the level of employment in the industry.  I am not sure that I would accept the veracity of such allegations.  Through the sixties, the seventies and the eighties there have been major investments in the construction area.  At enormous cost to the taxpayer we have provided buildings and various infrastructures that have not resulted in the kind of return to the Exchequer that was necessary to justify the investment in the first place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy speaking from the Parliamentary Democratic Party benches criticised the Government in respect of their claim that the £5,000 grant to those vacating local authority houses and buying homes of their own as well as the new housing grants would give the kind of stimulus to the economy that is needed.  I would remind the Deputy that already there have been 43,000 applications for the new grants.  Deputy Burke expressed concern that the Government might not have the money to meet their commitments on these grants but I think he will be disappointed on that, too.  These applications continue to arrive at the Department at the rate of 3,500 per week.  The scheme will have the effect of putting about £200 million into the economy this year alone.  That should provide about 10,000 jobs in the construction industry.  If all of these jobs are not <Col N="1164" /> provided this year they will have been provided within a two year period.</P>
    <P>Another advantage of the scheme is that only recognised and registered builders may be employed to carry out the work and they will be employing workers. This scheme together with the scheme announced in the budget to help employers to increase their workforce, that is, the foregoing of PRSI payments for one year from April 1986 to 1987, will bring about a big improvement in employment. Nobody can fairly or accurately claim that this Government have not been concerned about measures to try to reduce unemployment.  Having inherited an unemployment growth of 40,000 per year and with a population structure that was in no way helpful to trying to reduce growing unemployment, the Government have done remarkably well in bringing that down.</P>
    <P>One of the most successful schemes in this area has been the enterprise allowance scheme which reduced unemployment on the live register by roughly 10,000 in the first two years of its operation. Many of these people, apart from being taken off the register, are now doing something positive.  They are producing their own products and have started their own industries and are preventing imports from entering the country. The Minister yesterday announced more of these.  Hopefully, next week and next month he will announce more as that is the type of policy this Government take great pleasure in pursuing.  The social employment scheme, specifically targeted at the long term unemployed, had almost 5,500 people participating at the end of 1985 who a year or two ago had no hope.</P>
    <P>Let us look at reports in the press from various interested bodies.  The Construction Industry Federation expressed acute disappointment at the Government's failure to respond to their pre-budget submission calling for a range of incentives to boost the building industry, one of which was to eliminate the 10 per cent VAT on construction.  They blame that VAT for the 15 per cent drop in the new housing outlet last year.  I was looking <Col N="1165" /> recently at an analysis of house building within the Community and Ireland is second in the lead and <i>per capita</i> of her population is building more houses than any other country in the community apart from the Dutch.</P>
    <P>Coalition Governments can be proud of their record in building houses.  They started in the fifties when they had more houses than they had people to put into them.  They pursued the same policy in the seventies and are continuing to do that now.  Nothing would give us politicians a greater level of pleasure than to be able to say to our constituents: &ldquo;You can have a house within six months if you are married and have one child.  Even now you may not need to have any children.&rdquo; We may have to look at the cost now that we have reached that stage.  The cost to the taxpayer is substantial.  In one of the national newspapers today &mdash; I am paraphrasing the report; I do not know how accurate it is &mdash; it was stated that Dublin Corporation would be better selling all their housing stock to their tenants or giving them away for nothing.  It is costing them more money to carry out repairs than they are getting from them. That represents a waste of public funds.</P>
    <P>The Construction Industry Federation also referred to the £25 million reduction in the public capital programme but they did not draw any attention to the housing grants, a £200 million investment.  That is the kind of inaccurate representation that can come sometimes from a section of the community who feel that, to soem extent they are not getting their share. Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the retention tax.  The various lending institutions have been drawing attention to this in recent years.  There is a change of major importance under the heading of taxing the financial institutions.  The existing arrangements for taxing deposit interest are unsatisfactory and have been a source of considerable friction as institutions claim that their competitors enjoy an unfair advantage.  This year's measure was designed to harmonise tax arrangements as far as reasonably possible across the board for all deposit interest.</P>
    <P>There has been consistent pressure for <Col N="1166" /> an arrangement of this nature.  The Commission on Taxation emphasised the need for equality of treatment.  The tax yield from the financial institutions and from financial investment generally is decidedly low.  The banks in particular were in unfair competition with the building societies.  They were paying a 28 per cent retention tax which has gone up to 35 per cent.  The insurance companies have considerable advantages <i>vis-à-vis</i> taxation as have their investors who invest in various types of insurance and who can get a clawback on tax.  The banks had approximately 8,000,000 depositors. There are 2,000,000 adults in this country. Obviously, there is a bit of a fiddle going on some place.  I state publicly that the Revenue Commissioners have thrown in the towel.  They were not able to collect what they should have collected from the banks.  This is the simplest way to bring it in as they are guaranteed 35 per cent on all interest earned on deposit. That anomaly is there.</P>
    <P>I drew attention to the fact that the scheme of housing grants, which will be carried out by registered builders, will have the effect of eliminating some of the abuses that are taking place in the black economy, particularly in the construction industry.  Some building contractors openly employ people knowing that they are drawing either benefit or social welfare assistance.  In some cases, they drive to building estates, go back on the Tuesday and sign on.  Why not put the 37 inspectors into one area and see what the effect would be?</P>
    <P>The tourist industry will be pleased with what the budget proposes.  Hopefully, it will have the effect, expressed by the President of the Irish Hotels Federation, Mr. Brian McCarthy, that the VAT reductions will boost tourism earnings and increase employment.  He further suggested that the federation would immediately start planning a comprehensive programme to promote greater use of resources.</P>
    <P>The three major areas I referred to earlier were taxation, public sector borrowing and employment.  I would like to say something else on employment. <Col N="1167" /> Speaking in this House last week, the Minister for Agriculture referred to the number of factors totally to our disadvantage which he sees developing within the Community.  There is an over-production of milk, beef and grain.  These are three <Col N="1168" /> of the major commodities that have a direct value for the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>Since my previous statement to the Dáil on 5 November 1985 concerning the disappearance of Father Romano we have pursued the matter with the Philippine authorities but no information has been forthcoming on his whereabouts.</P>
      <P>While in Manila some days ago Ireland's Ambassador to the Philippines who is resident in Beijing raised the case again but was informed by the Philippine authorities that despite extensive inquiries they have not been able to obtain any information on Father Romano.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the new Philippine Government will make every effort to pursue the investigation.  For our part we will encourage the Philippine authorities in this sense and we will continue to take a close interest in the situation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am informed that in addition to the former Celtic Ceramics premises in Kilrush, which is the subject of a separate question by the Deputy, there are other factory units ranging in size from 750 sq. ft. to 57,545 sq. ft. unallocated and available for industrial purposes in County Clare. These premises are located in Shannon, Ennis, Kilrush, Miltown Malbay, Kilkee, Kilmihil, Kildysart, Lisdoonvarna and <Col N="1004" /> Killaloe.  There are a further 22 units which are vacant at present but which have been allocated for projects.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited &mdash; and the Industrial Development Authority where appropriate &mdash; are actively promoting all the unallocated premises for industrial projects.  I have asked these agencies to intensify their efforts in this regard. There are no plans at present to provide further advance factories in County Clare.  However, should a project arise for which no suitable premises is available, the provision of a purpose built unit would be considered.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am informed by Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited that they have decided to modify, subject to planning permission, 5,000 square feet of the former Celtic Ceramics premises for use as a fish processing centre.  The remainder of the premises, which is being promoted both by IDA and Shannon Free Airport Development Company for suitable industrial projects, will be redeveloped on a phased basis in line with demand. Additionally, Shannon Free Airport Development Company are currently examining the feasibility of developing a &ldquo;work space&rdquo; type small industry centre in Kilrush and will consider the suitability of part of the former Celtic Ceramics premises for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.  The effect of the circular referred to by the Deputy is to replace the original domestic rate grant allocations notified to local authorities in December 1985 by an increased level of funding made up partly of a domestic rate grant allocation and partly of the additional benefit accruing to local authorities revenue accounts from the use of the proceeds of local authority house sales.  In fact, the revised allocations notified show an increase of over 1.5 per cent on the original December 1985 figures.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to withdraw the circular.</P>
      <P>The revised allocations were based on information supplied both by telephone and otherwise by urban councils.  However, the circular indicated that the revised allocations were provisional pending receipt of the specific information sought in the circular.  I will of course review the provisional allocations on receipt of full information from all urban councils.  For the purpose of local authority estimates, my Department have informed the manager for the urban councils in Mayo that it is in order for the local authorities to proceed on the basis of an increased allocation as indicated above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the technical accounting matters raised by the Deputy are concerned, it is not my intention that the revised arrangements for rate support grants should in any way disturb the normal financial relationship between the county and the urban authorities and my Department have advised the manager of the Mayo urban councils of this.  The county demand made by Mayo County Council on the urban authorities in the county during the prescribed estimates periods represents an estimate based on information available at the time the demand is made, refined as necessary by <Col N="1007" /> outturns of the actual produce of the rate in the local authorities concerned in the two previous years, calculated in accordance with the public bodies orders.  I will in due course make any necessary amendments to the public bodies orders to enable the actual produce of the rate to be calculated for 1986 at the appropriate later stage.</P>

    <P>The prospects for further improvement in 1986 appear favourable.  In this connection the inauguration of scheduled services by two further US Airlines &mdash; Pan Am and Delta &mdash; should be of significant benefit.  In relation to transit traffic, Aer Rianta will continue its promotional effort in this area as it has been doing over the past number of years.  The availability of aviation fuel at competitive prices through the fuel facility operated by its subsidiary, Shannon Aviation Fuels Limited, which will be considerably expanded in 1986, should assist in the further development of this segment of traffic.</P>
    <P>The agreement between Aeroflot and Aer Rianta concerning Aeroflot operations at Shannon was extended in July 1985.  In addition, it is expected that the number of passengers transferred between Aer Lingus and Aeroflot will increase significantly in 1986.</P>
    <P>The promotion of airline flight crew training is also being actively pursued. Existing contracts for such training will be continued with Air France, KLM and Swissair, and new agreements have been concluded with Lufthansa, British Caledonian and Dan Air for 1986.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company (SFADCo) which operates under the aegis of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is also very active in the generation of increased business for Shannon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the survey referred to and that the survey refers to certain difficulties allegedly encountered by chronic renal failure patients.  The particular drugs not available to chronic renal failure patients, holding medical cards, under the GMS scheme comprise almost exclusively the various &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; (OTC) preparations which were removed from the GMS scheme by the then Government in October 1982.  As was then indicated, these OTC items are either very cheap or relatively inexpensive to purchase.  They do not require a prescription and are available from a range of retail outlets, including pharmaceutical chemists.  In those exceptional and rare circumstances, where a medical card patient might suffer hardship in purchasing such OTC items, application can be made to the appropriate health board for the supply of the item(s) concerned free of charge.</P>
      <P>There are a small number of patent drugs, used in the treatment of chronic renal failure, which are not available under the GMS scheme.  These preparations would generally only be administered in a hospital setting under specialist supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of our current levels of financial resources, any extension of the long term illness scheme cannot realistically be contemplated at the present time. However, I would strong emphasise that substantial subsidies are already <Col N="1018" /> available in respect of expenditure in drugs.  For those whose income is such that, despite their medical expenses, they do not qualify for a medical card, the cost of drugs refund scheme provides a very significant support.  Under this scheme, all expenditure in excess of £28 per month on drugs prescribed for use in that calendar month is fully refunded by health boards.  Persons insured with the VHI may also claim for the unrefunded expenditure in accordance with their policy coverage.  Furthermore, all unrecouped expenditure over £50 on medical treatment can be claimed as an allowance under the income tax code with certain small exceptions.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the level of financial support available is very reasonable having regard to the resources available to this Department and the very wide variety of demands made upon them.</P>

      <P>Retos Limited, Shannon, is a private organisation for re-employment training of handicapped persons, mainly those with a psychiatric illness.  It has been largely funded by the Mid-Western Health Board, with the aid of European Social Fund grants.  The grant from the health board for 1985, including an outstanding payment from the social fund, amounts to about £400,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1985, Retos Limited requested additional grant aid from the Mid-Western Health Board to meet the cost of expanding their activities.  The board informed Retos Limited that they had no funds available for this purpose. Retos Limited have since applied to my Department for a grant for this proposed <Col N="1019" /> development.  No provision has been made in the funds available to my Department for a grant for this purpose. The matter is however being currently examined in my Department and a decision will be conveyed shortly.</P>
    <P>Retos Limited has about 86 trainees on a full time basis at present.  Some trainees in the sub-contracting division of the company were recently laid off due to a fall off in orders for sub-contract work. If further sub-contract work becomes available, the company will be in a position to resume their training.</P>

In addition, food workers must take every reasonable precaution to prevent the contamination of food.  This provision is generally interpreted to mean that food workers should not smoke in close proximity to food.</P>
      <P>Article 32 of the same regulations provides that in any place where a food business is carried on a person who is not a food worker shall not engage in any unhygienic practice in such proximity to food as to be liable to cause contamination or infection thereof.

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited at the appropriate rate in the governing contribution period.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 6 March 1985 to 12 March 1985 and from 19 September 1985. She did not have sufficient contributions paid or credited at the appropriate rate in the governing contribution period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 and accordingly her claims for unemployment benefit were disallowed.  She applied for unemployment assistance and was assessed with means of £15.85 weekly, derived from the value of board and lodgings on her parent's holding.  She appealed against the means assessment but an appeals officer also assessed her means at £15.85 weekly.  She is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £15.90 weekly being the maximum appropriate rate payable in her case of £31.75 less means of £15.85.

Her entitlement to unemployment benefit from 16 October 1985 will be determined in the light of the information furnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new benefit year commenced on 6 <Col N="1025" /> January 1986 and as the person concerned satisfies the contribution condition, for receipt of minimum rate unemployment benefit, during the governing period 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985 her claim has been allowed at the weekly rate of £35.35 from 6 January 1986.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made to issue to her this week an order for encashment at her local post office in respect of all arrears of flat rate unemployment benefit due from 6 January 1986.  Further weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.  The delay in this case is regretted.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year at a class which provides cover against unemployment.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 30 August 1985.  Inquiries had to be made to establish if her employment during the relevant contribution year 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 which governed her claim of 30 August 1985 was insurable at a contribution class which provides cover against unemployment. These inquiries were recently completed and it was established that her employment was not insurable at a contribution class which provides cover against unemployment and accordingly her claim to unemployment benefit was disallowed. The person concerned is being notified of the decision regarding the insurability of her employment, and of her right to appeal against that decision.</P>

      <P>The person concerned exhausted her entitlement to 312 days unemployment benefit on 6 October 1985.  However, she requalified for benefit from 7 October 1985 as she satisfied the condition of having 13 weeks of employment, which was insurable at the appropriate contribution class, since 156 days of benefit had been drawn.  According to the Department's records she had only 36 contributions paid and six unemployment credits during the period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 which governs her claim of 7 October 1985 and consequently her claim was allowed at £33.65 being the appropriate reduced rate payable in her case.  She ceased to prove unemployment on 9 February 1986.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 15 April 1985.  Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  In order that a person may be considered permanently incapable of work, it is necessary for him to, <i>inter alia,</i> have been continuously incapable of work for a period of one year.  Therefore, the earliest date on which the claimant can qualify for invalidity pension is 15 April 1986.  In addition it is necessary to have him examined by a medical referee for an opinion as to his future capacity for work.  Arrangements have been made to have the person concerned examined by a medical referee on 6 March 1986.  Disability benefit will continue to issue in the meantime to the person concerned on receipt of monthly medical evidence of incapacity.</P>

The person concerned was examined on 22 November 1985 by a medical referee who did not consider him to be permanently incapable of work. A deciding officer decided that he was not therefore entitled to invalidity pension. However, arrangements have been made to have him examined by a different medical referee on 6 March 1986.  His entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed in the light of the report of that examination.</P>

The amounts in each co-operative differ and are dependent on quantities becoming available as a result of producers within the co-operative ceasing or reducing deliveries below the levels of their quotas.  The flexi-milk is to be distributed by the co-operatives to special eligible categories of producers in accordance with the general guidelines laid down by my Department.

      <P>In 1984, £77,400 was allocated for TB testing in County Sligo.  The question of allocation on an individual county basis did not arise in the course of the current (1985-86) round since a full monitor of the national herd is being carried out in addition to a programme of special testing of high risk herds in each county.  This programme will continue until 6 April 1986.  Definitive allocations for testing over the remainder of 1986 have not yet been fixed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, in view of the difficulties being experienced in the implementation of the social employment scheme whereby only £37 is made available for materials to include also the cost of supervision of the work being carried out for every £70 provided for labour costs, he will consider increasing the allocation for the scheme of more money for materials to be purchased for the various projects or alternatively increase the ratio of money allocated under the present arrangements in relation to the purchase of materials, given the fact that the amount available under the employment incentive scheme is only £60 for five days work per week by the employee; and if he will increase the amount payable per employee under the employment incentive scheme and increase the numbers of employees who can be taken on under the terms of the scheme from two per employer, as at present, to ten per employer for the purpose of encouraging employers to take on more people under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The social employment scheme provides for the payment of £70 per week to each employee in respect of an average 2½ days work per week.  In addition, the sponsors of a project may be entitled to a grant in respect of the costs of full time supervision of a project and in respect of the purchase of materials.  The materials and supervision costs for public organisations such as local authorities, health boards, etc. is 53 per cent of the total cost of the wages for a particular project.  In the case of voluntary organisations a grant of 28 per cent of wage costs is available, 13 per cent of which is in respect of supervision costs and 15 per cent for materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The indications are that in the vast <Col N="1036" /> majority of cases the grants for materials are adequate and there is no evidence to suggest that the amounts currently available deter sponsors from participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have been particularly pleased with the rate of take-up on the scheme to date. There are now 1,827 projects in operation employing a total of 6,777 persons and I am confident that our target of 10,000 persons in employment will be reached in mid-year.  In these circumstances I do not intend to increase the proportionate level of grant for materials or supervision under the social employment scheme in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>There are major differences between the social employment scheme and the employment incentive scheme.  The social employment scheme is a temporary employment scheme while the employment incentive scheme is a marginal wage subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>The premium structure under the employment incentive scheme was revised in April 1984.  There are two premia payable to employers under the scheme, a standard premium of £30 per week and another of £60 per week.  The latter is payable in respect of eligible persons aged 25 years or upward who have been unemployed for 12 months or more.  I have no plans at present to revise the premiums.</P>
    <P>In October 1985 the ceiling limit on the number of eligible recruitments per employer per annum was increased from two to four under the scheme.  I consider that any further upward revision of the ceiling limit would probably result in unnecessary windfall gains to employers and make the scheme less financially self supporting.</P>

    <P>Almost 500 applicants could not be assisted in 1985 due to limitations on funds or for other reasons.  It would not be possible, without an examination of all the applications concerned, to indicate the total amount of money involved.  The best estimate is that a sum in the region of £15 million would be required to finance those applications which would have been otherwise eligible under the scheme.</P>

      <P>It has not been possible to provide assistance to approximately 240 applications submitted under Teamwork for financial or other reasons.</P>
      <P>The total amount of money available under the scheme in 1986 is £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> However, because of the large number of projects approved for assistance in 1985 which have continued into the present year, very heavy financial commitments under the scheme have been carried over to the present year.  It has been possible, therefore, to approve grants for only a limited number of new projects in 1986.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present to provide additional funding for the scheme in 1986.</P>

      <P>Statistics relating to the social employment scheme are at present compiled on the basis of National Manpower Service regions and it is not possible to provide details of schemes in individual counties.</P>
      <P>In the north west NMS region, which includes Counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, there are currently 751 persons employed in 140 projects.  In addition, approval has been given for a further 124 projects employing 1,031 people.</P>
      <P>The cost of projects vary considerably depending on the numbers of people employed and the type of project.  There is no specific allocation of moneys for schemes in particular regions but there are sufficient funds available for any future projects which might be undertaken in 1986.</P>
