    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the implications of the violence in Northern Ireland on Monday, 3 March, and the manner in which the situation was handled by the British Government and the security forces; and in particular, if he is aware that adequate protection against obstruction, intimidation and physical violence was not afforded to those members of the community who wished to go about their lawful affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a review of events in Northern Ireland on 3 March, the Government issued a statement on 4 March which I will now repeat:</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to press ahead with the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  In this way practical action will result which will benefit both communities in Northern Ireland and Ireland as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strikes and demonstrations lead only to violence, as the events of Monday, 3 March demonstrated.  The Government are of the view that only the <Col N="1328" /> path of constitutional politics can bring reconciliation, peace and stability to Northern Ireland.  We appeal to unionists to enter into talks with nationalists with a view to working out together a system of devolved government for Northern Ireland.  The Government are open to any constructive views that the unionist leaders wish to put forward.</P>
    <P>There was widespread obstruction, intimidation and physical violence in Northern Ireland on 3 March and many members of the community were unable to go, unhindered, about their lawful affairs.  It is also clear that many people were enabled to go about their business, including to work and that many did so. There were many incidents in which members of the security forces acted correctly and, indeed, courageously; and there were others where they did not, but in a situation as difficult and as tense as that which obtained, commendation from the sidelines is as futile as condemnation.</P>
    <P>I share the repugnance expressed by Secretary of State King in the British Parliament on 4 March when he referred to representatives elected to that parliament making common cause with people in paramilitary dress.</P>
    <P>As the House will recall, the Anglo-Irish Agreement provides that the Inter-Governmental Conference have no operational responsibilities for police matters, and that in Northern Ireland responsibility for these matters remains with the Chief Constable of the RUC who maintains his links with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The agreement, however, provides that the conference shall consider security policy and relations between the security forces and the community; that they shall consider the security situation at their regular meetings and thus provide an opportunity to address policy issues, serious incidents and forthcoming events. The agreement envisages that the Irish side will put forward views and proposals on these, as on other matters.</P>
    <P>In this sense, the events in Northern <Col N="1329" /> Ireland on 3 March were discussed with the British authorities at a meeting of the conference today.  In accordance with normal practice especially in relation to security matters, it is not proposed to comment in public on the detailed content of these discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has acknowledged in his reply that there was widespread intimidation, obstruction and violence.  Will he agree with me that one of the important aspects of this matter is whether he is satisfied with the attitude of the British authorities?  In particular I ask whether any steps have been taken to ascertain whether the non-activity by the RUC in a number of cases, and the complete absence of any military presence, were a result of a definite direction by the British authorities to that end and, in that regard, whether he is satisfied that this general approach of the British Government and the resultant directions they would have given to the security forces was satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are continuing close consultations between ourselves and the British authorities so I do not intend to add to my reply on the aspects of the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach would agree, I am sure, that what has hustled a number of people is the fact that the British Army were not involved in any way in clearing road blocks or anything of that nature and in a number of cases the RUC did not intervene; they stood by.  These facts are known, but the important thing in regard to them, and I ask the Taoiseach if he will agree that the important thing in regard to them, is whether they indicate a specific general direction by the British Government? That is important from all points of view. Will the Taoiseach give me his views on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not wishing to go further into details, I will say merely that I am satisfied of the determination of the British Government to maintain order in <Col N="1330" /> Northern Ireland and to implement the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, it leaves me with no alternative but to conclude that the RUC did not carry out their instructions, universally at any rate.  Arising from that, has the Taoiseach's attention been drawn to the statement by the Deputy Leader of the SDLP to the effect that last Monday the RUC had forfeited all credibility with the Nationalist community? Would he care to comment on the implications of that statement by Séamus Mallon?  Can he reconcile that statement and the appeal by his newly appointed Minister for Justice to the Nationalist community to join the RUC? Perhaps he can give me some indication of the Government's views on these self-contradictory aspects of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the points initially raised by the Deputy, I would point out that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the Commons on 4 March said that the Chief Constable was preparing a full report on all the policing aspects of the previous 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying that the Chief Constable of the RUC is preparing a full report on the whole situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what the Secretary of State told the Commons on the following day, 4 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position of the Government that they are refraining from comment until that report is issued? Is that the Taoiseach's position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that the report would be issued, but I do not propose to comment further, for the very reason that I gave in my initial answer that, given the difficulty and tenseness of the situation, commendation from the sideline and condemnation from the sideline are equally futile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1331" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that sentiment on the part of the Taoiseach.  He will perhaps accept that on this side of the House we, too, have refrained from any sort of inflammatory comments. Would he not agree that the important thing from our point of view is, first, the attitude of the responsible British authorities to the implementation of security policy and that in regard to these matters grave doubts have to be raised either as to the instructions given by the British Government or as to the manner in which those instructions, if given, were carried out?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that in regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement the role and intentions of the RUC are crucial?  If Séamus Mallon's statement is correct, that the RUC have forfeited all credibility in the eyes of the Nationalist community, this has important implications from the point of view of the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The Taoiseach should be more forthcoming with the House at some stage about this whole aspect of the matter.  He has mentioned in his reply statements made by the Secretary of State, Tom King, on a number of occasions. In this context does the Taoiseach accept that it is British policy, as stated by the said Secretary of State, that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is a bulwark against a united Ireland?  Does he accept that as being stated British Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Stated British Government policy is incorporated in a binding agreement between our two Governments. That agreement, in Article 1, says, as the Deputy is well aware, that the reunification of this country would come about only with the consent of the majority, that that consent does not exist at present and that, should that consent come into existence, the two Governments would introduce and support the necessary legislation to give effect to it.  That constitutes the policy of the British Government as incorporated in the agreement.  Within the British Government and the British Parliament, or elsewhere, there may be different <Col N="1332" /> opinions as to what people would like to see, but there is a clear recognition in the agreement by the British Government of their responsibilities and obligations in the matter, whatever may be the individual views of individual members of the British Government or Parliament.  Some of them may feel that the future would best lie with a united Ireland and some may hold a different view.  The relevant matter is not the views held but what is in the agreement.</P>

      <P>Next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach therefore stating to me now that, when the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland says that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is, in fact, a bulwark against a united Ireland, he is in contradiction of the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement?  Is that what the Taoiseach just said to me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What then?  How does the Taoiseach reconcile what he has just now claimed to be the contents of the Anglo-Irish Agreement with this very specific, categoric statement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland of British Government policy that they intend to interpret and implement the agreement as a bulwark against a united Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say that. I heard the broadcast.  The Deputy is quoting out of context.  Having said that, I do not, of course, share the opinion expressed by the Secretary of State and, indeed, when he expressed it in a somewhat different form at an earlier date and sought to attribute it to me, the British Government formally repudiated the statement made by him at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A final supplementary question, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as the Taoiseach has indicated, the events of Monday week last are the subject of discussions today <Col N="1333" /> at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference, is it the intention of the Government to seek any reassurances during the course of those discussions about the protection from obstruction and intimidation of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland on similar occasions which are likely to arise in the near future and in the months ahead?  As a result of the outcome of today's conference, will he be in a position to give this House any reassurances?  The Taoiseach is aware that we have not yet put in place&mdash;and I am not blaming him in any way&mdash;our arrangements for discussing the work of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  In advance of such arrangements, would the Taoiseach tell me if assurances are being sought today and if in due course we will be given some indication of what assurances this House can have about the situation of the Nationalist community in what seems to be the threatening period immediately ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in my initial reply, in accordance with normal practice, especially in relation to security matters, it is not proposed to comment in public on the detailed contents of the discussions.  I would, however, add, at the conclusion of these exchanges, that the Government naturally share the concern of the Deputy and his party about the events on 3 March, the intimidation and violence involved and the impact they had on both communities&mdash;not merely on the Nationalist community, with whom we have of course a particular affinity, but on members of the Unionist community, many of whom also are intimidated and prevented from going to work and many of whom resent that bitterly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if IDA and FEOGA grants have been paid to Bord na Móna for the building of a peat briquette factory at Derryfadda, Ballyforan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1334" />
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither IDA nor FEOGA grants have been paid to Bord na Móna for the building of a peat briquette factory at Derryfadda, Ballyforan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>If and when the ongoing review is completed on the building of a peat briquette factory at Derryfadda, will IDA or FEOGA grants then be paid? Could the Minister state when the review will be finally completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of the Deputy, I should just give him a quick review of the facts in relation to the proposed factory.  On 31 March 1979 the then Government agreed to the erection by Bord na Móna of a peat briquette factory in the Ballyforan area of County Galway which was part of their third development plan.  On 26 May 1984, having evaluated the solid fuel market and concluding that the output of Ballyforan could not be absorbed by the market at an economic price, a decision was taken by the board to defer the Ballyforan project for one year.  A review of this decision was carried out by Bord na Móna in 1985.  The findings were that, having regard to the board's financial projections and briquette market prospects, the project should continue to be deferred while being kept under ongoing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I inform the Minister that it is very difficult at the moment to get peat briquettes in the west and I am sure the same applies in his part of the country?  It is also very frustrating for the local farmers who gave away their bogs and for the reduced workforce down there to see tonnes of milled peat transported out of Derryfadda.  Can the Minister tell us if the further processing of milled peat will take place now in Derryfadda to allow for the building of a briquette factory there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the Deputy, there are no plans at the present time to go ahead with this project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get an answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister positively in favour of this project going ahead?  What is the Government position? Have Bord na Móna, the Minister, or the Department any plans for the extension of sod peat production in any other bogs in the west in 1986?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair must draw the Deputy's attention to the question which asks about the payment of grants to Bord na Móna.  This is a very short question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>While they are separate questions, if the Deputies who have an interest in the west wish to discuss matters pertaining to turf production or the efforts of Bord na Móna in the west, I will have no difficulty discussing them with them at any time in my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that a grant was sanctioned by the IDA for the building of that briquette factory&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that a review has been going on since 1984?  Will that grant be paid when the decision is made to go ahead with the building of the briquette factory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to preempt any decision by the IDA in relation to the payment of grants.  The Deputy is correct when he says that the IDA had agreed in principle to a grant of £3 million <Col N="1336" /> towards the project in 1982.  I assume Bord na Móna will make a fresh application to the IDA and the IDA tend to have a positive attitude to developments of this nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the reason for not going ahead was the result of a market survey carried out by Bord na Móna in 1985.  Will a similar survey be carried out in 1986?  I cannot understand the results of that survey in view of fact that there is a widespread scarcity of briquettes and briquettes are being imported from Germany to fill the vaccuum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 13 together.  Discussions between BGE, my Department and the company regarding changes in conditions under which gas is supplied to take account of difficulties which the company claim have been caused by the sharp drop in oil prices have been taking place for some time now.  The gas price charged to the company is automatically adjusted downwards to take account of the fall in oil prices, but the company have sought adjustments over and over this.  These discussions are continuing and it would be inappropriate to comment further on them at this stage.  I hope, however, to be able to bring the matter to a conclusion in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, according to the CII, energy costs here are running at 20 per cent higher than our European counterparts?  Is he further aware that according to the same sources, manufacturing unemployment here is running at 21 per cent?  In the context of those figures, will the Minister make better use of natural gas to assist manufacturing industry and unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not not in a position to agree or disagree with the Deputy's suggestions as to the CII figures.  I have been aware for the past two years or so that we have higher energy costs.  We have taken certain steps to reduce those costs to keep industry competitive and I will be announcing further progress in that area very shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the major step he could take would be to bring forward an integrated energy policy, particularly with manufacturing industry in mind?  Would he not agree that it is outrageous that we <Col N="1338" /> have not had an integrated energy policy designed around the need to create employment and to boost Irish industry? We seem to be going in all directions &mdash; the ESB are going in one direction, Bord Gáis in another and manufacturing unemployment is running at 21 per cent &mdash;&mdash;</P>

One of the lessons of the seventies throughout Europe was that, irrespective of energy policies, there are many factors outside the control of individual Governments.  I have had many discussions with my counterparts at European Energy Council meetings.  One has to keep a certain amount of fluidity in energy policy to take account of, for example, the sharp drop in oil prices that we have seen in the last number of months.  Energy policy is reviewed on an ongoing basis and I believe it is satisfactory at the present time.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Minister's original reply, I understood him to say that the gas price was to be adjusted downwards, but that the company had sought adjustments.  Could the Minister interpret what these adjustments are?  Do they mean that the Dublin Gas Company, while accepting a reduction in price, were not prepared to pass it all on to the consumer?  Was there an adjustment upwards in their price?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have explained that there is an arrangement for the adjustment of the price of gas over a certain time period and the shift which has occurred in the price of oil in the last number of months will not reflect itself for a certain period.  One of the main areas where discussions are taking place is in relation to having a contract escalafor <Col N="1339" /> provision which will reflect changes to be able to track oil prices faster and to allow the gas company to remain competitive.</P>

      <P>When was the adjustment made in relation to prices to the Dublin Gas Company?  Is the Minister aware that while the conversion programme is on target, many people who have already converted are switching back, to oil because certain oil companies have already given reductions in the price of oil and that this is putting the Dublin Gas Company in a very critical financial position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A hydro-electric resource survey has been carried out on behalf of my Department and all sites which are considered suitable for development have been identified.  The survey was carried out by the Electricity Supply Board who had responsibility for site assessment and by An Foras Forbartha who carried out the hydrological analysis.  A report on the findings of the survey was coordinated by the National Board for Science and Technology and was published by my Department in October 1985.  It is entitled &ldquo;Small-Scale Hydro-Electric Potential of Ireland&rdquo;, and is available from my Department, at a cost of £10 plus postage.  Copies of the report have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The report identifies 483 potential hydro-electric sites around the country with an estimated capacity of 10 kilowatt or greater and 85 sites already being utilised. It includes information on the location, potential capacity and output and economic feasibility of each of these sites. The report also outlines legal and other requirements associated with the proposed development of any particular site. Information gathered during the survey on approximately 3,000 other potential sites with a capacity of less than 10 kilowatt has been retained and is available to the public on request to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware another booklet entitled &ldquo;The Development of <Col N="1343" /> Small Scale Hydro-schemes&rdquo; was published by my Department in 1982.  Its purpose was to guide private developers of water power, to assist them in assessing the potential of a particular site and to give an indication of the problems and costs involved.  This booklet is available free of charge from my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the size of the choke used in the test well 50/6-1, which gave a flow rate of 2,074 barrels per day; the reason he has not yet made this information available, despite his statement in the Dáil on 5 February that he would do so; if he agrees that the announcement of flow rates is largely meaningless without the choke size; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A one inch choke was used <Col N="1344" /> when test flow rates of 2,074 barrels of oil per day were recorded as announced by the operator in respect of the 50/6-1 well.  In fact, I conveyed this information to the Deputy by letter on 5 March 1986. Before giving this information I secured the agreement of the operator of the licence under which the well was drilled, on behalf of all the licensees concerned, to the release of this information.  The primary purpose of a flow test is, in fact, to measure how reservoir pressure varies with time as flow takes place.  Together with geological and geophysical data this enables petroleum engineers to determine the properties of the reservoir and to estimate the volume of reserves-in-place. Flow rates, <i>per se,</i> have no impact on this assessment of reserves-in-place. Their significance in this regard do not depend on the size of choke used.</P>
      <P>Consequently, it is not true that the announcement of a flow rate without the choke size is largely meaningless.  It gives the basic information that the particular well has flowed hydrocarbons on test.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise, to avoid any misunderstanding, that this information is supplied to me with other data by the operator in all instances where flow tests are carried out.  All this information is, under the provisions of the licence, furnished to me on a confidential basis, and cannot be released without the consent of the operator acting on behalf of the licensees.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy still has that letter and he will have had another letter from me more recently on 5 March.  I should remind the Deputy of section 46 of the licensing terms which says that an integral part of the legal contract between the Minister and the licensees, by virtue of the fact that licensing terms are incorporated in the licence, section 46 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that information which the licensee is or may be from time to time required to furnish under the provisions of the licence, will be supplied at the expense of the licensee and will not, except with the consent in writing of the licensees &mdash; which will not be unreasonably withheld &mdash; be disclosed to any person not in the service or employment of the State until six years have elapsed after being furnished or four years after revocation, surrender or expiry of the licence, whichever is the earlier.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to elicit two things: the information which was available to the Minister &mdash; Deputy Reynolds may have some other questions to ask because he posed some very relevant ones on that date also and did not receive the necessary information.  The <Col N="1346" /> Minister will recall that the question on the Order Paper on 5 February asked if he would make a statement on the information available to the Government on the reported discovery of oil in block 50/6 in the Celtic Sea.  On that date the Minister said that the information in regard to choke size was not available to the Government and he did not have it. He also indicated to Deputy Reynolds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely, and that is why I am asking the Minister why, when replying to a question to him about the information available to the Government, he did not have that information on his file?  He did not say on that date that he would not give it to me because it was confidential.  He said that he did not have the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>This is becoming a conundrum. I said on that occasion that I did not have the information on the file and I offered to get it for the Deputy.  In the course of getting that information for the Deputy, as I quoted from the licence terms, the consent of the operator had to be obtained.  When I communicated with the Deputy on the date of the first letter, 25 February, that consent had not been received.  Subsequently, I received the necessary consent from the operator who had received the consent of the other parties in the consortium.  Having received that information I gave it to the Deputy and what he intends doing with it I do not have any idea in the world.</P>

I told the Deputy that I did not have the information &mdash; it was not asked for &mdash; and at that time, even if I had it on the file, I could not have given it to him.  I probably would have given him the information because I tend to give all the information I have at my disposal.  Certain pieces of information between the oil companies and my Department are not divulged to the public because they are of value to my Department and the oil company concerned. The oil company have invested a lot of resources in ascertaining that information which is of commercial value to them.  Obviously, my Department will not divulge the information because of the relationship we have with all the oil companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord na Móna produced 1.8 million tonnes of peat in 1985 of which 1.5 million tonnes was milled peat and the balance sod peat.  It is estimated that private producers harvested about 1.25 million tonnes.  The Bord na Móna targets for 1986 are 5.017 million tonnes of milled peat and .383 million tonnes of sod peat.  Private production in 1986 is estimated at 1.4 million tonnes.</P>
      <P>The unusually wet summer made 1985 a very unsuitable year for turf production. Bord na Móna achieved only 30 per cent of their milled peat target and about 75 per cent of the sod peat target. Because of their long-term policy to maintain high stocks, Bord na Móna have, however, been able to maintain deliveries to ESB at nearly 90 per cent of normal levels.  Briquette production has also been close to target, although substantially increased demand for briquettes during the summer, arising from the bad weather, has resulted in an allocation policy for briquettes at present.  Avail&mdash; ability of sod peat for sale to the public by Bord na Móna is also restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loss of production in 1985 valued <Col N="1350" /> at over £50 million obviously has implications for Bord na Móna and, given reasonable weather in 1986 and future years, a special effort will have to be made by the board and its staff to redress this loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he is aware that the cost to the motorist of maintaining the Whitegate refinery is currently 11p per gallon of petrol at retail price; and whether in the circumstances he believes the maintenance of the present regime is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the basis on which the Deputy has computed the figure quoted.  The only valid determinant of the cost or benefit of Whitegate refinery to the Irish oil consumer is the comparison between Whitegate product prices and the actual import price of products imported by the oil marketing companies. Data on current actual import prices for January and February 1986 are not yet to hand.  Only when such data are available will it be possible to determine the current impact of Whitegate/import price differentials on consumer prices.  In the most recent month for which actual import price data are available, December 1985, there was a favourable comparison of $26.29 per tonne, equivalent to about 0.07 pence per gallon between the ex-Whitegate price and the import price of petrol in that month.  Indeed it is noteworthy that for all but four months of 1985 the price of petrol from Whitegate was lower than the import price of petrol from other sources.</P>
      <P>The nature of the mandatory regime by which Whitegate products are disposed of is such that prices are adjusted on a quarterly basis so that there is a time lag involved in passing through benefits in a time of falling prices or additional costs in a time of rising prices.  Market price movements in any one quarter, such as those which we have witnessed in recent weeks, are not reflected in Whitegate prices until the succeeding quarter. The impact of Whitegate on consumer prices can, therefore, only be assessed over a period of time and then, as I have said, only on the basis of a comparison with actual import prices rather than deemed or speculated prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The refinery was purchased and is <Col N="1352" /> being maintained in the interests of security of supply.  Nothing, in my view, which has happened since purchase of the refinery has fundamentally diminished that rationale.  The fact that so far the eighties has not seen oil supply disruptions akin to those of the seventies or that there is no immediate apparent prospect of serious disruption is not sufficient reason to dispense with security of supply considerations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that there is serious dispute as to the basis of the figures on which he made his reply?  Will he accept that recent figures are available and are published weekly in the European Commission Oil Bulletin?  Will the Minister accept that the figures for 24 February 1986 show that the average consumer price in Ireland pre-tax is $327 per tonne whereas the EC average is $224 per tonne?  Will the Minister accept that the data for February shows that the imported cost of petrol here was $184 per tonne while the basic Whitegate price at that time was $296 per tonne?  Going through all the calculations which can be made &mdash; although this is not the place to do so &mdash; they show a differential of 12½p per gallon.  I do not expect the Minister to reply in detail, but does he accept that there is a basis for genuine concern regarding the figures issued by the INPC and upon which the calculations are made?  If Whitegate are competitive, as the INPC claim, why do they have to be protected by the law which guarantees that one third of what they produce will be bought by oil companies here?  If they are competitive, it is not necessary and if they are not competitive, it is an extra burden on the consumer.</P>

I do not have the figures to which the Deputy referred and I made a fair and reasonable effort to point out that when the figures for January and February become available we will be able to <Col N="1353" /> assess the position, if necessary in public. Whatever the Deputy maintains about disputes and the question of the prices ex-Whitegate, the figures which I stated in relation to 1985 show that, except for four months, the ex-Whitegate petrol was cheaper than the import price and the Deputy must accept that.  In relation to the mandatory regime, I do not see a particular reason, because of the present comfort in relation to oil, for displacing that regime because, as we all found out in the mid-seventies, the oil situation can vary from good to bad and worse very quickly.</P>

      <P>Arising out of consultations which have been taking place with the ESB, I am pleased to be able to announce that electricity prices are being reduced.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 April, industrial consumers will pay on average 6.2 per cent less and commercial consumers 3.9 per cent less.  There is also a ½p per kW hour reduction on the night domestic rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general domestic tariff will be reduced by 5 per cent from September, <Col N="1357" /> at the time when domestic consumption will be increasing into the winter.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that including the reduction which was announced in June 1985 the industrial electricity costs are being reduced very significantly while the domestic reduction in September more than cancels out the last increase in the domestic tariff.  This package is costing the ESB over £30 million in the financial year 1986-87.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this news although it is strange that only four weeks ago the Minister ruled out the possibility of electricity prices coming down because of falling oil prices.  He said that a 2.9 per cent increase was the smallest for quite a long time.  Is this the only decrease envisaged for 1986 or does he intend to review prices again in three months' time because of falling oil prices?</P>

Therefore, I sounded a cautious note which was the correct thing to do.  It is my intention and that of the ESB to review prices throughout the year but much will depend on fluctuations in oil prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that because Smithwicks have opted for coal the prospect of Bord Gáis supplying natural gas to Kilkenny is now much less attractive?  Can he say what is the reason for all this behind-the-doors activity?  With the prospect of 700 customers, <Col N="1359" /> including a large industrial concern, the Minister said that the project would not be viable, so how can he expect anyone to believe that it might be viable now that the largest customer is no longer interested?  The Minister should stop codding the people of Kilkenny and tell them whether they are to have natural gas.  Is he keeping the news for the eve of an election?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The formal negotiations in question took place on 11, 12 and 17 September 1985 following earlier exchanges about the commercial feasibility of the terminal.  Work on drafting the legal agreement with Chevron commenced shortly after my announcement to the House on 5 December 1985 of the elements of the agreed package and is now almost completed.  As soon as final legal clearances have been obtained, the agreement will be signed and $44 million in cash will be paid over to the State.</P>

      <P>It appears that no money has been received by the Exchequer so far in this matter, though in recent times there was a helicopter escapade to west Cork to announce that money would be available and to give money to the local authorities to do various work.  That was in advance of any money being received from the company.  I am glad to hear that the matter has not been finalised because there is a number of companies, some large and some small, who have incurred considerable expense in relation to tendering for the rebuilding of the Whiddy terminal.  Is the Minister aware that Gulf-Chevron are reneging on their responsibilities to those companies who can ill afford to be at such loss?  Is the Minister aware also that Gulf-Chevron have been awarded $114 million compensation in the London High Court in respect of the destruction of the terminal? Since the companies who have tendered have incurred considerable expense, would the Minister take the matter up with Gulf-Chevron with a view to having them meet their obligations in relation not only to the companies I am referring to but to the workers at Whiddy?</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that our offshore licensing terms should be kept under review to ensure that necessary adaptation or adjustment can be made when necessary in the context of the world oil situation.  To that end the clarification statement of April 1985, outlining the manner in which the discretionary powers available to me under the 1975 terms will be applied in the case of marginal fields, was issued in the context of the ongoing monitoring in my Department of the offshore situation.</P>
      <P>I am not at this stage proposing that the terms be changed; but I will continue to monitor the situation closely, taking account of all relevant factors, including the effect of reduced oil prices.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Winter Time Order, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The order complies with the EC Third Council Directive on summer time arrangements concerning the harmonisation <Col N="1463" /> of the summer time period throughout EC member states.  It is the third order of this type.  The previous ones were the Winter Time Order, 1981, and the Winter Time Order, 1982, which the House approved on 10 March 1981 and 23 February 1983 respectively.</P>
    <P>The principal effect of the order is that summer time will begin two weeks later in 1986 and one week later in 1987 and 1988 than prescribed under our primary legislation in this area, that is to say, the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971, (No. 17 of 1971).  A minor consequence of the order will be that the time of change from winter time to summer time and <i>vice versa</i> will be 1 o'clock in the morning Greenwich Mean Time rather than 2 o'clock as provided for in the 1971 Act.</P>
    <P>If the order is approved by both Houses which I earnestly hope it will be, it means that we will have a similar period of summer time in 1986, 1987 and 1988 as we had for the past five years, i.e., from the last Sunday in March to the fourth Sunday in October.  The actual summer time periods will be 30 March 1986 to 26 October 1986; 28 March 1987 to 25 October 1987 and 27 March 1988 to 23 October 1988.  The reasoning behind the efforts at harmonisation of summer time in the EC is that such harmonisation would help the efficiency of transport, communications, commerce and contacts generally between member states.</P>
    <P>Discussions with a view to standardising the summer time provisions in EC member states have been in train for several years. There are various problems, including of course the fact that natural time in this country and in the United Kingdom is substantially different from that in many of the continental member states.  While the Commission would prefer a common date for beginning and ending summer time in all member states, it had not expected the success it has had with harmonisation to date.  The Commission, therefore, is prepared to continue as an experiment for a further three years the same system <Col N="1464" /> which operated in 1983, 1984 and 1985. This, in effect, means that the summer time period in the continental member states should end one month earlier than in Ireland and United Kingdom, i.e., on the last Sunday of September instead of the fourth Sunday in October.</P>
    <P>This is a most favourable arrangement from this country's point of view as we have always favoured as long a summer time period as possible and the public, when consulted about the provisions of the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971, were in favour of having our summer time period synchronised with that of the United Kingdom.  The arrangement also suits the continental member states who have always favoured a shorter summer time period.  I now call on the House to approve the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the various increases in social welfare payments which were announced in the budget.  The Bill also contains provisions for the introduction of the child benefit scheme, for improvements in the family income supplement scheme as well as a number of other changes in social welfare schemes.  Before dealing with the details of the Bill I would like to deal <Col N="1465" /> with three important general aspects of social welfare policy.  These are: the complementary roles of State and community action in caring for the less well off, the forthcoming report from the Commission on Social Welfare and misuse of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The size of the social welfare budget is enormous.  The total number of people and their dependants who receive each week social welfare payments of one kind or another is about 1.3 million or 37 per cent of our total population.  Overall spending this year, taking account of the new rates of payments in the Bill, will amount to almost £2.5 billion of which the Exchequer will contribute £1.6 billion. This overall level of spending is equivalent to about £7 million for each day of the year and it represents the largest single block of current Government expenditure.  Over the past ten years an increasing share of the country's output has been devoted to social welfare services and they now represent almost 15 per cent of gross national product.  These facts clearly illustrate the extent and importance of the services provided to our community by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Social welfare spending has increased to its present level due to a combination of factors including increased numbers of claimants generally, high unemployment and the various improvements made in the schemes over the years.  The overall expenditure may be broken down into five main programmes as follows: 27 per cent for the old, 28 per cent for the unemployed, 14 per cent for the sick, 23 per cent for family income support and 4 per cent for miscellaneous services and benefits.  About 4 per cent of expenditure goes on administration.</P>
    <P>The old age pensioner, the unemployed person, those who are sick, the single parent and her children are entitled to an adequate level of support from the rest of the community.  On the face of it the huge amount of money raised by PRSI contributions and from general taxation would indicate that our society is committed to protecting the weaker sections <Col N="1466" /> of our community.</P>
    <P>There is also, however, another attitude beginning to surface in recent times and that is that people on social welfare payments are doing well and that many are in fact only too glad to be on the system and to avail of the benefits it provides. There is, in my view, a danger here that we would lose sight of the fact that people depending on social welfare payments are in the vast majority of cases genuinely in need and are having considerable difficulties in meeting their responsibilities and commitments.</P>
    <P>Nobody can condone misuse of the system but, at the same time, there is a great danger in making sweeping allegations or moral judgments about various categories of social welfare recipients. We must be prepared to deal with abuse of the system wherever it occurs while maintaining the essential elements which make the system a genuinely caring one for people in different situations of need. Community attitudes to the social welfare system are very important and community involvement in social welfare provision has always been an essential feature of the system.</P>
    <P>Before the social welfare system as we know it today came into being, the traditional bulwark against poverty was the support of the family with each generation accepting responsibility for the elderly and others in need.  This pattern of support through the extended family weakened with the growth in industrialisation and urbanisation, but there is no reason why the underlying principle of mutual support could not be revitalised in these often more demanding times. The State can provide the basic infrastructure of income maintenance services but it is also vital that local communities take a responsibility for people in need and give them the continuing assurance that they are full members of the community.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, many voluntary organisations and local groups doing invaluable work in communities and my Department in the administration of the provision for once-off grants to voluntary organisations since 1983 and more <Col N="1467" /> recently in the preparation for the EC poverty programme have had considerable experience of the valuable contribution made by such groups.  Over the coming years there will be a need for continuing involvement and development of this aspect of social provision and for closer links between the activities of such groups and the statutory social welfare services in order to ensure that there are adequate mechanisms for identifying areas of need and tackling them in an effective way.  This Government have shown a genuine concern to improve the living standards of people on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an increase of 4 per cent in the weekly personal and adult dependent rates of social insurance and social assistance from the third week in July next.  The corresponding weekly rates for the long term unemployed are being increased by a further 1 per cent from the same time.  These increases reflect the continuing commitment of this Government as outlined in the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> to ensure that long term payments are at least maintained in line with inflation and short term unemployment and disability payments in line with take home pay.  But we have gone a step further.  The real value of pensions benefits and allowances has been increased and this will be maintained into 1987.  Since the Government came into office and including the increases in the Bill, short term payments have been increased by 30 per cent compound, long term payments by 33 per cent and the long term unemployed received the highest increase of all, 40 per cent.  In the period mid 1983-87 the increase in the consumer price index is expected to be of the order of some 23 per cent.  Indeed, all the indications are that the level of inflation will be at an historically low level by the end of the year.  It is evident, therefore, that the purchasing power of social welfare recipients has been more than maintained by this Government despite the severe constraints on the public finances generally.</P>
    <P>Because of demographic factors and <Col N="1468" /> our high level of unemployment, expenditure on social welfare will continue to increase inexorably in real terms over the coming years although its rate of growth will fall as inflation and unemployment are contained and reduced.  The difficulties in the public finances and the necessity for economies over the whole area of public expenditure will be severe constraints on efforts to provide additional resources for these services.  The fact that social welfare expenditure is provided to a large extent by the Exchequer &mdash; some £1.6 billion in 1986 &mdash; partly accounts for our high levels of taxation.  Even though the Government have reduced substantially the level of personal taxation in this year's budget it remains by international standards at a high level.  One of the reasons the Government have had to maintain these levels of taxation is to ensure that the financial position of those dependent on social welfare, who are unfortunate enough not to be in any tax bracket, is fully maintained.</P>
    <P>Basic social welfare commitments will continue to be met but there are important questions that need to be resolved. The problem of poverty in our society must be tackled.  It is relevant to consider whether the amalgam of programmes that has evolved down through the years in response to specific needs is still appropriate in present circumstances.  It is clear that we must review all expenditure programmes and concentrate resources where they are most needed.  It was for that reason that the Government decided to establish a commission on social welfare to carry out a fundamental review of and make recommendations on the social welfare code and related social welfare services.  As Deputies will be aware, the commission are due to report shortly and I am looking forward to the opportunity for a constructive debate on this complex area of national importance.</P>
    <P>I would now turn to a topic that has been the subject of much media coverage and speculation in recent weeks and, that is, the question of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.  It is important when discussing this topic that the matter be put into proper perspective and that <Col N="1469" /> we do not fall into the trap of contributing to an anti-welfare mentality.  This is something we must guard against.  I have already given some indication of the size and scale of our social welfare services. The amount of money spent each day is huge and the number of people who benefit is enormous.  There are over 3,500 staff in my Department responsible for the administration of the various schemes and for the delivery of service to the needy.</P>
    <P>Various figures have been bandied about in relation to the extent of fraud and those are pure speculation.  The only factual information which I can give the House is that of the various individual cases which were investigated during 1985 over the Department's services as a whole.  It is estimated that some 4,000 of them involved an element of fraud and that the total amount of overpayments involved in these cases is in the region of £3 million.  Investigations are still under way in many of these cases and a number of people have been or are being prosecuted.</P>
    <P>These are the only factual figures available.  My Department are very conscious of the need to combat fraud in the social welfare system, subject to the resources available and to the need to strike a balance between fraud prevention and making sure that procedures are not such as to cause undue delay in making payment to genuine cases.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to estimate what is the level of fraud at any time and any attempt to do so must be based largely on conjecture. Many social welfare schemes are, of course, open to manipulation and every effort must be made to detect and eradicate fraud where it exists.  This should not, however, lead us to abandon basic elements of the system or to make the system a less caring one for people in genuine need.</P>
    <P>On the unemployment side in 1985 a total of about 2,000 cases of fraud were detected.  The greatest incidence of cases relate to concurrent working and drawing benefit of which there were some 1,400 cases.  There are also cases of persons <Col N="1470" /> found claiming while they are either unavailable for or incapable of work. There were also some cases of personation and cases of claims for allowances to which the claimant was not entitled.  The majority of cases of fraud on the disability benefit scheme relate to concurrent working and claiming.  As regards old age non-contributory pensions, for instance, the bulk of the sums overpaid are due to non-disclosure of means which come to light generally on the death of the pensioner.</P>
    <P>With regard to employers defaulting on PRSI contributions, cases have arisen where considerable arrears of PAYE-PRSI were revealed when a company went into liquidation with perhaps large debts and few assets.  Fundamental trading difficulties and cash flow problems in the business sector cannot be solved by abuse of the social security system.</P>
    <P>Over the years a number of measures to curb misuse have been taken on two broad fronts.  First, changes in the structure of the benefits payable to persons during sickness and unemployment were made which have achieved a more realistic relationship between the level of overall benefit and a person's normal take-home pay.</P>
    <P>The second area relates to administrative measures.  At a general level all officers dealing with claims are trained and encouraged to be vigilant at all times in looking out for fraudulent claims. There are a whole series of checks and balances built into the various administrative procedures to which all claims are subjected to ensure that only valid claims are put into payment.  In addition, an extensive range of administrative measures has also been brought into force or improved over recent years and it is important that these be stated again. These included:</P>
    <P>Control measures at local offices have been tightened up.  The general cadre of the social welfare officers is now 251 officers based at 94 different locations throughout the State.</P>
    <P>The size of my Department's special investigation unit is now 38 officers at 18 centres engaged full time in the <Col N="1471" /> investigation of abuses and irregularities. The main role of the unit is in relation to the abuse of working and `signing-on' and they carry out special investigations in areas where fraud is suspected.  I have arranged to strengthen this unit further by the assignment of an additional six officers to anti-fraud work.</P>
    <P>There is also the development of closer liaison between the National Manpower Service and the local offices of my Department.  The National Manpower Service give priority to the registered unemployed in filling vacancies. This liaison makes it possible to identify persons who are not interested in finding work or who may in fact already have a job.</P>
    <P>Increased numbers of disability benefit claimants are being referred to my Department's panel of medical referees for a second opinion to ensure that only those who are genuinely ill are in fact paid disability benefit.  The panel of medical referees has been recently increased to 25.</P>
    <P>Improved selection procedures have been introduced in the type of cases referred for medical examination to ensure that the appropriate cases are submitted promptly for examination.</P>
    <P>Claimants for disability benefit are also visited in their own home by the Department's sickness visitors and doubtful cases are referred to the panel of medical referees.</P>
    <P>Securing prosecutions against persons who fraudently claim social welfare payments is a very important feature of my Department's drive against abuses of the schemes.  All fraudulent cases coming to light are considered for prosecution where sufficient evidence is available.  A total of 175 prosecutions for irregularities on the unemployment payments side were finalised in 1985 compared to 120 in 1984 and 86 in 1983.</P>
    <P>The Department's powers to prosecute for offences were strengthened and clarified in 1983 following the <Col N="1472" /> advice of the Attorney General in relation to certain defects in the existing legislation.  In addition, penalties for social welfare offences were substantially increased last year.</P>
    <P>Like my predecessor at the Department of Social Welfare, I am very conscious of the need to curb abuse of the social welfare system and I will continue to make every effort to detect and stamp out abuse and fraud.  This is all the more important because of the pressures on the public finances; any leakage from the system no matter how small is a lost opportunity in terms of providing a better service for the disadvantaged in our society.  Thousands of claims by genuine people to the various services provided by my Department are processed each week.  The numbers who attempt to fraud are small; the numbers who actually do so are smaller still.  No matter what action we take we must ensure that we do not cause any undue delay or hardship to the genuine cases.  This is of paramount importance.  We must at all times ensure that proper regard is had to the needs and dignity of the individual claimant and not make the innocent suffer for the sins of the few.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to some of the details in the Bill.  I hope that Deputies will have found the explanatory memorandum, circulated with the Bill, helpful in their consideration of the text.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that there has been an unavoidable delay in the introduction of the provisions for equal treatment for men and women in social security matters.  I am glad to be able to say that agreement has been reached with the staff union in question to implement, on a phased basis from mid-May next, those measures which are not dependent on additional staffing.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for the abolition of reduced rates of benefit at present payable to married women.  Married women will also become entitled to unemployment benefit for the full 390 days under regulations which I will be making separately.  I am also abolishing <Col N="1473" /> the reduced rates of benefit that are payable to persons under 18 years of age. Hitherto the reduced rates applied to married women and also to persons aged under 18.  In view of the fact that persons become employed contributors at age 16 and are liable for the same rates of social insurance contributions as other contributors I consider that they should also be eligible for the same level of benefits when sick or unemployed and I am providing accordingly in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of implementing the remaining equal treatment measures which were provided for in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985 is dependent on additional staff being allocated, the devising of new work procedures and the training of staff in those procedures.  I am making every effort to resolve these problems so that a date can be fixed for implementing the remaining phases.</P>
    <P>General increases in social insurance and occupational injuries benefits are provided for in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A contributory old age pensioner under 80 years of age will receive an additional £2.05 a week from 18 July bringing his rate of payment to £53.45 a week.  If he is married with a wife under age 66 he will get a total increase of £3.35 bringing the pension to £87.55 a week. A married couple both over pensionable age will get £93.35 compared to £89.75 at present.  Higher increases are paid for pensioners over 80.  Additional payments are also made for persons living alone.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of widow's contributory pension is being increased by £1.85 a week to £48.10.  Widows over 66 and over 80 receive higher payments.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of invalidity pension goes up from £45.30 to £47.10 for a person under pensionable age and a married couple will receive £77.70, an increase of £3.</P>
    <P>A person in receipt of disability or unemployment benefit will have a new personal rate of £41.10 a week, an increase of £1.60.  Deputies will be aware that this new rate was shown incorrectly in the first version of the explanatory memorandum on the Bill.  Where the recipient is married the increase will be <Col N="1474" /> £2.60 a week.  Maternity allowance is also being increased to £41.10.</P>
    <P>The new rates of social assistance payments are provided for in section 3.  The maximum personal rate of non-contributory old age pension for a pensioner under 80 years of age goes from £44 a week at present to £45.75 a week.  It will go up from £47.20 to £49.10 for persons aged 80 or over.  The overall maximum payment for a pensioner under 80 with a dependent spouse under 66 will increase by £2.65 to £68.75.  The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is being raised to £25.60 per week.</P>
    <P>Widows receiving non-contributory widow's pensions at the present rate of £43.15 will get an increase of £1.75 a week.  Similar increases will apply to deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>Those receiving short-duration unemployment assistance in urban areas will get an increase of £1.30 a week in their maximum personal rate.  In rural areas the increase will be £1.25 a week.  A married applicant in an urban area will get an increase of £2.25 a week in the present rate of £56.40.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployment assistance for long-duration recipients of unemployment assistance are higher.  For example, a married man in an urban area will get £63.15 which is £4.50 more than the corresponding short-duration rate.</P>
    <P>The maximum rate of supplementary welfare allowance for a married couple goes from £54.80 to £56.95.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the introduction of the new monthly child benefit scheme from April 1986.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the scheme will be to provide as much cash support to mothers as possible in one single payment.  However, it will not be possible for administrative and technical reasons to introduce, as originally intended, a fully taxable scheme in 1986.  As a first step, therefore, the Government have decided to introduce a non-taxable scheme of child benefit with effect from April 1986.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme a child benefit of <Col N="1475" /> £15.05 per month will be paid for each of the first five children.  This rate will be increased to £21.75 per month for each subsequent child.  These payments will not be taxable.  This represents an increase of £3 per month per child over the existing rates of payment under the children's allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>The new scheme replaces the present children's allowance scheme and also involves the abolition of the child tax allowance of £100 per child under the income tax code.  Furthermore child dependant increases for social welfare recipients will remain at their present levels.  The new scheme, therefore, involves a redirection of child support.  Families paying tax at the higher rates will suffer some net loss arising from the abolition of child tax allowances but the intention of the scheme is to achieve a redistribution of resources in the direction of families most in need.  Three-quarters of all families in the State will be at least as well off under the new arrangement as under the existing schemes and many thousands, including families depending on social welfare payments, will in fact be better off.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for improvements in the family income supplement scheme. The rate of the supplement is being increased from 25 per cent to one third of the difference between gross family income and a prescribed upper limit.  The income limits up to which family income supplement is payable and the maximum amounts of supplement payable are also being increased.  The changes in the income limits and maximum amounts follow from the improvements in the personal income taxation announced in the budget and from increases in the rates of short term social insurance benefits provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The levels of weekly income up to which a supplement is payable will be scaled up from £100 for a family with one child by £20 per week for each additional child, up to and including the fifth child. The income levels at which the maximum supplement is payable are also being <Col N="1476" /> adjusted, for example, from £68 to £70 per week for a one-child family.</P>
    <P>The maximum weekly amount of supplement payable to families with one child will be increased, by £2.00 from £8 to £10.  For larger families the maximum amount of supplement payable for each additional child up to and including the fifth child is being increased from £2.50 to £4 per week.  These changes will take effect from 10 April 1986.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for an increase from £49 to £58 in the earnings disregard, or &ldquo;floor&rdquo;, for pay-related benefit purposes.  This change will affect new claims only from the beginning of April next where entitlement to pay-related benefit is involved.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the pay-related benefit scheme in April 1974, a proportion of reckonable earnings has always been disregarded in calculating the amount of pay-related benefit payable in addition to disability, unemployment, maternity and injury benefit.  In 1974, this disregard or floor was £14, or twice the prevailing rate of flat-rate benefit.  The floor was not increased until 1981, even though the level of flat rate benefit rose significantly during that time.</P>
    <P>The latest increase in the floor continues the policy that has been adopted in recent years of progressively raising its level.  However, if the floor had been maintained at the same level in relation to the flat rate benefit as it was in April 1974, it would now be about £84 instead of £58 proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the earnings ceiling for PRSI contribution purposes be raised from £13,800 to £14,700 with effect from 6 April 1986.  For the fourth successive year there is no increase in the actual rates of social insurance contributions. Section 7 provides that the rate of contribution to the occupational injuries fund payable by employers be increased from 0.4 per cent to 0.43 per cent.</P>
    <P>There will also be an increase of 0.1 per cent in employers contributions to the Department of Labour's Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.  As a result of both of these changes, the standard rate of employers PRSI contributions <Col N="1477" /> goes up from 12.20 per cent to 12.33 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is no increase in the employees social insurance contribution.  However there will be a reduction of 1 per cent in the total PRSI contribution payable by employees as a result of the abolition of the income levy as announced in the Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>Section 8 makes provision for the PRSI exemption scheme for employers announced by the Taoiseach last October. Under this scheme employers in the private sector who take on additional employees on a full time basis between 23 October 1985 and 31 March 1986, resulting in a net increase in their workforce, will be exempt from their portion of the PRSI contribution for those employees for each week in the income tax year 1986-87 in which the increase in the workforce is maintained.</P>
    <P>Employers participating in the scheme will also be exempt from the redundancy contribution and, where applicable, the health contribution and the youth employment levy and this is provided for in section 8.</P>
    <P>To give further encouragement to employers to participate in the scheme the Government have decided, as was announced last week, to relax some of the conditions of the scheme.  Up to now employers who had received assistance by way of State grants in the past 12 months were not eligible.  This condition no longer applies.  Also it was a condition that an employee recruited under the scheme should be on the live register for six months.  This has now been reduced to 13 weeks.  Employers have an opportunity between now and the end of the month to participate in the scheme and avail of the exemption.</P>
    <P>An employer participating under the scheme will benefit to the extent of about £962 for the year for each additional employee taken on, assuming the employee is earning £150 a week.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 provide for changes in the disability benefit scheme.  Section 9 increases the period of disqualification for disability benefit and injury benefit from six weeks to nine weeks where a <Col N="1478" /> person fails to turn up for a medical examination by one of the Department's medical referees or where the person has become incapable of work through his own misconduct.  In 1985, over 75,000 disability benefit claimants were called for medical examination: 6,000 people did not attend for examination and were disqualified for the six week period allowed under present legislation. Because of the extent of non-attendance the Government considered that the penalty for such non-attendance should be increased.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that disability benefit will not be paid while a claimant is on paid holiday leave from his employment. There is some evidence that certain persons claim disability benefit as a matter of course while on paid holiday leave and this amounts to misuse of the disability benefit scheme.  This measure is designed to end this potential misuse.</P>
    <P>Section 11 rationalises the method of calculating entitlements under the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment.  The section provides that entitlement will be calculated as 70 per cent of a woman's earnings in the relevant tax year or 70 per cent of a specified weekly amount instead of a combination of flat rate, pay-related and additional pay-related benefit as at present.  This is a technical measure and there will be no change in the amount of benefit payable.</P>
    <P>Sections 12, 13, 14, 21 and 23 provide for changes to the occupational injuries benefit scheme.  Section 12 extends entitlement to benefit to persons travelling to and from work subject to such circumstances as may be prescribed by regulations. Sections 13 and 14 provide that injury benefit will be paid from the first day of incapacity for work where the incapacity lasts for more than three days. I consider this to be more equitable than the present arrangement where the incapacity must last for 12 days before payment can be made from the first day. Section 13 also provides that injury benefit will not be paid while a person is on paid holiday leave from his employment <Col N="1479" />&mdash; this is in line with the amendment to the disability benefit scheme in section 10.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that I am abolishing the reduced rates of disability, unemployment and injury benefit payable to persons under 18 years of age. Section 21 abolishes the reduced rate of disablement benefit for persons who are under 18 years.  In future persons under 18 years of age will receive the same rate of benefit as all other persons.</P>
    <P>Section 23 removes the restriction on a claimant appealing against a provisional assessment of disablement within two years of he initial assessment.  It also repeals the provision whereby a person who is receiving disablement benefit is assessed as being 100 per cent disabled while he is in hospital.  At present a person who is assessed at less than 100 per cent disablement and is hospitalised receives an increase to give him the full rate of benefit.  I consider that this arrangement can no longer be justified and propose that the person continue to receive the same rate as prior to hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>The provision whereby payments of injury benefit or disablement benefit including any increases are limited to the amount of the beneficiary's earnings at the time of the accident is also being repealed.  It is considered that this limit is no longer necessary given the fact that payments of injury benefit are subjected to a pay-related benefit &ldquo;wage stop&rdquo; in any event.</P>
    <P>Section 15 increases the fines for offences involving the obstruction of an inspector of the Department in the exercise of his duties prescribed in section 114 (4) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  At present a maximum fine of £500 or 12 months' imprisonment or both can be imposed on summary conviction and a maximum fine of £2,000 or up to two years' imprisonment on conviction on indictment under this section.  This section increases the maximum fines to £1,000 and £3,000 respectively and brings them into line with other penalties under <Col N="1480" /> the Social Welfare Acts which were increased last year.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that the full cost of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, including administration, will be borne by the Exchequer by way of the Social Welfare Vote on and from 1 January 1986.  The present arrangements for financing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme involve a sharing of the cost between the Exchequer and the local authorities.  This system has not worked satisfactorily and the Government have decided that in future the full cost will be borne by the Exchequer.  This represents a major improvement in the situation for the health boards who administer the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 16 extends the authority of social welfare officers to inspect the premises of self-employed persons on the same basis as for employers for the purposes of combating abuse.  The section extends the powers given in last year's Act to inspect premises where a social welfare officer has reasonable grounds for believing that persons are employed or that there are documents relating to employment being kept.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that where unemployed persons, who have participated in certain employment-training schemes sponsored by the Department of Labour for up to one year's duration, resume claiming unemployment benefit the two periods of unemployment will be regarded as one for the purpose of subsequent entitlement to benefit.  At present attendance at a training course of over 13 weeks breaks the link with the pre-course claim for benefit.  Section 19 also provides that to be eligible to receive unemployment benefit a person must not only be available for employment but also be genuinely seeking employment.  This will bring the condition for receipt of unemployment benefit into line with the corresponding condition for the receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Section 20 is designed to overcome some difficulties in relation to the authorisation of legal proceedings.  It provides for the acceptance in court of a certificate <Col N="1481" /> of authorisation of legal proceedings in relation to social welfare offences, without proof of the person purporting to sign the certificate, unless this is challenged.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for a technical amendment to section 3 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 to facilitate work on the consolidation of the social welfare regulations which is at present in progress.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to a number of other developments which do not require legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced in his budget speech that there would be a social welfare amnesty from prosecutions for those who come forward within six months admitting to existing or earlier irregularities or fraud in relation to the social welfare system.  I have also arranged that, in addition to new cases, the amnesty will normally apply to cases already under investigation where fresh admissions or offers of repayment are made by clients.  However, in all cases there will be no waiver of the requirement to repay any money obtained over and above legitimate entitlements.  Persons who wish to avail of the amnesty must come forward before 29 July next and the arrangements for doing so have been set out recently in advertisements in the national newspapers.</P>
    <P>Since 1983 £1.68 million has been provided for various voluntary organisations who do invaluable work in the social services area.  The grants are mainly for once-off projects and are payable in addition to any grants made by health boards. This year an increased sum of £750,000 is being made available.  An advertisement has been placed in the national press inviting interested organisations to complete an application form and submit it to my Department before 11 April 1986. The health boards will then be consulted and the grants will be paid to the approved bodies as soon as possible afterwards.</P>
    <P>Some 161 organisations benefited from grants under this heading in 1985.  The following is a cross-section of the type of work which these agencies carry out:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" />&mdash;day care centres for the old</P>
    <P>&mdash;meals on wheels</P>
    <P>&mdash;services for the physically handicapped</P>
    <P>&mdash;youth club projects</P>
    <P>&mdash;day care centres for the homeless</P>
    <P>&mdash;help for unmarried mothers.</P>
    <P>I am glad that I was able to provide further financial assistance this year for the work carried out by the various organisations who provide such a variety of social services on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, the Combat Poverty Agency Bill, 1985 is currently before the House.  The new agency will be set up as soon as possible after the legislation is passed.  A sum of £1 million is provided in 1986 for the agency and the EC poverty programmes.</P>
    <P>Social welfare is a vast and complex area and its impact on the daily lives of the community may well have been underestimated in the past.  I certainly do not under-estimate my job of re-shaping social welfare policy to meet the country's needs as we approach the end of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>What sort of reaction can we expect to the report of the Commission on Social Welfare?  Policy choices made for social welfare are important choices for society. To make these choices is to exercise power and decide on the distribution of scarce resources &mdash; that is the essence of politics.  My own view is that there has not been enough constructive and informed politics in relation to social welfare.  No public expenditure programme has an absolute and unconditional claim on any particular proportion or amount of public resources and none has, or ought to have, an absolute immunity to change as economic and social conditions create the need for change.</P>
    <P>To plead for a politics of social welfare more sensitive to differences of interest and opinion and more informed by debate is not to argue for any particular outcome, but the debate must begin.  I believe the priority must be to secure a greater degree of equity in the distribution of the resources at our disposal.  This <Col N="1483" /> Bill is further tangible evidence of this Government's commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened intently to the Minister presenting in a diplomatic and able way what must have been for her a very difficult presentation, and I recognise that she had to put as good a face as she could on what she had to offer.  I commend her for the able way in which she did that.  However, we must recognise that this Government have now been in office for three years and some four months and they have had an opportunity to produce their fourth Social Welfare Bill to the present Dáil and their record in relation to social welfare payments and increases over this period of three years and some three or four months has been quite appalling compared with what had been the record in the past.  I do not think there can be any doubt that the present Coalition Government's record is the worst that could ever be recorded in the history of this State in relation to social welfare improvements and payments.  They are even worse than those of previous Coalition Governments which, God knows, were bad enough.  The Minister did her best to put a good face on and to dress up the little she had to offer.  To some extent she extolled and congratulated the Government on their achievements of the last three years and four months in relation to the social welfare payments. The last three Social Welfare Bills caused great difficulty, but this is the worst.  We have had to listen to the pious platitudes of Government members regarding their intentions to keep increases in line with the consumer price index and inflation. We and everybody else now know that despite what the present Minister, her predecessor and Government spokesmen have said, the social welfare increases have not kept in line with inflation; they have fallen far short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect is being forgotten, <Col N="1484" /> which is that each year since the Government took office unfortunate social welfare recipients have had to wait longer for the increases to be implemented.  The increases announced in the budget used to be implementable from April but the Government started the trend of delaying payment.  In 1983 the increases were operative from the end of June; in 1984, from the first week in July; last year, from the second week in July and this year it is intended that they be operative from the third week in July.  The Government will not have sufficient time to do so, but if they were to keep on going in that way payment would be in December of the budget year or even the very last day of that year.</P>
    <P>A penny-pinching philosophy is being adopted by the Government who, if they are not masters of too much, are certainly masters of the doctrine of fiscal rectitude. The Minister, Deputy Dukes, on budget day gave us details of the increases for this year, but I had hoped that today the Minister might have given us some glimmer of hope for the future.  I listened assiduously but did not see much hope of any special improved benefits for social welfare recipients for the future.  We have lived through three years and three months of a Government who are apparently indifferent to everything but the implementation of miserly economic scroogery.  That is what they are experts at practising and they have become quite adept in this respect in relation to their treatment of all social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister adverted to the fact that there were misconceptions abroad.  However, many of these emanated from views expressed, both publicly and privately, by members of her own party, that social welfare recipients were ripping off the State and were better off receiving benefits than they would be if they were working.  I respect what the Minister has said today and am glad that she has put it on record.  It would be unfortunate should that type of thinking become widespread.  Those on the old age pension are entitled to it because they are over age; widows are entitled to their <Col N="1485" /> widow's pension because of their widowhood; the disabled are entitled to the disability benefit because of their disability; those receiving unemployment payments are entitled to them because they are unemployed.  Certainly those who are sick, unemployed or widows would prefer not to have to receive these allowances. They would prefer to be financed from the usual sources.</P>
    <P>The Government appear to have an obsession about badly treating the most vulnerable and the least well-off sections of our community.  Again this year they have treated them with abject disdain and inhumanity.  I had hoped, as no doubt the greater public outside also had, that at some stage the penny might drop and that the Government might realise that the direction in which they were going was the wrong direction.  I had hoped that some inspiration would come to them to improve the policies under which they are operating, but there is no indication as yet that they are getting any such inspiration.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the old, the sick and the unemployed &mdash; and particularly poor families &mdash; are being treated as social outcasts.  That has not happened just this year.  It happened last year and the previous two years.  The actions of the Government towards the most deprived section of our community cry out for vengeance from the public.  One need only travel in trains or take a taxi, as Deputy Reynolds does now and again, or go into any public house.  The public are just waiting to lay their hands on the Government and deal with them effectively in the appropriate fashion through the ballot box.</P>
    <P>The recently deposed Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, in his Financial Statement to this House on 29 January 1986 had once again the appalling audacity to pretend that despite the difficult economic background, as he described it, it remained the primary aim of that Government that transfers to the less well-off should keep pace with the cost of living.  He said that they had achieved <Col N="1486" /> that aim and that each of the welfare increases given in the first three budgets of that Government had exceeded the following year's cost of living.  That is not so.  This was a misrepresentation of the facts.  The Government, the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement and spokespeople for the Government conveniently omitted to inform the public that the increases granted in those years since they came to office had been operative for only nine months of those years up to now and this year would be operative for approximately eight months of the year.  This is a seriously deceptive and blatantly dishonest type of politics, trying to mislead, and should be deprecated.</P>
    <P>Let us take for example this year's increases which will be operative from the third week of July.  There will be an apparent increase of 4 per cent.  Those on long term unemployment will get an apparent increase of 5 per cent for eight months of the year.  One can compute the costs which these people have been bearing since the budget.  The projected inflation rate for the year will be something in the region of 4.5 per cent.  The real increase for social welfare recipients for the eight months period would be of the order of 2.7 per cent instead of 4 per cent.  For the long term unemployed, the increase will be not 5 per cent but in the region of 3.4 per cent, lower than the inflation rate.  What does this mean?  It means that the increased costs which came into effect on budget day &mdash; increased VAT, increased excise duties and so on &mdash; are costing social welfare recipients more.  The net result of the budgetary policy is that all the people, particularly those on social welfare, will have less money in their pockets this year than they had last year.  That is the stark reality.  That is what counts at the end of the day.  No matter how this or any other Minister tries to dress up the story, the stark facts are that people in receipt of these payments will have less disposable money this year than they had last year, and last year they had less than the year before.  The continuing saga of suffering goes on.  There is no point in Ministers <Col N="1487" /> pretending that the increases are matching inflation because they are not.</P>
    <P>Many social welfare recipients live in abject poverty.  They know, and we know, that this Government have cruelly, sadly, mediciously and vicioulsy attacked the lower sections of the community in the so-called interests of fiscal rectitude.  They have shown contempt and disdain for the old, the sick, the widows and the unemployed.  The unemployed are being treated as if they were an encumbrance on the State.  Many people are saying that the level of unemployment means that there is an increased burden on the State.  We are getting a little tired of the Minister for Finance and various Government spokesmen talking about the huge cost of the social welfare bill and pointing out that it costs almost £2.5 billion a year.  A major cost factor in that figure is the growing cost of unemployment which is the result of the Government's failed economic policy.  The Government have created this problem and have done nothing to solve it.  Every 1,000 people they have put on the unemployed queue cost the State £2.7 million per annum.  The Government cannot blame the unemployed for that.  They cannot blame Fianna Fáil for it, nor can they blame the oil crises, which used to be a great excuse. If something cannot be sorted out in the Department of Social Welfare, we are told the blame lies with the social welfare commission, they are looking into it, but that is like looking into an empty hole because no information is ever produced.</P>
    <P>Despite all these increased costs, there is not justification for the Government cutting back on social welfare payments to the extent they have done.  The increases they have given are derisory. A married couple with two children in receipt of disability or unemployment benefit will get an increase of £2.60 per week; an old age pensioner will get an increase of £2.05 per week; a person on invalidity pension will get an increase of £1.80 per week and a widow will get an increase of £1.85.  These increases are an insult to social welfare recipients in view <Col N="1488" /> of the huge increased costs which have been imposed on them in the interim.</P>
    <P>This Government are not conscious of the needs of the people.  Do the Government realise that these unfortunate families will have less money to meet essential needs this year than they had last year? Yet Government members are congratulating themselves on what they have achieved and how they have matched inflation.  This is ridiculous.  Compare what has been done over the last three years and four months by this Government in relation to social welfare payments and increases, with what successive Fianna Fáil Governments did. We recognised the needs of social welfare recipients.  This Government's record is appalling, particularly when compared with Fianna Fáil's record.  In 1983, this Government gave an increase of 12 per cent in long term payments, and a 10 per cent increase in short term payments, operative from the end of June.  In 1984 they gave an 8 per cent increase to those on long term assistance only and all other benefits were increased by 7 per cent, payable from the first week in July.  Last year the increase was down to 6½ per cent for long term payments and 6 per cent for short term payments, payable from 11 July.  This year a 5 per cent increase was granted to those on long term unemployment assistance and 4 per cent for all other social welfare recipients, payable from the third week in July.</P>
    <P>In 1980 Fianna Fáil granted a 25 per cent increase in long term benefits and a 20 per cent increase in short term payments, payable from April.  In 1981 Fianna Fáil granted a 25 per cent increase in long term payments and a 20 per cent increase in short term payments, payable in April.  In 1982 Fianna Fáil granted an across the board increase of 25 per cent to all social welfare recipients, payable in April.  It is obvious that this Government's performance in this area pales when compared with the achievements of Fianna Fáil of which we are justly proud and which we hope to reimplement at the earliest possible opportunity. We want to ensure that the poor, the sick, the old and the unemployed have a <Col N="1489" /> decent living, that they will be able to buy essentials, and that they will not have to survive in abject poverty any longer.</P>
    <P>I have some personal sympathy for the new Minister for Social Welfare.  I recognise that she has inherited an almost impossible position.  The record of her Department over the last three years has reached the lowest level ever in terms of financial support for the most deprived sections of the community.  Her predecessor did not cover himself with any glory.  The Minister's predecessor achieved absolute notoriety in ensuring that the less privileged got the worst possible deal.  Unfortunately, he seemed to take a sort of sadistic pleasure in getting this message through to the House and the people.  It appeared almost as if he took personal gratification out of imposing cuts and reductions and the policies of fiscal rectitude on the people.</P>
    <P>I am not prone to making personal comments about members of any party but he had developed a type of arrogance particularly in regard to any cruel impositions he happened to be effecting.  He appeared to enjoy doing so.  Almost a years ago I felt it was only right and proper that he should be admonished in this House.  At that time I told him that if a contest was held to find the most hated man in the country he would easily win. I have no doubt that, by the time he left that office, he would have won that contest even more easily.  However, it would be much too simplistic of me to assume that all of these mistaken policies and decisions were his only.  There must have been collective Cabinet responsibility for major failures and the reduced payments that have been made over the past three years and four months.  There can be little doubt that every member of the Government stands culpable.</P>
    <P>This year for the first time under the provisions of this Bill there will be no percentage increases given to child dependants of social welfare recipients. Those allowances will remain the same. This is a classic example of how little this Government care about the family as a unit, the rights of children to proper <Col N="1490" /> financial support for their maintenance. Indeed, it was ironic that on 29 January last when our spokesman on Finance drew attention to the fact that child dependants were not getting the 4 per cent or 5 per cent increase, the Taoiseach did not even know that that was so and stated that they were receiving a quarter increase which, of course, was not true. That clearly shows that the Taoiseach did not even know the minute details of the budget presented by the Minister for Finance. The decision to exclude child dependants from welfare increases is most unjust and is something for which this Government will pay dearly at the ballot box whenever the occasion next arises.</P>
    <P>It is becoming daily clearer that this Government are engaging in what might be described as an anti-family programme.  While failing to give any percentage increases to child dependants of social welfare recipients, there was much fanfare about the introduction of the so-called child benefit scheme.  One might well examine what they have achieved to date.  For example, the new monthly child benefit scheme will mean a payment of £15.05 per child per month for each of the first five children, compared with the existing children's allowance rate of £12.05 per child per month, an increase of £3 per child per month or a miserly 75p per child per week.  One must remember what this Government have done in relation to child support over the past three years.</P>
    <P>The children's allowance scheme constituted the traditional method of providing family income support for children, first introduced in 1944 in support of the larger families and applied initially only where there were three or more children in a family.  From 1963 onwards the provisions of that scheme were extended to cover all children up to 16 years of age and 18 years of age where such children were engaged in full time education or were incapacitated.  That traditional family income supplement, in most cases, was used assiduously and conscientiously by the mothers of families to supplement <Col N="1491" /> essential family needs.  On other occasions it provided the mother with a reservoir from which she could effect payments at crucial times.  We have now almost 500,000 families who benefit under the scheme; the figure would be 470,000 or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>Last year this Government granted no increase at all in children's allowances. In 1984 they gave a miserly 7 per cent from 7 August that year, with no increase at all having been given in the year 1983. This demonstrates this Government's appalling disregard for families' financial needs.  In the entire three years of their tenure of office they granted one increase of 7 per cent, implemented from 7 August 1984 which, in real terms, amounted to 4 per cent only in that year.  Therefore, effectively, since they assumed office in December 1982 this Government have increased children's allowances by a mere 4 per cent and this year, in implementing the child benefit scheme, they are granting a miserly increase of 75p per child per week.  I have no doubt that the almost 500,000 families entitled to children's allowances, or who will benefit from the new child benefit scheme, know that this Government have failed them miserably.</P>
    <P>In the National Economic and Social Council pamphlet on economic and social policies assessment dated January 1985 it was clearly stated that the child benefit scheme was to be increased to £30 per child per month compared with the existing rate of £12.05 per child per month. We are all aware that the Government granted a miserable increase, from £12.05 to £15.05, or £15 short of what was envisaged by the NESC as the minimum amount necessary for proper family support. I request the Minister to have another look at the Government's proposal in regard to that scheme.  She should try to restore some credibility to the Government by improving it.  If the Government are not worried about their own credibility they should consider and respect the rightful claims of dependent children.  I hope the Minister will review that scheme.</P>
    <P>The Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Kevin <Col N="1492" /> McNamara, when Bishop of Kerry, was clearly conscious of the value to the family unit in financial terms of proper children's allowance payments.  In a Lenten Pastoral in 1984, entitled, The Christian Family, according to the issue of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 29 March 1984, he:</P>
    <P>.... had criticised the meagre children's allowances paid out by successive Governments.  &ldquo;For a country which rightly prides itself on its strong family traditions it is puzzling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how we should accept payments which compare very unfavourably with European rates.&rdquo;&ldquo;In the last few years, &ldquo;the Bishop stated,&rdquo; families had become increasingly beset by economic difficulties arising from unemployment and increasing living costs.&rdquo;&ldquo;Many families were&rdquo; he stated, &ldquo;under pressure to keep a home, dress and educate children on low wages and social welfare benefits.  There were pressures on wives to leave home against their will to supplement the family income.</P>
    <P>The remedy here must surely be greater financial support for families from the State and voluntary bodies, he suggested.  Dr. McNamara stated that if children's allowances could not be raised for all social categories then there should be at least an increase for families on social welfare payments or who are otherwise hard-pressed.</P>
    <P>Dr. McNamara as a Church leader is conscious of the demands being imposed on families and how families are constrained because of financial difficulties from getting even the essentials of life.  In 1984 he advised the Government as to what they should do and I agree with that advice but the Government did not take any notice of him.  They have not taken any notice of any advice I gave them.  For some reason or other the Government appear loath to accept any advice from the Church.  It appears that the Church is in the Government's black book.</P>
    <P>Dr. McNamara's Lenten Pastoral put the issue of children's allowances in its proper perspective.  A miserly increase of 75p per child per month is not adequate <Col N="1493" /> to compensate for the increase in the cost of living in this day and age particularly when the child dependant allowance increases will not be granted this year. That was the most appalling and atrocious decision made by the Government since they commenced their inglorious reign of office.  We must add to that the fact that the £100 child tax allowance has been dropped.  Those on the lowest tier of the PAYE bracket will have to pay £35 per child as a result in extra taxation.  The amount of compensation to be paid by the Government will be £36 per child per year.  The injustice of that move speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>In the budget, and the Bill before us, the Government have attempted to dress up and doctor the family income supplement scheme.  Originally that scheme was sold as a masterly stroke to combat poverty and help poor people in difficult economic times.  It is no harm to reflect on the history of that scheme.  In October 1984 the two elements in the Coalition, Fine Gael and Labour were struggling and fighting among themselves.  At that time the family income supplement scheme was announced and it was estimated that up to 35,000 families would benefit from it.  There was a lot of talk about 35,000 families rushing to take up this scheme and how it would be back dated for two months.  That was done to accomodate some of the reluctant elements in the Labour Party who were finding the 50 per cent reduction of the food subsidies almost unpalatable.  Poor Deputy Bell from Louth got into convulsions about the drop in the food subsidies. He almost became applectic about the matter but the Government came to his rescue.  Poor Deputy Bell had a very easy political conscience and it was not difficult to satisfy it because when he was told that this marvellous scheme was to be back dated to 1 September he popped into line and said: &ldquo;Yes sir, we will keep going with you because you are doing a fine job in Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The famous family income supplement was as abject a failure as the Government have been.  It was predicted that 35,000 families would benefit, but for <Col N="1494" /> some reason or other the public did not avail of it.  Perhaps the scheme was not attractive &mdash; God knows it was advertised enough &mdash; or perhaps there were so many restrictions and conditions attached to it that it was almost impossible to avail of it.  Only 5,000 families have benefited by this scheme, which is a far cry from the 35,000 who were supposed to avail of it. The families who availed of the scheme are receiving on average £7 per week per family.  The suggested improvements intended to make the scheme more attractive will not have any major impact.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase in the family income supplement for a family with two eligible children would be £3.50 per week, which is insufficient at present when costs are so high.  I do not believe that there will be a massive influx of applicants wishing to join the scheme having regard to the miserly increase. When the scheme was first introduced it was supposed to cushion the poor from the effects of the removal of subsidies on food in 1984.  We should remember that the estimated savings on milk and butter in 1985 from doing away with 50 per cent of the subsidies was £24 million.  The estimated saving on having the subsidies on bread reduced in 1985 was £20.4 million, a total of £44.5 million.  Although the Government made such a big saving they paid out approximately £11 million on the family income supplement, which was supposed to compensate for the removal of subsidies and to benefit poorer families who were most affected.</P>
    <P>We should reflect on what the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Desmond, said in relation to the family income supplement when he introduced it in his typical flamboyant fashion.  I wish to quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 12 September 1984.  Under the heading &ldquo;Backdating of family supplement welcomed&rdquo; it stated:</P>
    <P>The low-income families eligible for the family-income supplement scheme, who are caught in what the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Mr. Desmond, has described as the &ldquo;wage poverty trap&rdquo;, will get <Col N="1495" /> between £10 and £120 of an unexpected bonus in back money because of the Government's decision...</P>
    <P>Mr. Liam Skelly, the Fine Gael TD for the sprawling constituency of Dublin West, which has about 120,000 people, ranging from the very rich to the very poor, regularly meets the families who will benefit from the supplement at his clinics...</P>
    <P>Mr. Skelly, a strong critic of some Government policies, said last night that the earlier introduction of the supplement will help alleviate the distress caused by the reduction in food subsidies. &ldquo;But a lot of unnecessary pain could have been avoided for these families if both decisions were made at the same time,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>The article went on to say that the scheme would benefit 35,000 families and would cost about £13 million.  It also said that when the back money was paid families would benefit up to £15 weekly, depending on the size of their income and the number of children they had.  This is a classic example of how the Government attempted to parade their wears in a shameful fashion, attempting to pretend to be doing what they were not doing, attempted to parade their wares in a what they were not providing and, as I said earlier, making much ado about nothing.</P>
    <P>I note that section 2 makes provision for the abolition under the equal treatment legislation of the reduced rates of benefit which are at present payable to married women.  I welcome this belated attempt to implement the European equality directive.  Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome clearly states that equal pay means not only equal wages or salaries but also equality for any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, which the worker receives directly or indirectly in respect of his or her employment. In December 1978 the Council of Ministers adopted the directive ordering the gradual application of equal treatment for men and women in social security.  This legislation for the <Col N="1496" /> implementation of the equality directive passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess, but this is the first indication that any attemp is being made to implement it, despite pleas from myself as spokesman on Social Welfare for Fianna Fáil and the various organisations that represent the interests of women who have been and are being cruelly discriminated against.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Government are dragging their heels on the implementation of the directive.  We did not get a firm commitment from the Minister about when it would be introduced in its entirety, because the Bill is only a small part of the equality directive.  There is much more to it than the abolition of reduced rates of benefit for married women.  It also means equality in every way and relates not just to payments but to the duration for which eligibility may be claimed.  It also makes provision for the availability of unemployment assistance for married women.</P>
    <P>I entreat the Minister and her Department to wake up and to try to implement this legislation.  I cannot help but wonder if the delay is because the Minister of the day refused to accept logical amendments which I put down on behalf of Fianna Fáil to try to ensure that no hardship would be suffered by any family receiving social welfare payments as a result of the implementation of the directive.  I put forward those amendments conscientiously and conscious of the fact that halving the dependency rate for children could in some cases mean a loss of £40 to £50 per week for the families concerned.  Unfortunately, the then Minister was intransigent in his views but that was not unusual for him.</P>
    <P>I am wondering whether it is because of that intransigence and because of the losses that some families might suffer that the Government are failing now to introduce the scheme in its entirety.  I should hope that that is not the case for the sake of women who suffered continuing loss. I should like to hear whether the Department will consider making retrospective payments to women who have been receiving the lower payments since <Col N="1497" /> the passing of the Act or will the increases apply only from mid-May, 1986?  It is unfair not to make the payments retrospective so I urge the Minister to consider this aspect with a view to making the payments retrospective.</P>
    <P>In the budget statement, the then Minister for Finance announced that an extra £9.2 million would be made available for unemployment payments for the current year.  This was to be in addition to the abridged Estimates published in December 1985.  It is questionable whether this amount would be adequate.  In December last an extra £40 million was voted in panic fashion by way of a Supplementary Estimate to make provision for the unemployment payments that had not been projected by the Government in last year's budget.  Many of us pointed out then that those projections were wrong but, either deliberately or otherwise, or because of some attempt to fiddle the figures in an effort to pretend that unemployment payments would be lower than the actual figures, the Government persisted with their projections. Taking present trends into account it is very likely that an additional £9.2 million will not be adequate by way of a supplement to the provisions for unemployment payments this year.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has got out of control cruelly as a result of the Government's failed economic policies and because of their failure to create a climate that would be conducive to working and to the creation of work.  A total lack of confidence on the part of investors both at home and abroad is clearly evident and for that reason, and that alone, there are 250,000 people out of work.  Even that unprecedented high figure does not give the real picture because if we add to it the 45,000 people who are engaged in various temporary employment schemes and also the 35,000 who emigrated last year, we find an appalling record of more than 300,000 people not being able to find work.</P>
    <P>This year again the Government have increased PRSI payments.  They seem to be totally unaware of the heavy burden these payments are placing on the PAYE sector in terms of their meagre wages. <Col N="1498" /> These PRSI payments are merely another form of taxation.  Under section 4 of the 1983 Social Welfare Act the ceiling in respect of which these payments had to be made was increased from £9,000.  That ceiling is now £14,700, a massive increase, and if one adds also the levies for health and youth employment, one realises the additional taxation, both direct and indirect, that has to be borne by the unfortunate worker.  This year alone the increase in the ceiling in respect of these payments is of the order of £900 while the ceiling in respect of the health contribution levy is being increased from £13,000 to £14,000.  The taxpayer is being fleeced all the time but is receiving less by way of return for his payments, whether the return is in terms of social welfare payments or in terms of health care.  The worker gets a much worse deal now than was the case four years ago.</P>
    <P>This year too, the then Minister for Finance performed another of his three card trick stunts by way of pretending to be giving something while in reality taking something back and doing so in many more ways than he is giving.  I speak of pay-related benefits which are being reduced this year.  Section 5 provides for an increase from £49 to £58 in the amount of weekly earnings to be disregarded in calculating the amount of pay-related benefit.  Last year there was an increase in this respect from £42 to £49 while in the previous year the increase was from £36 to £43.  Therefore, in the past three years the amount has been increased from £36 to £58.  This represents a major loss to those who are unfortunate enough either to become ill or to lose their jobs. We opposed this change originally because we recognised that it would reduce further the benefits that would be payable to those who were unemployed, disabled, or in receipt of maternity benefits.  People in these groups will suffer a net loss of £2 per week as a result of the increase this year in the figure, a loss that these unfortunate people cannot afford.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill provides for more authority for the Department in dealing with infringements of the social welfare <Col N="1499" /> code.  This is a welcome move especially in the light of various statements that have been made recently and in the light of reports that have been published in the media.  We can ill afford to have a major loss as a result of fraudulent claims.  I recognise that the Minister officially has on record over-payments last year in the order of about £3.5 million.  The amount is probably higher than this but I hope not to the extent suggested in various reports.  I would welcome any additional staff which the Department would employ to ensure an end to fraudulent uptake of social welfare payments.  These claims impose difficulties on the vast majority who are claiming legitimately and possibly receiving less benefit because of the tiny proportion who are fraudulently misusing the system.</P>
    <P>I did not note any great emphasis by the Minister on projected plans to streamline her Department's efficiency in the assessment and determination of eligibility claims for various payments, particularly non-contributory old age pensions and unemployment assistance claims.  I have said many times that the delays are becoming intolerable and it is very hard to justify a delay of three or four months before an appeal claim is settled and decided upon.  There must be grave inefficiencies and something radically wrong in the system.  I would be greatful if the situation could be reviewed and if the Minister would make it a priority to ensure that the inefficiencies of the past will be remedied in the future so that people will not have to wait interminable periods before a decision is made on their claims.</P>
    <P>Another problem which has been brought to my notice recently is that of seasonal workers, particularly those in the west.  These are people who have seasonal jobs during the tourist season and they also have very tiny holdings. They were regarded in the past as eligible for various unemployment payments but this year there have been refusals on a massive scale.  Many of these people are genuinely very badly in need.  Because they need money so badly they take <Col N="1500" /> seasonal tourist employment but the work lasts too short a time and other work is not available.  They are forced to live in very meagre circumstances.  Particular attention might be paid to that area to see if there could be more flexibility in the assessment of those claims.</P>
    <P>Regarding disability benefit, I recognise the improvement announced by the Minister.  There are now 25 medical referees.  As a member of that highly respected profession, it would not be my style in general to criticise my fellow professional colleagues and I do not intend to do so.  However, some of the decisions taken by medical referees in recent times have been medically crazy.  I do not understand how some of the decisions regarding eligibility for work are taken by these medical referees.  I know of one case involving a man with severe osteoarthritis of a knee, continuosly attending an orthopaedic surgeon, who has performed a number of operations on that knee.  It may be necessary for him to have an artificial knee joint provided.  He was examined by a medical referee within the past few weeks and it was decided that he was no longer unfit for work, yet the man was to attend the orthopaedic surgeon two days later.  He told this to the medical referee but the referee was more intent on checking his heart and blood pressure, which are fine, than looking at his leg and the complaint which was stopping him from working.  I find that difficult to understand.  When people make decisions like that there should be some consideration of whether they are as efficient as they should be.  I am not saying that this happens on a broad scale. I would not like to be misinterpreted. The decisions taken that are medically incorrect are probably few and far between.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Only a small group of people are involved in coming to these decisions.  It is probably not very correct to discuss this matter in the House because it is possible to identify them.  It is either a reflection on their competence or perhaps worse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would not wish that to be the situation.  Most of the decisions are absolutely in order and if errors occur perhaps the Department might have a look at the matter.</P>
      <P>Despite various promises and commitments and a massive advertising campaign over a year ago to encourage old people to invest their money in banking institutions, the Government have blatantly ruined all this by announcing in the Budget Statement a retention tax.  Now old people who have invested their moneys in banking institutes, despite the fact that they are not eligible for taxation, will be taxed indirectly on their interest. Last year the Department of Social Welfare did much to try to allay the worries and fears of all the people who might be hoarding money because they were afraid to put it into the banking institutions in case they would be declared ineligible for various benefits such as non-contributory old age pensions.  But, having taken that step as a result of advice from the Department of Social Welfare, they now find that retention tax is being imposed on them even though they would not ordinarily be liable to tax.  This is disgraceful. I would entreat the Minister to use her influence with her colleague, the Minister for Finance, and her other Cabinet colleagues to see if relief could be granted to the older age group from this particularly iniquitous type of taxation.</P>
      <P>I regret that I had so many criticisms of this Social Welfare Bill.  I would have been grossly dishonest if I were to ignore the realities contained in it.  The facts and figures are irrefutable and will have quite a disastrous financial effect on individuals and family units.  They will affect in particular the old, the sick, the deprived, the widows, the orphans and the unemployed. It is incumbent on me, as spokesman for the main Opposition party, to point out in this House the deficiencies contained in the Bill and the rather disgraceful and contemptible way in which the less well-off sections of our community are being treated by the Government at most levels but particularly in relation to social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on her appointment to this important Department, one of the great spending Departments of this State.  I wish her a happy tenure in that office. Social welfare has an effect on and influences most people.  As a result of the measures adopted in the budget 1.7 million people will benefit from the measures included in the Social Welfare Bill. The total budget for social welfare this year is £2.5 billion, or 15 per cent of GNP, which is a very sizeable percentage.  I am proud to be a supporter of this Government.  Since they came into office they have protected the living standards of the less well-off members of the community, those sectors of our community who are in receipt of social welfare benefits.  It is estimated that the increase in the CPI for the period 1983-87 will be 23.3 per cent.  During that same time short term social welfare benefits have been increased by 29.8 per cent, long term benefits by 32.7 per cent and long term unemployment benefits by 39.5 per cent.  It is obvious from these figures that people who are in receipt of social welfare benefits have had increases in real terms ranging from 5 per cent on 13 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the past Coalition Governments have had the same record in relation to social welfare.  I was not a Member of the House from 1973 to 1977 but at that time the Coalition Government also protected the less well-off members of the community. They reduced the qualifying age of the non-contributory pension from 70 to 66 years.  When times improve I hope that this Government will consider reducing the age further in order to bring it into line with the qualifying age for contributory pension which is 65.  We are one of the less well-off members of the European Community.  In the last few years there have been cutbacks in social welfare in some of the better-off countries of the Community.  In this country we looked after our less well-off members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we had an opportunity of reading in the papers and seeing on television the increases in social welfare <Col N="1503" /> announced in the UK.  They increased children's allowances by 10p per week; they increased old age pensions for single people by 40p per week and for married couples by 65p or 70p per week.  If our Government introduced such increases I shudder to think what the reaction would be.  If we draw a parallel again between ourselves and the UK, in this country pensioners have various benefits that are not available to people on similar pensions in the UK.  For instance, we have the free fuel allowance for old age pensioners and people on disability pension. That benefit has been increased in this budget by 25 per cent.  That is certainly in line with inflation, indeed it exceeds the rate of inflation.  Old age pensioners receive electricity concessions, telephone rental concessions, television licence concessions and unlimited free travel.  None of these benefits is available to pensioners or similar people in the United Kingdom. A short time ago I spoke with a couple of pensioners from Northern Ireland and when I explained to them the benefits that are available to pensioners in the Republic they were amazed.  They did not realise that there were such benefits available.</P>
    <P>A few points have been made in regard to the Social Welfare Bill which I would like to mention.  One is disability benefit. The Minister intends extending from six weeks to nine weeks the disqualification period for someone who does not report for a medical examination.  While there is concern in the Department at the number of people who did not turn up last year, about 6,000 out of 75,000, I would ask that if a person has a legitimate reason for not turning up for this medical he should be given another chance and the benefit should not be discontinued. There are 75,000 people on disability benefit.  When people are on disability benefit for a number of years they apply for invalidity benefit.  People are experiencing great difficulty in graduating from disability benefit to invalidity benefit. Like Deputy Dr. McCarthy I know of people who have been on disability benefit for six or seven years and as yet <Col N="1504" /> they have been unable to get invalidity benefit.  I do not know if this has something to do with the medical examination but, it is an area which should be examined to see if we can make it easier for genuine cases to graduate from one to the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her contribution referred to abuses of the social welfare system.  It is good to see the Minister adopting a responsible approach to this. Unfortunately social welfare abuses get a lot of publicity.  Abuses in other sectors are not highlighted as much.  The Minister said that the Department are tackling this problem and that the number of prosecutions has steadily increased since 1983. We must be careful that in taking action we do not cause hardship to genuine people who have nothing to live on, other than social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>In my constituency and in many other areas people who left the country have returned on retirement or when their health deteriorated.  Many of them are in receipt of UK invalidity pensions.  Irish invalidity benefit entitles a person to free fuel, electricity and so on.  Could the Minister look at the possibility of granting these benefits to some of our citizens who return home after spending 20 or 30 years in the UK?  When people return home they very often find that their UK old age pension or retirement pension is not as high as the benefit applying here and often the Department of Social Welfare have to top up these benefits.  In the past few weeks because of the improvement in the rate of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the pound sterling some people who applied for benefits in the past who did not qualify because of the exchange rate would perhaps be eligible now.  The position of some of these people might have changed considerably in the last month and perhaps when they re-apply for benefit, priority will be given to their applications because of the circumstances which now obtain.</P>
    <P>The benefit which applies mostly in the west is referred to as small farmers dole. That is an unfortunate name for it.  It should be referred to as a subsidy for <Col N="1505" /> people in the west living on small farms from which it is impossible to make a living.  The difficulty in this area has been with us now for the last two or three years, since the High Court and Supreme Court decisions which ruled that PLV was unconstitutional.  An action was brought by a number of farmers to the High Court and the Supreme Court and they were vindicated.  They have benefited, in that as a result of that ruling all agricultural land has been exempt from rates since then.  The other side of the coin is that small farmers in the west have suffered a lot as a result of that ruling.  People living on perhaps less than ten acres of arable land and who own four or five cows and a couple of sheep, are in receipt of unemployment assistance so that they could survive on the land.  These farmers were, until the High Court and Supreme Court decisions notionally assessed and the higher the PLV the less benefit they got.  Now all of them have to be factually assessed.  This is causing a great deal of concern and hardship in the west.  People living on five or six acres have had their benefit reduced from £30 a week to £10 or £15 a week.</P>
    <P>I do not know what we can do about this very serious problem but at the moment the factual assessment system is acting as a disincentive to people on small farms.  The danger is that a small farmer will sell off his cows and sheep in order to get the full social welfare benefit.  I would appeal to the Minister to have a long hard look at this problem to see what can be done.  A number of suggestions have been made.  At the moment farmers are being surveyed for the land tax which will be based on an adjusted acreage. Because PLV is unconstitutional perhaps we could tie this benefit to the adjusted acreage.  We could either do that or we could go back to the PLV system until the adjusted acreage survey is completed. It belongs to the last century more than this century to see social welfare officers going onto these farms and farmyards.  It is causing much hardship in the west.  Of course, it is always possible to appeal these cases but unfortunately these take a long time.  I have made representations <Col N="1506" /> and then appeals often take five to six months to go through.  Very often in the meantime these people have very little to live on.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at this problem to see what, if anything, can be done.</P>
    <P>One of the major things that this Government have done, the first time it has been done, is that they extended the Christmas bonus in December 1985 to the unemployed.  Before that it was available only to those who were on long term benefits, pensioners and those on disability allowances.  On this occasion it was extended to over 100,000 people on the unemployment register who were most appreciative.  They got their week's benefit plus 75 per cent.  Deputy McCarthey has said that this budget is anti-family. I fail to understand how he could say that as under the child benefit scheme the amount per child has been increased from £12.05 to £15.05 per month.  That is a very significant increase &mdash; £3 per child per month.  When one thinks of the increase they gave in the UK, 10p per week, it is certainly not anti-family.  The thinking on this is to change resources from the better off to the less well off. The 240,000 in receipt of unemployment benefit are not in the tax net.  Those of them who have children will not be affected as they are not in the tax net in the first place.</P>
    <P>They are the few brief comments I want to make on the budget.  The Government's record is second to none. They have matched the rate of inflation to the benefits they have granted since they came into office three years ago. They are following the example that has been given by previous Coalition Governments.  I hope in the next budget the increases given will also match the rate of inflation.  I am not afraid to stand in any part of the country and say that the Government have protected the living standards of the less well off members of our community during the past three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Bill before the House the emphasis seems to be on the rate of increases.  This basically is what <Col N="1507" /> the Bill is about.  It will afford us an opportunity to broaden the scope of the Bill and to talk about the impact and requirements of so many of our people resulting from the policies being pursued by the Government and their abject failure resulting in a huge demand on the Social Welfare Bill.  Although we welcome the reduction of 1,800 odd in the figure of unemployed last month, I suspect that mean drop is due for the most part to the social employment scheme where every effort is being made, and I mean every effort, to get people onto the scheme.  There are many schemes being organised by various agencies and bodies but no scheme has had a public relations exercise carried out to the same extent to sell it to the public as this one.  Some day we will question it and, perhaps, we may not be given the true answer, but certainly the amount of money that is being spent to promote this worthless, unthought-out and ill-considered scheme would pay for many a person's unemployment benefit.  The Minister for that Department and a bevy of his staff came down to Cork to tell us about it and showed us beautiful slides. We were promised that there would be 10,000 per year over a three year period, making 30,000 involved in the scheme.</P>
      <P>We have often considered that there are so many people doing nothing yet there is so much work to be done.  Of course, it begs the question, when will this administration do something about that situation?  The best that they have come up with is this social employment scheme of £70 a week for two and a half days work, or a week on or a week off, depending on which local authority operate it.  The Government introduced it in a flurry of excitement without having considered or talked with any of the groups or bodies of people that might be concerned with it.  First of all, there is the trade union movement.  It was only after the scheme was launched with trumpets blaring that somebody realised, we had better talk to these trade unionists, they have an input into it.  Why were there not talks with the social partners who would be involved in the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> I am making the point that even now with all the propaganda that was used and with the amount of discussion that has taken place subsequent to its launching we are nowhere near achieving the 10,000 participants promised work that needs to be done, could be done and ought to be done if the scheme was properly thought out.  I am making the point that in view of the amount of money being provided, quite rightly, as people must be given a sustenance allowance to live.  But many of those people who are unemployed and whose benefits are shown in this Bill, with the little increases given to them this year, would much prefer not to have to draw these benefits. They would much prefer to be working, because there is nothing more soul destroying for anyone than long term unemployment.  We have more than 230,000 of them registered as unemployed, but we know there are many thousands more, school children who, according to a survey done last week by the Youth Employment Agency, have gone back into education, young people who would be working if the opportunities were there for them.  We can only guess at what the numbers are, because no account has been kept of them and it would be very difficult to check.</P>
    <P>In passing, it is only right and proper that I should refer to the facilities for free third level education which were initiated by a Fianna Fáil Government and Minister. If those young people today were to pay for re-entering education or for staying on in education they would not be able to do it.  The Government who introduced free secondary education and provided free school transport were farseeing, and it is regrettable that that free education system has to be used these days by the Government because of the extent to which the country is suffering from unemployment.  There have been Coalition Governments and Inter-Party Governments, but it does not matter what they call themselves&mdash;a rose by any other name&mdash;they have all been abject failures.  This Government are no different, but I think they will go down in history as being the worst failure of all. <Col N="1509" /> Never in our history since we attained a measure of freedom&mdash;this Government seem to be shading the measure of freedom we have&mdash;even during the Emergency, was the spirit of the nation so low or the morale of our people so damaged.</P>
    <P>We have a Taoiseach and a Government four years ago projected for us as the people with all the answers from all the academics available to them.  I am not being critical of academics but this crowd seem to be short of common sense which is essential if they are to make or take decisions for the common good. Without doubt this Government have been short of common sense and of effective policies.  The volume of unemployment and the need for so much social welfare drawings were never so serious. We cannot afford them.  We cannot abide a Government who have been mismanaging the affairs of the nation so badly.</P>
    <P>In 1982 they put their policies before the electorate and afterwards they cobbled their Programme for Government, the main planks of which were the reduction of foreign borrowing, the phasing out over a four year period of deficit budgeting and the formation of the National Development Corporation. There is no doubt that the first two are away off target.  Indeed the Government have borrowed more than any previous administration.  They have abandoned their deficit budgeting proposal, and the NDC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a passing reference. The extent of social welfare drawings and the number of people dependent on social welfare benefits arise for the most part from Government policies. Many people have reached the end of their working lives but there is very little improvement in this Bill for them. Neither is there anything for those on unemployment benefit, assistance or disability benefit.  If in my ignorance I point out why we have such a demand on our social welfare resources and if I <Col N="1510" /> suggest that the demand is being contributed to by Government inefficiency and by the Government's inability to address themselves to unemployment.  I am sure you will excuse me.  However, it follows as the night the day that so long as you have a Government pursuing such inefficient policies there will be more and more dependence on social welfare benefits.  It should be permissible for me to point that out.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to improvements of £1.40 here, £170 there and £2.05 elsewhere. In the explanatory memorandum we read about old age pensioners receiving £2.05 more this year, with £1.30 for dependants.  Does anybody seriously consider that these increases are good enough even to keep in line with inflation, which is projected to be 3 per cent this year?  Think of the cost of living for everyone in this country and particularly the social welfare recipients.  The removal of the food subsidies was no great help to those people.  The Taoiseach could not even stand his ground when they were being reduced and took off to France or somewhere.  That is the kind of respect the Taoiseach has for those people on the social welfare code whom the removal of the subsidies will affect the most.</P>
      <P>Regarding disability and unemployment benefit, will the Minister of State or somebody during this debate give us the correct figures that need to be printed where the incorrect ones are at the bottom of the first page of the explanatory memorandum?  I will not spell this out, but somebody who is paid for doing that job can correct them.  Maybe the Minister will correct them also in his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talk about our old age pensioners surely brings to mind what we on this side of the House and those on the Government side saw about 12 months ago when a wave of crime swept across the country and when our elderly folk were in danger because they had a few bob under the mattress or in a biscuit tin.  Justifiably we, each and every one, encouraged them to put that money in safe places, that is banks and financial institutions, so that it would not be a temptation in this wave <Col N="1511" /> of crime.  Many of those people did that. People over 60 got a special concession. They were well accommodated and encouraged, but what do we find this year?  When they had the money inside in the bank this uncaring Government introduced that infamous clawback of 35 per cent.  That is the treatment, that is the attitude that this Government hold to our senior citizens who have given a lifetime of work to this nation, when work was there &mdash; note that: when work was there.  It is not there now for young or old.  This is the treatment that is meted out to them, but then that 35 per cent is being taken from other recipients of social welfare and the children whom we encourage to save in their little piggy banks, God help us, too.  Is it any wonder that this Government are starved for finance?  However, that being so, it is disgraceful that three groups of people, our senior citizens whom we encourage to put their money in the banks, our little children whom we have encouraged by the penny savings stamp right through their lifetime to save money and the charitable and voluntary organisations, should be treated so, in order that this Government can keep going and stay in power &mdash; or so they think.  We draw money at the rate of 35 per cent in that retention tax introduced in the budget. Have they any shame?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to it more in half an hour.  Have they any shame? When you consider some of the policies, statements, crusades and various other things performed by this Government, shame is a word that does not bother them.  We are all too well aware of the social welfare recipients, many thousands of them, who lost their jobs.  My illustrious opponent over there high up in the back benches had a question today that he wishes to raise on the Adjournment about another closure, that of Rowntree-Mackintosh.  Day by day the closures are going on during the lifetime <Col N="1512" /> of this Government, putting more people on social welfare benefit.  They are reasonably cushioned against the effects for the first 12 or 14 months with their unemployment and pay related benefit and, depending on the time of year, some return from income tax, but what happens then?  Every Deputy in this Dáil knows the position with the people who reach the stage of unemployment assistance and we are all well aware of the situation mentally, physically, emotionally and morally for these people when they go on UA.</P>
      <P>With the stringent assessment under the social welfare code is it not time that the Minister in introducing this Bill, thought of updating the assessment procedures for unemployment assistance? When one realises that the Department are working under an Act from as far back as 1934 &mdash; I can be corrected on that &mdash; when there was no such thing as redundancy.  There is nothing in the present legislation to take into account the redundancy which is a compensation for the loss of employment, but it becomes a very serious element of the assessment for unemployment assistance. The compensation received for the loss of a job is no longer considered to be compensation for the loss of a job, it is considered to be an asset necessary to be included for assessment.  The persons who drew redundancy must account for every penny of it &mdash; and I mean that literally.  They must have receipts and accountability for all of their spent redundancy money.  If not, they will get no unemployment assistance until the officials are satisfied about that.  Perhaps the fellow who backs horses at Cheltenham will have the dockets to produce but if he takes a jar, does he keep all the little bits of paper that he gets from the roll-out till to show to the Department?  That is the level of their investigation.  Such things as that redundancy element should be addressed in this Bill, and they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation cannot continue for much longer.  A number of people are barely remaining alive.  Statistics and surveys show that the numbers now barely above the poverty line, as we heard last week <Col N="1513" /> during the debate on combating poverty, are far in excess of what the Government or anybody else realised.  Is it any wonder that the demand on social welfare becomes greater?  Is it any wonder that efforts have been made and possibly continue to be made to defraud the social welfare system?  We have heard a good deal on that subject recently and a good deal of denial of it also.  It is difficult to know who is correct and who is incorrect, but one thing is certain.  The inclination or the encouragement to defraud is obviously there because of the low amount of benefit available to people, especially on unemployment assistance, and the stringent controls applied.  People are pressurised into trying to find loopholes in the system.  They are doing that to stay alive, keep bread on the table, clothes on their backs and shoes on their feet.  The system lends itself to the encouragement of abuse.</P>
    <P>The only way in which the social welfare code can be properly used and available to those who for health reasons and because of accidents at work genuinely cannot work is by providing employment for those who can.  There will always be a percentage who will genuinely not be able to work but the vast majority of those who are registered as unemployed are capable of working if the work was there for them to do.  If we had those capable people at work there would then be a greater amount of money available to sustain those who could not work.  We would then be in a position to provide a better system of support for those who because of illness, accidents, invalidity and disability cannot work.</P>
    <P>The Government are not addressing themselves to the overall problem of unemployment.  It cannot be stressed often enough or diligently enough that there are ever-increasing numbers out of work and &mdash; I almost forgot to mention &mdash; what about those who are leaving our shores in search of work?  For generations this country suffered from emigration.  In the mid-sixties, for the first time in our history, that trend was reversed.  In the sixties and part of the seventies schemes were provided under the social welfare <Col N="1514" /> code to encourage people back here to work because we had work for them. Then the Coalition Governments came into power and emigration was seen as an escape, a possibility to leave the country for our young and for the most part well-educated people, qualified, graduates as well as those to whom second level education was available.  They may have waited for a year, gone into various training programmes and schemes with no sustainable jobs at the end of them. Hope springs eternal, but our young people have given up hope and have taken to the emigrant trail in search of employment.</P>
    <P>I was privileged to be in Pairc Uí Cuív on Sunday, but one of the players cried off because he was on his way to Paris to look for a job.  Do this Government need any more evidence to waken them up and to get the people back to work, to introduce policies to give encouragement to investment in industry, to remove the barbed wire from around the trust funds, to create an atmosphere where the money which is in this country will be invested for the benefit of the Irish people?  The introduction of this Social Welfare Bill will put demands on the taxpayer to pay social welfare, but social welfare payments must be made because people must be sustained.  Many have contributed down through the years by means of PRSI, PAYE and social insurance, as it was called before the new schemes came into operation.  They are entitled to their rights because they contributed.  Many would much prefer to be let work and not have to draw social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Increases are definitely welcome but the insufficiency of those increases I have already mentioned.  If there were less people drawing social welfare benefits, the Government would not have to borrow for day to day spending.  There is no doubt that they have been borrowing for such spending.  When we were in Government we were accused of borrowing and, if returned to Government, if we have to borrow we will do so for productive purposes and will start the nation moving and get people back to <Col N="1515" /> work.  We will reduce the demand on the social welfare Estimate for the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir.  I accept, and have said already, that this Bill is about increasing social welfare benefits.  I could say that they are not <Col N="1516" /> sufficient increases, but I know that the present administration cannot afford to increase them any more.  There are ever more people drawing on social welfare, hence the increases must be small.  I hope I am making my point sufficiently clear. If the Government addressed themselves to the present unemployment position and got more people back to work there would be less drain on the social welfare funds.  Then, we might be able to come in here with increases not of £2.05 or £1.30, but with realistic increases.</P>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling that I stay with the Bill, but surely I am permitted to indicate, as I have been doing, that these increases are insufficient, while acknowledging that the Government cannot afford to give any more.  I am giving them an alternative to show how they could increase the benefits to the people who so badly need them.  I encourage the Government to look at the position from the point of view of unemployment and the creation of an atmosphere conducive to investment, because we must have investment to create employment.  We must encourage people with money to invest so that employment will be created, and we must encourage those at work to give of their best.  These are factors which, in my humble view, are very relevant to a Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, a single person on long term unemployment assistance, is entitled to £34.95 which is the personal rate for a rural recipient.  In all honesty, where would a person be going with less than £35 a week?  In the next column of the explanatory memorandum, we see that this rate is being increased by a massive amount to £36.70, but we all know that is not the full story.  Every effort is made to reduce that unemployment assistance. If a single person is living at home with his father who is an old age pensioner, the old age pension is taken into the reckoning.  How many single people in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit are getting the full amount?  There is only one way they can do it and that is to leave home and set up in a flat.  But then they have to pay £20 for the flat, <Col N="1517" /> leaving them with £16.70.  The cure is as bad as the disease.  This is disgraceful. Every Deputy will admit that people who are ashamed come to us because the Department of Social Welfare consider that their parents, who are old age pensioners, are subscribing to their survival and the maximum benefit is reduced because of this old age pension.  If the Minister or anybody else wishes to contradict that statement, I would be delighted to hear from them.  Recently two lads came to me.  Their father is a retired old age pensioner from Cork Corporation.  His little pension from the corporation and his old age contributory pension are taken into account when assessing the sons' unemployment assistance. Of course, the system has to be like that because we do not have the money to do anything else.  Why?  Because we have so many people unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Chair can correct me, that is his prerogative, but that is my assessment of the position.  If we had fewer people drawing social welfare we would be able to give realistic increases to those who are genuinely unavailable for work.  But no effort is being made to redress the situation.  Maybe, just maybe, out of this Social Welfare Bill, somebody in Government, or in the Department, might prod the Government to realise the foolishness of their folly, the foolishness of the policies they have been pursuing. Tackle this problem, assure the people who have contributed to social welfare through their PRSI and social insurance down the years that they will have a worthwhile retirement pension or, if they are injured, that they will have a worthwhile disability benefit, and even when people are unemployed and have to go on unemployment assistance, that they will get a worthwhile contribution. The Government should do all in their power to take more people above the poverty line, that magical line like the equator.</P>
    <P>Because of our economic situation many of these people are not alone out of work but they are broken in spirit, their morale is low, they suffer a feeling of <Col N="1518" /> hopelessness and their only hope of survival, of staying alive, is social welfare. Many of these people have no hope for the future; but, given the opportunity, there is hope for them, there is a future, and there is a possibility of rising out of the ashes.  That will not happen during the lifetime of this Government, but it most assuredly will happen in the life of the next Government, which will be a Fianna Fáil Government.  It will not be the first time we had to raise the spirit of our people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This Bill affords us an opportunity to look at the social welfare code, first in its confined context and then in its broader context, so that we can see what the real position is.  The dependence of so many people on social welfare is not the natural order of things.  The sooner this Government wake up and realise that the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to demand that the British Government have regard to the vote of the European Parliament on 20 February 1986 calling for the closing down of the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, in view not only of the danger to life and health from accidental leaks and emissions to date, but also in view of the serious risk of a major accident with uncontrollable consequences, and in view of the fact that plans for the further expansion of Sellafield involve a heavy traffic of ships carrying nuclear waste in the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 33 years since the Sellafield plant began its deadly discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea this nation has become aware of its inherent dangers.  It is important to put in context exactly what is involved.  Essentially two deadly chemicals, plutonium and caesium, cancer-producing elements, have been discharged into the Irish Sea.  Something like half a tonne of plutonium lies on the seabed.  When one realises that a lethal <Col N="1520" /> dose of that element alone is one-millionth of a gram, the enormity of the problem to the health of this nation, the potential risk to this nation from these elements, can be clearly seen.</P>
    <P>Sellafield is built on the worst possible location on a shallow sea.  The Irish Sea recycles itself every 18 months only, which means that much of this material lies within the sea itself.  Much of the discussion taking place in relation to the Sellafield plant is in the present tense but I would like for a moment to dwell on the implications that its deadly emission has for future generations.  The fact is that the risks are unknown.  That must never be allowed to be taken out of context. It is all very fine for scientists and others to contend that we are within EC regulations, that there is no cause for concern and so on.  The situation is much more serious.  If you like, we are mortgaging our environment, of which we are only the temporary custodians.  We have a right to maintain our environment.</P>
    <P>As a bordering nation Britain has no right to destroy or attempt to destroy our environment in whatever way they are doing at present.  The British Prime Minister wrote to the Taoiseach only last week telling him that she had no understanding of what concern this nation would have about the risks of Sellafield. The British Minister for the Environment, Mr. Baker, insulted the intelligence of the Irish nation when he said that fears of Sellafield were akin to those of medieval people about witchcraft. That puts in perspective the British point of view in relation to this plant.  As a nation we live in fear of a serious accident taking place at that plant.  Given the poor safety record of Sellafield it is not unreasonable to assume that there will be an accident which this nation is illprepared to meet.  It is a hazardous, archaic plant, many parts of it built in years when its potential growth could not have been envisaged.  There are now expansion plans afoot to spend £3 billion in importing foreign waste from as far afield as Japan to be reprocessed and discharged into the Irish Sea.  There will then be an increase in the amount of <Col N="1521" /> traffic in the Irish Sea, with foreign ships carrying this deadly waste to be reprocessed at Sellafield.  That is just not acceptable to this nation.  We must raise a very strong voice in opposition to this time-bomb within 100 miles of where this debate is being held this evening.</P>
    <P>The recent Black report &mdash; which has become discredited by inaccurate information having been furnished to those who contributed to its preparation &mdash; has proved emphatically that British Nuclear Fuels Limited cannot be trusted with information furnished, contradictory information, endeavouring to cover up serious accidents that have occurred, 300 of them over the past 30 years.  We are an island nation and cannot afford the risk of having these deadly chemicals contaminate food and fish stocks.  Anybody who has any knowledge of the low dosage effect of radiation and the deadly damage it can cause people could not possibly live in peace with this plant on our doorstep. The fact of the matter is that people vary in their susceptibility to radiation.  One could expose two people to the same amount of radiation; one will get cancer and the other will not.  It is an unknown quantity and the risks are enormous.  As far as Ireland is concerned it could have serious implications for the future.  I want to stress that fact here this evening.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter about three years ago in an Adjournment Debate in the month of July, I was accused of creating hysteria about this issue.  I feel as strongly now as I did then.  The only way out of this predicament is to demand that this archaic, accident-prone, badly managed plant be closed down.  A recent report showed that seismic activity, any type of activity &mdash; the figure quoted was anything over five or six on the Richter Scale &mdash; could cause problems to that plant, if it collapsed and a fire in one of the reactors burned uncontrollably.  Fire did burn there uncontrollably in 1953; we do not talk about these things now, but it did happen before.  Fortunately the wind then was blowing across to the Continent, not like the wind that blew from the 1957 fire and in respect of which there is talk of the link with Down's Syndrome children <Col N="1522" /> in the Dundalk region.  These types of accidents can easily happen.  Regrettably Sellafield is being looked on by the British nuclear industry as a moneymaking project. It is, I suppose, the fastest developing industry as far as earning money for Britain is concerned.  They are looking after the nuclear waste of other nations, countries that will not undertake that, will not store it.  What attitude should we adopt other than to condemn that approach?</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment calls on the British Prime Minister to ensure that a thorough review of the safety of the plant is carried out but such an approach at this stage is totally unacceptable to the nation.  This is an apolitical issue and there should be total agreement on it.  Nobody in their right mind could consider agreeing to the Sellafield plant being kept open.  The amendment suggests that it should be determined independently whether Sellafield can operate safely.  I do not know what the Government are engaged in but their prime responsibility is to the nation and they should not be condoning or working hand in hand with the British Government in regard to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I understand that the environmental committee of the House of Commons intend publishing tomorrow an all-party report on the subject of safety at Sellafield. My information is that the report will condemn the plant and that the plant will have difficulty trying to maintain its presence following the publication of the report.  Why should the Irish Government assist in keeping that plant open? The European Parliament on 20 February voted overwhelmingly to press for the closure of the plant.  Most of the contributions in that debate were to the effect that the plant had a lethal future. Why should the Government injure the nation by being party to an arrangement that will allow the British to buy time in regard to the future of Sellafield.  The British want time to come up with a very suspicious system of safety at a plant which is totally unsuitable.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the huge employment content of the plant.  Anybody <Col N="1523" /> in Ireland would consider that matter but the workers involved should be compensated for working in a hazardous plant.  British Nuclear Fuels have awarded huge sums in compensation to the widows of ex-Sellafield workers without admission of liability.  There is circumstantial evidence to support the view that people in that region are living in a very unhealthy environment.  Medical practitioners and radiation experts have said that.  It is a fallacy to say that there is such a thing as an acceptable level of radiation.  Some people have said that the radiation level at Sellafield comes within EC levels.  That we live in a backdrop of radiation is most unfortunate.  It is unfortunate that we have to tolerate it but to be subjected by a neighbouring country to this type of radiation exposure is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I have a full dossier on the accidents at Sellafield, the most alarming of which took place this year after we were given assurances by British Nuclear Fuels.  That concern was fined £10,000 for exceeding the limits and failing to keep proper safety records at the plant.  Accidents occurred there on 24 January, 5 February and 6 February.  There have been many accidents at the plant and by the law of averages we can expect more before the end of the year.  It would be better if the House was united on this issue and that is why I was disappointed that the Government tabled an amendment to our motion.  I am aware that the Tánaiste, and many members of the Government, are opposed to the plant but it appears that the Government are in some way succumbing to pressure on this matter. All the pressure in the world must be exerted on Britain in regard to this issue for the sake of future generations.</P>
    <P>We must remember that certain cancers take time to develop.  Blood cancers can take up to 30 years to develop.  Many medical teams are trying to establish cancer links with the Sellafield plant and that is proving very difficult.  It is very difficult to quantify cancer and attribute it to a particular cause.  Some people are hiding behind reports and saying it is <Col N="1524" /> impossible to prove a link with cancer and, therefore, the plant is safe.  I cannot understand the logic behind the reports that support the presence of the plant. The Government should take a firm stand on this and not listen to Margaret Thatcher saying that we do not have anything to fear.  This nation has everything to fear.  Nuclear discharges at Cap de la Hague are 66 times less than those from Sellafield, which we are tolerating, but people there are objecting to that plant. The Americans closed down a nuclear reprocessing plant because it was deemed to be unsafe but although our sea is being contaminated on a daily basis by one million gallons of radioactive water, we are tolerating it.</P>
    <P>I accept that people can draw different conclusions from figures but it must be accepted that there is an element of plutonium lying in sludge which could be dislodged by seismic activity.  Geologists say that seismic activity is taking place continuously in the Irish Sea and reaches three on the Richter scale.  When that sludge moved before, the beaches of Cumbria were contaminated and closed down.  Such movements could cause a lot of damage here.  We do not have to wait until a clump of radioactive seaweed lands on our coast before we protest about this.  We should not wait until we see foliage and trees affected by plutonium dust.  We should not have to wait until surveys are carried out on children born with abnormalities or until our fishing industry suffers.</P>
    <P>A responsible decision was taken by the European Parliament a few weeks ago and now we have an opportunity of telling the British Government that our Parliament demands nothing short of a closure of the Sellafield plant.  We should not capitulate and permit a bogus investigation to take place.  Such investigations in the past were found to be totally onesided. We must think of our future.  If the Government force their amendment through the House, they will suffer international embarrassment.  The Minister will be seen by the British Government as saying that the Irish Government are <Col N="1525" /> content with what is happening at Sellafield. That would be inconsistent with the statements made by the Minister for Energy, the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, or with those of many members of the Minister's Party.  This is a let-off for the British, an opportunity lost, and obviously Fianna Fáil will not, under any circumstances, be in agreement with an amendment of that kind.</P>
    <P>I should like the House to look on this issue as perhaps potentially the most serious issue on health and environmental grounds which the nation will face in the future.  We demand that the Government exert maximum pressure on the British Government to close down Sellafield immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Brady and the Fianna Fáil motion.  On 5 February in this House I called on the British Government to close Sellafield and I repeat that call tonight.  I said then that enough is enough and that it should be closed down in the best interest of the present and future health of our people, North and South.</P>
      <P>At that time the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, said that I was being hysterical and alarmist, and the same accusations were levelled at Deputy Brady three years ago when he drew attention to the very serious situation which was developing.  Since then Deputy Haughey, Deputy Brady, Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy Woods, Deputy Raphael Burke and many others put out a distress call to the Government hoping that sooner or later they would exert pressure on the British Government to close the plant.  There should be a united call from this House that enough is enough.  Report after report, which would probably fill this Chamber, point to the very serious dangers to the health of our people and to that of future generations. As news of more and more leaks are reported in the newspapers, television and radio, is it surprising that the people wonder why the Government are standing back from the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also disappointed that the Government chose to put down an <Col N="1526" /> innocuous amendment, because we are accused of playing politics with too many issues.  This issue should not be political in any sense because it reflects the grevious concern of everyone in the country.  I hope the Government will have second thoughts between now and the vote tomorrow night.  We are trying to protect the health of our people and there is a very real danger of an accident in the Irish Sea as ships transport this deadly waste for dumping.</P>
    <P>This is a leak a week factory of horror, and any doubts which people might have had three years ago must surely have been dispelled by now.  The continuance in operation of this leak a week factory is no longer acceptable to the nation. When will the Government join with us in making a call to the British Government telling them that enough is enough as far as Ireland is concerned?  While one can only try to interpret the British Prime Minister's remarks on the issue, it appears as if the British Government put the health of their people and the preservation of the environment in second place behind jobs and the economic development of a deadly industry.  Not alone are we suppossed to accept that the plant will continue but also that it will be enlarged.</P>
    <P>There was a widespread debate on this issue last week in the European Parliament and a vote to close the plant at Sellafield was passed by a large majority. It is not just Fianna Fáil crying out for something to be done but a majority voice coming from the European Parliament to call a halt and to close the plant.  We must not put the health of our citizens behind blind economics.  We must protect the environment and the health of our people.  I am not being hysterical or alarmist because, as Deputy Brady said, there are mountains of reports and evidence piling up daily pointing to the dangers of this plant.  Does anybody believe that the management of that horror plant have any credibility?  We have been misled over and over again in relation to the facts.  We all know that the plant was built in 1947 to produce material for Britain's atomic bombs.  It was then a <Col N="1527" /> military establishment and it is run on the same secretive lines today.  Even the Irish Nuclear Energy Board admitted recently that the management have been discredited and that we should not give much credence to their statements.  How many times have they tried to cover up the facts?  However, the truth will out, as it usually does.  People will not accept cover-ups or whitewashes and, in time, even the workers in Sellafield will be prepared to say when the facts have been distorted.</P>
    <P>Since 1964 this plant has been involved in nuclear waste reprocessing.  It is the plant that has been responsible for all the recent incidents.  Is it not only natural to expect that a plant which was built in 1947, with an addition being built in 1964, would be cracking?  Regardless of what level of maintenance may have been applied during the period of the plant's operation it must crack up inevitably and, consequently, the only sensible course to take is to close it down.  We as a sovereign nation are expected to remain quiet so far as this plant is concerned and to accept what we are told by a management who are discredited and by a British Government who are interested only in the economics of Sellafield and in the preservation of the large number of jobs there.  Some amazing statements have been made in this House from time to time from the opposite benches in regard to this whole matter.  On 5 February last, for instance, the Minister of State at the then Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism told me by way of reply to a question I had tabled that he doubted whether the British Government would have in operation a plant that would be to the detriment of the health of the British people.</P>
    <P>Let us contrast that statement with the evidence of the many incidents at Sellafield in recent years.  Studies have shown that there is a higher incidence of leukaemia along the west coast of Scotland, which is directly in the path of currents from the discharge point in the Irish Sea. All the evidence available to me indicates <Col N="1528" /> that the British Government are prepared to put economics before health.  I would not have time this evening to go through all the evidence that is available about the numbers of times that different beaches have been declared safe for use by the public and then subsequently declared unsafe.  The beach at Sellafield was closed to the public in December 1983 on the grounds that it was dangerous though a scientist at the plant had been sacked in 1981 for giving what was considered an unwarranted warning to a family about beach pollution there.  That is a clear example of the double talk that comes from the authorities who are supposed to control this horror factory. How many more accidents must occur before the plant is closed?  Discharges at the more modern reprocessing plant at Cap de la Hague in France have been far fewer than has been the case at the Sellafield plant, but apparently we are prepared to agree passively with the British Government.  That is something those of us on this side of the House are not prepared to do on this very important issue.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea is regarded as the most heavily polluted and as containing the highest level of radioactivity in the world. Low level radioactive materials have been discharged into a pipe that extends two kilometers into the Irish Sea but the rules have not been observed.  Half a tonne of Plutonium 239 has been deposited in the Irish Sea since 1964.  Since one-millionth of a gram is lethal to an individual, the amount deposited and which has a life span of approximately 240,000 years would be capable of killing more than 200 million people.  That is the reality of the evidence that is available.</P>
    <P>Studies have shown also that radiation is ten to 100 times higher on the east coast of Ireland than is the case on the west coast.  I should like the Minister to ascertain from his colleague, the Minister for Health, when the studies undertaken by the Department of Health and which we have been hearing about for so long are to be published.  On the many occasions on which Deputy O'Hanlon attempted to raise this matter with the Minister he was <Col N="1529" /> told only that the results of the studies would be published soon.  We hear the word &ldquo;soon&rdquo; in this House much too often.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy not aware that an expansion of the plant is to take place?  Are we to keep our silence until such time as there is a major accident in the Irish Sea?  There is a responsibility on all of us to call for the closing down of the plant; and, if Deputy Allen is not interested in being associated with that call, he is free to go his own way.  How ever, should any such serious accident occur it would be remembered that Bernard Allen was not in favour of any action being taken in regard to the plant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be glad to do so when Deputy Allen ceases interrupting. In December 1983 the British <Col N="1530" /> Department of the Environment warned the public not to use 25 miles of beach near Sellafield.  Radioactivity levels were 100 to 1000 times normal level after the accidental leak in November 1983.  Some samples of fish showed higher levels of radioactivity also.</P>
      <P>In January 1984 the National Radiological Protection Board issued a report to the effect that exposure of the public to natural radiation should not be used to justify exposure from other sources.  That is a standard defence that is trotted out by people on the other side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a meeting in London on 17 February 1984 between the Minister for Energy and Mr. Patrick Jenkin, the British Environment Secretary, the Minister said he was particularly satisfied with the talks and that Mr. Jenkin had reassured him that an incident such as the one which occurred in the previous year could not happen again.  The Minister said that, while Mr. Jenkin has assured him that scientific evidence available did not indicate adverse effects to the Irish people, he expressed concern at accidental discharges and long-term consequences and pressed that releases from Sellafield must be as low as reasonably achievable.  That meeting was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 February 1984.  There is much more evidence that I could read, but there is not enough time for that.  The Minister, because of the sport that he was very good at, will know what a hand-off is.  I expect him not to take anymore handoffs from the British Government on any other occassion in which he may meet their representatives.  It is regrettable that the Minister does not see his way to discontinuing this playing of politics and accept that it is in the interest of the Irish people that Sellafield be closed.  We must not run the risk of a very serious shipping accident in the Irish Sea involving ships carrying waste to Sellafield.  We know, too, that at regular intervals beneath the waters of the Irish Sea there are two nuclear submarines.  If there were to be an accident involving one of those vessel and one carrying waste to Sellafield, we would no longer be around to raise our <Col N="1531" /> voices about the danger.  That is why we should speak here on this matter with a united voice.</P>
    <P>We all know of the fines imposed on the management of Sellafield because of their mismanagement and we know that sometimes the whole issue causes embarrassment to the British Government. More than 800 construction workers at the Sellafield site staged a half day strike in protest at not being told about the level of a leak that had occurred at the plant. Those workers showed that concern though their livelihoods were involved, but here we are apparently about to raise a disunited voice in relation to the whole matter.  In this way we are only playing into the hands of the British Government whose attitude to Ireland has been always to divide and conquer.  It may transpire that tomorrow's report will produce more deadly evidence than I am offering, but even if the British read the report of this debate they will realise that the House is divided in its approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>There is no need for an Irish Government to play footsy with the British any longer in this regard.  That has been the case for far too long.  We accepted in good faith many of the statements that emanated from the British, Government to Government, but there is enough evidence that the time has come to call a halt, to close the plant and not to wait until none of us is around to make a protest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann, in view of five recent incidents at the Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Plant, supports the measures already taken by the Government:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)&nbsp; in conveying to the UK Government the Irish public's concern that the number of incidents although of limited radiological <Col N="1532" /> impact has caused a loss of confidence in the safety of the operation of the Sellafield plant;</P>
    <P>(b)&nbsp; in calling on the British Prime Minister to ensure a thorough review of safety at the plant;</P>
    <P>and, while recognising that the setting up of an investigation into Sellafield by the UK Health and Safety Executive is a positive step, supports this Government's arrangement of Ministerial discussions at European level with a view to establishing a community inspection process to determine independently whether Sellafield can operate safely or whether its operations should cease or be suspended until satisfactory standards of safety are achieved.</P>
    <P>I will begin by reiterating the policy of the Government with regard to Sellafield. The Government's position is that radioactive discharges from Sellafield should be minimised and eliminated as soon as possible through the use of the best available technology.  This position has been stated at every opportunity in contact with the British authorities and at all appropriate international fora.</P>
    <P>As this House is aware, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, the operators of the Sellafield plant, have commenced a programme which includes measures designed to effect significant reductions in radioactive discharges at Sellafield.  The sum of £350 million is being spent on a new complex, to be known as Pond 5, incorporrating new technology designed to reduce discharge levels from the storage of the spent fuel before it goes to a chemical plant on the site for processing. This is at present being commissioned. There is £200 million for a new vitrification plant which will turn radioactive waste left after reprocessing into inert glass bricks, and $130 million for a new water treatment plant, which is now in operation and which will reduce routine radioactive discharges to the Irish Sea.  A sum of £150 million is being spent for a floc precipitation plant, to be operational by 1991, which will reduce discharges of long-lived alpha radiation; and a further <Col N="1533" /> water treatment plant in the form of a salt evaporator to reduce the volume of liquid radioactive waste.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this programme, recent incidents at Sellafield have given rise to disquiet about the operation of the plant.  At a meeting of the Ireland UK contact group on 14 February last officials of my Department conveyed our grave concern at the recent incidents at Sellafield and our annoyance at the inadequate notification procedures.  The earliest of these incidents involved the discharge of 458 kilograms of uranium into the Irish Sea on 24 January 1986.  This was followed by a plutonium gas leak on 5 February, and on 13 February 1986 a fire occurred at the Drigg low level radioactive waste dump near Sellafield.  All three incidents were discussed at the meeting on 14 February.  The British authorities assured my officials in the course of that meeting that the radiological emissions to the environment resulting from these incidents were insignificant.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, a prompt notification procedure was agreed at the meeting and notification of more recent incidents has been practically immediate.  These involved two incidents at Sellafield, one at Trawsfyndd and one at Capenhurst at Sellafield.  There was a leak of 250 gallons of low level radioactive water from a pipe into a containment trench on 18 February.  We were informed that two workers were slightly contaminated on that occasion.  The incident at Trawsfyndd involved the discharge of 15 tonnes of carbon dioxide contaminated with radioactive elements and we were informed that no raised levels of radioactivity were detected off site.  This incident occurred on 21 February.  On 1 March there was a leak of plutonium inside the Sellafield plant and two workers were contaminated.  Finally, on 2 March one worker was slightly contaminated at Capenhurst Nuclear Power Station during the course of carrying out routine maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that these incidents are, in themselves, of little radiological <Col N="1534" /> significance to the Irish population. Clearly, a balanced view of the situation must be maintained.  However, the frequency of these incidents has caused the Government and the Irish people to lose confidence in the safety of the plant.  The safety record at Sellafield has been less than satisfactory and the frequency of recent accidents poses the possibility of the occurrence of an accident in the future which could have consequences for this country.  This concern is heightened by the recent revelation regarding the errors in the information on radioactive discharges supplied to the Black inquiry.  I am also aware of the increasing public concern at the continued operation of the plant.  This concern must also be shared by the British public.</P>
    <P>For this reason the Taoiseach, at his meeting with the British Prime Minister on 19 February 1986, urged that there be a review of safety procedures at the plant. The further incidents which followed that meeting underlined the necessity, as we see it, for such a review.</P>
    <P>Therefore we welcome the announcement of the setting up of an investigation into Sellafield by the UK Health and Safety Executive.</P>
    <P>However, it must be recognised that, given the current public concern about Sellafield, any review of the plant must not only be objective but must be seen to be objective.  The Taoiseach recently informed the House that the Government would be seeking ministerial discussions in Brussels on the issue of a European inspection force to monitor activities such as those at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Several articles of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM), to which of course we belong, give the Commission several rights with regard to the control and monitoring of radioactive emissions from nuclear installations in member states.  The Government will be examining in detail how the Treaty can be applied by the Community to obtain greater control in relation to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I have already had preliminary discussions <Col N="1535" /> on the matter with Commissioner Clinton Davis, with a view to having an early meeting to discuss the joint approach by ourselves and by the Commission.  I must say, for the record of this House, that his approach to date has been co-operative because he recognnises the Irish interest in the activities at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Mr. John Boland, TD, took up the matter of a European inspection force at a recent Council of Environment Minister in Brussels.  Minister Boland said that the escalation of problems connected with the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant is causing public and political concern in Ireland.  The gravest worry is naturally for public health, but there is concern too for the effects on our air quality and marine environment.  No one can predict the long term effects of discharges to the Irish Sea and the risk of excessive discharges is also present.  The Minister, Deputy Boland, added that there is wide acknowledgement of a communications gap between the nuclear industry and the man in the street.  For the Irish public, this communications gap is all the greater since they derive no economic benefit from Sellafield, but there is a perception that this country's health and environment is at risk from it.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Clinton Davis responded that, following a debate in the European Parliament last September on the subject of nuclear safety, he asked a committee of independent scientific experts to look into a number of questions related to community policy on radiation protection.  He also requested member states to send experts to an <i>ad hoc</i> committee to discuss the idea of a Community nuclear installations inspectorate. Commissioner Clinton Davis is considering the reports of both these committees at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Eddie Collins, had a meeting with Commissioner Clinton Davis today in Strasbourg.  I have just been advised of the outcome of these <Col N="1536" /> discussions.  The Minister of State stressed that there is a need for Commission action to ensure that nuclear plant operators, in particular the Nuclear Processing Plant at Sellafield, comply with the highest possible standards of safety.  He emphasised that there is growing concern in Ireland about Sellafield.  He said that the Commission has a central and vital role to play in the implementation of the Community basic radiation safety standards under the EURATOM Treaty.</P>
    <P>In particular, the Minister stressed the Irish Government's position that a European inspection force, which would be internationally regarded as an objective and impartial watchdog, should be set up.  He further stated that the issue was of international importance because of the trans-national effects of discharges into the marine environment and the atmosphere.  Commissioner Clinton Davis responded that the Commission was urgently reviewing aspects of Community policy on nuclear safety following recent events at Sellafield and would give serious consideration to the issues the Minister had raised.</P>
    <P>I will be meeting the Commissioner towards the end of the month for further and more detailed discussions on all matters pertaining to this issue.  I will emphasise to the Commissioner the fact that it is the safety aspect of the Sellafield operation which is causing mounting concern in Ireland.  The history of Sellafield has not encouraged confidence and the result, we feel, is that the industry has a very negative image.  We believe, therefore, that the establishment of an inspection force such as we are proposing should be welcomed not only by people who are concerned on health, safety and environmental grounds, but also by the industry itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>If we come to grips with the difficulties, the fears and the problems in the present tense it will naturally follow that we will be catering for the future generations.  This inspection force should be in a position to establish whether plants such as Sellafield are safe, and furthermore whether discharges are in conformity with the obligations set out in the EURATOM Treaty, which include compliance not only with numerical limitations on discharges, but also with the ALARA principle, that discharges must be as low as reasonably achievable.  We have, of course, stressed to the UK authorities at every opportunity that discharges from Sellafield must conform with ALARA and must, furthermore, be completely eliminated as soon as possible. As long as there are discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea, the Irish population will continue to be concerned about the possible impact on their health and safety.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise, of course, that the levels of radioactivity are carefully monitored by the Nuclear Energy Board who are engaged in a continuous monitoring programme which monitors radioactivity levels in fish, seawater, seaweed and sediment taken from the Irish Sea.  Independent research programmes are also undertaken by the environmental radioactivity laboratories of University College, Dublin, and Trinity College, Dublin.  The results of these monitoring programmes have clearly shown that contamination has occurred in the Irish Sea as a result of discharges from Sellafield. However, the radiation dose to the Irish population resulting from Sellafield is very small and would be, on average, less than 1 per cent of the limits advised by the International Commission for Radiological Protection and by the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A joint Irish-Spanish research cruise is <Col N="1538" /> planned for this year to monitor levels and distribution of caesium 134 and caesium 137 in the area bounded by the North-East Atlantic dumpsite, the southwest coast of Ireland and the north-east coast of Spain.  This will include an examination of the extent to which discharges from Sellafield and Cap de la Hague have now penetrated these more southerly waters.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board, with the assistance of the meteorological service of the Department of Communications, also monitor radioactivity levels in air, rainfall and drinking water samples.  I am assured by the nuclear energy board that the levels of artificially produced radioactivity in the atmosphere and in the environment are low and do not constitute a health hazard to the Irish public.</P>
    <P>The monitoring system operated by the Nuclear Energy Board has been adequate to determine the level of radiation dose to the Irish population which has occurred to date.  However, in the light of these recent incidents I propose to have the monitoring procedures reviewed in consulatation with the Nuclear Energy Board with a view to establishing whether monitoring requires any modification.  I will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we will continue to be in a position accurately to measure future radioactivity levels.  I might also add that the Nuclear Energy Board published a report in 1984 on their monitoring programme, copies of which are available in the Library.  A more recent report will be published shortly and will also be available in the Library.</P>
    <P>In November 1983 a British TV programme claimed that there was an excess of young people with leukaemia and other cancers in the neighbourhood of Sellafield.  A public inquiry was set up and its report, known as the Black report, concluded that the evidence available did not establish a link between the cancer and Sellafield.  However, the Black report did make certain recommendations regarding further studies to be carried out.  The Black report also recommended a review of the discharge authorisations and a reduction of routine <Col N="1539" /> discharges from the plant.  The UK Department of the Environment are in the process of carrying out a review of these discharge authorisations.  My Department will be consulted during this review.  It is expected that the new authorisations will be introduced later this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Sunday Times</i> reported on 16 February that a nuclear scientist, Dr. Jakeman, formerly employed at Sellafield, has now revealed that the figures given to the Black inquiry on radioactive discharges in the fifties were inaccurate.  The article states that BNFL have now admitted that the levels were actually 40 times greater than stated to the Black inquiry. It is also reported that the chairman of the inquiry, Sir Douglas Black, has commented that he considers that he will not be altering his conclusions.  It has been confirmed with the UK DHSS that <i>The Sunday Times</i> report is substantially correct.</P>
    <P>Further studies are currently being undertaken by the UK authorities on the basis of the Black report recommendations. These include an increase in the number of children originally studied and a re-analysis of data by the Northern Children's Cancer Registry.  A UK Department of Health committee will reassess that part of the Black report which is concerned with discharges in the light of recent disclosures by BNFL that the figures provided to the Black advisory group were apparently too low.  This health committee will advise within six months as to whether the revised discharge figures should effect any change in Black's conclusions.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, many people in Ireland are worried about the possible effects on their health resulting from Sellafield emissions, particularly in view of the recent spate of incidents.  The House will be aware that there is concern, for example, about clusters of Down's Syndrome in the Dundalk area.  I should mention in this context that the Department of Health have set up a steering committee to examine the incidence <Col N="1540" /> of childhood leukaemia since 1970 and of Down's Syndrome in the under 25's.  The committee will also undertake a critical examination of the Black report.</P>
    <P>Members of this House, and the public, will obviously be concerned at the future action which can and will be taken. The Government will, of course, continue to emphasise to the UK authorities that the Irish population are unwilling to accept any possible risks to their health or environment from an industry which is situated in another country and which is of no benefit to them.  Our concern regarding Sellafield was expressed as far back as February 1984, when I met the then UK Secretary for the Environment, Mr. Patrick Jenkin, to discuss the issue of the discharge and dumping of radioactive waste.  Following that meeting a contact group was established between Ireland and the UK to provided for a formal channel of communication between the two countries on nuclear matters.  Through this contact group, and by other means, the Government have, in recent years, taken steps designed to ensure that we would be kept well abreast of all developments at Sellafield.  As a necessary improvement to the working of the contact group, it is our intention to seek a full meeting of officials of all relevant Departments and bodies in the UK and the Republic.  We consider that this would contribute to greater cohesion in and prompt receipt of the information being made available.</P>
    <P>I assume that the announcement by the UK authorities of the appointment of a team of 12 inspectors to undertake an investigation into Sellafield is due at least in part to the firm representations which the Irish Government have been making, and will continue to make, to the UK Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already mentioned that the nuclear industry must be well aware by now of the very negative image which it has in the public eye.  The reality is that the Sellafield issue will continue to fester until such time as the basis for <Col N="1541" /> concern regarding its possible effect is investigated.  While recognising that the review by the Health and Safety Executive is a step in the right direction, we are of the firm opinion that what is required is an independent inspection of the plant. We contend, furthermore, that it is clearly in the interest of the nuclear industry that they should support such an impartial inspection of the Sellafield plant and also support any measures that might be necessary to improve the safety and environmental impact of the plant.</P>
      <P>I should stress at this point that, as far as we are aware, Sellafield has never exceeded the numerical limits which it is authorised to discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>However, and this is important, the Euratom Treaty requires adherence not only to these limits but also, as I previously mentioned, to ALARA.  In a case in the UK Crown Court last year British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. were found guilty <i>inter alia,</i> of not complying with ALARA.  It cannot be denied, therefore, that there is evidently scope for improving operations at the plant, and while the programme which has been introduced at Sellafield should result in a significant reduction of discharges, the need for reassurance regarding the safety of the plant remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the points which I will be emphasising in my forthcoming discussions with Commissioner Clinton Davis. I understand that the Commissioner, as well as considering the reports recently presented to him, has received information which he requested from the United Kingdom Government, and he will be submitting it to the article 31 committee of EURATOM, which deals with basic standards for radiological protection. This committee, at the request of the Commissioner, produced the report, currently being considered by him.  This report addressed, <i>inter alia,</i> the questions of the lessons to be learned from the Sellafield discharge incident of 1983 as well as from the Black report.  I understand <Col N="1542" /> that this committee have now been asked to convene to consider the recent incidents at Sellafield and to consider whether the present report needs to be modified in the light of these incidents. This House is aware that there is increasing pressure on the Government regarding Sellafield because many people see the only solution to this problem as the closing down of the plant.  Closure of the plant is not as simple as it seems.  Firstly, there is already an amount of highly radioactive materials stored at Sellafield which will continue to be stored there, even if further reprocessing is not carried out.  These materials will require attention and management and would therefore continue to give rise to concern.  If satisfactory standards of safety are seen to be operating and if we can have confidence in the safe operation of the plant without fear of endangering the Irish public, the continued operation of the plant would not be opposed.</P>
    <P>However, we need this assurance that the plant is being safely operated, and we consider that the basis for any such assurance must be an investigation by a European inspection force such as we are proposing.  The Irish Government are of the firm opinion that it is in the interest of all concerned to support this inspection force at European level and to support any measure that might be adjudged necessary by an inspection force to improve the safety of Sellafield, even if this transpires to mean suspension of operations or closure of the plant.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, continue to give this matter my fullest attention, and I will decide on what further action seems appropriate in the light of the ministerial discussions with Commissioner Clinton Davis.  I would assure the House that, in the meantime, the Government will miss no opportunity to convey, both to the United Kingdom authorities and at all appropriate international fora, their concern about the spate of incidents which gave rise to widespread public lack of confidence in the safety of the Sellafield operation.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of a letter received by the Taoiseach last week from <Col N="1543" /> the British Prime Minister.  That letter will be replied to in due course by the Taoiseach.  The letter confirms that neither the UK Government nor the nuclear industry are complacent about the Sellafield operations and that continuous improvements are taking place at the plant.  This is to be welcomed. However, I must emphasise that what concerns the Irish Government and people is not the recent incidents, which are in themselves of limited radiological significance, but the frequency of these incidents.</P>
    <P>I understand that a report on radioactive waste by the House of Commons Environment Committee is due to be published tomorrow, and I await with interest its findings and recommendation. I cannot pre-empt it by making any comments at this stage, but it will be examined carefully by my Department and if there are areas of our concern which are not covered in detail we will take immediate action to seek immediate action by the British Government.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>A report was produced by the British House of Commons AllParty Environment Committee which questions the continued operation of the Sellafield nuclear industry and which challenges the nuclear industry to justify the need for the Sellafield Nuclear Processing Plant, justifies, if such were necessary, our motion, which we are discussing this evening and which has been on the Order Paper for some time, demanding the closure of the plant.  I noted on BBC television at about noon today that a Sellafield spokesman commenting on the report laid more emphasis on the job losses which would occur in the event of the plant being closed down than on the health hazards involved. While we would accept that any country, <Col N="1545" /> in present circumstances, would be concerned about job losses, they must equally accept that where health hazards can be great, then the health aspect of the matter must have priority.  We in this House should be determined to ensure that this is so.</P>
      <P>My constituency is in almost a direct line from Cumbria where the Sellafield nuclear plant is located, on the other side of the Irish Sea, and the people of County Louth are understandably deeply concerned about the health hazards involved. I attended a number of meetings recently in my constituency, none of which was called for the precise purpose of discussing Sellafield but in every case the Sellafield nuclear processing plant became the prime topic of discussion and the fears of the people of Louth were forcefully expressed and there was a general demand for the closure of the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submitted a question for written answer asking the Minister for Energy if he will give details of the methods employed in monitoring the water in the Irish Sea <i>vis-á-vis</i> emissions from Sellafield and if he is satisfied that the methods used are of the highest standards.  I expected a reply today.  Instead I received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle stating that the question was disallowed because it anticipated the debate on the closure of Sellafield in Private Members' Time. While not disputing the Ceann Comhairle's decision, I must, however, express regret that my question was ruled out because the information sought by me, had it been given, would have helped considerably in this debate.  When I have asked questions in the past about the Sellafield issue, I have been informed by Ministers replying to the questions that their information is that the level of radiation is not serious etc., and equally questions to health authorities are apt to have a somewhat similar reply but the public are entitled to know how the information supplied to me is arrived at, how the water and the air are monitored and how the information supplied to me is arrived at, how the water and the air are monitored and how the information is evaluated. I do not know, and the public do not <Col N="1546" /> know.  As my question was ruled out, I had hoped that the Minister for Energy might make some reference to that situation this evening but all he said was that the monitoring system operated by the Nuclear Energy Board has been adequate to determine the level of radioactivity.  A further speaker from the Government side should give me the information I require.  I would refer to the fact that the Minister in the course of his speech mentioned the number of discharges into the Irish Sea and expressed satisfaction that a prompt notification procedure was agreed at a meeting.  Notification of more recent incidents have been practically immediate.  I quote from page five of the Minister's speech: &ldquo;No one can predict the long term effects of the discharges to the Irish Sea&rdquo;.  Early notification is not what is needed but a complete stop to the leakages which can only be achieved by closing down the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>A major difficulty we face in endeavouring to deal with this extremely serious problem is the fact that there is a total lack of faith and justifiably so, in the veracity of the management at Sellafield. For many years while this industry was operating we have had no information whatsoever about the processing plant there.  Now, because of circumstances outside the control of the Sellafield management, we know that for years problems arose at Sellafield because of accidents about which no announcements were made by management and about which the workers in that plant could not speak because of the Official Secrets Act. They each had to sign a declaration of secrecy.  Very serious accidents which occurred in more recent times and which it was found were impossible to cloak have changed all that and the matter has become an international issue, and for the first time here the gravity of the matter, which we on this side of the House raised some years ago, is beginning to get the attention it deserves. However, we still face enormous difficulties in getting at the truth.  This is a multimillion business with enormous sums of money utilised by BNF in a PRO exercise to paint the best possible picture of the <Col N="1547" /> industry.  I am convinced that unless a team of international experts are given access to Sellafield to carry out a thorough investigation into the safety aspect of the plant and until we have a group of international experts monitoring the operation on a regular basis, we are going to drift into a crisis situation and then taking action will be too late and totally ineffective.  We now know that a small earthquake, such as was experienced recently in Britain, striking closer to the Sellafield area could have devastating results.  The proposals in the Government amendment falls far short of what is necessary.  The Government have been conveying the Irish public's concern for quite some time to the UK Government and the Taoiseach has written to the British Prime Minister on the matter, only to be told in every instance that there is no problem whatever at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>We are now aware that we were given misinformation in the past by the Sellafield authorities.  The Black report proves that BNF cannot be trusted.  Whether or not the information being supplied at present both by the British Government and the Sellafield authorities is true or false, past experience ensures that the public, particularly here in Ireland, but to quite an extent in Britain as well, will be very suspicious of it and will rightly be very unhappy in the knowledge that nothing will be done about possible health hazards.  From now on we can only be satisfied with the findings of international experts and in the interim the plant must be closed.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister for Energy that Deputy Kirk and I asked the then Minister for Industry and Energy on Thursday, 17 November 1983 if he proposed to seek the setting up of an international body to inquire into incidents of nuclear pollution at Windscale, now Sellafield.  The Minister's reply was that he was informed by the Nuclear Energy Board that the extent of the exposure in Ireland to radioactivity from discharges of effluent from Windscale was less than 1 per cent of the accepted EC safety limit and was also less than 1 per cent of the <Col N="1548" /> recommended limit set out by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention that it now appears to be accepted that nobody knows what the danger level of radioactivity is.  The risks are unknown and in the circumstances it is obvious that it would have been a much more sensible approach by the Minister at the time of our question if he had further questioned the Nuclear Energy Board's submission to him and if he had proceeded to negotiate with other countries with the object of setting up the international body proposed by us then.</P>
    <P>In the remainder of his reply to us the Minister stated that Ireland had on several occasions indicated to the UK and to various international bodies our opposition to the discharge of radioactive effluent and dumping of radioactive waste at sea.  From our experience now of the attitudes of those involved in this multi-million pound industry, both the British Government and British Nuclear Fuels, it is clear that simply drawing attention to these problems is far from sufficient and that an international grouping must be formed to monitor the whole nuclear industry.  At Sellafield, safety precautions are now, and have been for a long time, clearly inadequate.  Indeed, an ITV programme recently pinpointed the discharge of a million gallons of effluent into the Irish Sea, and this in itself points to the failure, so far, of the Irish Government to ensure that this grave problem is properly tackled.</P>
    <P>In her reply to the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister stated that Sellafield represented the highest standards of safety and she described its past record as excellent.  From our present knowledge of this accident-prone industry, it is clear that these assurances by the British Prime Minister are totally unacceptable, more particularly when no neutral observer could possibly consider the monitoring bodies cited by her to be unbiased or independent scientific bodies.  Her reliance, for example, on a body which originally planned the Windscale discharges <Col N="1549" /> into the Irish Sea emphasises the weakness of her case, but equally underlines the need for an independent international scientific body to monitor Sellafield's operation.  I would also make the point that the workers in the Sellafield plant, the inhabitants of the area around it and many groupings in Great Britain itself are now deeply concerned about the health hazards related to this plant.</P>
    <P>On the east coast of Ireland, and in my constituency particularly, we are anxious that we get the real truth.  If the truth is that, and all reports point to this, the emissions are harmful then Sellafield must be closed down.  If the argument of the British Government and BNF is that there is really no danger, and this is highly unlikely, then it is equally important that we should know this, but the information must come from an impeccable source, not from groupings or individuals who are involved in the business and in whose interest it is to continue the operation and, equally, of course, this must entail the closure of the plant now to allow for the investigation.</P>
    <P>I am especially concerned about truth in this matter, because rumours and stories circulating here in respect of health hazards can have a very serious detrimental effect on our tourist industry and on the consumption of certain foodstuffs. There is only one way in which these rumours can be scotched and that is that there be an acceptance that the emissions and effluent discharges are shown to be dangerous and the plant be closed down and the problem thereby eliminated.  The matter must be cleared up and cleared up quickly.</P>
    <P>The whole question of radioactivity from discharges of effluent from Sellafield has now become not only a national issue but indeed an international one. While I am glad to note this general interest I feel that the matter should have been treated more seriously by the Government when first raised by Deputy Kirk and Deputy G. Brady and myself some years ago.  We became particularly concerned about the matter when we read a report by two Irish doctors in a British medical journal linking the births <Col N="1550" /> in my constituency of a number of Down's Syndrome babies with a nuclear accident at Windscale, now Sellafield, and we asked the Minister for Health if he had seen that report and if he was aware of the deep concern and apprehension in respect of the matter in the constituency of Louth.  The Minister replied that a link between the births and the nuclear accident at Windscale had not been established.</P>
    <P>I wish to make the point that the doctors concerned, who were highly reputable people, appeared to have established such a link.  I would like to learn from the Minister if this matter has been followed up over the past couple of years and if any conclusion has been reached in respect of it.  It is very necessary that the facts in this case should also be made available to the public and if after investigations the Minister is satisfied a link has since been established then the Government should present the British Government with this information.  I would remind the Minister that in the area around Sellafield in Britain quite a number of people were stricken with an illness the incidence of which was ten times greater than the national average and yet it was stated that there was no relationship there either between the incidence of the disease and the nuclear plant at Sellafield, which stretches credibility somewhat, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>I think that we must accept, until proved otherwise, that there is a threat to the health and to the lives of people involved in the Sellafield operation, not only to people living and working in the area but to people along the east coast of this country and particularly in my constituency.  We do not wish to overreact. The facts are, however that because of misinformation in the past, it is understandable that we should have strong doubts as to whether the data made available to us by British Nuclear Fuels, or, indeed by the British Government, can be relied upon.  From whom does the British Government obtain this data?  Is it from the Sellafield authorities? The facts are that misinformation has been handed out for many years and this <Col N="1551" /> does not inspire confidence.  We should also remind ourselves that the plant itself is old and there has been a failure over the years to improve safety standards there.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that there must be a thorough investigation into the whole Sellafield operation.  Apart from an investigation into the plant, all the evidence in respect of health on both sides of the Irish Sea must be thoroughly investigated and action taken.  It will not suffice any longer simply to say that the incidents at Sellafield had resulted in only slight contamintion and that it was within the limits laid down internationally; nor can we confine ourselves to the contamination of water only.  The effects of air emissions must also be monitored.  Let me repeat that an international group must be in charge of the investigation and of the monitoring. Nothing else will have any credibility.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament recently demanded that the processing plant at Sellafield be shut down.  This desision was reached after a debate to which many members contributed.  All through that debate, even among those who did not favour closure, there was clearly a complete loss of confidence in the management. We must have particular regard for this decision.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat, the Sellafield nuclear processing plant must be closed now and proper investigation carried out at once.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion tabled by Fianna Fáil is very timely.  It comes at a time when very serious incidents have taken place and this had given great cause for concern about the Sellafield plant, particularly to everybody in Ireland.  Sellafield was formerly known as Windscale and during that time a number of serious accidents took place which called into question the desirability of continuing to operate the plant for safety reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every country very rigid regulations have been introduced in every type of factory to ensure the maximum safety for workers and others who may come into contact with the operations, but here we are considering a plant using radioactive <Col N="1552" /> material.  It superimposes a grave obligation on the authorities to ensure that every possible safety measure is taken and that no risks whatever would be imposed on anybody coming into contact with such a plant.  Experts in Britain have expresed grave fears about Sellafield and many have called for its closure, particularly following the most recent incidents when a number of workers were contaminated by radioactive material.</P>
    <P>Though Sellafield is located in another country, its geographical location is far too close to Ireland for comfort, particularly on the east coast.  It is even more disquieting to know that tons of radioactive waste are being pumped into the Irish Sea.  Tests carried out to sea life have indicated a very high degree of radioactivity.  We have been assured that the extent is not so great as to cause concern to humans, but very few people accept that, and the knowledge that the Irish Sea is the most radioactive stretch in Europe gives cause for great alarm and concern.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances it is a fundamental responsibility of the Irish Government to call for the closure of Sellafield and to end the very realistic fears we have on this side of the Irish Sea.  After the Taoiseach's recent meeting with the British Prime Minister we were told that Sellafield was not the serious threat it was supposed to be, though the Taoiseach had expressed fears and anxieties.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach must be much tougher.  We should be calling for the closure of Sellafield, as many people in Britain have been doing for some time. A recent report indicates clearly that Sellafield is a radioactive time bomb.  It is common knowledge that it has a very serious design fault which could lead to a disaster from a minor earth tremor.  The report points out that a minor tremor would destroy key bolts holding up the reactor which in an accident would cause an uncontrollable fire and discharge a very high level of radioactivity.  The possibility of this happening is one in 500, whereas the safety standards adopted for new plants is one in ten million.</P>
    <P>Earth tremors on this side of the world <Col N="1553" /> have become much more powerful in recent years.  One has only to recall the experience in Dublin in 1984 when an unusually strong tremor hit the city.  The main force of the tremor was in the Irish Sea.  This was an experience unknown to Irish people.  It increases the risk of a similar occurrence in Cumbria which would have a devastating effect on Ireland following a massive radioactive fallout from Sellafield in such circumstances. The British Prime Minister on a number of occasions recently has said that Sellafield will not be closed down.  That shows very scant regard for the environment and not only for the Irish people but for the very large population of Cumbria.</P>
    <P>It has been made clear that information relating to a number of incidents at the plant have been suppressd.  There has been far too much secrecy and far too many falsehoods surrounding incidents which originally were denied but which subsequently we discovered were not only true but of a very serious nature. The British Prime Minister recently characterised some of these incidents as trivial.  What is trivial about humans being exposed to leakages of radioactive material, particularly to plutonium seepage? Scientists have proved that a dust mould of plutonium in a small animal's lung can provoke a massive fibrosis big enough to kill within months.  What terrible effect, therefore, would a severe leakage carried by strong winds have on the communities located within hundreds of miles of the plant?  The effect on the population would be devastating and according to experts it takes only one-thousandth of a gram of plutonium to cause a serious cancer which would be fatal within one year.  Surely it is no coincidence that the incidence of cancer and leukaemia in certain areas geographically located closer to Sellafield is much higher than anywhere else in the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Wednesday when coming to the end of my speech, I referred to the contribution made in this House by the Minister for Agriculture speaking in the budget debate.  He referred to the difficulties he experienced in Europe, particularly with regard to the production of milk, beef and grains. These are three of the most important commodities as far as our economy is concerned and any difficulties, especially in relation to price increases or with regard to quotas, would have a very serious effect on our economy.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the cessation scheme as proposed by the Commission.  That scheme would have a considerable adverse impact on the economy.  It must be totally resisted by the Government and the Minister would have the full support of every Member of this House in opposing any such scheme.  It poses a severe threat to our national interests. One would regard it as having almost the same dimension as the super-levy when first introduced.  I would see it as the thin end of the wedge if the Commission was able to pursue a policy of this nature with regard to meat production, above all in relation to this country.  We could see more punitive measures introduced at some later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk accounts for 33 per cent of gross agricultural output and is directly responsible for the employment of 11,000 people.  At a time when unemployment is at a critical high level we should not <Col N="1555" /> accept any measure of that nature.  All the farming organisations have unified in their condemnation of such proposals. They have asked the Government, the Minister and all with any power or sway within the European scene to resist this measure.  One could refer to the levy and the deal drawn up with the special concessions which we were given and for which we fought very strongly as being completely violated by the present proposal. I was somewhat disappointed that some additional funding was not provided in the budget to enable a restructuring scheme of the order of that now being pursued by some of the co-operatives; not all the co-operatives are co-operating in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is only now that we are beginning to realise the full impact of the super-levy and its effect particularly on young farmers coming into milk production or farmers who are in the process of expansion, who have reached a quota level and cannot get sufficient additional gallonage to enable them to pursue milk production properly.  I impress on the Minister that under no circumstances must there be any falling back from the position adopted and supported in 1984, a position for which we fought so strongly.</P>
    <P>I referred very briefly last Monday to the three major areas within the budget &mdash; borrowing, taxation and unemployment. I want to refer now very briefly to taxation.  There are major changes in the taxation system which are directed essentially towards easing the burden of income tax payments generally and especially on the PAYE sector.  We have seen for so long the crippling burden particularly on the PAYE taxpayer and this budget has attempted to redress the situation somewhat.  The Government have decided that substantial reductions in income tax should be the priority.  These will result in increases in disposable income and will encourage higher economic activity, contrary to what the Opposition might claim.  To provide the revenue needed for these increases, it is essential to increase substantially the tax yield from the activities of the financial <Col N="1556" /> institutions and I shall refer to that later. We are now aware of the principal changes that are taking place in the income tax area.  Perhaps the most important is the dropping of the 1 per cent income levy which will cause a considerable and very welcome reduction in the level of taxation across the PAYE sector.  The personal allowances have been increased, perhaps in line with inflation, but we should like to see more increases there.  However, there is a reduction in a full year of about £200 million for the PAYE sector and about £121 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable criticism of the national plan, <i>Building on Reality.</i> This Government have attempted in a very urgent way to reduce the level of taxation on the PAYE sector in line with what was proposed in that plan.  Over the period of the plan, which will operate for almost one more year, that will continue to be done.  The income tax packet in this budget goes way beyond what was promised and committed to in the plan. Taken in conjunction with the increase in child benefits these are welcome improvements for the taxpayer.  The Opposition have continuously drawn attention to the fact that the income tax yield in 1986 will be considerably higher than it was in 1985 and that perhaps is so, in arithmitic terms.  I am not afraid to quote the figures for the House.  In 1986 the post budget yield will be of the order of £2,356 million whereas the outturn for 1985 was £2,103 million.  That is a predicted increase of £253 million.  What we have not taken into account and what the Opposition do not refer to is the fact that wages have increased even faster now in real terms than inflation.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in office from 1977 to 1981, and in particular in the latter two years of that term of office, inflation was running at two and three points above 20 per cent.  In May of 1982 it was running at 23.4 per cent and wage increases were of the order of 10 per cent, so in real terms there was a reduction in what people were earning.  Consequently, although one might refer to the fact that taxation was not increasing at <Col N="1557" /> that time, in reality it was increasing at a high level.</P>
    <P>What has given rise to the greatest level of criticism, not necessarily only from politicians but from other sections also, has been the taxation of financial institutions. This is a change of major proportions. The existing arrangements for the taxation of deposit interest are unsatisfactory and have been a source of considerable friction as institutions claimed that their competitors enjoyed an unfair advantage.  I referred briefly to that last week.  We have a 28 per cent retention tax on investments in building societies. Banks did not have that retention tax and they have been demanding that the situation be changed and a more equitable tax introduced.  That has been done now, but there are anomalies.  All forms of taxtion bring anomalies with them.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Bill we will have an opportunity to bring in amendments which can change and rectify any penal anomalies on certain sections of the nontax paying community.  I refer in particular to the savings of pensioners, children or even charitable institutions.  In a postbudget submission the Minister pointed to the fact that these savings could be put into Post Office saving investments, the credit unions and Government gilts and would not attract taxation, unless there was already a liability for taxation.  Even though people may not understand or may not wish to understand this, under existing law children who may have piggy bank account are liable to taxation if their parents are liable to taxation.  There is no major change there.  In fact, there is tax avoidance in this area which has gone undetected for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>What is happening now is that the Revenue Commissioners are admitting that they failed to collect the level of taxation due on deposit interest over the years and now they are advocating a system whereby at least they will get something on a retention basis.  I suggest that the Minister for Finance seriously examine ways and means of not imposing taxation on anybody who is not liable to pay tax. I do not believe such a system would be difficult to operate.  In America each <Col N="1558" /> taxpayer has an obligation to submit a return at the end of the year and get a balancing statement.  Many taxpayers do the same thing here.  It should not be difficult for a person who is not liable to pay tax to submit a form and demand a refund.  I do not accept that administratively that would be difficult.  It would be far more difficult, more time consuming and need more manpower to collect the different taxes under this system.  Again, I strongly suggest the Minister modify and amend the anomaly which clearly exists in this type of taxation.</P>
    <P>There have been changes in the capital taxation system, and not before time. Many people in industry are crippled because of taxation and this is acting as a serious disincentive to additional investment in jobs.  This is something we must look at very seriously in the years ahead. This will not be easy to do, but it will be done piecemeal.  Unemployment is still very high.  In the early eighties it was rising at the rate of 40,000 each year and now it is rising at approximately 5,000 a year.  That is an unacceptable level. Every effort should be made to improve direct investment in industry in a way that will provide real and sustainable jobs. In the value-added tax area there were considerable modifications made last year, to the advantage of a large section of industry.  This year the Minister has gone a stage further and has given a considerable boost to the tourist industry which I hope will respond by providing the necessary jobs.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the health provision under this budget, and in particular to the closure of hospitals.  There was a debate in this House on the announcement made by the Minister for Health. We all know what he is trying to do but what is important is how he can achieve that, given the funds available, and at the same time provide the best possible service.  The closure of psychiatric hospitals piecemeal is not the best way to approach this problem.  There have been consultations, particularly in relation to the proposed closure of St. Dympna's.  I am confident that that hospital will not close and the Minister should make a <Col N="1559" /> statement to this effect as soon as possible to allay any fears particularly of people who have been institutionalised over a long period.  I also ask him to announce, as soon as possible, the date for the commencement of the regional hospital at Ardkeen, Waterford.  That has been on the stocks for a long time.  This hospital is very badly needed.  The South-Eastern Health Board area has not done well in relation to capital projects &mdash; other health board areas have done better.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this budget is in harmony with the objectives set out in the national plan.  It aims to achieve the best possible balance between the obligation to improve public finances and to improve the climate for full employment. Also, it marks further progress on the reform of the taxation system.  This reform had already begun.  It began last year, has been carried into this year, will be carried into 1987 and will continue to improve as years go on, irrespective of what Government are in office.</P>
    <P>The constraints imposed on the Government in preparing this budget have to be acknowledged.  There was little room for manoeuvre because of the difficulties of the final situation.  These difficulties will not go away overnight, irrespective of what the Opposition say. Despite this, however, the Government have recognised the urgent necessity to reduce the burden of personal taxation and the largest income tax reductions for several years are being made.  I congratulate the outgoing Minister for Finance.  I am sorry his Ministry has been changed because I thought he was a remarkable Minister.  I welcome the new Minister who has the ability to carry on where his predecessor left off.  They are both very capable, able and diligent and I am confident that the country will benefit from their experience and commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this budget contains nothing to relieve the air of depression which has affected people in the last three years.  It could be described as a plus and minus budget.  There was no incentive given to people out of the <Col N="1560" /> recession which has deepened over the past three years through the mismanagement of this Government.  This budget is a continuation of existing Government policies.  Indeed the year 1985 could well be described as the worst year in history for this nation and its people, a year in which economic growth was at a standstill and unemployment reached its highest ever level.  The outlook is indeed gloomy with the provisions of this latest budget. As far as this Government are concerned people no longer count.  The Government are endeavouring to save this country at the expense of its people and their families; they are engaging in a bookkeeping exercise.</P>
      <P>Government economic policies are breaking up family life, placing the family under severe pressure, even undermining its existence.  It should be remembered that the family comprises the basic fabric of this nation and that of future generations. This Government's crazy policies and poor management are breaking up that fabric.  Yet they claim to be the most progressive Government with regard to social issues.  If their economic policies were geared towards helping the family then those social issues would no longer constitute a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused to hear my colleague, Deputy Dowling, talk about the relief given to taxpayers in this budget.  I would call such relief lollipops or pennies from heaven.  They are an insult to the over-taxed, indeed, to the heaviest taxed people in Europe.  The pennies from heaven being handed out by the Minister for Finance are an insult to their intelligence. The rate of taxation is unbelievably high here.  A single person earning approximately £10,000 per annum is paying 60p in the £.  In addition, he must pay contributions to a widows' and orphans' fund, PRSI, levies on income, employment and health contributions, all of which mean that such a person pays over 20 per cent in the £ on top of his highest tax band.  The net effect is that such a single person takes home approximately £5,500 or 55 per cent of his total income. Nobody on the Government side could contend that such a single person <Col N="1561" /> is not over-taxed.  I would contend that he is one of the most heavily taxed people in Europe today.  How could such a single person save money to purchase or build a house when he may get married?  It is impossible for any worker on such a salary to save sufficient for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The position becomes worse as one's salary increases, when there is a larger proportion taken by way of tax.  For example, a man earning, say, £15,000 per annum will take home only a little over 50 per cent of his salary.  This means that when people want to get married they will have insufficient moneys saved to purchase a home.  In turn that means such people must borrow and today £25,000 will cost approximately £330 a month or £80 a week.  Most people are unable to carry such repayments which means that their wives must remain working in order to pay their mortgage and put food on the table.  Working wives are regarded as being well-heeled but the truth is that they are the new poor in our society.  The Government have introduced subsidies, grants and so on to alleviate the problem. The problem itself is brought about by the system of income tax under which people are not allowed to retain sufficient of their earnings with which to build their futures.  There is, instead, a merry-go-round of civil servants handing back something taken unjustly in the first instance.  That is the crazy situation which obtains.</P>
    <P>One sees vacancies for posts advertised in the newspapers but the hard fact is that they are worth only 50 per cent of the stated salaries because the remainder goes to the Revenue Commissioners.  We can see also that the family, as a unit, is being undermined by Government policies. I will give two examples of what I mean in regard to interest relief.  Take a person who is endeavouring to provide a member of his family with third level education and who needs to borrow money for that purpose.  There is no relief given in respect of interest paid on any such loan.  It is a disgrace that people endeavouring to do the best for their families in difficult circumstances are not <Col N="1562" /> allowed claim interest on the loan to educate them while, at the same time, wealthy business people can claim interest on extra investment by them to increase their wealth.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise the good work being done by families.</P>
    <P>Another area in which relief could be granted is in regard to loans for the purchase of cars, the second largest investment any householder makes, the costs for which can have a dramatic effect on any household budget.  A car is a necessity today for most households, particularly for people lucky enough to have a job.  This Government have not allowed relief in respect of interest on car loans. This has resulted in people purchasing secondhand cars because of the high loan repayments on new ones.  It would be of advantage to Government revenue if people purchased new cars because the amount of tax on them is much greater. Such relief would lighten the burden for most householders.  Motor tax has been increased again this year and motor insurance premiums are sky high.  Often in country areas when young people are offered jobs, in order to get to and from their place of employment their parents must buy them a car.  In many such instances the cost of insurance is greater than that of the car, and I am not exaggerating. I appeal to the Minister to give this matter some consideration.</P>
    <P>It will have been noted that in order to qualify for a grant for home improvements the necessary work must be carried out by a registered builder, the aim being that all taxes due are collected.  I would ask the Minister to consider some such subsidisation for the family, by allowing people to claim expenses against income tax in respect of, say, doctors', dentists', solicitors', accountancy and veterinary fees.  At least some proportion of such fees should be allowed against their income tax liability provided receipts for such expenditure are retained.  This would introduce more equity into the taxation system for the already hard-pressed income tax payer.  It would also assist in the determination of the income of some of those professional people who are <Col N="1563" /> regarded as not paying their fair share of taxation.  In this respect I apologise to nobody.  There are many professional people who are becoming richer daily at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer. Regardless of the amount of revenue I believe that justice should be seen to be done.  By allowing the ordinary taxpayer some element of those expenses the Government would be catching those fat cats in the tax net, especially when there is so much unemployment and gloom about.</P>
    <P>I might make a few suggestions by way of summing up.  The tax allowances should be higher to give people a start in life.  Such a move would help to do away with many of the subsidies and so on that have been introduced to help people. Subsidies would not be needed if there was a decent tax relief for the over-taxed. Parents should be allowed to claim on the interest on loans borrowed to educate their children and people should be allowed claim for the interest paid on car loans.  People should be allowed to claim some portion of family expenses, such as those for doctors, dentists, solicitors, accountants, vets and auctioneers.  I appeal to the Minister to consider those suggestions.</P>
    <P>I was shocked today to hear the Taoiseach's response to the request by Deputy Lenihan to allow Government time to discuss the serious crisis in agriculture. I made a similar appeal on two occasions last week but without success. I appeal to the Taoiseach again to allow Government time to discuss a crisis that is getting worse daily.  The milk super-levy negotiations were handled very poorly but that problem will look like a storm in a teacup compared with what will happen if there is not support for beef intervention and if there is a levy on grain.  Those two issues will have to be sorted out to the satisfaction of our farmers or otherwise we will be back to where we were in 1974.  Our cattle trade will collapse, farmers will suffer and thousands of jobs will be lost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> It is disappointing to note that agriculture was scarcely mentioned in the budget.  The grant-in-aid for 1986 for the Farmer Apprenticeship Board has been severely cut.  I heard the chairman of that board on radio this evening being critical of the Minister for Finance in regard to that.  There has also been a cut in the allocation to ACOT.  I expect that before the year is out some of our agricultural colleges will have to close down, adding to the litany of closures that the Government have been associated with or the cause of in the last three years.  Many industries, colleges and hospitals have been closed down by the Government.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the hardship he is imposing on the farming community at this critical time. The farming community will have to pay if they request assistance from agricultural advisers and later they will have to pay land tax.  When considering those charges we must remember that farmers have had to contend with a drop in their income in the last five or six years, something that no other section of the community has had to face.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the banks and lending institutions who in the last six to nine months have been quietly but viciously putting great pressure on small farmers, small businessmen and those who borrowed money in recent years. The banks and lending institutions must accept a lot of the blame for the state of our nation today.  In the mid and late seventies money was forked out to almost everybody by the banks.  One could buy a farm, or half a dozen farms, over the phone but now when things are going bad the banks and lending institutions want to put everybody to the wall.  The Minister for Finance should have a hard look at the way the banks are treating our people.  Letters are being sent to decent hard working people who because of a reduced income as a result of decisions made in Brussels are unable to meet their repayments.  Some of them, as a result of brucellosis and TB in their herds, have lost a lot of their stock.  Those people are getting the rough end of the stick from the lending institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> I was annoyed to read recently that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, a bank set up for the purpose of providing finance for the agricultural industry, have now decided to utilise money, provided at a cheap rate by the European Investment Bank, to stabilise their own finances at the expense of the farming community. It is a national scandal that they are to cook the books again, like the Minister for Finance, at the expense of the ordinary farmer.  That organisation is putting pressure on farmers.  The story about the EIB money was reported in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> this week.</P>
    <P>The Opposition should be given time by the Government to highlight the dangers that face the farming community. Our views could be used by the Government in their efforts to get a good deal in Brussels.  I have not been a Member of the House for long but during my time here I have seen a lot of time wasted on silly things by both sides.  The effect of a reduction in the support of intervention for beef will be severe.  In 1986 100,000 tonnes will be covered and that figure will increase to 150,000 tonnes in 1987 and 200,000 tonnes in 1988.  The crisis will deepen if we do not go to Brussels and demand special treatment for our farmers.</P>
    <P>A study by the IFA has shown that there would have been a price drop of 13p per 1b if the 400,000 tonnes of beef sold into intervention had been sold on the EC market.  The potential loss to producers has been estimated at £147 million or 36 per cent of net income. That is a shocking position but yet the Taoiseach does not consider it important enough to debate in the House.  It will be debated on the day after the fair but fairs and marts will be very scarce if the issue is not debated in the House in the next couple of weeks.  The figures I have given show the serious problems affecting Irish farmers, meat factories and the many people employed in the meat industry. This is the most serious threat to the country for years.  Since 83 per cent of our beef is exported the effect of the EC move will be far greater on us than on other EC countries. It will be more <Col N="1566" /> serious than the super-levy, the effects of which are being felt throughout the country.  Milk is being poured down the drain because farmers cannot sell it.</P>
    <P>Another problem facing Irish farmers is that our exports to Third World countries are not as strong as we would like them to be.  The Taoiseach should treat that as a major problem.  He should address himself to the large amounts of beef imported into the EC from outside. That represents a major problem for Irish farmers and the Community as a whole. There will have to be a successful outcome to that problem.</P>
    <P>I read an article in today's issue of <i>The Irish Press</i> under the heading: &ldquo;Exporters lose out at top Fair&rdquo;, which stated:</P>
    <P>A major Irish meat company is selling its products from a stand housing the British food section of the giant Alimentaria Food Fair in Barcelona, because there was no State encouragement for Irish representation, it was claimed yesterday.</P>
    <P>As a result, Irish food exporters may already have lost access to vast new markets in the Mediterranean and Latin-American world, Irish businessmen at the fair believe.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bill Maher, sales director for the £100 million per year Master Meats Group, said that he had to take a stand in the British foods area because Córas Tráchtála (CTT) and CBF, the livestock and meat board, showed no interest in getting Irish company's produce into this vital &ldquo;shop window&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is a shocking state of affairs.  Are we facing a collapse of the meat trade? The article continued:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We feel that we are obliged to come here in the interests of the Irish farmers and indeed, the Irish economy.  This market is vitally important and it is the springboard to other markets which have been closed to Irish exporters&rdquo;, said Mr. Maher.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But if we had to come here and sell under a Russian flag, we would do that, because we see it as very important for Irish food processing to get out here <Col N="1567" /> and sell.  It is really disappointing that CTT and CBF do not seem to realise that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the statements made by Mr. Maher, and it is shocking that we are not debating it.  Mr. Maher also said:</P>
    <P>Other meat companies, including the Anglo-Irish group, Dawn Meats and Halal, were also represented at the Alimentaria Fair hoping for a slice of a new Spanish market worth £20 million this year (but expected to grow to over £100 million within the next decade).</P>
    <P>However, they all complained that their business negotiations are seriously hampered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was just highlighting the position.  Mr. Maher said that their business negotiations were seriously hampered by the absence of an Irish stand where they could carry on business in a professional manner.</P>
      <P>A senior executive of CBF, Mr. Aidan Archer, arrived in Barcelona last Sunday and he said that it was expected that Ireland would be strongly represented at the next Barcelona Fair in two years time. Live horse and you will get grass.  With 250,000 buyers from 70 countries present, it was felt that this year, with Spain's entry to the EC, was the time to get a foot in the door.  Unfortunately, CTT and CBF seem to be asleep in their over-heated offices as they did not support the industries who would like to have displayed their goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal briefly with the reduction in ACOT's budget.  In 1985 it was £18,335,000 and this figure was reduced to £17,296,000 in 1986 &mdash; a reduction of 6 per cent, or £1,039,000.  This is a very serious reduction and, when inflation is taken into consideration, it is a drop of 12 per cent in real terms.  When we look at the general administration of the Department of Agriculture we see that <Col N="1568" /> the cost in 1985 was £62,855,000 but that the estimate for 1986 is £66,837,000, or an increase of 6.33 per cent.  In other words, civil servants can decide to increase Estimates for their own Departments by 6 per cent and to reduce the estimate for ACOT by 6 per cent.  Their increase of 6 per cent will cost an extra £4 million, but the reduction in the Estimate for ACOT will cost only £1 million.  Salaries are estimated to rise in the Department by just over £3 million and travelling expenses are expected to rise by £0.5 million, a total of £3.5 million, which is an increase of over three times the reduction in ACOT's budget.  That is a national scandal.</P>
    <P>The total budget for agriculture is £229,145,000 and the general administration cost is put at £66,837,000, an increase of 30 per cent.  We now know where the money is going &mdash; not on the farmer but on well heated offices for civil servants. The figures show that the reduction in ACOT's budget at 6 per cent is the highest percentage cut on anybody under the Department of Agriculture and shows how the civil servants in Dublin view any service to help farmers.  They can have an increase in their own Estimate by 6 per cent but reduce a vital service by 6 per cent.  The closer the Department get to the people they really depend on, farmers, the greater the cut. In the eyes of civil servants the farmers are just a nuisance.  However, there is an old and true saying that when the farmers are down the nation is down.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture will go to Brussels and strike a hard deal there.  In the national interests I wish them well because thousands of jobs depend on farming.  We should add Government Departments to the many white elephants like CIE because of the cost of their general administration. There is no penny pinching in Government Departments but there is penny pinching in regard to anything which affects agriculture.  This will affect the advisory input to farmers and it could not have happened at a worse time with quotas on milk production and talk of <Col N="1569" /> quotas in beef and cereals.  The only way farmers have of increasing their income is through increased efficiency and it is in this area that the cut in ACOT's budget will affect the advisory service to farmers. It would be interesting to know what the IDA services cost the taxpayer.  Why should the farmer be penalised because he needs advice?  His income has dropped over the last five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are paying too much tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of them do not have a taxable income.  I do not know about the farmers in County Louth.  The Deputy has put me off course but the Government have put the country off course.  I wish to emphasise that it is very unfair of the Minister for Agriculture to allow the Minister for Finance to be penny-pinching in regard to agriculture, especially with the advisory service at this critical time.  It is very hard on young farmers unless they have a good milk quota, because they cannot grow beet. There is not much profit in beef although there is a little leeway in regard to sheep production.  A farm today does not provide a very good livelihood for many farmers and that is why they need an advisory service.  It is strange that, when ACOT established a specialised advisory service, the administration in Dublin should see fit to cut that budget by 6 per cent.  Every rural Deputy should exert as much pressure as possible on the Minister to alter the situation.  About 15 years ago we had only four or five advisers in each county and, because of the cut in the budget, the same situation will apply this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you look at the reduction of £1 million in the Estimate for ACOT and compare it with the prison service, you will see that salaries, wages and allowances in 1985 were £31,929,000 and in 1986 they will be £37,529,000, an increase of £5.6 million or 18 per cent.  Salaries, wages and allowances in other Departments are increased by 9 per cent and it shows the confidence which the Government have in agriculture.  Is it any wonder that we <Col N="1570" /> get a poor showing in Brussels when our own Government treat agriculture in this manner?  Many schemes have been discontinued in the past three years though these schemes were fought hard for.  Included among those are the lime subsidy scheme, the AI subsidy scheme and many others in respect of which moneys could be got from Brussels. Instead, for the purpose of a bookkeeping exercise and to satisfy civil servants those grants were discontinued.  Apart from the loss to the farmers this involved also job losses.  The lime industry is almost at a standstill and with thousands of cows being slaughtered throughout Europe as a result of the super-levy, there is now a crisis in the beef area.</P>
    <P>Regardless of who are in Government, we are entitled to special consideration in the areas of beef, lamb and milk, products that do not require any imported materials.  We got no special deal so far as the super-levy was concerned.  We made a hames of that and became the laughing stock of Europe.  We did not get the sums right and were left in the position of having to return the following year to have matters rectified instead of being in a position then to look for something else.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to ensure that at least a one day debate takes place in the House to allow us the opportunity to support himself and the Minister and to urge them to go to Brussels in an attempt to work out a deal that would save jobs as well as saving the livelihoods of farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister's predecessor on this budget and I wish him well in his new post.  I wish the new Minister well also in his post.  I am confident that he will continue the good work of his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general appeal of this budget must be viewed against the backdrop, not of the budget of last year or of the previous year, but in terms of budgets of a number of previous years.  Listening to Opposition speakers in this debate so far decrying this year's budget one wonders whether we are talking about the same <Col N="1571" /> provisions.  I say this in the context of the budgets of, for instance, 1979, 1980 and 1981 when the people opposite had control. These same people are bemoaning a shortfall in the Estimates this year of between £45 million and £55 million but they did not appear to be surprised when only a few short years ago the overrun could well have been to the extent of £150 million or even up to £500 million.  The people opposite seem to have forgotten that.  However, it may be a sign of the times that even a small overrun or difficulty now attracts so much attention from the Opposition.  This proves that at least they recognise that the Government are set on the course of doing a difficult job and are intent on completing that job.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Opposition have the right to criticise errors, overruns or shortfalls but in doing that they should have regard to previous performances by their members when they held the various portfolios in Government.  As I said here on another occasion, all I can recall about the 1970 budget is that turnover tax, as it was known then, was increased from 2½ to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Opposition is the basic stone of democracy but when I came into this House first I had difficulty in understanding why the Opposition should oppose at all times. Presumably, because of the system we operate, the party I represent behaved in a similar way when they were in Opposition though I should like to think that was not the case.  We should be much more careful when we oppose because opposition for the sake of opposition can leave many people, particularly the young, disenchanted with politics.  Therefore, we should oppose for the right reasons only.</P>
    <P>During the past three years there has had to be a certain amount of curtailment of expenditure in various areas but in that context the Government are doing a good job by way of this budget.  We hear persistent calls nowadays, both from the Opposition benches and from elsewhere for greater cuts in public expenditure and for the obvious consequent realignment of our financial affairs.  Regrettably, what <Col N="1572" /> has been lacking in terms of all those calls has been any indication as to where the cuts might be made.  Many Members call on the Government to deal with white elephants but few are prepared to accept the culling of the white elephants if they should happen to exist and thrive in the constituency of the Deputy concerned. That is another matter we must face up to whether we are in Government or in Opposition.  Cuts are obviously necessary and when they are made they are bound to hurt some people.</P>
    <P>This Government have probably taken the best course possible in the circumstances. When they came to office a few years ago they had the option of enforcing large scale cuts of a very severe nature which would have had a dramatic impact on the whole economy.  We hear claims from many quarters today that that would have been the right way to solve our problems but, if the Government had taken that line, would that sharp short medicine have resolved our difficulties? I should think not.  Shortly after the Government coming into office and prior to their first budget they announced some minor cuts in the school transport area. The announcement necessitated the elected representatives attending various constituency meetings in an effort to explain the reason for the cuts.  This was at a time when there was a general call for cuts in public expenditure in an effort, and a laudable effort, to reduce taxation. Those calling for those cuts were not prepared to accept that they would hurt each and every one of us and would leave many people worse off.  In those circumstances the Government did very well to embark on a slow process of turning the economy around and enabling us to reap the benefits of the changing winds of the world economy.</P>
    <P>It has been done admirably.  This country is poised to take full advantage of whatever benefits will come from changes in the world economy.  If a different policy had been followed, if for instance the massive cuts which some people had advocated had been implemented, I have no doubt that there would have been unemployment on a scale we have not <Col N="1573" /> yet had to comprehend.  That would have been disastrous.  I compliment the Ministers involved in formulating the policy which has brought about a position where we can take advantage of changes occurring outside this country.</P>
    <P>The provisions for public pay in the budget this year and the previous year were in dramatic contrast to provisions for public pay made in the previous five or six years.  During his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The Government's pay policy is that pay increases in Ireland should not exceed the rate of pay increase in competitor countries and that, within this framework, the free collective bargaining system should continue to have regard to the ability of individual employers to pay and to the likely impact of pay settlements on employment. There was a welcome moderation in the level of new pay settlements in Ireland in 1985.  This progress must be maintained ...</P>
    <P>That is probably one of the most important features in this and the previous budget.  For many years we failed to compete in the market-place in the export arena.  Slowly but surely our economy was being futher constricted and ground down.  It could not be and has not been allowed to continue.  In 1985 for the first time since the forties we were able to register a trade surplus, at a time when virtually every country in the world was having economic problems.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to the area of unemployment by comparing the position here with that obtaining in a couple of other countries.  Speakers opposite have said that we have 240,000 people unemployed, which is a sad and desperate situation which cannot be allowed to continue. Let us consider the case of West Germany where a few years ago they did not have an unemployment problem, yet today they have almost three million people unemployed.  Only last week we had reason to speak with representatives from New Zealand where ten years ago they had no unemployment but now they have 100,000 people unemployed.  Ironically <Col N="1574" /> some of those countries would appear not to be in the same position to capitalise on whatever upturn comes in the world economy.  If we consider our own position in relation to those other much more sophisticated and vibrant economies, we have done reasonably well.  We have come a distance without creating too much hardship for people but at the same time imposing a certain amount of restraint without which this country could not continue.  Somebody from outside the country might have had to solve the problems if we had not succeeded in doing so.</P>
    <P>The budget makes provision for social welfare increases across the board from next July.  The main feature of this is quite simply that people who are in the less well off sector of our society will at least have their living standards keep pace with inflation and the cost of living generally.  A major feature in the past three years is that people in that sector have received increases each year which have been more than sufficient to compensate for the rate of inflation.  That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>The budget also provides for the introduction of the promised child benefit scheme &mdash; £15.05 for the first five children and £21.75 for each other child.  There has been much criticism about the Government's policy towards the family and some controversy as to whether certain groups should have received the kind of assistance they have been given.  I know that single parents and deserted wives have been mentioned as getting too much from the system.  In my constituency I deal with quite a lot of queries from deserted wives and single parents, as well as from the elderly and those generally in need of social welfare payments of one kind or another.  One has to deal with the problem at that level to recognise fully the needs of those people. I do not believe that any girl wilfully becomes a single parent in order to get a particular type of social welfare payment. I do not think a wife becomes a deserted wife in order to claim the deserted wife's allowance.  In my experience situations arose which were completely outside the control of the individuals themselves and <Col N="1575" /> it is fortunate that our society is at least compassionate enough to recognise their position and do something for them.  We would be lacking in Christian charity unless we were so doing.</P>
    <P>The budget provides for a reduction in VAT on meals in restaurants and hotels and this should be of considerable benefit to the tourist industry, including our own native tourists.  Perhaps we might see that reflected in our own restaurant in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The hotel and catering industry has been lobbying consistently for this type of reduction.  It has now been reduced from 23 per cent to 10 per cent. Notwithstanding the gloom and doom approach by members of the Opposition, the hotel and catering industry is grateful for the measures taken and has pledged itself to be in a position to respond to the extra market during the summer months. The same reductions also apply to a number of other services including the electrical area, hairdressing, laundry and dry cleaning services, etc.  Incidentally, hairdressing is a sector which is extremely labour intensive and has absorbed thousands of young people who have an opportunity to serve their time to a trade and can provide themselves afterwards with a job.  This is something we should encourage and it is laudable that it is provided for in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the other reasons we have a right to be optimistic at present is the fact that inflation is down considerably.  This has been brought about by careful handling of Government finances.  One must remember that the inflation rate for quite a number of years was considerably in excess of what it was in most other European countries.  I say that in answer to those who now claim that the only reason inflation is down is that it is down worldwide. We always had a fraction of an inch over other countries but now we are in a different situation and in a way in a more competitive position than ever before.  It looks as if the trend will continue, in <Col N="1576" /> which case we will be in an even better position in another year or so.</P>
    <P>I referred briefly to unemployment.  A number of schemes which were provided for in the budget are now beginning to show some success.  I am talking about the enterprise allowance scheme and the social employment scheme.  It was never anticipated that they would be as successful or have as great an impact as they have.  In all the towns around the area in which I live there are people doing the kind of jobs that they were not in a position to do previously.  Local authorities now have access to funds and can employ people under the social employment scheme to carry out the necessary environmental works which have been affected for the last ten years or so.  It will take a couple of years for the country to receive the full benefit of that scheme. It is commendable that the scheme was introduced and that it is working so well.</P>
    <P>A number of Opposition speakers, not only in relation to this budget debate but over the last couple of years, mentioned again and again the sad position of the construction industry.  I do not want to dwell upon it too long now.  Never in the history of the States was there so much money and so many schemes available to the construction industry to utilise and capitalise on.  Never was there such a scheme available that would be of such benefit to the community.  For far too long we ignored the fact that there were a large number of dwelling houses which needed restoration and where people concerned felt that they did not have the necessary finance to undertake the massive work that needed to be done. In the last few weeks 43,000 people got approval for this work.  The value of this in terms of jobs is about 10,000 for the year.  If that does not have some impact on the construction industry then I would be very seriously concerned about exactly what the problem is in that area.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of years there were quite a number of schemes introduced. For instance the person who surrendered his local authority house received a grant of £5,000.  If he was a tenant purchaser he received £2,000 new house grant on <Col N="1577" /> top of that.  Those people are also entitled, depending on the loan scheme, to £3,000 mortgage subsidy.  Comparing that with the assistance available to the construction industry five, six or ten years ago when the only assistance available was the £1,000 grant and, prior to that, £750 or £900 grant depending on the circumstances of the person, it has improved considerably.  The industry needs to reassess its position.  I believe that the problem is that the market is oversupplied.  The amount of money now being made available to the construction industry is such that it should be making a greater impact than it is.</P>
    <P>Interest rates, like inflation, have stabilised and lowered and are still coming down.  From my dealings with local authority loan applications, interest rates are now similar to those that prevailed in 1976.  I did not hear anybody talking much at that time about the high interest rates even though they were high.  We are now living in an era ten years later, and the Government have done exceptionally well in bringing about the situation which exists at present.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about agriculture, the effects of the budget on agriculture and the failure to do something more in this area.  While everything in the garden &mdash; no pun intended &mdash; is not as rosy as one would have liked, given the climatic conditions which the farming community had to bear last year, nonetheless there is still a great deal of confidence.  There are plenty of markets abroad for our produce if the Government and the Minister responsible are prepared to look into the market-place and seek them out.  That has been proven very successfully over the last few years.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer again to some of the things which people generally do not recognise.  One hears criticism of the Government regularly and if I was sitting on the opposite side of the House I would not be as sensitive to it.  For example, social welfare expenditure amounts to £2.5 billion per year.  Over 37 per cent of the population are in receipt of social welfare of one kind or another.  That is why it is very important to recognise that <Col N="1578" /> all schemes put in operation by the Government must have an impact on the number of people unemployed.  No country can afford to have such vast numbers of people unemployed.  For that reason the general thrust must continue to be to try to alleviate that problem.</P>
    <P>Health is another area which was referred to by other speakers.  The expenditure on health amounts to £1.2 billion per annum.  As a member of a health board, I feel I should comment on some of the things that have been said in relation to the handling of this area over the last couple of years.  I think the Minister has done a very good job.</P>
    <P>Much heat has been generated by discussion in recent times on the proposed closure of certain mental hospitals. It has been the policy of most of the health boards over the last ten years to deinstitutionalise psychiatric health services. They have been pursuing that policy very well and very forcefully and have called on various Ministers and on different Governments to introduce a means whereby that target can be achieved. However, when the Minister decides that the time has come to phase out the existing old-fashioned unfit structures and replace them with community based psychiatric services, there is immediate uproar.  Unfortunately, the general public did not get a chance to know the full story.  Statements have been made by people who have fears which may not be genuine and by people who fully recognise the situation and who were advocates for the changes that are now being brought about.  There was never any question of the Government or the Minister closing mental hospitals and throwing the patients out on the road.  That will never happen.  The policy of the health boards and of the present Minister is to replace those old-fashioned unfit buildings with smaller community-based institutions where patients can receive a far higher standard of service than anything that has been conceived of in the past.  I will not go on any longer about that as I appreciate it would be more appropriate to a debate on a Health Estimate. <Col N="1579" /> If one had time to go into the conditions which prevail in a great many psychiatric institutions it would give rise to great shock.  It should be a prerequisite for every Member of the Oireachtas to pay at least one visit to some of the major psychiatric institutions and they would be in a position to speak with firsthand knowledge on the problem.</P>
    <P>A group of people with whom I sympathise who do not receive a great deal of public attention either at budget time or at any other time are lower paid workers, workers on a salary of perhaps £5,500 or £6,500 per annum.  Many of our local authority workers are in that income group.  When people criticise those who work for the local authorities they often do not recognise that in many cases these people would probably be at least as well off financially if they did not work at all. A great deal of credit is due to those who work on the local authority system, to those who work on our roads putting down anti-skid sanding at night and all the other work which we take for granted.  If these people were not doing that work we would soon recognise the importance of the service they provide.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposals in the budget to improve the taxation system, everybody recognises that taxation here at 36 per cent of GNP is excessive.  We must also accept that the tax on the PAYE sector is unbearable.  It was generally recognised this year that the time had come to recognise the position of the PAYE sector and to make some concessions. The Minister in his budget did just that.  I listened to Deputy Byrne a few moments ago decrying the fact that sufficient tax concessions are not given; but, after all, the concessions amounted to £121 million in the current year and it will be £205 million in a full year.  By any standards that is a reasonable concession in a single year.  Rome was not built in a day.  Our problem did not materialise overnight and it will take us a long time to get out of this financial mess.  It cannot be remedied overnight and any Government attempting to do so would only <Col N="1580" /> exacerbate the situation.  The Government and the Minister have recognised the position of the PAYE taxpayer by giving concessions.  I hope this is the first of many.  This concession was constructive and it is in recognition of the levels of taxation applicable to the PAYE sector. When Members of the Opposition talk about tax concessions I hope they will recognise that in the past their own performance in relation to the PAYE sector was not always spectacular when giving concessions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mainly concerned with two areas, tourism and the building and construction industry.  Contrary to Government expectations, at the beginning of last year the performance of the economy turned out to be almost flat during 1985.  The economic growth rate as measured by GNP has increased by a mere ½ per cent.  Industrial output increased by just over 3½ per cent in 1985 compared to a growth rate of 13 per cent a year earlier.  With this slowdown in the growth rate it was inevitable that unemployment would increase last year. The increase continued into 1986; and since the Minister delivered his budget speech the numbers unemployed have exceeded 240,000, or almost one in five of the labour force, for the first time in our history.  An area that has suffered more than any other area in the recession is the building and construction industry. The collapse of this sector, where many small and medium sized builders have gone out of business, has been extraordinary. The extent of the collapse can be shown by two stark statistics.  The sale of domestic cement has fallen by 40 per cent between 1979 and 1985.  In 1979 total domestic sales of cement amounted to tonnes.  Statistics have been prepared to prove that the building and construction industry is dying.  There has been a major decline in the numbers employed in this sector.  Only half the people employed in building and construction in 1980 were still employed by that sector five years later.  According to the CSO, taking <Col N="1581" /> employment in building as being equal to 100 in 1980, by 1985 this index had declined to 55.8.  The bleeding of our resources of men, materials and infrastructure must be stopped if we are to continue to aspire to being a developed industrial country.  There is little to suggest that the contents of this budget will do anything to halt and reverse the decline in this central area of the country's economic life.</P>
      <P>All the evidence points to a further decline in building and construction this year.  Spending on the public capital programme in 1985 did not reach the level planned for in the 1985 budget.  At £1,693 million public capital spending fell short by £83 million of the Government's expectations last year.  Having underspent last year, what have the Government planned for this year?  Have they intended to make up the ground lost last year?  No, they have not.  Instead there has been yet a further cutback in public capital spending.  The total public capital programme has been cut by a further £11 million this year to £1,681 million.  Taking account of inflation that represents a further drop of some 5 per cent in the volume of public capital spending this year.  I am not alone in canvassing the view that building output will fall again this year. The Central Bank in its bulletin published a week before the budget had this to say:</P>
      <P>For 1986 building output may fall again although the decline is expected to be a small one of about 1 per cent. Some further decline in private housing is expected.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank concluded:</P>
      <P>On the basis of the outlook for activity in 1986 no improvement in the employment situation can be expected. However, given the limited decline in output now in prospect any further fall in employment is likely to be small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial constraints on Government spending are undeniable.  It would be irresponsible for any Deputy to call for major expansion in public capital spending <Col N="1582" /> in the present financial circumstances. Spending for spending's sake, whether it be on current or capital programmes, may increase employment today but at the expense of even greater unemployment in the future.  Having said that, it must be accepted that the Government have shown a remarkable lack of foresight and imagination in their approach to capital spending.  If the State does not possess the resources to give the building and construction sector a lift, it should be seeking imaginative ways of including the private sector in participating in undertaking new and needed capital investment projects: roads, bridges, flyovers and by-passes are much needed. The lack of investment on roads in recent years is now beginning to show through in the rapid deterioration of their surfaces. The country still has no highway system making the passage of goods, raw materials, machinery and exports difficult from one point to another.  These bottlenecks have economic costs both in terms of lost time and often loss of export orders.</P>
    <P>There is scope in this area for a major partnership between the State and the private sector in the provision of a first class highway system.  The State would benefit by improving the nation's infrastructure at relatively low cost while still living within the constraints of public finances.  Through tolls the private sector could be guaranteed a reasonable rate of return on the investment they would surely be prepared to make.  It is hard to understand why these successful experiments have not been used to forge a much more generalised response in terms of partnership between the State and the private sector.  The implementation of such a strategy would have two major benefits.  First, it would serve to direct much of the free resources now languishing in the gilt markets or in the money markets towards the creation of something physical, useful and lasting. Secondly, it would give a spurt to the building and construction industry raising both employment and output in the process. But unless some imaginative action is taken to support the building sector it <Col N="1583" /> will simply not exist as we know it when times improve and demand picks up.</P>
    <P>Tourism is the second area of the budget I would like to address.  Despite the buoyancy of last year's tourist season, tourism generally has turned in a relatively poor performance over the last 15 years.  Yet it is an area where Ireland is uniquely fitted to make a success of this industry.  In the tourism industry Ireland's lack of an industrial past is not, as in so many areas, a hindrance to development. Instead it is a positive help.  We have a relatively unspoiled environment, clean air, low population density and possibilities for outdoor activities such as golf, fishing, shooting, horse riding and many other sporting facilities.  Ireland has major links with countries which enjoy a high standard of living and thus generates much tourist business as an additional beneficial factor.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision to reduce the rate of VAT on meals and touring coaches, which was referred to tonight, from 23 per cent to 10 per cent from 1 July will help the tourist industry to some extent but it is by no means enough. These concessions will cost £11.5 million. However, the Minister has more than outweighed the good by introducing a 2 per cent increase in the standard rate of VAT from 23 per cent to 25 per cent. This will bring in £77 million this year or seven times the amount of the concessions granted on meals and tourist coaches.  It seems peculiar, to say the least, that the Minister has postponed the reduction of the VAT rate on meals until 1 July next or approaching half way through the tourist season.  Anyone in this House who sees logic in that should not be here at all.  This has created a situation whereby VAT on meals will rise from 23 per cent to 25 per cent before falling back to 10 per cent in July when the tourist season is tapering out.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider this excessively complex situation and to cut VAT on meals to 10 per cent at the same time as introducing the increase to 25 per cent in the standard VAT rate.</P>
    <P>The reduction in VAT, however, deals <Col N="1584" /> only with the tip of the tourist iceberg. A much broader strategy needs to be formulated and much stronger than was proposed by the Government in their White Paper on tourism published last year.</P>
    <P>There are two inescapable facts attached to tourism.  First, the principal constraint on a cost-conscious tourist intending to visit Ireland is the high cost of VAT.  Number two, access to Ireland is too expensive and it is deterring droves of would-be tourists.  I speak particularly of air transport.  A central objective, therefore, must be a reduction in air fares.  Unfortunately, the Government through the Air Transport Bill, do not seem to accept this because they seem to be turning their face away from reality. Ireland's tourism policy must be based on the fact that we will never be a sunbound destination.  We must tailor our tourism policy to meet the demands of specialist tourists, those interested in sport, particularly fishing, or the enjoyment of unspoiled scenery and countryside.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the tax on deposits provided for in the budget. The effect of this proposal will mean that voluntary organisations will have to pay tax in future.  Surely the Minister must know that such organisations make a tremendous financial contribution to helping such worthy causes as the fight against cancer and other diseases such as polio. I could continue all night to refer to the great work being done by these organisations who are now caught in the 35 per cent tax net.  The services those voluntary organisations contribute to should be financed totally by the Government.  I ask the Minister to review this appalling attack on voluntary organisations when he introduces the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Many Members during the debate referred to savings and small savers. Savings lead to wealth and to investment in industry.  All Governments should offer incentives to savers, but what have this Government done?  They have proposed that banks, An Post, building societies, the ACC and so on will be required to deduct income tax at 35 per cent on <Col N="1585" /> deposit interest.  I fail to understand the logic of that.  The Government talk continuously about creating employment, about incentives to invest, but they attack those who want to save and to invest.</P>
    <P>Banks will tell you that they are bulging with money but nobody is coming in to take money out to invest in industry. There is no longer the incentive to invest. It is a tragedy to say that hundreds of people who in other circumstances would be prepared to invest prefer to put their money in the bank and sit back and enjoy the interest and the security rather than invest in employment creation enterprises. I am surprised at this attack by the Government on the small saver.  The Government should be encouraging young people, particularly, to save.  In Cork we have suffered the worst of the recession.  Many of our traditional industries have been closed, Dunlop, Ford, Verolme.  Many people worked in those industries all their lives and made every possible effort to rear and educate their families.  They were told to invest their redundancy money to ensure the future of their families.  What has happened? The Government will take back 35p from every £ of their income.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this budget proposal.  The new Minister for Finance had experience of industry and I hope he will see the disastrous effect this will have on investment and consequently on job creation.</P>
    <P>We hear that the economy is improving. This does not seem to be happening throughout the country, especially among local authorities.  I was glad to hear the Minister for Energy today talking about lower charges by the ESB.  As soon as oil prices were increased some years ago the ESB were very quick to put up prices but it has taken a long time before a Minister for Energy considered the reduced cost of oil and gave some concession to the general public.</P>
    <P>This does not apply to the ESB only.  I ask the Minister to consider a reduction in gas prices in Cork and Dublin.  Oil affects the production of gas and I hope that in the next few days the Minister for <Col N="1586" /> Energy will announce price reductions for natural gas in Cork and Dublin.  This would help local authorities when they are striking rates because it could mean less expenditure on public lighting and other such services.  Most local authorities pay about £1 million annually for public lighting.  That is one way to prove to the public that the economy is on the upturn.  It would create confidence and help people to believe that there is a future in this nation rather than feeling of depression of those who are working, but particularly those who are unemployed. The time has come for this or any other Government that sit on the benches on the far side to create incentives and take certain capital investment risks which must be taken to bring the nation out of its present depressed state.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said on many occasions that the economy is improving, so let that reflect itself in industry, in price control and in the reduction of the cost of electricity and gas.  This would give the uplift which is needed now in the industrial world.  They are what I hope to hear the Minister for Finance saying in his reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Ministers involved to take note of my suggestions with regard to the building construction industry and tourism and that these suggestions will receive careful consideration.</P>

      <P>I want to express regret at the departure of Deputy Dukes from the very important position which he held.  As a Border Deputy I had no reason to be grateful to the Deputy, but he is a tremendous young politician, probably the most able in the country.  His real work will not be recognised probably until ten years have elapsed, as in the case of Richie Ryan, who had to endure all types of abuse by the public but who <Col N="1587" /> today is regarded as one who had positive answers to Ireland's problems a decade ago.  Deputy Dukes's real work will not be gauged for a number of years, but I would like to pay tribute to the job he did in guiding us through a very traumatic period of our economic development.  We had inherited an appalling mess from the Soldiers of Destiny who produced the 1977 manifesto, which will rank as the most despicable document ever produced on behalf of the Irish nation.</P>
      <P>The nation's problems were very severe when we took office and the Government have applied themselves in a very responsible manner.  Having said that, I come from a depressed area, the Border region, which has been described by the European Economic and Social Council as the most underprivileged and deprived in western Europe.  My area has been ignored over the last 17 years.  It has borne the brunt of the Ulster troubles on behalf of this nation and successive Governments have done little or nothing to alleviate the terrible economic distress felt in the Border counties.</P>
      <P>On a national basis, our problems continue to escalate despite the very best and honest efforts of this Government.  The twin problems are unbelievably high taxation and the increase in the unemployment figure.  That figure of around 240,000 is open to question due to the very extensive black economy, but the fact is that there are thousands of young people leaving schools with little or no hope of gainful employment in the future. That must be a matter of deep concern to all political parties.  The present stereotyped policies of dealing with unemployment are obsolete and the time has come for a radical reappraisal of the economic situation.  On previous occasions I called for the implementation of job sharing and the abolition of overtime.  I also believe that the Government should introduce an attractive tax-free incentive for people in the public sector to retire at the age of 55 years.  This is the only way in which we can really create employment for our young people who are in serious need of some hope of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> Another area about which I would wish to express concern is that of social welfare. I suggest that we are fostering a social welfare dependence which is out of proportion to the size of our population. We are a country of three and a half million people and there are one million social welfare beneficiaries.  This is an unbearable burden on the small and decreasing number of people who are working.  It accounts for the tremendous amount of money taken out of the wage packets of those who are PAYE workers. Again this is one of the reasons for the very active black economy in our midst. In that connection I draw the Minister's attention to the recent <i>exposé</i> in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of the massive social welfare fraud taking place in the Border areas, which accounts for a figure in the region of £25 million per annum, despite the Minister's denials and half admissions. The scale of social welfare fraud is horrific.  If the true extent were known, it would cause a revolt among the PAYE workers and those who pay taxes.  The recent fraud in the Border area is undeniable. I have in my possession a report compiled by a social welfare investigation officer which clearly indicates that a sum in the region of £25 million is being pilfered by North of Ireland pirates who are putting their hands into the pockets of PAYE workers down here.  This is deplorable and cannot be allowed to continue. At a time when we are cutting down and closing hospitals and teacher training units, it is regrettable, to say the least, that we are allowing that unbelieveable sum of money to leave our economy. The Government must do something to close the avenues and prevent money of this nature from escaping.  Many of the recommendations made in that report have been ignored by the Government. They are afraid that if we open this Pandora's box it will be seen that the situation is totally out of control.  There has been a certain ambivalence towards social welfare fraud.  This is not just confined to Border regions.  It is widespread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I will be giving some of my time to my colleague, Deputy Noel Treacy.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, and congratulate him on his appointment.  I hope he will be able to help us solve this problem.</P>
      <P>I am speaking this evening of one of the oldest and most historic housing estates in Ballinasloe, County Galway.  We would like the Department to provide finance for the necessary improvements to this housing estate, in particular the provision of proper heating and sanitary facilities. The Minister will agree it is a scandal that in 1986 these houses do not have bathrooms but have outside toilets only. I hope the Minister can rectify this situation by providing the finance which the Ballinasloe Urban Council have requested on numerous occasions.</P>
      <P>In 1985 when <i>Building on Reality</i> was published, hope was raised that there would be a scheme of improvements available for local authorities.  Paragraph 5.91, reads:</P>
      <P>Serious deterioration is affecting certain rented houses, mostly built under low-cost arrangements in the relatively recent past, as well as some older rented local authority housing.  Major works of a structural nature are needed if these houses are to continue to be suitable for renting.  Local authorities will be allowed to assign limited funds from their annual allocation for local authority housing for improvements to these houses, where this would represent good value for money.  These funds will attract loan charges subsidy.</P>
      <P>That last sentence is the most important in that statement and I hope the Minister can provide the finance and the loan charges subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to see the schemes the Ballinasloe Urban Council have applied for implemented.  The council want to provide <Col N="1590" /> bathrooms in particular, windows, ranges, rewiring and other works and they applied for help more than one year ago.  At that time a housing inspector visited the estate and estimated that £10,000 to £11,000 could be spent on each house.  Last September the Department wanted extra information and the council commissioned the National Building Agency to provide it.  All details have been sent to the Department and I do not believe any further information is necessary.  If that is the position, I hope the Minister will confirm it tonight, because I fail to see why that scheme cannot go ahead.</P>
    <P>We are talking about pre-1940 houses, and I mention that particularly in the context of the house improvement grant scheme.  These houses are 50 years behind the times as regards heating and sanitation in particular.  The Minister may have seen an article in <i>The Sunday World,</i> 9 March 1986, and I will quote what that article said:</P>
    <P>Doors are falling off hinges, windows are broken, ranges are not even fit to boil a kettle and rats have chewed up the floorboards in some houses in St. Grellan's Estate.</P>
    <P>That is a horrific example of the inhuman conditions in which people in this estate are living and shows how urgent it is that this problem should be tackled.</P>
    <P>St. Grellan's is a close knit community. They have a very active residents' association. They keep their public representatives informed of the problems in the area and they have raised these matters on many occasions with the urban council and the Department.  Since the last local elections they have their own councillor, a member of the Minister's party who I am sure has been in contact with the Minister on these matters.  The Labour councillor, Stephen Connell, with the other eight councillors, the town clerk and the manager have been trying to get the necessary finance for these improvements.</P>
    <P>Originally there were 60 houses in this housing estate, some of these are now doubled up.  I understand we are talking <Col N="1591" /> about 56 houses now and there may be need for other houses to be doubled up as well, in other words, four bedroomed houses instead of two bedroomed houses. Whatever happens, sanitary facilities as well as heating and cooking facilities must be improved.  One of the housewives quoted in last Sunday's newspaper article talked about life being hell in that estate. She said:</P>
    <P>I believe in miracles every time the kettle boils on our range.  Our daughter and son are under doctor's care.  It is the cold that has made them ill.  This housing scheme has been deplored by the medical profession in Ballinasloe. In a recent article in <i>The Ballinasloe Herald,</i> a senior doctor, Dr. Tarpey, spoke of the inhuman living conditions in this estate.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently in this House on the Homeless Persons Bill.  I was speaking about the provision of ranges and sanitary services in houses throughout the country, but I mentioned in particular St. Grellan's housing estate.  I would like this Government and all Governments to devise a crash programme for local authorities to provide these basic facilities. There is no use in Governments boasting about the number of new houses they have built.  That is good for statistics but it does not help housing estates like St. Grellan's where these facilities are so badly needed.  I would like the Minister to give an assurance tonight that the money will be provided very soon for this type of programme in St. Grellan's estate in particular and in other housing estates throughout County Galway and the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Tonight is a very important night in Ballinasloe because the urban council are discussing their estimates.  The frustration of the residents of this housing estate can be seen from the fact that they are marching to the urban council offices. This march is representative of the town of Ballinasloe, as the old Irish saying goes, idir cléir agus tuath a bhí ann.  These people are very frustrated because of a lack of action, and I have given some of <Col N="1592" /> the history of what has happened.  Something must be done and quickly.  In my view it is appropriate that the residents should march to the council offices tonight when the estimates are being discussed.  I know the council have been trying to get the necessary finance for these improvements.</P>
    <P>As a county councillor and a public representative for the Ballinasloe area I appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary finance to improve the living conditions of the people in this estate. The article to which I referred in <i>The Sunday World</i> of last Sunday referred to the possibility of a rent strike if those improvements are not carried out quickly.  I am sure the Minister does not want to have a rent strike.  Neither does anybody in the Ballinasloe area.  But there has been continuous delay on the part of the Department in implementing what the people there want even though departmental inspectors have visited the estate and the local urban council have commissioned the National Building Agency to send all the information requested by the Department.  All information has now been furnished to the Minister's Department with regard to the work so urgently needed to be done in St. Grellan's housing estate.  I know that the chairman of Ballinasloe Urban Council, councillor Patsy Geraghty, has called on the Department to make the money available and not refuse consistently to help out these people.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister of State honour what was promised in the Government document <i>Building on Reality 1985-87,</i> in chapter 5, paragraph 5.91 to the effect that local authorities would be allowed to undertake this work and that the loan charge subsidy would apply to them.  Let the Minister show the House here this evening that the Government are serious in what they said in that document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to support my colleague's call for immediate action to alleviate the problems that the people in St. Grellan's estate in Ballinasloe have had to put up with for over 50 years.  This estate was built in 1934, <Col N="1593" /> in one of the first housing programmes undertaken by the first de Valera Fianna Fáil Government.  Apart from some works done in 1974, 40 years later, to nine of those houses, no other work has been undertaken there since.  Today four of the houses only have proper bathrooms and five only have toilets.</P>
      <P>This evening, as the two local representatives, Deputy Kitt and I are calling on the Government, through the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, to have these works carried out as a matter of urgency.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and to wish him every success. I hope one of his first successes will be an immediate, positive decision to ensure that the money is made available for these remedial works.  We are calling on him and the Government to take immediate action on the unnatural and inhuman conditions to which the people in St. Grellan's estate have been subjected for far too long.</P>
      <P>I should like to give some comments contained in the local <i>Ballinasloe Herald</i> of last week.  That paper's editor, a well known national journalist, Mr. Jim Carney, visited the estate himself last week.  On the front page of that issue there is a report on the situation obtaining in Ballinasloe.</P>

      <P>Saturday, 1 March 1986.  As Deputy Kitt has said, some of the comments are to the effect that it would be a miracle if a kettle boiled in the estate.  Major difficulties are encountered with ranges.  There is a need to have a new range installed in every house.  Even when repairs are carried out by local officials very often they have no effect.  It is virtually impossible to light a fire.  One family are quoted as saying they could not cook their Christmas dinner, that the hot press and water tank are virtually useless, that their kitchen is extremely <Col N="1594" /> damp.  This newspaper carries a number of photographs showing the dampness on the walls, the wallpaper falling away from the walls and highlights the terrible, inhumane conditions that children and pregnant mothers are condemned to.  These are totally inhumane conditions in this age.  Total frustration is felt by the people in Ballinasloe at the long delay experienced in getting these remedial works carried out.  There is another comment to the effect that one woman has had her floor boards eaten away by rats, that her family never had proper accommodation. There is over-crowding in many of the houses.</P>
      <P>I know the people in St. Grellan's estate well.  I come from near Ballinasloe. I went to school in the town for five years. I worked in the town for 12 years and I have been a local TD for Ballinasloe for the past three and a half years.  I have had the pleasure of being in St. Grellan's estate many times over the past 22 years. I can say that these are a proud group of people, with their own idiosyncrasies, their own priorities, traditions and ethos.  They are a community-minded group of people.  They built their own community centre in 1976, where there is nightly supervision of their children doing their homework.  There is no room in the houses to do homework or have a proper, natural living environment.  That is the reason the local community centre is used for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people, in their frustration, elected a local councillor to the urban council at the local elections last June.  He happens to be a member of the Labour Party.  He is secretary of the residents' association and is a fine representative of the people.  He has said continuously that he is totally frustrated with the attitude of the Minister for Energy and the former Minister for the Environment to the plight of these people.  I appeal to the Minister of State this evening to ensure that some immediate action is undertaken. In the document <i>Building on Reality 1985-87</i> the Government gave a commitment that moneys would be made available for the renovation and reconstruction of pre-1940 local authority <Col N="1595" /> houses.  Ballinasloe has one of the oldest and most historic estates in St. Grellan's. They made an application to the Department of the Environment submitted through the NBA for these moneys. The necessary documentation was forwarded to the Department in April 1985.</P>
    <P>Additional information was sought by the Department in September 1985.  This was a complete surprise to the urban district council as they believed they had submitted all of the necessary documentation with their initial application in April 1985.  Yet they had to submit further documentation on 21 January 1986.  To date they have received no response even though they acceded to the Department's request on no fewer than three occasions, April 1985, September 1985 and January 1986.  As far as the people in Ballinasloe are concerned it amounts to total procrastination and a frustration of their efforts made through the urban district council, a council who have not the necessary resources to undertake these remedial works themselves.  As far as the people of St. Grellan's estate and Ballinasloe Urban District Council are concerned walls need to be plastered, bathrooms need to be added to the houses and extra rooms provided.</P>
    <P>There were two headlines at the top of <i>The Ballinasloe Herald</i> last week.  One read &ldquo;Angry residents to defy Council; We won't pay, Say Grellan's&rdquo;.  On the other side there appeared the heading &ldquo;Dunlo Row flares at Enquiry&rdquo;.  There is at present a public inquiry going on in Ballinasloe, ordered by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy John Boland, regarding a compulsory purchase order for lands on which the urban district council hope to build houses.  In 1986 £1 million was available for the building of those houses.  I contend that an immediate order should be made to have this money spent in building 12 new houses in Fallon's field, adjacent to St. Grellan's Housing Estate to alleviate the over-crowding and pressure on the people in St. Grellan's at present, providing them with proper living conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> I want to quote from <i>The Ballinasloe Herald</i> of 1 March, 1986 in the words of the council chairman, Mr. Patsy Geraghty, who said:</P>
    <P>We are all annoyed and aggrieved at the failure of the Department of the Environment to make funds available to Ballinasloe Urban District Council to carry out work such as that necessary at St. Grellan's.  We have met with the stone wall in our plans to provide a welfare home in the town and a sports field in St. Brendan's but I agree that the St. Grellan's situation is very bad. The answer is money and only the Department of the Environment can come up with the necessary funds.  This estate has toilet facilities that are 50 years out of date and a complete overhaul is the only solution.</P>
    <P>With my colleague, I appeal to the Minister of State to treat this case with the utmost compassion and make an immediate expedient decision to make the funds available.  He should act on the application that has been with him since April 1985.  A positive decision should be made in the interest of the parents, the adults and the children who are all living in totally unnatural and overcrowded conditions.  Those conditions have been criticised by the local representatives and were clearly illustrated by the media in recent weeks.  I hope that tonight we get a positive response to our request.</P>

Initially, I must make it clear that the basic responsibility for the management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwelling rests on the local authority who provided the dwellings.  I was a little surprised to hear that after 50 years it was not until April or May of last year that an application was submitted to the Department to update these houses.

It is most unfair to come at this late stage and level accusations at the Department of the Environment.  To meet the outgoings and the cost of rennovation local authorities have available to them their receipts from rents, as well as 40 per cent of the proceeds of sales of local authority dwellings together with other miscellaneous receipts related to housing.  Local authorities may also avail of the Department's improvement grant scheme for works such as the provision of bathroom-bedroom extensions and the provision of water and sewerage facilities.  The after grant cost of such work can be funded by means of an unsubsidised loan scheme which is also operated by my Departmentr. That loan scheme has been in operation for many years but many local authorities have not available of it.  Local authorities can, from their own resources, pay any loan charges.  A sum of £1 million has been available down the years but few authorities have availed of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In drawing up the national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> the Government recognised that the existing aids might not be sufficient in cases where local authorities found themselves faced with outgoings not coming within the category of what might be termed normal maintenance and improvement costs.  This kind of situation arose mainly in connection with the remedying of serious defects which have arisen both in so-called low cost housing and in some older housing stock.  I imagine that St. Grellan's fits into the latter category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to help these authorities to meet the higher cost involved in remedying the defects associated with such housing, paragraph 5.91 of the national plan <Col N="1598" /> provided that authorities might assign limited funds from their annual allocation for local authority housing to carry out a major programme of improvement works to low cost housing and certain older stock suffering from serious deterioration.</P>
    <P>Local authorities were notified by circular letter dated 10 January 1985 of the terms of the new remedial works scheme. Under the scheme, capital, limited to £12,000 per dwelling, subsidisable at a rate not exceeding 80 per cent, may be made available to local authorities to fund major repairs of a structural nature to pre-1940 houses suffering from serious deterioration.  Houses purchased from the local authority may be included in a proposal for assistance under the scheme where they form part of a scheme of rented houses and their inclusion is necessary to give an acceptable result to the scheme as a whole.  Essential works of an improvement nature such as the provision of a water supply, sewerage facilities or a bathroom could be included in a proposal provided other necessary works of reconstruction arising from structural deficiency are sufficient in themselves to bring the houses within the scope of the scheme.  Tenant purchasers are expected to contribute half the cost of the works either by means of a lump sum payment, an extended or revised annuity or a combination of both.  The scheme is designed to encourage tenant participation as much as possible.  To this end, in order to qualify for assistance under the scheme, local authorities must, where appropriate, provide for environmental works to be carried out in cooperation with local residents.</P>
    <P>Applications under the remedial work scheme are running at a very high level and to date some 35 valid applications valued at over £30 million have been received.  The capital allocated for the scheme for 1986 has had to be limited to £5 million having regard to the competing demands of other housing expenditure. As the applications on hands far exceed this amount, it has been necessary to deal <Col N="1599" /> with the applications on a priority basis related to the urgency and extent of the work involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the Deputies that St. Grellan's will receive every consideration and if it is found necessary, will receive preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>Obviously those estates which are suffering from major structural defects such as leaking roofs, water penetration, defective walling and so on, will have to be dealt with more urgently than those whose main defects are of a less serious character.  A degree of priority must be given to the need to remedy the serious defects which have often plagued the so called low-cost housing since its construction in the late sixties and early seventies. The remedial works scheme represents the first serious effort to tackle this serious problem.  While it was only to be expected that authorities would be quick to take advantage of the generous nature of the scheme's provisions, the fact is that all applications cannot be allowed immediately but must take their places in whatever order of priority is decided.</P>
    <P>An application for assistance under the remedial works scheme was received from Ballinasloe Urban District Council in May 1985.  There is a conflict in regard to that date because the application was received in April.  The work proposed consists of the replacement of defective doors, windows and plumbing, the provision of insulation and the installation of bathroom facilities.  Following a visit by the Department's inspector in September 1985 &mdash; I do not think we can be accused of stonewalling in that respect &mdash; the council were requested to submit additional information of a technical nature to enable the proposal to be further examined.  This information was submitted to my Department at the end of January 1986 and the file has again been referred to my Department's inspector.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that as far as the Department are concerned the matter is not closed and we have not abandoned the idea of giving assistance.  However, the House will appreciate that other local authorities consider that they have problems <Col N="1600" /> and with £5 million available it is difficult to meet all the demands made on us.  I am sorry that I cannot at this stage give an indication of the outcome of the council's application for assistance under the scheme.  A decision will, however, be made in the matter as soon as possible after the inspector's report has been received and considered in the Department.  I should like to assure the Deputies, and they in turn can inform my Labour colleague in Ballinasloe, that as far as the Department are concerned the matter is still under active consideration. However, we are awaiting a report.</P>
    <P>It is most unjust to suggest that the Department are stonewalling or are not treating this in a humane manner.  The faults in the houses did not arise overnight. Doors do not rot or houses become rat infested in a space of ten months, as the Deputies suggested.  I am surprised that action was not taken by the local authority before now.  The Deputies who raised the matter are members of Galway County Council and as such have an input into the affairs of Ballinasloe.  It appears to me that there was negligence at that level also.  If a charge is to be levelled at anybody the Deputies cannot walk away from it.  The House has my assurance that on receipt of the inspector's report the matter will receive careful consideration. I hope we will be able to respond in a positive manner.</P>

      <P>The breakdown of expenditure by my Department for consultancy and legal services in 1985 is as follows: mining (£394,000), natural gas development (£243,000), petroleum exploration (£197,000), oil (£29,000) and miscellaneous (£10,000).  Fifteen individual consultants plus 14 firms or organisations were employed by my Department in the course of the year.  They were selected in 1985 or in earlier years from employment under contract or agreement for specific purposes in the following ways</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; By request for tenders issued to suitably qualified firms with relevant Irish <Col N="1369" /> experience.  These firms submitted proposals and costings and a choice was then made based on an evaluation of these proposals.  The number of proposals received varied from case to case.</P>
    <P>&mdash;In other instances relevant qualified people were obtained from State-sponsored bodies, such as the IIRS and the Industrial Credit Company, on a negotiated fee basis.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Because many projects have a lifetime longer than one year consultants who were previously employed on these projects and who were found to be satisfactory were re-engaged.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Very occasionally, when a specific immediate need has arisen, my Department negotiate directly with one firm whose particular expertise is required by the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the very sensitive security, strategic, and commercial considerations involved in relation to the resources in the care of my Department, I am satisfied that it would not be in the national interest to publish the names of consultants employed unless there were special reasons for doing so.</P>

    <P>The names of consultancy firms engaged are mentioned below.  It is not possible to state the total number of consultants employed.  In most cases it is institutions or firms that are engaged rather than individuals and such organisations assign staff on a full or part time basis, for different phases of projects.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for selecting the institutions, firms and individuals concerned vary.  For example, administrative research projects are commissioned by the Committee on Administrative Research, normally from the Institute of Public Administration.  The Civil Service training centre commissions the Institute of Public Administration to present courses under a standing arrangement. Other consultants are selected on the basis of their specialist knowledge or expertise.</P>

      <P>VAT returns are not submitted in a manner which would enable the actual yield from particular trade sectors to be identified.  Based on non-Revenue statistical data the following estimates of VAT yield from buildings and construction work have been calculated: Yield at rate of 10 per cent in 1985, £57 million; Yield at rate of 5 per cent in 1983, £32 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> It should be noted that in 1985 the rate of 10 per cent applied from 1 March to 31 December (except in the case of new private housing where it applied from 1 May to 31 December) and that in 1983 an effective rate of 5 per cent applied from 1 March to 30 April and a substantive rate of 5 per cent from 1 May to 31 December.  The 1983 figure given above relates to the combined yield from those rates.</P>

The conditions for the exercise of racehorses include:&mdash;1. entry for horses is restricted to a specified gate; 2. exercising can only take place at certain times and on certain days.  Normally racehorses <Col N="1397" /> will not be permitted entry on Sundays; 3. horses cannot be exercised outside the areas designated by the Commissioners; 4. riding upon footpaths, grass slopes or margins is strictly prohibited; 5. horses to be ridden at walking pace between the gate and the approved exercise area; 6. owners or trainers of racehorses must take out insurance against all claims for loss, damage or injury to any person, animal or thing.</P>
      <P>This activity which is traditional in the park is provided for in the by-laws and the conditions under which the licences are granted are designed to ensure, in so far as possible, that it does not interfere with the public's enjoyment of the park.</P>

It is not possible at this stage to give any precise analysis of the way in which the 1986 A.2 allocation will be spent.  I can say, however, that the greater part of the allocation will be spent on the purchase of software and the provision of consultancy services related to the installation of the computerised information systems necessary to ensure the efficient and cost effective management of the health services.

    <P>While the original allocation was £950,000, a greater than anticipated need for these services, particularly in the areas of the development of financial and community care systems, gave rise to expenditure of £1,137,301.  This was offset by savings on other subheads of the Vote.</P>
    <P>The standard practice in my Department is to seek tenders from a number of suitable firms for major consultancy assignments and software purchases. No tenders were sought in 1985, however, as the assignments were for the most part continuations of contracts entered into previously.  In the case of some minor assignments firms were selected on the basis of suitability, reputation and proven experience.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the allocation made to each voluntary hospital from his Department in each of the years from 1983 to 1986, inclusive; the percentage decrease in real terms each year; and the deficit on 31 December 1985.</P>

      <P>At present a composite deflator for health services costs is not available.  Use of the consumer price index for this purpose would distort comparisons between <Col N="1405" /> the percentage changes in allocations from year to year for individual hospitals because of variances in the pay/non-pay ratios.  Furthermore, there are factors which would tend to invalidate comparisons between percentage changes arrived at on the basis of a set of figures derived from the use of the consumer price index, such as adjustments to take account of changes in activity levels, developments in certain hospitals etc.</P>
      <P>The average overall reduction in real terms in non-capital allocations for voluntary hospitals between 1983 and 1985, based on the use of the consumer price index as a deflator, was approximately 2.87 per cent.  The 1986 allocation is at budget stage and is not comparable with the final allocations for earlier years to which the percentage change quoted is related.</P>
      <P>In relation to the deficit in December 1985, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the excess of expenditure in voluntary hospitals over approved allocation levels for 1985.  It will not be possible to provide this information on a definitive basis until accounts for individual hospitals for 1985 are available.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 11 June 1984 to 22 June 1985 and was paid 318 days benefit during that period.  She then claimed disability benefit from 24 June 1985 to 30 September 1985 when she was found capable of work by the medical referee.</P>
      <P>She then claimed disability benefit from 24 June 1985 to 30 September 1985 when she was found capable of work by the medical referee.  She next attended at her local office for the purpose of reclaiming unemployment benefit on 1 November 1985 and stated that since her disability benefit claim had ceased she had been in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the health board. Her unemployment benefit claim of 1 November 1985 linked to her previous unemployment benefit claim and accordingly she was paid to 22 January 1986, at which date she exhausted her entitlement to the maximum duration of 390 days benefit.</P>
      <P>In December 1985, she requested permission to sign the unemployed register retrospectively for the period 1 October 1985 to 31 October 1985.  Her request was granted and arrears of £397.88 unemployment benefit plus pay-related benefit were due for this period.  However, as a result of her request to sign-back being granted, her entitlement to 390 days unemployment benefit was exhausted on 5 December 1985 instead of 22 January 1986.  This resulted in an overpayment of £149.59, being the difference between the unemployment assistance which she would have been due from 6 December 1985 to 22 January 1986 and the unemployment benefit plus pay-related benefit which was actually paid for this period. In addition she had received a total of £222.25 supplementary welfare allowance from the health board in respect of the period 1 October 1985 to 31 October 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, a total amount of £371.84 <Col N="1418" /> (£149.59 overpayment plus £222.25 advances of supplementary welfare allowance) was deducted from unemployment benefit plus pay-related benefit arrears due amounting to £397.88, leaving a balance of £26.04 which was paid to her on 5 February 1986.  She continues to sign the unemployed register and is at present in receipt of £34.95 unemployment assistance weekly, which is the maximum rate payable to a single person.</P>

      <P>Following investigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned, he was assessed with means of £22.35 weekly, derived from the benefit of board and lodging in his parents' home.  He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance of £9.40 weekly being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case £31.75 less means of £22.35.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing this scheme, provides that the means of a person for unemployment assistance purposes must take account of the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by him.  The purpose of the assessment for board and lodgings of applicants living with relatives is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants living in relatively better-off circumstances and those whose circumstances are poor.</P>
      <P>Where the head of the family is a wage earner, the method of assessing the value of board and lodgings is to deduct from net parental income, that is the gross income less income tax and PRSI contributions, an amount to cover such outgoings as rent or mortgage repayments. In addition, a parental allowance is deducted and the remainder of net parental income is divided among the non-earning members of the household to arrive at the value of board and lodgings.</P>
      <P>To alleviate the position of applicants from small families who often fared badly under the method described above, it is provided that an applicant's share of the net household income should not be regarded as more than a maximum of 12½ per cent of that income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net parental income, less rent, in this case amounted to £178.91 weekly and with the application of the 12½ per cent limitation described above, a deciding <Col N="1422" /> officer assessed the means of the person concerned at £22.35 weekly.  If the person concerned wishes to appeal against the means assessment, he should complete and return the appeal form already issued to him.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 30 December 1985.  Her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she had only 24 paid contributions during the contribution period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 which governed the entitlement to unemployment benefit from 30 December 1985.</P>
      <P>A new benefit year commenced on 6 January 1986 and her claim was authorised at £38.05 weekly, the appropriate rate payable to a single person who has 44 contributions during the contribution period 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985 which governs entitlement to unemployment benefit from 6 January 1986.  Inquiries are being made at present with the Department of Health and Social Security to establish whether any contributions were paid on her behalf during the governing contribution year 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985, while in the United Kingdom. When these inquiries are completed, her possible entitlement to a higher rate of unemployment benefit will be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit, and the amount of pay-related benefit payable, are determined on the basis of reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year.  The relevant income <Col N="1423" /> tax year for unemployment benefit claims commencing during 1985 is the income tax year 1983-84.

J1 contributions are payable in respect of employments of a subsidiary nature or of inconsiderable extent and are not reckonable for disability benefit purposes.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid unemployment benefit from 25 April 1985.  On 8 November 1985 she claimed maternity allowance and consequently payment of unemployment benefit ceased.  However for the period she claimed maternity allowance she was already paid unemployment benefit and arrangements have been made to treat <Col N="1425" /> the amount of unemployment benefit paid in respect of the period 19 August 1985 to 26 October 1985 as paid on account of maternity allowance.

      <P>Due to unavoidable budgetary constraints and the need to make the best possible use of scarce resources in terms of disease detection and control, the programme of testing for the remainder of 1986 will be based on the pattern of disease prevalence as revealed by the current intensive round of testing due to end next April.  By that time over 12,000 herd tests will have been carried out in County Donegal and the emerging picture is very satisfactory.  Donegal is clear of brucellosis and has the lowest bovine TB prevalence level in the country.</P>
      <P>The allocation of resources to individual countries, which incidentally has not yet been finalised, will be based on their respective disease situations and in this regard County Donegal will be treated on the same terms as any other county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 151 and 152 together.  The main items of expenditure of disease eradication are <Col N="1438" /> fees to veterinary practitioners for testing and reactor grants to farmers.</P>
      <P>In 1984, £265,000 was allocated for testing in County Limerick and £630,000 was paid in grants.  While there were no specific allocations on a county basis in 1985, it is estimated that approximately £600,000 has been paid for testing and £800,000 in reactor grants.  As far as 1986 is concerned, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the likely out-turn for these items of expenditure, which will be determined by the volume of testing during the current (1985-86) round &mdash; scheduled to continue until 6 April &mdash; the resources available for testing under the 1986 programme and the disease situation in the county throughout the year.</P>
      <P>The overall disease situation in County Limerick is satisfactory.  There are currently only 26 herds i.e. a prevalence of 0.28 per cent restricted due to brucellosis. This represents a significant improvement on the situation at the end of October 1985 when 0.95 per cent of herds were restricted and is a major achievement in a county which traditionally has had serious difficulties with brucellosis.  The TB prevalence is 2.11 per cent or 198 herds restricted, which is considerably less than the national average.  Testing in County Limerick during the current round has been very intensive.  Furthermore, my Department's veterinary officers have given particular attention to a number of serious outbreaks in the Fedamore, Castleconnell and Cahirhayes areas which developed towards the end of 1985, where lateral spread of infection is considered to have been the most likely cause of the problem and where testing of contiguous herds has been carried out on an extensive scale.  The 1986 programme is being designed to enable the veterinary officers to devote the available resources to the areas of highest disease risk in each county.</P>

    <P>AnCO &ldquo;external trainers&rdquo; consist of private sector firms and public sector bodies, such as Vocational Educational Committees, providing training courses for AnCO under contract.</P>
    <P>AnCO &ldquo;other consultants&rdquo; refer to consultants employed by AnCO Head Office, mainly for the purposes of advising on administration and training programmes.</P>
    <P>Figures in respect of AnCO training centres are not readily available and could not be provided in the time available.  Expenditure would, however, be small.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> The AnCO external training division organised 700 external training courses in 1985.  Only one of the consultants employed by the YEA provided a training course.  The balance of consultants employed by AnCO and the YEA provided non-training services.  A total of 9,731 trainees were trained on AnCO external training courses in 1985. Twenty-eight persons participated in the training course run by a consultant for the YEA.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he has any plans to introduce legislation controlling (1) the advertising of job vacancies; (2) the recruitment methods, in view of the total unsatisfactory situation at present, especially in relation to the use of box numbers; (3) the problem of confidentiality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department regulates the operation of employment agencies under the Employment Agency Act, 1971.  Regulations made under the Act provide in the case of any notice in a publication published in the State seeking a person for employment outside the State, for the inclusion of the name and address of the employer outside the State or alternatively the name and address of a holder of a licence under the Act acting on his behalf.</P>
      <P>In the case of agency notices seeking a person for employment within the State the address may consist of a box number or other accommodation arrangement. This is an unsatisfactory situation and steps are being taken to eliminate the practice by way of amending secondary legislation.</P>
      <P>Employers may advertise direct for employees and may decide to use a box number in such instances, possibly in the interest of confidentiality.  I have no plans to introduce legislation to change this practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also relevant to point out that under the Employment Equality Act, <Col N="1456" /> 1977, it is unlawful to publish or cause to be published any advertisement for job vacancies which indicates an intention to discriminate on grounds of sex or marital status.  In the event of a breach of the law proceedings may be initiated by the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would take this opportunity to encourage employers to notify their vacancies to the National Manpower Service where lists of a wide range of suitably qualified persons are available.</P>

      <P>The facelift grant scheme was introduced in 1985 as part of the capital grants scheme administered by my Department and is designed to assist youth organisations to improve their facilities.  Since the commencement of the facelift scheme in 1985, total grant-aid amounting to £272,727 has been allocated to 38 projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no specific financial allocation for the facelift scheme.  It is financed as part of the total budget for the capital grants scheme.  A total sum of £1.2 million is available in 1986 under the capital <Col N="1457" /> grants scheme to meet existing commitments and for allocation to new projects, including facelift projects.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 to 195, inclusive, together.  I am aware of the concern of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work made a substantial number of recommendations on <Col N="1458" /> occupational accident and disease prevention and also looked at a number of other matters including compensation arrangements and how they affect accident prevention.  Because of the deficiencies of existing safety legislation, I have decided to concentrate my efforts and those of my Department on the development of proposals for legislative change reflecting the majority of the Commission's recommendations which are related to safety and health at work.</P>
    <P>While my Department is aware of some approaches in relation to individual cases where workers who suffer occupational injury were not covered or were inadequately covered by employers' liability insurance, there is no overall data on the matter available to me.  The commission pointed to the many complex issues relating to compulsory employers' liability insurance, including the almost total absence of information on the overall position relating to compensation and recommended that a separate major inquiry be carried out into the whole matter of compensation for injury at work.  These issues would need to be examined comprehensively by all the interests concerned before any initiative as regards legislation in this area is decided upon.</P>
