      <P>As I said last night, it is vitally important that we have a balanced debate on this subject with no great display of emotion one way or the other. No one can claim a monopoly of wisdom or knowledge on this subject.  On the other hand, it is our duty to point out as far as we can the various problems that might arise.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the experience of other western countries that divorce was introduced in a restricted fashion but gradually the grounds for divorce were extended from adultery to include desertion, cruelty, insanity and so on.  The idea of a no fault divorce &mdash; irretrievable breakdown &mdash; was introduced to replace divorce on a fault basis due to practical considerations. The experience of other countries shows that where no fault divorce was introduced it led eventually to divorce on demand.  It is not realistic to imagine that we will remain impervious to trends which predominate in other western societies.</P>
      <P>The impact of divorce on these societies is indicated by some very chilling statistics.  For example, 33 per cent of all marriages in the UK are subject to divorce proceedings &mdash; that is, one out of three marriages.</P>
      <P>In 1972, the number of divorces, which increased steadily from some 2,000 in the twenties, was 110,700.  By 1981, the number of divorces had increased to 200,000.  In 1981, some 100,000 English children were in care.</P>
      <P>At the start of this decade, one in every three marriages in the US ended in divorce, now the figure is one in every two marriages.  The US divorce rate doubled between 1967 and 1977.  Marriages in the US last for an average of six years, and one in every three children lives in one-parent families.  In the US, in 1980, some 18.2 million children lived in single parent homes.  The long term consequences for any society in which this happens are clearly obvious.  We should note that when divorce was first introduced in Great Britain, a period of five years had to pass before either spouse could bring a divorce case before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that all of us in this <Col N="1079" /> House are motivated by the need to protect family life and also by a growing awareness of marriage breakdown as a reality of life in Ireland today.  There are increasing numbers of people who, because of incompatability, the pressures of life in our modern society, violence and other causes, are experiencing broken marriages, with tremendous pressure and pain on the individuals involved.</P>
    <P>In their deliberations on divorce, the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown accepted that any amendment to the Constitution which might be proposed to allow the introduction of divorce legislation should ensure that the rights of the family as set down in Article 41 are not diminished.  The committee expressed the opinion that any such amendment should be drafted in such a way as to ensure that the basis of Article 41 is not altered, that it should continue to place a duty on the society to protect the family and the institution of marriage and to recognise the family as the natural, primary, fundamental unit of society.</P>
    <P>How will adequate provision be made for the protection of dependent spouses and the welfare of dependent children who might be affected by the grant of a decree of divorce?  It is unrealistic to think that the average spouse will be in a position to maintain two households and that is precisely what will happen in many cases.  The problems caused by the initial divorce and the subsequent legal interpretations and implications for wives and children make it clear that divorce, far from being a remedy, very often exacerbates the difficulties that have previously arisen.  Evidence from other western countries overwhelmingly underlines the sad fact that women and children undergo considerable financial hardship as a result of divorce.  As two dwellings must be maintained and, consequently a second family, inevitably in the vast majority of cases there must be a drop in the standards of living of the parties involved. If, as usually happens, the wife obtains custody of the children, very often she is <Col N="1080" /> not in a position to take up paid employment leaving her vulnerable on financial grounds, and that is in addition to the social and emotional vulnerability which can be even more painful as separated women find themselves isolated and their status undermined.</P>
    <P>A recent ten year academic study conducted in the United States was critical of the impact of no fault divorces.  At the time of its inception the law was aimed to reduce the acrimonious element in marriage breakdown by eliminating the need for one spouse to prove that there are grounds for divorce.  What no one envisaged was that a by-product of this legislation would be the emergence of a new class of impoverished women as wives had lost their bargaining leverage. Some 85 per cent of divorced women are awarded no alimony at all.  When judges divide the family income the husband often gets two-thirds and the wives one-third. This study concluded that divorced women and their children experienced a 73 per cent drop in their standards of living during the first year while their husbands enjoy a 42 per cent rise in theirs.</P>
    <P>According to the US Census Bureau figures, of the eight million women in the United States who raise children without the father's domestic presence, one-third of them are officially classified as living below the poverty level; two-thirds of those entitled to child support actually get none at all and millions of fathers avoid payments; seven out of ten ignore court orders; three out of every five children born in the United States today will experience a divorce in the family before they are 18 years.</P>
    <P>It is tragically clear that women and children are impoverished by marital breakdown.  This is particularly acute where women devote their lives to homemaking and rearing children and find it impossible, because of lack of professional skill, business goodwill, inadequate educational qualifications or the needs of the children, to find paid employment.  It is clear that the decisions of the courts in Ireland and elsewhere <Col N="1081" /> are inadequate; nor can they be properly enforced in such a situation.</P>
    <P>The present system of dealing with matrimonial property in the event of a marriage breakdown is most unsatisfactory as was outlined by the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. It effectively discriminates against women since in most marriages the wife is obliged to give up work outside the home for at least some time, and in many cases permanently, to look after the family.  This suggests that because she is not earning she is unable to make contributions which would entitle her to an interest in property acquired in her husband's name.  This is particularly inequitable as the Constitution, in Article 41.2 recognises the special importance of women within the home.</P>
    <P>At present, it is clear that a whole range of issues relating to the interpretation of the law relating to family property requires clarification.  The situation at present is that we cannot be sure that a dependent spouse is not prejudiced in any determination of property rights by the fact that she gave up employment in the course of a marriage to attend the duties in the home.</P>
    <P>If divorce is introduced here, it is probably inevitable that our marriage breakdown rate will follow the sharp increase of other countries.  If this happens, is the State prepared to guarantee proper and adequate maintenance for the families involved?  That is something we have to evaluate seriously.  Under Article 41, the State is constitutionally obliged to provide for the maintenance of women and children, who will be the helpless victims of divorce.  The cost to the State of such support has not been calculated but in terms of local authority housing, social welfare payments and health care, it must be reckoned to be considerable.</P>
    <P>Is it possible to ensure that the law relating to maintenance will be enforced? The evidence suggests not because this has not happened in other countries.  Can we guarantee that the wife and the children of the first family will be supported by the estranged husband?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> The joint committee noted the instances of persons who default on payments under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, and recognised the relative difficulty which can be experienced in enforcing maintenance awards, particularly against self-employed maintenance defaulters.  It is clear that the person against whom maintenance is awarded can defeat the effect of the order by disposing of his assets, leaving the jurisdiction or, if self-employed, by simply refusing to obey the order of the court and requiring the dependent spouse to have endless recourse to the courts with little hope of success.  The structure of families in Ireland differs from our continental counterparts in that families are larger and only 10 per cent of the married women work outside the home, so there would be considerable financial considerations involved in the implementation of a divorce law.</P>
    <P>None of us has a monopoly of knowledge and wisdom on this subject.  However, it is our duty to point out the various dangers as we see them which might result from the proposed legislation and to point those out clearly and emphatically without prejudice, without displays of emotion.  Ultimately the people of the country are very wise and will decide whether or not this legislation is proper. It is appropriate that we should point out the implications judiciously and the people will then decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill represents the culmination of an approach to reform of many aspects of our social affairs. Although it is probably the most significant reform attempted by this Government, it is nevertheless only one of a number of very substantial reforms that have been prepared or undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the last couple of days, for instance, we saw the publication of the Status of Children Bill, an important measure which is aimed at ensuring equality of treatment for all children in several vital areas, irrespective of the circumstances of their birth.  It is a Bill <Col N="1083" /> aimed at giving expression to the constitutional provision committing us to cherish all the children of the nation equally. In addition, a law relating to the issue of domicile is before the Dáil.  In itself it is an important measure of equality, and it will also address the anomalous position in which many women find themselves.</P>
    <P>Work is now in hand to draft a new Bill extending the right of women to protection against discrimination.  This Bill will broaden the orientation of the Employment Equality Agency and strengthen its power, in addition to giving powers to the Minister for Labour to tackle discrimination on the grounds of gender wherever it occurs.</P>
    <P>We have already enacted a Bill to provide more rational family planning facilities and services, following lengthy debate.  The enactment of that Bill was also important in the context of overall reform.</P>
    <P>And the statement of intent published at the same time as the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill demonstrates a continuing commitment to reform. Many of the measures contained in that statement are not dependent on the outcome of a referendum and are the product of a great deal of thought and work. I would like to say a few words about these proposals before returning to the main issues in this debate.</P>
    <P>Among the measures about which we are proposing to bring forward legislation are these.  First, the establishment of a Family Court, with the powers of the Circuit Court, but with less formal and less confrontational procedures.  The Family Court will do its work away from the glare of publicity.  The establishment of the Family Court will require the appointment of a number of additional judges &mdash; I believe that it will be necessary to appoint at least three initially &mdash; and judges of the Family Court will have a quite different orientation in their work from the normal court procedures.</P>
    <P>Second, we are proposing to widen the grounds for judicial separation.  At present separations can only be granted in cases of cruelty, adultery or unnatural <Col N="1084" /> practices.  In future it will be possible to secure a judicial separation on these grounds, and in addition on the grounds of desertion; or in cases where the behaviour of one party forces the other to leave &mdash; this is known as constructive desertion &mdash; or in the case of separation, for a period of three years or a period of one year where both spouses agree.</P>
    <P>Third, we are proposing to introduce the concepts of mediation and conciliation as parts of the separation process. In future, the Family Court will have the power to strongly encourage couples to avail of mediation services so that a reconciliation can be seriously attempted as a desirable alternative to separation. Even in cases where reconciliation is not possible, conciliation will be used to encourage the partners to agree on the terms of a separation in a non-confrontational and non-adversarial way, the better to protect the interest of dependent spouses and children, and to protect children in particular from the trauma that often results in such situations.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the Family Court will have the power to make financial orders with a view to ensuring the interests of spouses and dependent children are adequately protected and appropriately provided for.  These orders will relate to maintenance, lump sum payments and property owned by the spouses, including the family home.  An important item which will be seriously considered in this context will be a provision to ensure that a woman, for instance, who had given up work to raise a family would not lose out in the share of property rights to which she is entitled as a result.</P>
    <P>All of these provisions have a number of things in common.  Firstly, they cannot, by any stretch of logic or imagination, be described as &ldquo;anti-family&rdquo;. There is nothing in these proposals which can be, or has been, objected to by any churchman or politician on those grounds.  They are in essence a set of proposals designed to bring greater equity into troubled situations, and greater protection into the way in which dependants are regarded.</P>
    <P>Secondly, these proposals are not in <Col N="1085" /> themselves dependent on any change in the Constitution.  If we in this House find merit in them, as we should, they can be enacted irrespective of the outcome of this referendum.  I believe it is vital that, no matter what the outcome of the referendum, we should press on immediately with these major reforms.  I intend to do whatever is in my power to ensure that that happens, whether we win or lose the referendum.</P>
    <P>But I intend also to do whatever is in my power also to ensure that the referendum is won, to enable this House to take the next logical step to follow reforms such as these.  All of the reforms I have mentioned so far, taken together, constitute a recognition that marriages do break down.  In the face of that reality, while we legislate to introduce mechanisms to strengthen the family, to endeavour to save troubled marriages and to help to bring the pain, suffering, and financial hardship that marital breakdown can cause &mdash; as we do all of these things, the essential purpose of this referendum is to enable us to go one step further: to give people a chance to start again, in a new and legitimate union.</P>
    <P>In short, we have the power, as our Constitution is written, to introduce a range of measures which take account of the truth that marriages die.  It is essential that we use that power wisely and compassionately. But we should also have the power to legislate to enable people to remarry, and at present we do not.  I have never advocated, and I do not do so now, that we should use such a power lightly or indiscriminately.  Indeed, on every occasion on which I have spoken on this subject, I have pointed out forcefully that unless we in this House exercise great care, we can make the situation worse rather than better.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any Member of this House wants to introduce easy divorce to this country.  Neither do I believe that there is any Member of this House who wants to see the emergence of a so-called &ldquo;divorce culture&rdquo;.  And incidentally, I do not accept the silly slur that there is any Member of this House, or of the Government, who is anti-family.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> But I do believe there are a growing number of people, both here and in the community, who are prepared to face the reality that action is necessary to enable thousands of families to escape from the trap of a broken marriage, with hope that they can make a fresh start. However reluctant some people may be in coming to that recognition, and however much we may want to ensure that divorce is a last resort rather than an easy option, we have now arrived at the point where a recognition of reality is crystallised into positive action.</P>
    <P>The proposal before this House today &mdash; the essential reason for this debate &mdash; is that the people should be allowed to choose.  It is not in itself a proposition about which there is a great deal of controversy &mdash; indeed I think it is fair to say that there may be a virtual consensus in the House that the people, the electorate, the voters, have a right to have a final say.  I would like to think that there would be a consensus among us also in urging as many people as possible to exercise that choice on the day.  It is important that at the end of the day, after all the sound and fury, that choice is exercised in a calm and reflective way, and in a way that is truly representative of all the people.  The outcome of this referendum will have an impact on the future &mdash; I believe that the impact will be for the better &mdash; and thus it is important that younger voters in particular, to whom the future belongs, be encouraged to vote in the greatest possible numbers.</P>
    <P>If I would make any other appeal it would be that the debate for the next several weeks be conducted in as dispassionate a manner as possible.  What we are debating is a serious issue &mdash; it is not an occasion for name-calling, or for the use of simplistic labels.  As one who has been personally attacked in the past for my position in relation to such issues as this, and who has had to listen to attacks on my family, I am very conscious of the level of pressure that can be involved. But I am more conscious of the need to respect the deeply held views of others, as I would wish them to respect mine.</P>
    <P>If I could turn to talk about the actual <Col N="1087" /> proposition on which I expect we will ask the people to make a choice, I am conscious also of the fact that on this issue there is not a consensus.  We will be asking the people: &ldquo;Are you prepared to allow the introduction of a limited form of divorce, in very specific circumstances, in such a way that only you can change those circumstances?&rdquo; I would like, by way of setting out the reasons why I believe people should answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that question, to explore some of the arguments that have been made against change.  I find is noteworthy that the argument is not now being put forward, in any sort of blatant way, that what we are proposing will &ldquo;open the floodgates&rdquo; to quick and easy divorce.</P>
    <P>It seems to be accepted that by inserting the five year qualifying period into the Constitution we have eliminated that possibility. Only the people can in future relax the conditions for the granting of a divorce, through a further referendum. Indeed, the insertion of the further clause, referring to &ldquo;any other condition prescribed by law&rdquo;, has ensured that the Oireachtas can only tighten the conditions under which a divorce may be granted, as indeed we are proposing in the Statement of Intent.</P>
    <P>Thus, since the argument that divorce will become easier to get will not stand up to critical examination, the arguments used against the proposition have to be more subtle and more subjective.  The principal arguments left run are as follows:</P>
    <P>The legal availability of divorce builds up a social pressure which, for large numbers of people, becomes stronger than moral or religious resistance...from being defined in law as indissoluble, marriages, all marriages, become immediately defined as dissoluble. Marriage as a lifelong union becomes legally obsolete.</P>
    <P>Likewise:</P>
    <P>...the concept of &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; is the basis for the most <Col N="1088" /> advanced and unrestrictive form of divorce in the world today...restrictions on divorce are in practice impossible to maintain, and expectations of a moderate and limited divorce law are pious hope more than well-founded expectation.</P>
    <P>Likewise those who argue against state that:</P>
    <P>None suffer more than children do from the divorce of the parents.  Children are the chief casualties and victims of divorce...divorce is a spouse-centred, and not a child-centred development.</P>
    <P>The passages I have quoted above are taken from the bishops' pastoral on this subject, as reported in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times.</i> Before commenting on them, I would like to make a few brief points.</P>
    <P>First, I respect fully the right, indeed the obligation, of the bishops to issue a comprehensive advice to the members of their Church in relation to this subject. The fact that I do not agree with much of its reported contents cannot obscure that fact.  Second, there is, in fact, much in the document that I agree with and admire.</P>
    <P>The document, while making the essential point that divorce is never acceptable to the Catholic Church, accepts that marriages break down.  It does not seek, ostensibly at any rate, that Catholic doctrine should be enshrined in law &mdash; indeed it accepts that private morality cannot be legally enforced.  The arguments put forward in the document are not, therefore, based on moral and religious grounds but on sociological ones, and it is these arguments that I find it impossible to accept.</P>
    <P>For example, in the passage I have quoted above, which I hope is a fair summary of the views contained in the whole document, there appears to be an imputation that divorce creates a social pressure of its own.  This may be the case but, can it be compared to the range of pressures that lead to broken marriages? These pressures &mdash; the causative ones &mdash; range from financial and health pressures <Col N="1089" /> to psychiatric disorders and brutality. There are other pressures, the pressures consequent on broken marriage &mdash; the stress, frequently the violence, the neglect of children amounting sometimes to traumatisation.</P>
    <P>The document goes on to say that from now on, with the passage of this legislation, all marriages become immediately defined as dissoluble.  How can this be true, except in the purely technical sense? Our Constitution recognises the family as the &ldquo;natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society&rdquo; and accordingly it guarantees &ldquo;to protect the Family in its constitution and authority&rdquo;.  The Constitution goes on to pledge to &ldquo;guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack&rdquo;.  The Constitution places a heavy onus on the State, on the courts and on the Oireachtas to honour and to uphold these guarantees. Nothing we are doing, even if we wanted it to, could undermine these provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, therefore, that in our Constitution and laws, we cannot attack the family and we cannot attack the institution of marriage.  In short, we cannot declare that marriage as a lifelong union is legally obsolete.  What we can do, and what we are doing, is to recognise, as the churches, do, that marriages die.  In that situation, and only in the case of the marriages that have satisfied the difficult criteria by which they can be declared dead, we can, if this Bill is adopted by the people, permit a right of remarriage.</P>
    <P>The pastoral goes on to describe &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; as the basis for the most unrestrictive form of divorce in the world.  That might be true if we did not have a written Constitution, changeable only by popular referendum.  It might be true if we were not prepared to write a careful and restrictive definition of irretrievable breakdown into the Constitution, where only the people could change it.  It might be true if we were not prepared in our laws to make it difficult for people to part, and to encourage them to come together again.  Because we are <Col N="1090" /> prepared to do all these things, a moderate and limited divorce law is much more than a pious hope.</P>
    <P>Finally, the document says that children are the main victims of divorce. Divorce, is says, is a &ldquo;spouse-centred development&rdquo;.  I cannot disagree with this but I would have to ask in what way are broken marriages a child-centred development?  Who are the victims of dead marriages, and what can be done for them?  What hope is there for the child of a bitter, angry and perhaps violent couple?</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a great deal of sociological evidence on both sides of this question, particularly in relation to the position of children.  There is also the evidence of our own eyes and our own experience, in a society which has no divorce but more than its share of broken marriages.  Most of us, I believe, know of children who have been neglected, even malnourished.  Most of us know of children who have been alienated not only from their homes but from schools and from society in general.  How many of us, I wonder, really believe that what we are proposing will make the situation worse for them?</P>
    <P>The amendment, if passed by this House and enacted by the people, will give to this House a liberty that it has not previously enjoyed.  It is, of course, a liberty to be exercised under the constraints of the terms of the amendment itself and under the terms of the legislation that the Government intends to enact.  It also confers rights on those people whose marriages have, tragically, failed and who also satisfy both the constitutional and the legislative conditions. These rights are firstly, a right of access to the courts to seek a decree of dissolution of a marriage; secondly, a right to be legally aided to enable persons of insufficient means to seek such a decree and thirdly, consequent upon a decree, the right to remarry.  It is also important to note that the proposed amendment confers the right upon children and upon dependent spouses to have adequate provision made for them and if this is not done no divorce decree can be granted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> To argue that this amendment will lead to unrestricted divorce is an insult to our Judiciary because it assumes that judges who have been appointed and who have sworn to uphold the Constitution and the laws will suddenly reject their oath of office, ignore the fundamental law of the State and wrongfully use the limited jurisdiction that will be granted to them by the people and by this House.  I know that, in fact, nothing of the kind will occur.</P>
    <P>This amendment represents a turning point in the development of our constitutional law and specifically of the relationship of every citizen under the State. Our conception of the fundamental rights enjoyed by our citizens has developed significantly since the judgement of Mr. Justice Kenny in the case of <i>Ryan v. the Attorney General</i> in which he held that there were unspecified personal rights contained in and protected by the Article 40.3 guarantee of the State to protect, defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.  But, these unspecified fundamental rights have had to be established by litigation before the courts and not by other means such as benevolent legislation.  It is perhaps a poor reflection on this House that commentators, looking at the way in which our laws of fundamental and human rights have evolved, allot all the credit to our courts and not to our legislature.  However, I believe the passage of this amendment will represent and will be seen as a significant shift in our conception of the liberty which we allow our individual citizens.  I believe we as a State will no longer be seen as prohibitive, as a State which denies its people that which other democracies have regarded as a legitimate civil right. I also hope that it might cause us to reflect on the nature of and possible need for constitutional reform in its broadest sense.  It is, perhaps, time for not only the legislative reform already mentioned, not only the selective, limited and responsible constitutional reform contained in the Bill before the House, but also a broad reassessment of the manner in <Col N="1092" /> which we govern ourselves, our aspirations as a people and our destiny as a nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of Fianna Fáil, the largest party in the State, hope this very important issue will continue to be debated in a responsible and informed manner and that any assessment arrived at by the people after the debate will be informed, sensible and balanced.  The whole thrust of our approach to this matter is precisely in that spirit and we do not want any confrontational approach. We do not feel it is a matter of conflict, rancour or prejudice and, for that reason, we have decided as a party not to participate in the referendum in a political sense.  We respect the fact that many members of the party have their own views on this matter.  We respect those views and say to those people, our good friends, that they should make their assessment of the issue individually after consideration of all the aspects and vote accordingly.  We have left this matter open to individual members of the party at local and parliamentary level to make their own choice.</P>
      <P>We feel very strongly that this matter involves a personal right, individual conscience and personal morality in one's approach.  In the best traditions of democracy, matters concerning personal conscience in regard to morality should be left not just to our Members in the Dáil and Seanad or to our organisation but to people in general to make their assessment after a mature and balanced appraisal of the facts emerging from the debates in this and the other House.  We have already make this very plain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the speeches made already by the Minister for Justice in introducing the Bill and by the Minister for Energy in regard to the sociological problems involved.  I will elaborate on the legal, constitutional, property and succession problems involved.  I suggest that the fullest possible assessment should be made by the people in regard to how and in what way the spouse and children will be affected by the ramifications of property, succession and financial <Col N="1093" /> aspects of the matter.  A very frank assessment is required and the Government have been lacking in candour in approaching this matter and in spelling out precisely what is involved in so far as legal rights are concerned.</P>
    <P>Protection for the first family is written into the Constitution under Articles 41 and 42 and the legislation already adopted by the House within the ambit of those Articles.  I refer particularly to the Succession Act, the Married Women's Property Act and other legislation passed by this House within the context of the Articles to which I referred.  There is a corpus of legislation giving rights to the surviving spouse and particularly to the children by way of court applications. There is also a whole area dealing with property, succession and financial rights. I should like to know, and the public should be informed as to precisely how these rights will be implemented in future if this amendment is passed.</P>
    <P>The Government have a bounden duty to spell out precisely what is involved in their proposed amendment in the way of impingement on existing legislative rights in respect of property, income, testamentary disposition and financial implications as far as the family is concerned.  It is legitimate to say that, if this amendment is passed, a very real issue of conflict will arise in relation to the rights of the first family as against those of the second and third families.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that according to the proposed amendment a court must be satisfied that adequate and proper provision is made in regard to the circumstances of the dependent spouse and child, that that defence mechanism would be written into the Constitution, but I ask the Government to consider seriously how that can be made effective and enforced. Will the Minister tell us how an order made by a court in respect of the surviving spouse, child or children, of the first marriage can be enforced under the procedures that exist in regard to enforcement here or in any other country?</P>
    <P>As all Members are aware, we are into a very difficult area in regard to the enforcement of court orders.  Theoretically&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> I emphasise that word &mdash; the spouse or the family can be accommodated under a court order but subsequently there is a total lack of capacity on the part of the apparatus of the State to enforce that order.  The family of the first marriage may find themselves deprived of property, income and financial support and that may pass on to the second and third family.  They are legitimate areas for investigation and the Government should explain fully to the public what is involved. It is not enough to pass a simplistic amendment to the Constitution providing for the dissolution of marriage where it has irretrievably broken down.  All other aspects must be taken into consideration by a mature electorate.  Hopefully, the electorate will consider all aspects in a sensible manner when they are given the opportunity.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the need for a compassionate and concerned approach as far as the irretrievable breakdown of marriage is concerned.  We have adopted a mature approach to this matter and we see the social imperative of being able to deal with cases where marriages have been broken down irretrievably in a sympathetic and compassionate way.  That is the reason why Fianna Fáil have decided, in a responsible and constructive way, not to oppose the referendum.  We want it put to the people for their mature consideration after the full facts have been explored in parliamentary debate without any confrontational rancour.  I deplore those outside the House who try to induce confrontational rancour into the debate because, thankfully, it has been noticeably absent in the approach adopted by all sides of the House.  I hope the debate proceeds on that basis.  This matter is highly sensitive and requires compassionate and mature treatment and consideration. We should proceed on that basis and help the public to make up their minds after considering all the facts.</P>
    <P>I should like to enter one or two caveats against the Government's approach to this.  The adoption by them of a quasi-confrontational approach in the sense that they are backing this in a quasi-political way has led to an interpretation <Col N="1095" /> by some commentators that in some way this is a confrontational matter.  We reject that approach.  Speaking on behalf of my party I must stress that we reject totally any confrontational approach to this highly sensitive matter which involves an area where compassion and concern should be the predominant considerations. The legal, constitutional and property aspects must be given mature consideration by the people in the referendum.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that I deplore any mischievous attempt to divert the public mind away from our approach and our attitude.  As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, we will not be diverted from our approach between now and referendum day.  It is tremendously important that the Dáil and Seanad maintain an attitude towards this matter which will secure respect from the people.  The people will accord us that respect if we adopt the approach I have outlined.  That has been the basic motivation behind our party's attitude to this matter and we will continue to occupy that high ground throughout the debate here and until the people make their decision in the referendum. I should like to assure the House, commentators and the public that that is our position.  There should not be any ambiguity about it.</P>
    <P>I will not engage in any other detailed criticism of the matter before us apart from reiterating the real problems that are involved as between the various families and their legal, constitutional and property succession rights.  I appreciate that they are matters for subsequent legislation, but I want the public to be aware that there are real problems involved and that this is not a simplistic matter of granting divorce as a right without other implications or complications. There are massive, serious implications and complications involved and it is the duty of the Government to inform the public accordingly.  This is not an occasion for any smoke-screen public relations exercise.  It is an occasion for very serious and mature debate, an occasion for the Government to inform <Col N="1096" /> the public fully on all the implications and complications involved.  It is not an occasion for making emotive speeches, or debating the matter in a simplistic black and white fashion.  There are very real problems of a highly complex nature on which the public should be informed, allowing them to come to their mature conclusion having been so informed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has watched at first-hand activities and operations of this Government since their inception, especially their abject failure to grapple effectively with the social and economic problems of the country, with particular reference to the social evils in our midst of mass unemployment, crippling taxation, falling standards, rising poverty, crime and enforced emigration, all of which loom around us, it is extremely difficult to understand why, at this critical time, the nation's attentions and resources should be focused on an amendment of our Constitution with the intention of introducing divorce into this country.  It is as if we had nothing else to do, nothing else to worry us.  The need for many thousands of jobs, the welfare of our youth, the need to conserve and improve our social services, to stave off further cut-backs and stem the ever-rising tide of crime and taxation would seem to be of no consequence at present.  I would be a much happier man had the Tánaiste, when he spoke here a few moments ago, talked along those lines, had he dealt with the real issues affecting our people, the real social and economic issues without which one cannot have a worthwhile moral code or social justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the inception of this Government they seem to have been obsessed, not with economic or social issues but with the moral issues of our society.  The questions of abortion, contraception and now divorce would seem to have pre-occupied the minds of the members of the Cabinet. Can anybody suggest that, without a job, without a reasonably secure means of livelihood, any responsible young couple could, or would, embark on marriage? Love on the dole is a romantic concept but, invariably, when poverty comes in <Col N="1097" /> the door, love flies out the window.  Does anybody deny that idleness is essentially the devil's workshop, that the more and more jobs we provide for our people the more crime and violence will wither away in our society?  Does anybody deny that very many of our broken marriages &mdash; which we all truly deplore in this House &mdash; could have been saved had appropriate State aid and support been provided in time?  I am glad something positive is being done in this area on the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>
    <P>I contend that poverty, unemployment and insecurity constitute the greatest threats to marriage and stability of family life.  They are the great demoralising features in Irish society today.  The degree and extent of unemployment and poverty in Ireland, North and South, are simply inexcusable and unacceptable, in a Christian society such as ours.  I contend there are very many families in Ireland today whose meagre income does not provide them with sufficient food, clothes or fuel, families who suffer from malnutrition, inadequate hygiene facilities, who live in sub-standard conditions and accommodation, in squalid environmental conditions. To my knowledge there are more and more families today who simply cannot make ends meet.  The result is unhappiness, deprivation and discord, especially among young married couples. They can no longer maintain themselves even in frugal comfort.  We know that many young couples are unable to meet their hire purchase payments, their house mortgage repayments, their repayments to the banks, building societies or to the unscrupulous moneylenders who stalk about our housing estates preying on young housewives in particular.  In the Ireland of today a marriage needs to be doubly blessed to survive.  It is assailed on every side by economic, alien and sinister forces.  All the signs are there for all of us to see.</P>
    <P>I believe that the founding fathers of this State, especially those who drafted our Constitution, built wisely and well when, in the first instance, they laid the main emphasis on the importance of the <Col N="1098" /> family.  It is declared in our Constitution that the family is the natural, primary, fundamental unit of society, possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.  The suggestions now being made in this House would seek to undermine that fundamental principle.  Moreover, it should be remembered that, in our Constitution, the State guarantees to protect the family, its constitution and authority as the necessary basis of social order, as indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State.  Let us mark well in this House, in the deliberations of the present day, that our Constitution contains this important stipulation:</P>
    <P>The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>That is an aspect of our Constitution on which every Member of this House needs to dwell long and deeply before voting for or supporting the measures now before us.  To trifle with the institution of marriage, therefore, is to undermine the family which must remain the bedrock of our society.  It seems to me that that would be a truly retrograde step which no Member of this House should contemplate lightly.</P>
    <P>The clamour now is for divorce. Regrettably we have many broken marriages. Like so many of my colleagues, I believe that all the resources of the State should be brought to bear on resolving these marital, great human problems.  I believe the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown should be implemented quickly in respect of all fundamental aspects so as to assist in resolving these problems.  A comprehensive education programme to prepare young people for marriage and proper counselling should surely be available in dealing with marital difficulties. The compilation of relevant statistics is of vital importance.  Many of the figures which I hear quoted in this House would seem to be picked out of thin air.  There is nothing to substantiate them.  We need hard facts and the statistics appertaining <Col N="1099" /> to marriage breakdown.  I trust that the figures emanating from the recently held census will be really worthwhile and ones upon which we can act.</P>
    <P>The legal remedies mentioned by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown in respect of such important factors as nullity, separation agreements, maintenance, guardianship, the custody of children, matrimonial property and all these things must be considered urgently. I look forward with much enthusiasm and support to the idea and ideal of the new family court structure, that is to say, the creation of a family tribunal with full powers, duties and responsibilities to deal with marital difficulties and family problems generally.  If this is backed up by a comprehensive system of free legal aid, we will have gone a long way towards stabilising, strengthening and supporting the institution of marriage.</P>
    <P>Divorce is not the answer.  I believe that marriage is an ancient, well tried, noble institution upon which the family is based.  For me and the vast majority of the people whom I represent, marriage is a sacrament.  It is indissoluble.  We accept as our credo that what God hath brought together no man has the right to pull asunder or, to quote the words of the Master: &ldquo;Have you not read that the Creator from the beginning made them male and female&rdquo;?  He also said: &ldquo;This is why a man must leave father and mother and cling to his wife and the two become one body.  They are no longer two, therefore, but one body.  So what God hath united man must not divide&rdquo;.  These are the words of the Gospel.</P>
    <P>Divorce, therefore, is alien to the Christian way of life.  The experience of other countries and all the facts and figures quoted here by Members show clearly that the introduction of divorce leads rapidly to a worsening of the situation which it was designed or intended to remedy and more and more broken marriages are the result.  From being defined in law as indissoluble, all marriages become defined as dissoluble.  Marriage becomes in legal principle a mere temporary union.  The permanency of <Col N="1100" /> marriage is destroyed.  Marriage as a lifelong union becomes legally obsolete. The commitment for life is replaced by a legal commitment to stay with one's spouse unless and until one decides otherwise, in, say, about two, three, four or five years time, when one can be legally separated or divorced.</P>
    <P>It is not just broken marriages which are affected in this situation.  All existing marriages are in principle implicated. The multiplier effect goes into operation and divorce spreads as it has spread in every country, like a plague throughout the land.  As for the concept of irretrievable breakdown as put forward in the proposed legislation, I believe that concept will simply facilitate and accelerate the incidence of divorce in this country. It is tantamount to divorce by unilateral repudiation imposed upon an innocent and unwilling partner by an unfaithful or unscrupulous spouse.</P>
    <P>These are some of the reasons that we oppose all these measures.  Irretrievable breakdown, it would transpire, is the easiest ploy in the world for one unscrupulous partner to impose upon the other. If one looks into that aspect of the matter, one can see clearly and plainly how it can work.  The five year waiting period will quickly become four, three and two years, as has transpired in other countries and within a relatively short time we shall have virtually instant divorce, postal divorce in this country.  In the resulting tragedy it is the children who are the greatest sufferers.  Children are the chief casualties and victims of divorce.  Divorce is experienced by them as a rejection of them by their parents and this can and does give rise to psychological and emotional problems and personality disorders in such children, involving in very many instances a crisis of identity. Divorce is always a disaster for the unfortunate children involved.  There is no gainsaying that fact.  Divorce is bad for men; it is very bad for women, but the real sufferers are children.</P>
    <P>To raise the divorce issue now is certainly a diversionary tactic by the Government.  So far as the people are concerned, it is the old saying, &ldquo;If you <Col N="1101" /> cannot give them bread or work, give them a damn good circus.  Let the populace indulge themselves; let them think that you are conferring some new-found freedom on them, or that they are getting something for nothing&rdquo;.  So, we have this new Coalition circus of divorce to contend with.</P>
    <P>A kite is also being flown, a hint that to amend our Constitution on the lines indicated and bring in divorce would do much to resolve the Northern problem, that the liberal approach and the withering away of things Irish, Republican, Gaelic or Catholic might conceivably placate Big Ian and the Orange Boys and pave the way for the acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I believe that to be utter nonsense and stupid folly. I believe that honesty with our fellow Irishmen and women in North-East Ulster is the best policy.  We are what we are and we should make no apology to anyone for it.  We are the proud inheritors of a great tradition, a rich culture, a religion to which we have held fast down through the ages and will never relinquish. We respect the traditions and beliefs of our Northern brethren and I believe that they must surely respect us for our beliefs, honestly and honourably held and not open to compromise.  Even if we were to offer certain Unionist leaders of today the privilege of rewriting our Constitution as they would like it, I believe that the answer would be the same: &ldquo;Not an inch, no surrender&rdquo;.  So let us not cod ourselves, let us not debase ourselves and let us not sell our birthright for a mess of pottage.  They are fundamentals on which we cannot and must not compromise.  The integrity of the family, the sanctity and the dissolubility of marriage are some of these fundamentals to which I refer and on which we in this House and we in this country must stand fast.</P>
    <P>Let us be careful that we of this generation do not win for ourselves the name of the new soupers who sold their souls for soup, for two penny rolls and for hairy bacon.  I must confess that I find nothing edifying, nothing good or noble in <Col N="1102" /> divorce.  It simply degrades and demoralises. While marriage will remain the ultimate in love and romance, in respect and fidelity, in everlasting union for our young people of today, tomorrow, and always, I want to play my part in trying to solve the problem of broken marriages; but, clearly, divorce is not the answer.  Divorce destroys the concept of marriage as a sacrament.  It makes a mockery of marriage as a permanent institution.</P>
    <P>Let me quote, before concluding, the words of a man who was chiefly responsible for bringing divorce into England in 1857.  That man was Lord Campbell.  He was the great initiator, who pushed through this legislation and claimed all the glory for it.  But, having seen divorce operate in England for a number of years, having seen the tragedy which resulted, the spiralling of divorces, the break-up of family life and the worsening of moral standards in society at large, Lord Campbell wrote:</P>
    <P>I have been sitting two days in the divorce court and, like Frankenstein, I am afraid of the monster I have called into existence.  There seems some reason to dread that the prophecy of those who opposed the change may be fulfilled by a lamentable multiplication of divorces and by the corruption of public morals.</P>
    <P>That was his view after witnessing the operation of divorce even at that time over 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>These are some of the reasons why I am implacably opposed to amending our Constitution with a view to bringing in divorce to this country.  I urge the House and the country to reject divorce.  I urge my constituents in South Tipperary to reject divorce.  They are a proud people, a wise people who have never accepted a lowering of standards be they moral, social or economic.  I believe I speak for Tipperary on this vital issue.  I trust and hope that where Tipperary leads, all Ireland may follow.  To those of my colleagues in this House who wish to see divorce brought in, I would ask them to think again and to beware the monster they are <Col N="1103" /> creating and which they cannot control. Like our friend, Lord Campbell, they may regret their action.  They may regret for the rest of their days their action in condoning such proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here to discuss the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Constitution was enacted in 1937 and this is only the tenth amendment in 39 years.  I believe that this is the most important amendment which has been put to the people.  If this amendment is passed it will make a fundamental change in the status of marriage in the State. Marriage is now recognised by the State as a permanent contract.  If this amendment is passed and divorce legislation introduced, the State will no longer recognise marriage as a permanent contract and marriage will become to be seen as a temporary state and a contract to be ended at the will of either partner when they so desire.</P>
      <P>I spoke here on 14 November 1985 and said that when the Government, if they did, produce legislation to put to the people Fianna Fáil would approach it in a mature and balanced way.  Because of the seriousness of the issue we held a special parliamentary party meeting on 25 April following which we issued a statement pointing out clearly the position of the party.  Could I quote a paragraph from that statement:</P>
      <P>The Party carefully considered all the many aspects and implications of this proposal and in particular its profound effect on the position of families and the nature and quality of our society.  It also had regard to the many different but sincerely held views in the community on this issue and decided that the question should be left to the people as a whole to decide. Accordingly, the Party will not oppose, in the Dáil or Seanad, the proposal to hold a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that that is as it should be; because of the complex nature of the issue it should be left to the people to decide.  We do not have the right to deny <Col N="1104" /> the people the opportunity to vote and to give their views on this issue.</P>
    <P>The referendum should have awaited the results of the census.  The census was held on 13 April and, for the first time in the history of the State, the people were asked to give their marital status, whether they were married, single, separated or deserted.  It would have been very beneficial to have the results of that question in the census before proceeding with the referendum.  We are told that there are 70,000 persons with broken marriages, but it is difficult to substantiate this figure.  I was a member of the all-party committee dealing with the protection of marriage and family life and looking into marriage breakdown.  We did not have any figures which could be confirmed for the benefit of the committee.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous change in the pattern of marriage over the past number of decades.  Persons are marrying at a lower age; and there are smaller families, with the result that the childbearing and rearing years are shorter for the couple.  The couple spend more of their married life on their own as a result of marrying younger and smaller families. There has been a change in the pattern of the extended family.  We do not now have to the same extent the close relationship between grandparents and parents as we formerly had, as people have moved to the city, which has grown out of all proportions with the result that they are away from their homes and their roots.</P>
    <P>The status of women has changed.  The pattern of marriage has changed in another dramatic way also. If we look back to the turn of the century, when a couple married the man went out to work.  He provided shelter for his wife and family.  The housing at that time was not anything like the standard it is at present.  He handed over the money to his wife, who stayed at home to rear and feed the family.  They had to strive against disease because infectious disease was rampant and wiped out one or other spouse early in life.  The average length of a marriage was 20 years whereas now <Col N="1105" /> it is 42 years.  Because these physical difficulties existed, if a couple succeeded in providing a home and food the marriage was very successful.  Nowadays people expect more from their marriage.  Companionship and emotional bonding has become a major expectation of couples at present.</P>
    <P>We all accept that marriage breakdown is on the increase.  This results from pressures within the marriage and also from external pressures.  Contributory factors are unemployment, inadequate housing and the changes that occur in society. The influence of alcohol and drugs, the illicit use of drugs and the proprietary use of drugs is something that we do not give enough attention to.  We do not have the exact figures of those who suffer from marital breakdown.  The only figure which is available, apart from the estimated figure of 70,000 which I do not think was properly assessed, is that of the labour force survey of 1983, which was properly assessed and which states that 21,000 persons are involved in marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>In the UK in 1982 there were 146,698 divorce decrees.  These affected 158,268 children under 16 years of age and 27,898 children over 16 years of age.  What we should have done in advance of legislating for divorce was to look at all the measures that could be taken without the need for a referendum and to take those measures.  It has been fairly obvious for a number of years that there are many areas where the State should update the law or introduce laws to support those whose marriages are in difficulty.</P>
    <P>The joint committee, which was set up over two years ago and reported a year ago, put forward a number of measures which were agreed by all the members of the committee and for which the Government should have legislated.  One thing that concerns me about this referendum is that the Government seem to be linking changes in the existing law to the referendum, changes which it is not necessary to have a referendum to bring about.  The referendum refers specifically to the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> The Irish Constitution explicitly guarantees that the State will protect the institution of marriage.  It is expected therefore that the State do everything possible to ensure that those entering marriage are fully aware of the seriousness of the life long commitment which they are undertaking.  The State provides financial aid to marriage preparation and counselling agencies.  Its social services attempt to deal with such marital problems as come to their notice.  There is no overall policy regarding the provision of planned programmes of preparation or of counselling services for couples when problems arise in a marriage.  Neither does the State have any comprehensive policy for the support of families.  The State should make greater support available for pre-marriage courses, for counselling for those who have difficulties in their marriage and for those who have separated and need support afterwards. There are a number of measures which the State can take.  They could raise the minimum age for marriage to 18 years, which is something that the all-party committee unanimously agreed should be done.  In schools the curriculum at primary and post primary levels should enable young people to realise their total potential, help them develop skills and inter-personal relationships and create some awareness in them of the demands of marriage and parenthood.</P>
    <P>In an oral submission to the all-party committee, Dr. Jack Dominian, clinical psychiatrist at the Central Middlesex Hospital, said:</P>
    <P>My image of the prevention of marital breakdown starts in the family.  I would like to see the family as being the model.  In regard to the schools, I have said again and again that in addition to &ldquo;The Three R's&rdquo; I want a fourth &ldquo;R&rdquo; which stands for relationships to be an essential part of education in schools.  We are doing research at the moment.  I am not saying that you can teach boys and girls about marriage, because it is too big a step for that age group, but you can teach them about personal relationships, about trust, <Col N="1107" /> about communications, about affection and about understanding.  I would like to see that, which is the infrastructure of marriage, being an essential part of education.</P>
    <P>At present voluntary organisations do much work and they receive some support from the State.  The Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the Marriage Counselling Service of the Church of Ireland are doing very valuable work in this regard.</P>
    <P>While much can be done by specific forms of intervention at different levels to assist young people in preparation for the tasks of marriage and parenthood, the primary source of preparation is their life within their families.  The success or failure of that preparation depends on the quality of family life which they experience.  The quality, in turn, will depend upon the degree to which the family is able to fulfil its role.  Families in modern society are not able to do this unaided.  At present State responsibility for family care is divided between several Departments with the result that services are fragmented.  They respond to needs in a piecemeal manner.  The establishment of a Department specifically for family care, as is the practice in a number of European countries, would ensure the appropriate development and implementation of such a policy.  Dr. Jack Dominian, who has very wide experience and is a well known authority on the subject of marriage, the prevention of marriage breakdown and the problems that arise from breakdown, when he came before the all-party committee recommended that there should be such a Department, that it is better to have a Department within an existing ministry than to create a new Department with a junior Minister.</P>
    <P>There are many measures the State could take, many legal remedies which do not need a referendum.  The referendum is purely about the right to remarry.  For example, the laws of nullity could be updated because the present law is in an Act of 1870, the Matrimonial <Col N="1108" /> Cause and Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act.  Though in the past ten years there has been a wider interpretation of that law by various judges, the law needs to be updated in the light of advances in medical and psychological sciences.</P>
    <P>There should be an updating of the law on separation, with more support for separation by agreement, particularly in regard to judicial separation, to take account of problems not included in present law, such as breakdown.</P>
    <P>The law on maintenance should be updated.  The family law in the Maintenance of Spouses and Children Act, 1976, is working satisfactorily but there is the matter of default in payments to victims. The State should pay those persons and then pursue the responsible spouses who have defaulted in payments.  The law on guardianship and custody needs to be amended.  The joint committee took the view that a joint custody order is meaningless if it means that a child would have to live part of each week with one parent and part with the other.  This would not be in the interests of the child except in very exceptional circumstances.  The committee felt that the law on that should be amended.</P>
    <P>The law on matrimonial property needs to be revised.  At present it deals with property interests on chance decisions made over the years and it discriminates against many women if they work outside the home and do not make contributions that would entitle them to an interest in property in their husband's names.  The Family Home Protection Act, 1976, was found to be defective in a recent High Court decision when a creditor applied to sell a family home for a debt judgement.  That law should be updated.</P>
    <P>The law on barring orders could be updated so that such orders could be obtained when the health, safety and welfare of the spouse or children are at risk, as well as in cases of physical violence which appears to be the position since the 1983 case was heard of O'B <i>versus</i> O'B.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy referred to family courts.  We believe there should be family courts.  Particularly since the <Col N="1109" /> committee reported, there should have been some move towards the establishment of family courts, with a High Court judge or judges who would have power to deal with all family disputes with a duty to investigate the state of marriage relationships.  Such a tribunal should have at its disposal the assistance of marriage counsellors of the couples choice, pyschologists, social workers and other relevant persons.  The tribunal should make its decisions on the basis that paramount consideration must be given to the welfare of any children involved.  The tribunal should have available reports from psychologists, social workers and teachers.</P>
    <P>Another area in which the State has not played a proper role is in regard to reconciliation and mediation.  There should be more State support for voluntary groups involved in reconciliation. The areas of agreement rather than of disagreement should be dealt with.  The State could have improved existing legislation in this regard and brought in new legislation where appropriate and this would not involve a change in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Divorce is about the right to remarry and it is true to say that not all persons whose marriages have broken down want that right.  There is no need for a constitutional change except for those who wish to remarry.  The support systems of which I have spoken could be introduced and improved and laws changed without the need for a referendum.  It is dishonest of the Government to be linking these changes to the referendum because it is not necessary to hold a referendum to bring about very important changes which we all agree are necessary.</P>
    <P>The issue to be put to the people is a very clear one.  We all have compassion for those whose marriages have broken down and we must be sensitive to their needs and to their wish to remarry.  We must decide between allowing individuls to remarry and the common good, the good of society if the status of marriage is changed so that it will no longer be a permanent contract in the eyes of the State.  I believe divorce is not in the best <Col N="1110" /> interests of the people because of the serious social consequences and the financial implications that inevitably ensue.  My concern is that the cure could become the disease.</P>
    <P>Article 41 of the Constitution is the basis of the legal protection for the family.  It has influenced all legislation affecting the family since the Constitution was enacted.  A question I ask is whether it is possible to delete Article 41.3.2º, as is proposed in the Bill, without diluting if not negating entirely the value of the entire Article as a protection for the family, and particularly for the first family where a divorce takes place.  It appears to me the new family would have the protection of the Constitution at the expense of the first family.</P>
    <P>Divorce would have serious consequences for the succession rights of women because the effects of divorce on the laws of succession would be significant. Under existing law a married woman has substantial succession rights. Where the husband dies without making a will and where there are no children, the wife is entitled to all of his property and if there are children she is entitled to two-thirds and the children share in the remaining one-third of the property. Where the husband has made a will the wife has a legal right to half of the property if there are no children and to one-third of the property if there are children. These legal rights over-ride any attempt by a husband to disinherit his wife by leaving his property to another person. These rights are substantial and cumulatively they afford the wife considerable protection, especially where her husband may not have her best interests at heart.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked how a woman would fare as regards succession rights if we had divorce.  All the evidence from other countries shows she would fare badly.  The general tendency is to reduce the succession rights of divorced women and in some cases to abolish them completely.  At best the rights of the first wife would be diluted and at worst she would have no rights whatever.  This would be a matter of major concern.</P>
    <P>The same applies to children.  They <Col N="1111" /> suffer in the case of divorce.  Some people argue that divorce is better than continual parental fighting in the home but that is not a real alternative.  In any case where it would be better in the interests of the children for the parents to live apart, they may separate.  They do not need a divorce to do that.</P>
    <P>The financial implications of divorce are important in that experience in other countries shows that in the main the State has to support the divorced wife and her family.  Where an unemployed man whose wife is dependent on him gets a divorce, the State may find itself supporting both the first family and the second family.  It is estimated in the United Kingdom that it costs a sum of £1 billion per year to support persons who are divorced and their families.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the amendment that will be put to the people.  The interpretation of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; by the courts will mean that persons separated for two years will be entitled to a divorce providing they fulfil the other conditions. I believe the five-year period will become two years.  It is wrong for any member of the Government to suggest that in order to reduce the five-year period a further referendum will be necessary.  Anyone who has read the Bill before us will accept it is a matter of interpretation of the meaning of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and that it is the two-year separation period that will apply.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the section dealing with the need for support for dependants. I do not think it is possible to put in wording that will guarantee provision for them.  If we look at the experience in other countries it is obvious that increasingly the State is being called to the rescue of first families and to support them.</P>
    <P>I appreciate this is a complex social issue and that there are sincerely held views by many people one each side.  The debate should be held in a mature and balanced way.  I should like to quote again from the statement we issued on 25 April after a lengthy and mature debate in our own party.  It stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> Fianna Fáil would hope that this important issue will be fully and responsibly assessed by the people and a wise decision arrived at after an informed and balanced debate, free of rancour or prejudice.  To ensure that the debate does not take place along party political lines, Fianna Fáil have decided that the party will not compaign politically in the referendum. Because, however, many members of the party feel deeply about the issue, individual Deputies and Senators will be free to participate personally in whatever way they wish in their individual capacities.</P>
    <P>It is correct that we should not campaign as a political party.  We are the largest political party in the State and it would be wrong for us to politicise this matter in any way.  Our duty is to inform the people on the issues and the consequences of the amendment in a balanced way.  Then, with mature judgment the people will make their decision on whether to amend the Constitution in the way proposed by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit I am a little confused at the attitude of the main Opposition party with regard to this legislation. As Deputy O'Hanlon has stated, they have indicated they do not wish to oppose the holding of the referendum. Yet, in all the speeches I have heard from that side of the House so far, it appears to me a clear indication has been given that they are opposing the referendum in one way of another.  I agree with Deputy O'Hanlon that all sides of the House should try to ensure that the people get a fair chance to make up their minds and to hear the various sides of the arguments in a rational and unemotional way.  The Opposition seem to be preoccupied with the anti-divorce view and a great deal of time has obviously been put into the presentation of a case against the legislation rather than having reasoned arguments, which the statement of 25 April indicated would be party policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a case to be argued for and against divorce.  We must accept that.  We <Col N="1113" /> have an obligation to present both sides of the argument to the people and then to let them decide the issue.  The case presented by the Opposition so far deals with the danger to the family, the consequences of a second marriage and the possibility of easy divorce being on option in the future.  There is no sense in us burying our heads in the sand and pretending that serious marital problems do not exist.  Society has changed in the last 15 years.  Those affected by marital breakdown will proceed on their own course regardless of the outcome of the referendum.  There is an obligation on us to present legislation to the people and to let them decide if they wish to accept it as an attempted resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>The legislation is reasoned.  There is provision for mediation and conciliation. When I ask most people who attend my clinic if they went through any type of conciliation process, they say they did not.  A dispute arose and as a result of that they sought legal opinion and ultimately were legally separated or living apart.  I am sure that is not only my experience but also that of other Deputies.  There is need to some legal mechanism which would direct people towards a process of mediation and conciliation.  Some such procedures do exist at present but they are not sufficient to encourage many people to go through the process of trying to bring their marriages back onto the straight and narrow path.</P>
    <P>The welfare of children has been mentioned and this must be taken into consideration. The welfare of children in broken marriages is in something of a twilight zone at present.  I am sure we all know of cases where there was a broken marriage and one or other spouse entered into another relationship and formed another family.  That is unofficial divorce with very little provision made for the welfare of the children of either relationship.</P>
    <P>Many people say that if divorce is introduced it will become easy to obtain one over the years and the fabric of society will break down as a result.  The case is also made that in countries where divorce <Col N="1114" /> was introduced a few years ago the laws have been liberalised and it is now easier to obtain a divorce there.  I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>As legislators we should present all aspects of the case.  Regardless of their political affiliation the people who are affected by this could decide in an election to take the action which is open to them if their views are not responded to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan made a speech this morning.  It is to be hoped that we will not have a highly emotional atmosphere such as developed when debating other social legislation.  I hope this debate will be conducted in an orderly fashion and that the people will listen to all the arguments and then make up their own minds. Deputy Lenihan raised a number of interesting points in relation to the legal procedures involved.  He mentioned succession rights and inheritance and the entitlements of the children of a second marriage under the Succession Acts.  That is something which must be examined when the Bill is being drafted, assuming that the people allow the House to proceed with the legislation.  It should be readily possible for the courts to resolve those problems within such a framework having regard to the fact that they are expected to resolve them now.  It should be possible for the courts to resolve those problems in this framework having regard to the fact that those same courts are now expected to resolve the problems as they exist at present and which will continue if we do not attempt to introduce this type of controlling legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred to the Coalition circus.  He said this legislation was now being introduced to divert people's attention from other more serious issues. I refute that entirely.  This is a serious issue which requires far more careful consideration than that, and I hope nobody inside or outside the House will treat it lightly.  It is an issue that requires more serious consideration than that.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested on the opposite side of the House that the five year period which was the criterion prior to the granting of divorce in Britain when it was first introduced was subsequently changed <Col N="1115" /> and that now it is relatively easy to obtain divorce there.  I am not a legal person but I feel the fact that this proposal is to be written into the Constitution should be sufficient guarantee to all the people that nobody is going to change the law without the permission of the people who are going to vote on this or some further referendum.  That is reasonable enough. Let me also point out that we have a written Constitution and many other countries do not.</P>
    <P>We have a serious problem at present, the problem of marriage breakdown.  I accept that divorce is not going to solve that problem and I would not try to argue that it will.  But it does attempt at least to try to do something about legalising the situation that follows on a broken marriage.  For that reason we, as legislators, have a serious duty to try to come to grips with the problem which has been there for some years and is obviously growing because society is changing. There are far greater pressures now than there were some years ago and these will continue.</P>
    <P>If we do not move with the times and introduce legislation which will meet the requirements of modern society, society will pass us by and this House will become less relevant than it is at present, and that has been raised on many occasions both in and out of the House over the past few years.  Ultimately the people will decide, having listened to the arguments put forward by those of us in this House.  They will also, I am quite sure, decide having regard to the arguments put abroad outside this House.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to become involved in any such arguments but I feel that in any State it is the right of any Church to express its views on moral or social issues to its flock and expect them to have regard to them.  I am not entirely happy with the theory that a Church in any State should have the right to have those views legislated for or imposed through legislation because that would put people in many denominations, particularly minority denominations, at a distinct disadvantage and is something which flies in the <Col N="1116" /> face of our Constitution which purports to treat all people equally.  Again I emphasise that it is undoubtedly the right of the Churches to express their views on such issues to their people without fear.</P>
    <P>Likewise I believe that we, as legislators, also have a duty to legislate for all of the people having regard to the circumstances prevailing at the time.  Perhaps somebody, at some stage in the future, will have a different view as has happened in the past.  But we, at this time, should try at least to do something to move along with the requirements of the present time.  It is a difficult thing to do but one would hope that when the people come to make their decision on this issue &mdash; and I think they will decide in favour &mdash; they will have regard to the fact that circumstances as they now are are not ideal and certainly change is needed.  The changes proposed by some Members on the opposite side of this House are the same except in name.</P>
    <P>This is going to become a vital issue.  I implore those on the opposite side of the House to try to come to grips with this important issue.  Deputy Lenihan accused those on the Government side of adopting a confrontational stance on this matter.  That is not true.  Since this is Government-sponsored legislation those on this side of the House will obviously have regard to the fact that it is Government legislation and will try, in so far as they can, to set out the case as they see it.  There is no question of adopting a confrontational stance.  The confrontation will come from those who see a need to change but will not accept the change as proposed in this legislation.</P>
    <P>If we do not change, if we do not move with the times, then the times will move without our approval and the law and the initiative will be taken out of our hands. For that reason, I hope the people in their wisdom will decide in favour of this legislation on the basis that it is moral and caring, far more caring than the present system, with particular reference to one spouse or the other and also to dependent children.  In this case provision will be made through the courts in relation to <Col N="1117" /> settlements which will give some semblance of order to a situation where there is now total disorder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that this matter has now come before the House in this form and that, for the first time, the people are likely to be given an opportunity, in a matter of weeks, to vote on the important matter and to allow us, the legislators, to bring into law legislation in relation to divorce.</P>
      <P>I must say at the outset that, as a result of some of the comments I have heard in this debate, I will be worried about the success of possible divorce legislation in this House.  Some of the stances taken by some of the Members in this House lead me to believe that, irrespective of what the people decide on 26 June, it may still be impossible to steer divorce legislation successfully through this House and that would be most regrettable.  I certainly hope that the fears I have, based on what I heard yesterday and this morning, will not come to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I want to make a few comments about the language used in yesterday's debate in particular.  We heard words like &ldquo;sledge hammer&rdquo; from Deputy Woods, and &ldquo;Frankenstein is going to stalk the land&rdquo;.  This morning we heard words like &ldquo;the monster&rdquo; from Deputy Treacy.  Yesterday Deputy Glenn said that any woman voting for this legislation would be like a turkey voting for Christmas.  As a woman Member of this House who has rarely sought to divide issues as to whether they apply to women or men, I reject this and I feel insulted that women are treated like this in this House and in this country on matters of this kind.  It is degrading; it is offensive; it is insulting to Irish women and I hope that throughout this debate people will refrain from discussing women in this way and from implying that this legislation will make women and children suffer any more than they have suffered over recent years as a result of the kind of legislation we have and the trauma so many of them have to live with during their lives.  When we discussed the contraception legislation some time ago <Col N="1118" /> the same kind of language was used. Women were being frightened.  We had hysterical reactions from many Deputies inside and outside this House trying to scare women into believing that they will be more vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I was very struck by Deputy Flaherty's remarks yesterday because her experience is similar to mine.  When we give examples of hard cases we are accused of being emotional and are told that hard cases do not make good law.  Of course they do not but we have to deal with hard cases.  We have to have compassion and understanding.  Above all else, as legislators we must make sure that as far as they can the laws reflect the circumstances so many people find themselves in today.</P>
    <P>Divorce is not new in Ireland.  We have had it for many years, but we have closed our eyes to it.  We pretend it does not exist.  We have divorce Irish style.  We have people living in marriages who do not speak to each other for many years. I dealt with one particular case where the husband and wife had not spoken to each other for more than ten years.  They lived together.  They had all the outward signs of having a marriage, but that marriage had failed; it did not exist.  Those people &mdash; and they are the only people who should matter &mdash; and their children, knew there was no marriage, but they stayed together because to separate would lead people to believe they had failed in some sense, that they had not lived up to society's expectations of them.  There are many people in that category.</P>
    <P>How often have I dealt with people who lived together as husband and wife who have never been married because one of them has been married before? They do not tell many people about this. In some cases even their families do not know one of the parties was married before.  The reason they do not let people know the true facts is that they feel ashamed, they feel they are failures or that they are doing something wrong.  It is no longer right that in a republic we should treat people like this.  It is not just because of the hard cases or because I believe we must face up to the issue in a realistic way, but because I want to see <Col N="1119" /> our Constitution and our legislation reflect the ethos of a republic and not the ethos of a State dominated by one particular Church.</P>
    <P>We should go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the rights and views of minorities are respected and vindicated in our laws and that the views of one particular Church, no matter how much it may be in the majority or how influential it may be, should not dominate our Constitution and should not, to the exclusion of other people, dominate our legislation. We are told by many clerics that the law of the land does not necessarily have to reflect the views of one particular Church.  I do not believe that is the view they really hold, because, when we come to change the law of the land and ensure that it does not reflect only the views of that Church, every obstacle is put in the way.  It is a shame that that is the case.</P>
    <P>It is no different for women and children if their marriages have been declared null and void.  The children still have the problem of growing up without a father or mother.  Yet we are told in the document published yesterday that children will suffer if they grow up in a house without a father or a mother because the parents have separated.  Of course, this will create difficulties for children and, unfortunately, in many cases children prefer to see their parents together.  They hate one parent to be away from the family home.  If that marriage has been declared null and void and if one of the parents has married again, are not the consequences for those children exactly the same as they would be if their parents had been divorced?</P>
    <P>For some people it is better to say that the marriage never took place rather than admit that the marriage existed for a number of years but that it had broken down.  Why can we not be honest and recognise that marriage, which is essentially a relationship between two people based on commitment, does end for various reasons &mdash; unemployment, alcoholism and so on.  We are all aware that relationships end.  People are not machines. They cannot be forced to stay <Col N="1120" /> together in those circumstances.  If they do stay together and if they have all the outward appearances of a marriage, that is not a marriage and that should not be good enough.</P>
    <P>We should not force so many people into accepting second class standards in their marriages when many of them may have an opportunity to start life again. Are we to tell people who make a mistake, who recognised that marriage was not what they expected, a young girl who married at 21 or 22, that for the rest of their lives they will have to pay for making that mistake and that they will never be able to have another chance? That is not acceptable and I know the majority of younger people will not tolerate that kind of society.</P>
    <P>Like other Members of this House I had the opportunity of sitting on the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee.  I learned a lot from my experience on that committee, just as I learned a lot from my work as a Deputy in this city and county.  Some of what I learned frightened me to some extent.  Some people who came before the committee recognised that marriages break down.  When the Knights of Columbanus were questioned as to what we as legislators should do, they said we should advise the people involved to pray for success.  With no disrespect to anybody, that is not the response of a politician.  It is the duty of a politician to try to ensure that legislation reflects an understanding, care and thought for the people in that situation. It is not enough to tell people to live with their mistakes, to pray for success and to hope the problem will go away; or, as some people suggested yesterday, to extend the law in relation to nullity, to extend the law which may allow them to imagine the marriage never existed.  That is dishonest, it is false and it is not the duty of legislators to behave in that fashion.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill, which will be put to the people, is to a large degree the result of the work of my constituency colleague, Deputy M. O'Leary, who has just left the House.  I would like to pay tribute to him. It is interesting to note that we share a constituency where thousands of people <Col N="1121" /> are affected either directly or indirectly with the problems of marital breakdown. At a recent Dublin County Council meeting 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the people who were allocated houses in Dublin county were the victims of marriage breakdown.  These were people who, according to our Constitution, were not families because they were not families based on marriage.  In many cases they were unmarried mothers, some of whom were having relationships with married men and in many other cases they were deserted wives.  That is a very high percentage, but it reflects what is happening around the city.  Some people, may not confront the issues in the way I do, because in other parts of the country the problem may not be as great.  But of this I am sure: the problem exists throughout the country and it is no easier for the people involved if the marriage breaks down in rural or urban Ireland. What people expect of their politicians is that they face this issue, not ignore it or try to sweep it under the carpet.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read a few nights ago the remarks of two members of Young Fine Gael when they read Minister Cooney's views on this matter.  I do not share his views, but I respect his right to articulate them.  I am disappointed that young people in particular would ask for him to be sacked because he holds such views on this kind of legislation.  We must get away from the paranoia in Irish politics of assuming that everybody must be whipped into line on every matter and that, no matter how strongly one feels, particularly in relation to private morality, if one does not subscribe to the views of the majority one must in some way be made to feel guilty and must be sacked or not be acceptable.  Why should somebody with those views not serve in Government? Why should somebody be expected to be out of that Government because he or she held views which he or she in conscience felt to be correct?</P>
    <P>We need more people who are prepared to state their views and campaign for them if necessary and, as a consequence, to respect the views of others who differ <Col N="1122" /> from them.  I am disappointed that young members of a political party would behave in that fashion and would support this rigid disciplinary system whereby nobody is supposed to be free on any issue, particularly on issues of this kind, or to differ in any way from the majority of one's colleagues at a given time.  That will not be tolerated for all time.  That is why in this party we recognise that people in all parties have very serious differences based on their sets of values, religious views and personal views on private morality. Those views should be respected in every way and people should not be thrown out of political parties, or embarrassed in them, or forced to toe the line, simply because they hold views based on their own set of convictions.  The more people of strong convictions we have in politics, irrespective of how much we may dislike those views, the better the parliamentary system we will have and the more that system will reflect the views of the people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about the role of women in this and, in particular, about the views expressed by Deputy Glenn. She is not exceptional.  Such views are expressed by many people, unfortunately, when issues of this kind are discussed. Women are generally supposed to be the moral guardians of all that is right and proper and, if something goes wrong, it has to be the fault of a woman.  We all know many unmarried mothers.  Very few of us meet unmarried fathers but, for every unmarried mother, there is a father of the child.  It is sad that so few such fathers play their part in support of the person who carries and has their child and thereafter support the child or in very many cases ever want anything to do with the child.  I hope throughout this debate, people will refrain from the kind of language used yesterday, not just the &ldquo;turkey&rdquo; phrase which I thought most insulting, degrading and offensive and I hope it will not be repeated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but in particular remarks like &ldquo;women are going to be cast <Col N="1123" /> aside&rdquo; as if they were some kind of chattel or machine to be cast aside by men and made to feel inferior, vulnerable, frightened and threatened.  I know women who are worried about the financial consequences of this kind of legislation. Women who are concerned to know the reality become frightened, worried and upset because they are being fed false information for some people's purposes. This kind of information is fed in order to distort the result.  The result will be fine, no matter how it is achieved.  Even if you frighten and terrorise people into achieving your results, that is fine once you get the right result, but it is not fine with me and it is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Glenn chose the figure of 70,000 couples who are affected by marital breakdown.  She calculated as a result that obviously 35,000 women would be new in the marital breakdown difficulty area who were not in the system already, none of them a deserted wife, or on maintenance from her husband, or on separate payments.  All would now be coming into the system and the State would be expected to look after them.  She calculated the cost of that at around £200 million.  When Deputy Glenn and others like her argue about marital breakdown, they tell us that the 70,000 figure is grossly exaggerated, that it is nothing like that, that it is much smaller.  I do not know what the figure is.  My view is that it is much bigger than 70,000.  It may be much bigger or much smaller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, one problem we had on the all-party committee was the fact that there are no official statistics.  All of the statistics are <i>ad hoc</i>, drawn together from the numbers of people claiming deserted wife's allowance, going before the court for barring orders, trying to get maintenance from spouses and so on.  These figures are grouped together in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion.  I am delighted that, as a result of the census recently carried out, we may have some idea later in the year of what the figure might be, but it does not really matter what it is.  Our Constitution and laws must reflect the ethos of a <Col N="1124" /> republic which is a place that guarantees, vindicates and protects in every sense the rights of minorities and does not seek to have the views of one Church dominant at the expense of protecting the rights of all our people, particularly those who subscribe to minority religions. Many people say Protestants do not want divorce, or Catholics do not want divorce, but people want divorce and not just because they want the right to re-marry.</P>
    <P>Divorce is not just about giving people the right to remarry.  Many people who have had very bad marriages, whose marriages have irretrievably broken down, want recognised in Irish law the fact that once and for all that marriage is over, has ended.  They want the status they deserve which is legal recognition of the fact that their marriage has ended.  Of course, that legal recognition will give them the right to remarry, but it is not just about the right to remarry.  It is about giving people the status they feel they deserve, about recognising in law that a marriage that existed, and may have been very happy for a long time, has broken down.  They are entitled to that, irrespective of the numbers who wish to remarry, who want to have their marriages dissolved, who know that their marriages have ended. None of us has the right to decide whether a marriage has ended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods said yesterday that these proposals would allow for unilateral divorce; that where one party wishes to have a divorce irrespective of the views of the other party, after five years one party could get a divorce.  If one party to a marriage wants a divorce, that marriage is over.  The views of the other person do not matter, unfortunately; if one party feels that the marriage is over and wants the marriage dissolved, that marriage is over.  Marriage is about a relationship between two people based on love and commitment.  If one party recognises and feels that that love and commitment are no longer there then, unfortunately, the marriage is over and has ended, whether it is unilateral or bilateral divorce.</P>
    <P>Whether the proposals are too restrictive or too liberal, depends on one's point <Col N="1125" /> of view.  I share the view that they are far too restrtictive but I accept the political reality that possibly nothing else may succeed at this time.  However, restrictive as they are, it is sad that we are still told by some people that it is the most liberal form of divorce of all.  People who say that must recognise that it is not the truth. It is not the most liberal form of divorce; it is not divorce on demand; and it is not easy divorce.</P>
    <P>If anything it is going to be an extremely expensive type of divorce. Lawyers in many cases may have a field day trying to establish whether a marriage has failed and whether there is any real possibility of these people coming together again.  On the next Stage of this debate I will be putting forward two amendments, one in relation to the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, a very subjective word.  I would have much preferred the word &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; which is a more objective analysis of what has happened.  It is not for us to decide whether a marriage is a failure. Take two couples in similar circumstances. In one case they can have a perfectly viable and happy marriage because of their expectations, views and circumstances. The other couple may feel it is not good enough and that the marriage has broken down.  &ldquo;Breakdown&rdquo; would have been a better word than &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to the campaign, many people prefaced their remarks by saying they would advise their constituents to vote yes or no as the case may be.  Others said they will be campaigning for the legislation, hoping that the amendment will be passed.  Some people feel it is above party politics.  It is.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to come together in such situations and forget about party politics.  Within most parties there are differences in approach to this kind of legislation.  I certainly will be campaigning, and so will most of the Members of my party, to ensure that this legislation passes, not in a party political way or because we want to score political points but because we feel so strongly that the Constitution and the laws should reflect the views and ethos of a real republic. If we believe that, we have a duty and <Col N="1126" /> responsibility to campaign for it and to encourage as many people as possible to see that it becomes a reality.</P>
    <P>I hope over the next few weeks that we will have a real and meaningful debate on the issues involved and that it will be rational and concerned.  I hope it will not be a debate where people choose to score political points either against their political opponents or others who will play a major part in this campaign.  I am interested in particular in the views of the Catholic Church in relation to this legislation. They must recognise, for example, that in the Archdiocese of Armagh, which crosses the Border, there is divorce legislation in one part and none in the other.  I am sure they would agree that there is no real difference in the rate of marital breakdown on one side of the Border compared to the other.</P>
    <P>What reflects the quality of marriage is not legislation or the Constitution, but the ethos and the values which society holds.  For that reason I could never see a situation where the standards and values which are common in many parts of the world would ever become commonplace here.  In fact, the rate of marital breakdown, in so far as we have statistics, is lower in Northern Ireland than in the South.  One thing is certain, whether it is lower or comparable, there is no marked difference between the two and one cannot say that across the Border there is any difference in the kind of marriage that exists there compared to the South. In both parts of the country people have very strong values and convictions about the way society should be ordered.  It does not matter what the law or the Consitution say, they live accordingly.</P>
    <P>Most people in this country, even if they are experiencing difficulties in marriage, go for help at an early stage, when difficulties can often be overcome. Others refuse to go for help, and in cases I have dealt with it seems to be very hard to get the man to seek help.  Most men run away from help, which is a pity because difficulties can be overcome in the early years if they seek professional help.  I hope that we will soon have the kind of professional help which is required in <Col N="1127" /> these situations, because unfortunately in recent years we have left it to voluntary and Church groups to fill the void and to provide professional help.  I should particularly like to praise the work of the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, who do an excellent job in conciliation, reconciliation and in helping couples who have difficulties to overcome them.  Their work is a credit and an example of what could be done.  They filled a void which should have been filled by the State.</P>
    <P>I am not as familiar with the courts system as Deputy Shatter but I have been outside the Family Court on Monday mornings and, despite the fact that family law matters are supposed to be dealt with <i>in camera</i> with nobody knowing what goes on, the fact is you get a list that tells you the case of <i>Murphy v. Murphy</i> or whatever will be heard that morning. Those involved are standing outside in a dreadful corridor and it is quite obvious to everybody passing that they are going into the Family Court.  This is not good enough in a small country where everybody knows your business.  It is not acceptable; and, if we really want to protect family life and to help those in difficulty, we will have to establish a proper family court system.</P>
    <P>It should not be a court in the normal sense, a place where you score points off one another, where you try to establish who committed the matrimonial fault and who the guilty party is.  That is degrading, not just for the parties but for the children involved, who are given great details by their parents about what goes on in court. In some cases the judge asks people to see the children and sometimes they are brought outside the courtroom.  Even children as young as seven or eight years of age know what is going on.  It is horrible for them and they should not be subjected to this sort of treatment.  Many of us who deal with people who have come up against the court system for the first time in relation to family law say that they would prefer to get £20 per week less from their husband's than to have to go through the court system to have <Col N="1128" /> maintenance provided.  The court structure is not adequate and a court in the normal sense of the word is not the place to deal with disputes between husbands and wives.  Our adversarial court system thrives on pulling people apart and on keeping them apart and any chance of reconciliation is usually destroyed when people enter the courtroom.</P>
    <P>We should have informal surroundings away from the normal court structure where people are not asked to go in with criminals or to stand around corridors for hours waiting for their case to be heard. Very often such cases are heard by elderly men who are not trained in family law, it is many years since they graduated and they have little understanding of the problem involved in family law.  They feel that the people should put up with difficulties and that it is their duty to do so.  That type of attitude tends to be adopted by elderly judges who hear family cases.  We need young people who have had specific training in family law, who are understanding and have worked in the area of counselling and so on.</P>
    <P>We should also have a proper conciliation service with psychologists, social workers and others who could work at bringing people together.  Trained counsellors work in a professional way with people who are experiencing difficulties in their marriage.  At present many people, expecially young couples, who come up against marital problems go to doctors, priests or politicians for guidance. None of us is trained or capable of giving the kind of advice required.  Many of the comments made in the debate in relation to the bad effects which this legislation, if passed, would have referred to succession rights and financial matters.  It is the old story; the same attitude prevails in regard to illegitimacy.  Everybody is in favour of removing the stigma until it comes to the financial arrangements.</P>
    <P>Why is it that matters such as succession, property and money are the first things that come to mind when we are debating legislation of this kind?  We are all very caring, but when we get down to the nitty-gritty we find all the pitfalls and create all the difficulties we can.  We <Col N="1129" /> make sure that every hurdle is put in the way so that the legislation which we all seek in general terms to have enacted becomes impossible to achieve.  Unfortunately, that was the way in which some people approached this debate.  They went through the legislation very critically &mdash; although I do not object to that because it is their duty to analyse legislation in a critical fashion &mdash; and they found nothing good to say about it.  Everything was an obstacle or a difficulty and would make life worse for people in that position.</P>
    <P>The reality is that there is marital breakdown and people are living together in second relationships outside the law. They have said to the legislators, those whose responsibility it is to enact legislation: &ldquo;You have not done anything about it; you have swept it under the carpet; you have ignored our problems and we are going to ignore your law because it does not suit us or in any way reflect the type of life we want to live&rdquo;.  They have said: &ldquo;Your law does not reflect what we want for ourselves or our children and we are much better off out of our bad marriages and living with somebody who cares for us in a real marriage even though in law it is not a marriage, rather than living in the circumstances the State is trying to force us to live in all our lives&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some people do not like mentioning hard cases because they are the exceptions. I recognise and realise that there are thousands of happily married people there and there will be after the legislation is passed.  The legislation will not make any difference whatever to couples who are happily married because divorce will not be compulsory and nobody will have to have a divorce, just as judicial separation is not compulsory, or going to court in any sense to reconcile marital difficulties is not compulsory.  If people can sort out their problems, if people can have a happy marriage, they need not be one bit worried about the consequences of this legislation.  However, the hard cases must be considered.  We must provide for those who live together despite their own best instincts.</P>
    <P>Some months ago a woman told me <Col N="1130" /> her husband was having a relationship with her young daughter.  That woman did not want to talk to people about that and she felt she had to continue living with it because society tells her that she must stay living with the person who is treating her daughter in that fashion rather than leaving the house, and that she must ensure that her daughter is not adversely affected for the rest of her life. Despite what we think about the country, there is a big problem in regard to incest and many of us who work in this city are aware of that.  I am not saying divorce is the answer or that recognising that marriages break down is the answer. However, we must not make people feel guilty, so guilty that they continue living in such circumstances and will not get professional help.  Why is that the case? The reason is that priests and legislators keep telling those people that they are supposed to live with it all their lives, they are supposed to accept it and pray for success.  They are told they are supposed to try to make the marriage work.</P>
    <P>One cannot tell a person living under such conditions that anything will make the marriage work because that marriage has failed.  We should recognise that now. There is no point in the debate in the House, or in the course of the debate in the country, in people beating old drums and pretending the problems which are prevalent in our society are not that great.  Similar problems prevail throughout the western world.  There is no point in our pretending that, if the legislation is passed, the problem will be made any worse just as it will not be made any better.  However, if the legislation is passed we will be recognising that people who live in those circumstances have a right to have their marriages dissolved and say: &ldquo;That is the end.  My marriage is over and I do not have to live in fear of the person I have come to dislike&rdquo;. That person will be able to say he or she does not have to live in fear of another person breaking into the house at night or having to be made the subject of a barring order.  That person will not have to live in fear of the other partner getting at the children.  I accept that there are <Col N="1131" /> many cases where men are battered.  The battering is not all one sided.  Many men, unfortunately, are battered by their wives.  Their wives do not speak to them and when they come home in the evening they discover that their wives have been drinking all day.  Whether drink causes the bad marriage or the bad marriage causes drink I do no know, and I do not think anybody else knows.</P>
    <P>I hope the amendment is carried but, like others, I am worried if it is carried, whether subsequent divorce legislation will be passed by the House.  Some of the comments I heard in the course of the debate lead me to believe that there are many people who will say one thing in public, adopt one kind of political stance, but when it comes to the crunch will find all the obstacles, will beat this down all the way and will find problems with the small words, the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; will not be dotted and the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; will not be crossed.  That is not the way to approach this important matter.</P>
    <P>There are many who are looking with interest at what is happening in the debate.  I hope the debate will not again be one where we will have a confrontation between Church and State, where we will have a nasty political confrontation based on people wanting to score political points.  I hope we will not have people rolling out the women and children in order to create mass hysteria.  I hope people will not be terrorised or frightened into staying away from the polls or into voting against something which in conscience they would prefer to vote for. Those people may feel that because of the consequences, their financial position, their house, their succession and their fear of losing their children, they must vote against divorce.  That type of jargon has already been used in the debate, but it must end if we as a mature society are to face up to the problems that confront so many of our people and if we are to ensure that the laws here reflect a real republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second major opportunity the House has had since the <Col N="1132" /> New Ireland Forum, and the forum report, to indicate our willingness to deliver on some of the offerings made by all parties at the forum as to the type of society we want to have here and our willingness to acknowledge that we would recognise and cherish different traditions. The first of those opportunities was on the Family Planning Bill introduced last year.  We saw clearly then that the views of all parties were not all what they appeared to be at the forum.  We are now presented with a very historic opportunity to indicate our willingness to recognise that the rights of people with different traditions or views from the major established Church here should be accommodated.</P>
      <P>For many years I had difficulty in my mind with the subject of divorce but in recent times the difficulty I have had has disappeared because I have come clearly to the conclusion that divorce is a civil right.  We should not change the law to deal with hard cases &mdash; the new legislation will certainly provide solutions for them &mdash; but I take the view that divorce is a civil right which should be available to people, Catholics or non Catholics.  I do not think we should change our Constitution to facilitate the views of people of different traditions on this island but we should change it because it is the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a commentator pointed out in the past few days, divorce will not be compulsory and nobody will have to get it.  If a person's marriage breaks down, he or she can continue to live with that if they wish for the sake of the children or if they believe it is in the best interests of the children to do so.  However, those who find themselves in a marriage that has failed should have access to the divorce law and access to permission to remarry in the eyes of our State law.  Obviously, the State must put some control on this to ensure that social order is maintained. It is difficult to bring about that balance. I know there are different views on the provisions the Government propose to put into the Constitution.  Some say the Government have gone too far in being restrictive and others argue differently. <Col N="1133" /> Certainly, it is not the case, as the Catholic Church have claimed, that this is the most liberal form of divorce available. Frankly, that is a nonsense.  In all the circumstances, and given the fact that it has taken so many years to get this measure into the House, we should take it as it stands and propose to the Irish people that if they wish to create the type of community all parties to the New Ireland Forum said they wanted they should adopt this.</P>
    <P>It has been an outstanding characteristic of the debate that Members referred to the position in the United States and in the United Kingdom.  That may come from the fact that in the pastoral letter revealed in yesterday's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> the Church referred at considerable length to the position in the US and the UK.  However, as Deputy Harney pointed out, we are a completely different society.  Our ethos is utterly different from the ethos that exists in the US.  The ethos that exists in parts of the United States is different from the ethos that exists in the UK.  I am not saying that our society is ideal or better.  We certainly have some warts, particularly unique ones, in the type of life, community and society we have, but our society is fundamentally different and we recognise it to be so.  We would have to change in many different respects, apart from changing the divorce law, to make our society like American or British society.</P>
    <P>I will read the pastoral letter of the Bishops in full but I find it strange that they do not appear to have referred at all to the position in the North.  Bishop Cathal Daly in the forum report referred to that position but it must not have suited in some way to refer to it in the pastoral letter.  The Divorce Action Group have published statistics which indicate the number of decrees nisi granted &mdash; they become absolute in the North of Ireland after six weeks.  They state that in 1981, 1,498 were granted; in 1982, 1,467; in 1983, 1,279 and in 1984, 1,313.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of a leaflet circulating in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire from his Department and in his name which states that the cervical smear test is available in all health clinics throughout the country free of charge; and if he will name the clinics in the Dún Laoghaire area, the rest of the country of Dublin and the city of Dublin, where these facilities are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Department's leaflet &ldquo;Summary of Health Services&rdquo; was circulated in the Dún Laoghaire area.  The Deputy will also be aware of a new report which I have just completed entitled &ldquo;Report: Health Services 1983-1986&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like to confirm that cervical smear tests are available nationally through health centres, maternity hospitals on an out-patient's basis and through general practitioners.  The level of demand for this service varies significantly from area to area; in areas where demand is low the service is organised on a regular review basis, while in areas with a high demand, a more structured approach is taken.</P>
      <P>At present the demand on the Dún Laoghaire health centres for cervical smear testing is, I am advised by the local health board manager, too small to warrant the making of formal arrangements in the health centres.  Accordingly, when women present at their local health centre they are referred either to their family doctor, to a hospital out-patient department, or to a health centre where the demand is sufficiently high to warrant the organising of special cytology clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of any individual difficulty being faced by any women in the area <Col N="1135" /> my Department will immediately consult with the Director of Community Care to ensure the full delivery of this service.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area cervical smear testing clinics are operating in the following health centres: Rathcoole, Lucan, Clondalkin, North Strand, Ballymun, Coolock, Kilbarrack and Edenmore.  In addition, the service is available through general practitioners and at all the Dublin maternity hospitals on an out-patient basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that a number of constituents brought this circular to my attention.  It appears that the information contained in the circular is misleading because it says cervical smear tests are available at all health clinics throughout the country free of charge.  I would have thought that would have included the Dún Laoghaire area.  Can the Minister now confirm that is not the case, that the information contained in the circular sent out in his name was misleading and confusing to say the least?  Can the Minister say what was the cost of publication and distribution of this circular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;Summary of Health Services&rdquo; is the general leaflet of the Department of Health.  It is readily available to anybody who wants copies; there is no charge for its supply.  It forms part of the general information services of the Department of Health.  It indicates that the service is available in all health centres throughout the country.  In simple terms, if a woman wants to avail of the service, she goes to the health centre and some centres have formal facilities located in the centres.  She notifies them that she wishes to avail of the service, which is free of charge, when arrangements will be made by the staff of the health centre for a referral.  In the case of some health centres in a large catchment area &mdash; where a large number of women frequently present themselves &mdash; formal full service is made available at the centre itself.  Otherwise, as is the case in Dún Laoghaire &mdash; where women present <Col N="1136" /> themselves occasionally, a small number each week at the different centres &mdash; the demand would not warrant having health staff waiting for, say, six to ten women a week, perhaps one or two every second or third day.  Such persons presenting themselves are referred immediately either to a maternity hospital or to a GP locally who provides the service.  I stress that I have not had any individual complaint. I have had many inquiries from women's organisations and so on but no woman in Dublin has come to me or to my Department saying: &ldquo;I cannot get a cervical smear test done as a matter of urgency&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The ladies I have in mind brought the Minister's circular to a health clinic in the Dún Laoghaire area, and the staff at the clinic could not help them.  I do not want to embarrass the Minister &mdash; it is not my form having regard to the fact that we share the same constituency &mdash; but it smacks somewhat of electioneering, the Minister having issued the circular in his name, the women going to the clinic and discovering that the staff there were unable to assist them.  In those circumstances the Minister might examine that type of circular in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that women going to clinics seeking this test would be referred to a local general practitioner.  Would he say whether the service would be free from the local general practitioner in the same way as it might be free, if it was available, through a clinic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the service on a national basis is free of charge and the facility is available.  The normal point of inquiry for the delivery of the service is a health centre.  We try to build it up on the basis of a community health service rather than referring women directly to hospitals.  In Dublin we have a substantial number now in operation.  While appreciating Deputy Andrews' point, I do not accept at all that it is a local matter in so far as our <Col N="1137" /> constituency is concerned.  I emphasise that my discussions in the Department of Health and with the Director of Community Care indicate that the service is readily available, that there have been some backlogs at the hospitals undertaking the actual assessment.  That is something that was occasioned by disputes about overtime and so on, most of which have been resolved.  We had continual difficulty in relation to St. Luke's Hospital, for example, but that was resolved last year.  Overall, the service is available and Deputy De Rossa made that point. Since the previous parliamentary question came up in the House, I had the service extended to the health centre in Ballymun.</P>
      <P>If there are sufficient women in Dún Laoghaire presenting themselves on a regular basis, say in Patrick Street in Our Lady's Clinic, service will be provided, or one in another major health centre in Loughlinstown.  There is there a very new, large health centre with a catchment area of about 50,000 people.  One might in that area have sufficient women who would present themselves.  It could be operated on that basis.  However, as of now my information is that the service provided is adequate.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree, now that it has been raised particularly with regard to the Dún Laoghaire area in which there are nine local health centres, none of which offers this service, that that catchment area is not being serviced? If we wish to make it a positive programme, not only on a national but on a regional basis, a catchment area of that size and with that population of young married women deserves some centres to be set up without the women involved having to signal individually that such a need arises, particularly if it is advertised that the service is already available.</P>

      <P>It was never intended to be a walk-in service.  It is quite impossible to organise such a service in most areas.  One would have to have a medical practitioner in an area awaiting patients for protracted periods.  For example, we have a maternity hospital in the constituency in question in Loughlinstown and nearby many other facilities where this service can be provided without any difficulty whatsoever to women concerned. In the Department of Health I have not had a single complaint from any woman who has had difficulty in obtaining the service.  That is the reality.</P>

      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has approved an outline plan drawn up to implement the report &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; in respect of psychiatric services in the board's functional area.  This plan includes proposals for the development of community based services in the County Clare area based on the north, south, east and west Clare areas with headquarters in Ennistymon, Shannon, Ennis and Kilrush, respectively. These will replace the countywide services of Our Lady's Hospital, Ennis, on a phased basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are following up the implementation of this plan with officers of the Mid-Western Health Board.  It is not proposed in this plan to close down Our Lady's Hospital, Ennis, in the immediate future.  An important aspect of the plan is to provide a 40-bed psychiatric unit at Ennis General Hospital.  I have noted that it is reported in the <i>Clare Champion</i> of 21 February 1986 that the General Secretary of the Psychiatric Nurses' Association attributed certain comments to me about the future of Ennis and Ardee psychiatric hospitals. No such statements were made by me and <Col N="1140" /> I very much regret the needless concern caused to the patients and staff of these hospitals.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware, that since the publication of the psychiatric services report, &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;, there have been some anxiety and concern, especially on the part of relatives and patients in the hospital and of the staff also about the future of the hospital.</P>

      <P>A question, Deputy, please.  We will make some progress if the Deputies ask questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>May we have some assurance from the Minister that in the immediate or long term view, say in the next three to five years, there will be no change in the existing situation at Ennis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There will indeed be change in the existing situation.  I make the point that that change is needed and is on the following basis.  The Mid-Western Health Board have submitted their plan for the development of the psychiatric services in County Clare.  This plan was approved by the board at their meeting on 4 April last.  The board decided&mdash;and I fully support their decision&mdash;to provide psychiatric services on the basis of four sectors within the county.  I do not think that the Deputy would dispute that. North Clare will be sectoralised in Ennistymon, west Clare in Kilrush, east Clare in Ennis and south Clare in Shannon.  As the Deputy knows, there are already day hospitals in Kilrush and Ennis.  The sector HQ day hospitals would have to be rented or built in Ennistymon and in Killaloe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan also provides extensive development of supervised and unsupervised hostels and high support hostels for new long stay patients.  Finally, there will be a 40-bed psychiatric unit in Ennis General Hospital.  All that will impact on the general delivery of services by Our Lady's Hospital in Ennis, which provides a general county service.  In that framework there will be change which will be on a phased basis.  I am very pleased that that <Col N="1141" /> health board have submitted plans which are in accordance with the &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; psychiatric community services which we envisage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it that the Minister will approve that plan and press ahead with its implementation and with the provision of the services in the areas which he has mentioned, before any attempt is made to close down existing services?  There is a fear that some developments may take place at Ennis Hospital before the other services are provided in the various locations mentioned.  The Minister will be aware that there are up to 500 patients in Ennis and there is anxiety at present about their future prospects.</P>

      <P>It is evident that Deputy Daly wishes to pursue his party's propaganda smear campaign and wants to bring this matter down to County Clare.  I would like to take this opportunity of complimenting the Minister for the programme which is being followed and the very good work that is going on in Kilrush.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the affirmative.  We are anxious to upgrade the general hospital and to provide the renovations, which are absolutely essential in terms of fire precautions.  As the Deputy knows, we all have become very sensitive about this issue.  Hospitals which are on in years require substantial refurbishment. This is going on at present.  It can be upsetting to the staff and to the patients in such hospitals while such changes are being made.  I have no doubt that with co-operation the work can be done quite expeditiously.  There is no cause whatsoever for concern be it in the general hospital, in Our Lady's or in St. Joseph's Hospital.  There is no need for hysteria in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent report on medical care for the aged which was prepared for the North Eastern Health Board recommends the appointment of three physicians in geriatric medicine to the board's area.  I understand that the <Col N="1144" /> board are currently examining the structure and funding of these posts and that a proposal will be submitted to my Department in the near future.  When this proposal is received my my Department it will be considered without delay.

There is a lack of effective geriatric assessment in most of our health board areas and the appointment of geriatricians can be of enormous benefit.  Recently I agreed to the appointment of one for Loughlinstown Hospital in the south Dublin area where there is a large number of elderly people.  This is already proving itself to be exceptionally beneficial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the anxiety of patients and relatives at the proposal to close a 50-bed unit, and other accommodation restrictions, at St. Joseph's Hospital, Ennis, County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of St. Joseph's Hospital, Ennis, is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance and I am assured by the board that any elderly patient in genuine need of accommodation at this hospital will be able to obtain it without any difficulty.  Accordingly, there is no need for any anxiety on the part of patients or their relatives regarding the availability of accommodation at St. Joseph's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate, of course, that in the current budgetary situation, this board, in common with other health agencies, is examining the whole range of services being provided to see where effective economy measures can be introduced without adversely affecting patient care.  The prudent management of bed mumbers at St. Joseph's Hospital and at <Col N="1146" /> all other hospitals in the board's area forms an integral part of this examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, because of the shortfall in the region of £3 million in the budget for the Mid-Western Health Board, there is now widespread anxiety and problems arising in the hospitals in Ennis and in County Clare as a whole?  Is the Minister aware of the chaotic situation which is presently developing?  I do not think one can divorce St. Joseph's Hospital from the General Hospital in Ennis as there is an exchange of patients between the hospitals. There is widespread anxiety and chaos in the General Hospital in Ennis. Is the Minister aware that the roof of the General Hospital in Ennis is leaking and they have to put buckets in the corridors and in the wards to collect the water? Does the Minister understand what is happening in the hospital services in County Clare and will he do something about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that there are buckets there, because it took this Minister for Health to allocate the money that will improve the hospital. That is the reality.  As the Deputy well knows, this year, with my approval, the board took steps to improve both the ward accommodation and the theatre along with the provision of the second entrance into the second theatre.  As a consequence, and to enable those improvements to take place, 38 surgical beds were closed for a limited period and surgical admissions were confined to emergency cases.  While the work is in progress surgery is being carried out in a temporary theatre.  This work will be finished at the end of July.  The surgical beds and service will then be brought back into full use.  There will be two separate theatres with independent entrances. Equally, I would point out to the Deputy that a recent report from the fire officer recommended that the number of beds in the hospital should be reduced in order to improve the fire precaution arrangements.  As the Deputy knows, the <Col N="1147" /> health board have appealed that recommendation to the county council.</P>
      <P>These are the developments in the hospital.  I regret very much that Deputies are equating all of that with alleged cutbacks.  There are no cut-backs in this hospital.  The hospital is being urgently improved for the people of County Clare and, as the Deputy knows, there are some 50 surgical beds in the hospital.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the hospital was designed and planned as a 70-bed hospital.  There are up to 150 beds in the hospital.  There are corridors where there is no room to move, where there are beds lined after beds.  Is the Minister aware of the complaints that have been made, including complaints made on national radio, about the situation where there are male and female patients using the same wards and the same toilets?  There is a chaotic situation there and could the Minister take immediate steps to remedy this?  Could he give us some indication of what he proposes to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the broad point, and the Deputy is well aware of it, that there is a substantial provision of geriatric beds in County Clare.  No matter what way one examines the population of the county or the number of elderly persons in the county, it is apparent that between St. Joseph's and the three district hospitals in Ennistymon, Kilrush and Raheen and the various other facilities including the private nursing homes in the area, there is an adequate provision of geriatric beds in that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board have assured me that, where they require the admission of an elderly person to one of those facilities, they do not have any major difficulty with accommodation. That is taking into account the closure last year&mdash;and it was an appalling facility which the Deputy's party wanted <Col N="1148" /> to keep open&mdash;of Edenvale hospital which was a totally unsuitable 30 bed geriatric centre.  It was utterly unsuitable for the treatment of the elderly.  Fortunately we closed it and as a result we opened the new maternity unit at Cahercalla.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister prevail on the health board to ask the authorities at St. Joseph's Hospital and the county hospital in Ennis to co-operate so that there will not be any over-anxiety because of the reduction of 38 beds due to the change in the operating theatres at the county hospital?  Will these beds be made available until work is completed in July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that the surgical service will be brought back into full use at the end of July.  Construction and renovation work can be notoriously delayed but, in this case, work is expected to be finished by the end of July.  I hope people will co-operate and exercise patience and that politicians will resist the temptation to stir it up.  If they want to have a go at the Minister for Health they should find something decent to have a go at him.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the very grave and serious situation that exists in the general hospital in Ennis and that the fire officer of Clare County Council on 28 April 1986 issued a warning to the hospital?  If they were to comply with the direction of the fire officer in the county the general hospital should now be closed.  Can the Minister tell us what action he intends to take to rectify the very serious situation that exists there and when his Department propose to build the two additional wings to accommodate 15 additional female medical beds and 15 additional male medical beds in the hospital?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the North Western Health Board in relation to the provision of geriatric hospital services is that these services should be provided in small locally based units and in line with that policy it is proposed to reduce the level of services in the central geriatric unit at St. Joseph's Hospital, Stranorlar.  Discussions are being held between officials of my Department and officials of the board in order to make the necessary arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Saint Joseph's was the only institution providing longterm nursing care for geriatric patients.  The board took the view that they should have a programme of community nursing units in such places as Buncrana and Falcarragh&mdash;throughout the county.  It is the intention of the health boards to develop this programme of community geriatric care throughout the country.  I should point out that 52 elderly patients have been transferred from Saint Joseph's to community nursing units, ten of these in 1984.  This year I have provided extra money for Buncrana. It has been possible, therefore, to reduce the numbers in Saint Joseph's from 242 beds to 190.  We have a day hospital in Saint Joseph's for 89 persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that there will not be any reduction in Saint Joseph's below the 190 beds until further units have been built?  The Minister announced section 31 cuts in the budget.  Can he arrange the position so that the hospital will not be closed or <Col N="1155" /> phased out until adequate alternative facilities are available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 31 has operated for some years.  As the Deputy knows, budget situations are tight and we are trying to develop sufficient units throughout Donegal while we retain all the beds in Saint Joseph's.  We cannot have it both ways.  I am not in favour of large geriatric hospitals with up to 250 beds.  I should prefer that people would live in the areas from which they come in community nursing units.  It is far more effective and I do not think there is any dispute between us on that point.</P>

Generally speaking, the services in Donegal are extremely good and the nursing units are working effectively. I do not know of any major budgetary impact on those services.</P>

      <P>The original letter of allocation spoke about a reduction in the level of services provided in St. Joseph's geriatric hospital.  That is part of the general policy of the Department.  I do not know of any adverse impact on the number of beds in that hospital or in other community services arising out of the budget allocation.  It is changing the system rather than trying to cut corners to save money.  It has been possible since 1980 to reduce gradually the number of beds in St. Joseph's.  I should like to see the development of further community nursing units throughout the region particularly in the Leitrim and Sligo area. Donegal has been doing quite well but there are areas in Sligo and Leitrim where the same policy could be implemented, and is being implemented to an extent.</P>

      <P>As far as I am aware, the Minister has asked the health board to cut back almost £4 million in their budget. We must be the only health board in the country who have not an adult dental scheme.  It is very difficult to provide a service when they are asked to cut back.</P>

      <P>Time and time again I have indicated that this kind of mythical <Col N="1160" /> £4 million figure which is trotted out by public representatives has little bearing on reality.  The health board have received an increase in their allocation for 1986.  Inflation is running at 2.5 per cent and the health board allocations are up by 5½ per cent.  They have money available to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will withdraw the letter sent to the health boards instructing them to be more vigorous in their applications of guidelines for general medical service cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question relates to a letter dated 30 April 1985 which issued to the chief executive officer of each health board above the signature of a senior officer of my Department.  That communication related to the various initiatives which health boards might pursue in order to ensure that expenditure on the general medical services scheme in 1985 would be commensurate with the finances available.  The letter in question indicated that proper control by the health boards of the numbers covered by medical cards could make a significant contribution to cost containment and recommended vigorous implementation of the published guidelines for eligibility, but in accordance with agreed and standardised procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, and as the text of the letter made explicitly clear, applicants for medical cards whose incomes exceeded <Col N="1161" /> the appropriate income guideline figure would be issued with a medical card only where it was clear that hardship would otherwise arise.  This recommendation was, of course, in complete accordance with the appropriate statutory provision, namely, section 45 (1) of the Health Act, 1970.  Similarly, the letter noted that effective ongoing review procedures should be placed in operation to ensure that medical cards did not continue to be held by persons who were, in fact, no longer eligible to hold them.</P>
    <P>I can see no grounds why I should now ask my officials to withdraw the letter in question or why the health board administrations should be requested to ignore its recommendations.  Indeed, were I to do so, it would, in effect, amount to explicit ministerial approval for the idea that persons ineligible for medical cards should be issued with them or should continue to hold them.  It would also suggest that careless and loose application of the published income guidelines for medical card eligibility would suffice in the future.</P>
    <P>In any event, and as the Deputy will be well aware, the determination of eligibility for medical cards in individual cases is entirely a matter for the chief executive officer of each health board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to a letter dated 12 December 1985.  Arising out of the last comment made by the Minister that it was a matter for the CEO, does he stand over the statement that any increase in demand for cover should be offset by the uniform rigorous application of the guidelines?  Does he accept that there must be discretion on the basis of need and that a rigorous application of the guidelines will cause undue hardship to a number of people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to me&mdash;I have looked at all the counties where medical cards have been issued&mdash;is that there has been no reduction by and large.  To take the Deputy's own county, in 1984 there were 12,244 medical cards, representing 42.59 per cent of the population.  In 1985, it was <Col N="1162" /> 11,999 medical cards representing 43.8 per cent of the population.  What has happened in a number of counties is that it has been computerised and is carried out on a regular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the statement that there should be rigorous application of the guidelines irrespective of need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There should not be any excess allocation over and above the guidelines.  Thirty-seven per cent of the population are covered by medical cards. That represents almost four out of every ten people.  I did not have anything to do with the 1982 issue of medical cards but in that year 37.19 per cent of the population had medical cards.  In 1985, 36.7 per cent had them.  The reduction is largely accounted for by the fact that, by Government decision, I do not issue medical cards to students irrespective of their income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the widespread concern amongst some parents and health care workers regarding the inability to have severely mentally handicapped children placed in residential care; and the plans he has to ensure that facilities will be provided as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware that gaps exist within the mental handicap service, I do not consider that the provision of extra residential facilities for severely mentally handicapped children is the top priority.  Long-stay residential care for children should only be provided after other alternatives, such as family support and hostel accommodation, have proved unsuitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to identify the current priority requirements in the mental handicap service and to assist in finding a solution to the problem, I have set up a small consultative group to examine the matter and to make recommendations to me. <Col N="1163" /> The first meeting of this group will take place in June.</P>

      <P>What advice would the Minister give to a parent with a severely mentally handicapped child who is unable to have that child placed in residential care?  Would the Minister accept that because of the reduction in real terms in the allocation to voluntary organisations which cater for the mentally handicapped the position will get worse?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  In consultation with all the agencies concerned we have been examining the position of those who are mentally handicapped.  I am well aware that this is an area which can be hyped up almost overnight, for example, by somebody ringing up the Gay Byrne Show.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy the facts.  Since 1983 Cheeverstown House costing £1.5 million this year has 124 day places with ten beds open so far this year.  In St. Mary's Drumcar we have provided £200,000 extra for a 20 place unit and two chalets with ten places in each.  In Dungarvan we have provided a new assembly hall and a hydrotherapy pool.  In Belcamp we will be opening the adult day care centre this year at a cost of £¼ million.  In St. Patrick's in Upton in Cork we have opened five chalets with ten places.  There is a hostel awaiting funding in Cootehill.  I take the Deputy's point there.  In addition, to enable the main services to be brought onstream, since 1983 we have given additional moneys to the Brothers of Charity, to the Pope John Paul Centre in Ballybay in County Galway and to a small centre in <Col N="1164" /> Cork.  These moneys are being expended and there is a lot of argument going on about the staffing of those units and I have been very disappointed about the way in which some of them have opened. But by and large the money is available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board have agreed that arrangements should now be made which will enable the psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital to open as an integral part of the psychiatric service for north-east Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Beaumont Hospital Board have decided to support the concept of having an integrated community and hospital psychiatric service in this area and to proceed immediately with arrangements for the joint appointment with the Eastern Health Board of two consultant psychiatrists.</P>
      <P>Officers of my Department had an initial meeting with representatives of the relevant staff organisations and further meetings are now being arranged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is not really practical to open one section of a 720 bed hospital when he is not opening the whole hospital? There will be services such as catering where the whole dining area has to be opened up to provide for these patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary course of events, if one were starting from scratch and there was no other staff in the hospital, I would agree that it would be ineffective and uneconomical. But there are already 27 staff working in the hospital and at a meeting of the board of the hospital on 13 May the board agreed to seek the appropriate approvals <Col N="1165" /> to the appointment of the two consultant psychiatrists, to the structure of those posts and to the service to be provided. So we are going ahead and we will have the 34 beds opened there.  They can be opened quite separately and will service the community care area No. 8 incorporating Coolock, Killester, Raheny, Howth, Swords and Balbriggan, a population area of about 180,000.  I see no reason why those 34 beds cannot be opened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not recommended a reduction in the intake of medical students but I am concerned with the present output of medical graduates and my Department have had discussions with the Department of Education about a phased incremental reduction of the intake of students into medical schools to match service requirements.</P>
      <P>The Department have initiated an analysis of the medical manpower situation in Ireland to ensure that rational decisions may be made.  Decisions can only be taken in this area after the most careful consideration because they will impact on the medical schools and also the career opportunities and income levels of health professionals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education together with the HEA have primary responsibility for our medical schools. Following a review undertaken by the Higher Education Authority in 1978 it <Col N="1166" /> was decided that a figure of 305 Irish medical students each year would meet future medical manpower needs.</P>
    <P>The number of Irish entrants to medical schools has been reduced towards this figure over the last number of years.  The number in 1983-84 was 343 and the number in 1985-86 is 322.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 1983 and 1985, inclusive, an estimated additional £60.5 million was spent on community care services.  This represents an increase of approximately 25 per cent over the period compared to overall inflation for the same period of approximately 22 per cent, a real growth, therefore, of approximately 3 per cent in spending on community care services.  This real growth has occurred against a background of restricted resources generally in the health services.</P>
      <P>A number of new community orientated services have been initiated since 1983.  The decision to introduce a new service occurs, of course, at the end of a complex process of review and evaluation which may take some time to complete. In addition, therefore, to new services a number of reviews were initiated and some of these are still ongoing.</P>
      <P>More importantly perhaps than the introduction of new services is the improvement of existing services and the reorientation of institutional services to community based thinking, for example, the psychiatric services.  Within the existing financial framework it has proved possible to make major improvements in this manner.</P>
      <P>The following is a list of new services which I introduced since taking office.</P>
      <P>(1)  Measles immunisation,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> (2)  AIDS monitoring and information services,</P>
    <P>(3)  Nutritional surveillance service,</P>
    <P>(4)  Major upgrading of the services in the area of drug abuse in conjunction with other Ministers,</P>
    <P>(5)  A major intensification of anti-smoking services.</P>
    <P>(6)  Dental Services: Six new orthodontic posts were established, and are in the course of being filled.</P>
    <P>(7)  Scoliosis Screening: Following the completion of a pilot screening service on scoliosis I have now approved the phased development of a national screening programme.</P>
    <P>(8)  Travellers: The development of special services for the travelling people.</P>
    <P>(9)  Child Care Services: Major developments in the child care services.</P>
    <P>(10)  Cancer: Extension of free cervical smear testing services.</P>
    <P>(11)  Small Health Centre Programme: Improved delivery of existing and new services by the development of over 30 small modern health centres to date.  This programme is ongoing in addition to the major health centre programme.</P>
    <P>(12)  Family Planning: Further development of family planning services.</P>
    <P>A number of reviews are also under way or have been recently completed and are now being examined, which may result in the development of new services or the reorientation of existing services.</P>

      <P>Before the sos I quoted certain statistics from Northern Ireland which indicated very clearly that over the past several years there has been no dramatic increase in the number of divorce decrees being granted or in the number of applications for divorce. Apart from these statistics it is evident to people who know the community in the North that that society is not destabilised as a result of having a divorce law.  That community has many other problems but I do not believe anyone in this House <Col N="1219" /> would seek to identify the existence of a divorce law as a destabilising factor.  If people wish to find a community to compare with ours, in the context of what changes might be expected with the introduction of the divorce law, it would be fairer to look at a community closer to home, such as Northern Ireland, rather than quoting examples from the United States or Great Britain.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to appreciate fully the nuances of Fianna Fáil's position in regard to this Bill.  We understand that officially the party have no view, that they believe a referendum should be held but that they are not offering a view either for or against the proposals being promulgated by this measure.  However, Members are entitled to hold whatever view they wish and to campaign as they see fit.  Having listened very carefully to what Deputy Woods, the Fianna Fáil spokesman, said yesterday, and particularly to his expressions, for example, that if this legislation were passed it would become a constitutional Frankenstein that would lie low at first and subsequently stalk the land, he spoke about the creation of constitutional orphans and said the Government could be described as taking a sledgehammer to family life and other gems of emotional hyperbole, it struck me as extraordinary that Fianna Fáil decided, against the advice of Deputy Woods, not to have any view as a party. Either they have very little regard for the views of Deputy Woods &mdash; I will not comment on that &mdash; or they are playing some sort of game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every front bench Fianna Fáil spokesman, with one exception, has spoken against this measure and they have done it in a very subtle way.  What Deputy Woods did yesterday was, I thought, rather clever given the difficulty Fianna Fáil have in deciding which position to adopt in this debate.  At the end of his speech Deputy Woods summarised in nine points the difficulties he had with this measure.  Each one he disguised in a way which suggested that his problem was with the detail of this measure.  He said on the subject of divorce there were <Col N="1220" /> some people for it and others against it, but in reality almost all the nine points he mentioned against this measure were essentially arguments against divorce as such.  I cannot understand why he did not have the courage to come out and say he did not believe we should have a divorce law.  Deputy Flynn, who no doubt will be speaking shortly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In our party Deputy Cooney and Deputy Glenn have made their views know, and full credit to the people who are prepared to stand up and say they are against divorce, they are entitled to hold their views, but what I do not like, what I take exception to is the type of cod-acting we had yesterday from Deputy Woods who spoke about the pros and cons of divorce in this country and elsewhere, what some people think, what the Roman Catholic Church think, and what other churches think. Then he listed nine points which he purports are difficulties he has with the detail of the Government measure but which on analysis clearly show that this is an effort to have a go not just at the details of this measure but at divorce, but he lacks the courage to say so.  I put it to Deputy Woods as Fianna Fáil spokesman, to declare his position.  I know what his difficulty is.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods and Fianna Fáil are afraid to indicate to urban Ireland, particularly the densely populated urban areas like Dublin, that they are a party of the past in social terms, that they are a party of no change, that essentially they do not want to see change and that, apart from some flowery contributions we had from Fianna Fáil speakers who ended up discussing the Forum report, they do not believe in accommodating the different traditions in this country, that they do not believe in a <Col N="1221" /> true republic and they do not believe we should have anything in our Constitution except views that reflect the Fianna Fáil belief in things, and apparently the Roman Catholic Church's belief in things.</P>
      <P>It is even more interesting that not only Deputy Woods but none of the Fianna Fáil front bench has said he or she is in favour of divorce, but they are against this measure for one reason or another.  I will watch with care to see what develops. What is even more important is that Deputy Haughey, the Leader of the main Opposition Party, is out of the country while we are discussing a Bill to amend the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Before going into the detail of Fianna Fáil's nine points of objection to the measure, I will mention what Deputy Glenn and members of Fianna Fáil have referred to in this debate, that is, the importance of Article 41 of the Constitution and what it means. I do not wish to challenge in any way the sincerity of those who argue that it is important that we reflect in our Constitution that the family is a fundamental unit of society and that we want to keep it that way.  I agree entirely and I consider it proper, but we should not be carried away with the notion that Article 41 has done all that much for the family or, for that matter that Article 41, drafted and written as it was in 1937, reflects fairly the type of views people have about society today.  For example, two sections of Article 41 are far from representing what we believe our Constitution should say about the family.  Article 41.2.1º states:</P>
      <P>In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
      <P>Article 41.2.2º provides:</P>
      <P>The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
      <P>Those sections contain an implication that may well have found broad acceptance in Ireland in 1937, but today many people hold the view that they reflect, unfairly, the type of position we regard woman as having in our society today. Perhaps this Article could be amended in other ways to reflect more properly the type of society we want to have, and that we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing to be borne in mind is that Article 41 has not been all good.  It <Col N="1224" /> has been cited as the Article which has created a situation where several hundred legitimate but abandoned babies are not capable of being adopted.  Notwithstanding the fact that there was a demand, legitimate children abandoned by their parents, sometimes for years, are not capable of being adopted because of their legitimacy.  The reasoning behind that has been the belief that the courts would have to respond to Article 41 in some way, that by permitting the adoption of legitimate children, though they may be abandoned, the intention and purpose of Article 41 might be offended.  I do not believe it ever offended the intention of the Article.  I can see grounds for taking the view that the adoption of a legitimate child in those circumstances might have been challenged in the courts if one of the parents later sought to do so.</P>
    <P>However, I do not believe that Article 41 should be accepted as good enough.  I know the view about the interpretation of that Article may be changing in respect of the adoption of legitimate children, but it is sad that since 1937 legitimate children who were abandoned have not been capable of being adopted.  We should not be proud of that.  We should not rush around singing the praises of the Constitution's concern for and interest in the family in view of some of the consequences of that provision.</P>
    <P>I am not sure this House can hold its head high and express the view that family life is all we believe it to be in that we as a State and a community should be proud of what we have done when it comes to the family.  There have been a number of cases with which too many Members of this House have been all too familiar in recent years &mdash; for example, the Kerry babies case and the case of Ann Lovett from Granard &mdash; which did not reflect well on the attitudes that exist here to children either within or without the home.  It is highly questionable whether we should praise our society in view of some of the happenings in this State over the past couple of years. Maybe it is time we examined far more closely our bona fides in this regard.</P>
    <P>I move now to the detailed response <Col N="1225" /> by Deputy Woods here yesterday to the Government's measure.  I am asking Deputies to consider carefully whether all of these nine points can fairly be described as objections which could be limited or directed solely to the Government measure.  I suggest a great number of these points are arguments against divorce and some of them are arguments against annulment.  I believe that Deputy Woods was engaging in some sort of copout yesterday when he recited in his very long speech all these different points and expected people to believe him.  I want to say one thing that should be refuted. I do not know whether it has been refuted on this side yet.  Perhaps people did not notice it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods claimed early in his speech that this Government were concerned solely with this problem and had nothing else to think about.  That is absolute rubbish.  I was sorry to hear Deputy Woods so early in his speech engaging in that sort of play-acting.  Let me come to the detail.  In his conclusion he listed nine points.  The first was that a very low threshold was to be used to decide if a marriage was no longer viable, that the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; was so subjective and undefined that the courts would find it impossible to avoid a liberal and unrestricted basis for divorce.  Deputy Woods must know that what is contained in the Bill will go into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Government indicated that a description of irretrievable breakdown will be incorporated in legislation. Deputy Woods is also aware that irretrievable breakdown is being used because of the fact that the fault system &mdash; and that there is broad experience of this almost everywhere where there is a divorce jurisdiction &mdash; is not a procedure conducive to mediation or reconciliation. It is the Government's intention in the matter of divorce legislation that mediation and conciliation would play an important part.  If that is to happen it would be most imprudent of the Government to proceed on any other basis except that of irretrievable breakdown.</P>
    <P>I think it was also in relation to that, that Deputy Woods suggested that a <Col N="1226" /> court might decide a marriage had failed when a couple had their first row.  Perhaps he intended to be flippant and I will not take it any further.  I did not understand his reference to the fact that adultery, impotence or an inability to communicate successfully, were not grounds upon which a divorce should be granted. Maybe I misunderstood him, but I should like people to read the major part of his speech where he went into detail in this regard.  Certainly the last three grounds I mentioned are substantial and, if they persist in a marriage for five years, there is no doubt that the marriage has irretrievably broken down and is suitable to be considered for a divorce application.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods in his second point said that the use of the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; would permit unilateral divorce at the request of one party only and that a court would have no other option but to accept the view of one of the parties that the marriage had failed, regardless of the view of the other spouse.  Deputy Harney dealt with that question this morning and I find it hard to believe anybody would argue that where a couple are married and one of them decides, for any reason, that the marriage will not work and persists in that attitude for a period of five years, the marriage as a relationship existed after that period.  It defies commonsense and I am sorry Deputy Woods did not elaborate a little bit more because I do not understand what he meant.  It is an argument which one could apply to a divorce law even if it was a period of 20 years instead of five years, or it could be used in annulments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods' third point was that the Bill allows for divorce on demand once a couple have been married for five years.  It is astounding rubbish that the official spokesman for Fianna Fáil could say the Bill allows for divorce on demand when a couple have been married for five years.  I am not surprised Deputy Woods did not convince his party in this regard, if he actually believes that.  Perhaps Deputy Flynn would like to comment on this point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods' fourth point was that <Col N="1227" /> the Bill is particularly inadequate in providing financial support and security for a divorced spouse and the children of the first family.  He said the financial needs of the wife and children will be determined once and for all at the date of divorce and that the proposed constitutional provision will not allow these needs to be reviewed over the years should circumstances change.  That latter statement is untrue.  The Bill does not prohibit an arrangement being made in legislation whereby there could be a return to the courts afterwards to get an increase in maintenance or to change the circumstances in some way.  Even where a couple enter into a marriage separation agreement and decide there should be, say, a once off payment of anything from £10,000 to £50,000, or a payment of £50 per week to one of the spouses, this House has long recognised and written into legislation the right of either spouse to go into court and have that agreement between the parties altered.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill which would prevent that happening and I would be surprised if the legislation to be introduced by the Government when the amendment is accepted by the people did not include provision for such an agreement. Deputy Woods, in failing to elaborate, has not made the position clear but, in any event, his remarks are untrue. I should like to remind him that the very same point can be made in relation to a marriage which has been annulled.  In the earlier part of his speech, Deputy Woods seemed to be in favour of a new system of annulment but the point can be made just as strongly in regard to annulment. Essentially, he is saying that, once a couple are married, there should never be a change of any kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods' fifth point is that the measure gives no constitutional protection to a spouse who is considered not to be dependent on the partner seeking divorce.  That argument can also be made in the case of annulment because, if we brought State law in line with the Church law on this, the marriage would never have existed and, therefore, there would <Col N="1228" /> be no protection whatsoever.  I do not believe it is an argument and the courts have taken a sensible view of the question of dependency.  I know a couple living in my constituency who have broken up after being married for three years.  They are very young and will still be in their twenties in five years' time.  They do not have any children and are both working. In five years' time I am sure the courts would say to that couple that they are both working and there is no problem.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it might be advisable to write into legislation that, where a court so decides, they could review the question of dependency and there is nothing in this measure which would prevent that happening.  It can be considered at a later stage but it also applies to annulment and indeed to any form of divorce.  It should be noted in that regard in the United Kingdom, where obviously the Roman Catholic Church have an annulment system similar to that operating here, that they will not allow people to remarry if they have obtained an annulment in the Catholic Church without obtaining a civil divorce.  They do that for the sound reason of bringing order regarding property, succession rights and maintenance rights within the marriage because the Church have no function in ordering these arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods' sixth point was that the proposed amendment provides no protection for the assets or income of any spouse, for example, a shop or farm which may belong to the husband but which was built up over the years by the mutual efforts of both spouses.  I must challenge Deputy Woods as to his knowledge of the current state of law.  The Married Woman's Status Act, 1957, and case law since that Act have developed a very effective means whereby a couple, without getting divorced or separated, can divide the property between them. This Bill does not do anything to alter that.  It is preserved and recognised. There is nothing in the Bill which can change or affect it in any way.  It is recognised in our law but, even if it were not, it is an argument that arises against annulment or against any form of divorce.  It is <Col N="1229" /> an argument that can be made against any form of divorce one might design.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods said the succession or inheritance rights of a spouse and children of a first marriage are left unprotected and transferred to the second family. That is misleading.  It is proposed to write such a provision into the Constitution and to ensure that it is written into the ultimate legislation.  Yes, it is the case that there will be a division of the capital assets whether it be house property, farm, business or whatever at the time the divorce is applied for.  What does Deputy Woods want?  Does he want the rights of the first family postponed until the death of the person who is married the second time?  That does not make any sense.  It is an argument that one has to use, if one believes in the argument which I do not, against any form of divorce or annulment.</P>
    <P>If there is ever to be a break, whether by annulment or any form of divorce even a divorce system designed by Deputy Woods, that argument arises.  The only way to deal with it is to provide that, when the application for divorce is made, effect is given to the rights of the parties of the first marriage.  It may be that provision can be made for reconsidering their position in the future in the event that a change arises, but I challenge Deputy Woods to show where that measure does any harm to the argument he has made in regard to it.  The reality is that the court must be satisfied that adequate and proper provision is being made.  Deputy Woods' argument applies to any form of divorce and annulment and it cannot in any circumstances be used as an argument against the measure before us because it is not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods suggested that existing social welfare benefits, for example, widow's pensions, deserted wife's benefits and dental benefits, are transferred to the second wife and that the State would presumably assist the divorced wife and children on a means test social assistance basis.  In relation to a couple who do not have means and rely for an income on social welfare I suppose some arrangement like that will be made by the State <Col N="1230" /> and I do not see anything wrong with it.  It may be that Deputy Woods is not making a complaint there, but he describes it as an objection he has to this measure.  However, that arises even in regard to an annulment or any form of divorce.  Again, the essential point is that it is not an argument that can be properly made against the measure before us.</P>
    <P>The final point made by Deputy Woods was that the rights and protections enshrined in the Irish Constitution and designed to protect the family based on marriage would be transferred to the second marriage. He said the divorced spouse and children of the first marriage would become constitutional orphans.  That is a pleasant little piece of emotional hyperbole. Will he explain the position in regard to the child of a couple who get an annulment?  Will he call that child the issue of nothing which is the same as a constitutional orphan, if that is the type of language he wants to use?  The problem is the same; it is a human problem of enormous proportions.  It is a reality we have to deal with all the time here whether it is 20,000, 30,000, 50,000 or 70,000.  It does not matter what the children are called, although Deputy Woods saw fit to describe the children of broken homes as constitutional orphans.  That arises in an annulment or in any type of divorce system.  In my view the Deputy is being a little bit flippant at the expense of those who are involved in very difficult and tragic situations.  It is not an argument that can be made against the Bill as a measure in itself.</P>
    <P>Last night on television Deputy Woods managed not to say whether he was in favour of or against divorce.  He saw problems arising and had real difficulty with this measure.  I have just outlined his reasons.  I would prefer Deputy Flynn to be spokesman for Fianna Fáil on this issue because what we would hear from him would be straightforward, direct, logical and consistent.  At least one could argue fair with fair.  Deputy Woods' speech yesterday was insidious because it sought to mislead the Irish people at a critical time.  It was an extraordinary <Col N="1231" /> speech in many ways and when the pastoral letter of the Bishops is published &mdash; the contents of it were reported in yesterday's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; I shall look at it with great care and compare its words with those used by Deputy Woods. I went to some trouble to get a copy of Deputy Woods' script which contained details of that pastoral.  I suspect that many of the arguments used by Deputy Woods were arguments he did not fully understand.  He may not have been well briefed on his subject but I will wait and see what the position is in that regard.</P>
    <P>I urge Fianna Fáil to clarify their position, as a party, on this issue because it appears to me that they are playing both sides.  They are not willing to tell Irish urban society what the truth of their position is.  They lack that courage as a party. I accept that there are individuals in the party who are quite prepared to do it, but Fianna Fáil are lacking in leading opinion in other parts of the country and helping to generate and bring about change.  That is a great pity.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the position of the Roman Catholic Church on this matter.  Many people were critical of the Taoiseach when he said he would consult the Churches.  In my view he was absolutely correct and prudent to do that. I should like to make it clear that I believe utterly in the separation of Church and State but this is the one area we have dealt with in the Dáil where the interests of the Church and State overlap in the sense that the Roman Catholic Church actually subsume the marriage ceremony functions and conduct them on behalf of the State.  They have a clear definite interest in this area.  The Church have been operating a counselling service in marriage, at the commencement of marriage and where marriages run into difficulty, through CMAC.  Many of the people in my area who are involved in that work have impressed me with the dedication they put into it.  It is remarkable what has been achieved in the area. Unquestionably the guidance and counselling given to young people starting into marriage have been of great benefit and <Col N="1232" /> of enormous support and aid to people who got involved in marriage difficulties. The Church are deeply involved in this.</P>
    <P>Up to some years ago I had some difficulty with the question of divorce because I saw problems arising in the event of an amendment like this being passed, but I do not believe the problems that might arise are of the nature I believed them to be some years ago.  The way I have rationalised my position on this is that I regard divorce as a civil right.  It is not something anybody likes to see, but I regard people who find themselves in matrimonial breakdowns having a right to regularise their position.  Those people should have a right to remarry provided the obligations both parents have to their first family are properly looked after.  The Bill before us provides for that.  We must be one of the few countries where that is written into the constitution.  The State also has the right to impose restrictions to ensure that social order is maintained. It is a difficult balance to achieve but I believe we have found the balance.</P>
    <P>I read carefully the statements issued by the Hierarchy on this subject and I am trying to reconcile what I know to be the sincere interest and concern they have with what I see as a problem we face as legislators.  I have to approach this on the basis that I see this as a civil right.  It must be said that the fact that the Roman Catholic Church do not want the provision in the Constitution altered is unique amongst Churches.  All the other Churches take the view that it should be changed.  The Catholic Church believe that a divorce law would be a harbinger of fundamental change, that it would be offensive to our society and what we want.  The Church have an absolute right to say that if that is their view, but it must be pointed out that in that they are offering a view on social policy and on a social situation.  The Hierarchy do not have any expertise any more than any other group of concerned citizens have having looked at the subject.  Different views prevail on that point.</P>
    <P>Second, it is important to note that as far as I am aware &mdash; and I have made <Col N="1233" /> inquiries about this &mdash; legislation, legalising or not legalising divorce, is not a matter of doctrine in the Catholic Church at all.  I might describe it, with every respect, as more a matter of social policy in the Church rather than a matter of doctrine within the Church.  I have already cited the example of what happens in Great Britain when the Church annul a marriage, that a party will not be remarried within the Catholic Church without the applicant arranging his affairs by way of civil divorce, at least in the eyes of civil law.</P>
    <P>In the Bishops' pastoral letter, as reported in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times</i>, the essence of the case made was, and here I quote:</P>
    <P>Estimates suggest that there may be as many as eight million divorced Catholics in the United States the majority of them remarried outside the Church.  It is as though the legal availability of divorce builds up a social pressure which, for large numbers of people, becomes stronger than moral or religious resistance.</P>
    <P>I suppose that is a fair point and I cannot deny it.  But it is equally the case that there are millions of people in the United States, born Catholics, who no longer attend Mass.  It is equally the case that there are millions of Catholics around the world, particularly younger Catholics, who live with somebody, or have children by somebody.  They do not marry.  Of course, I am not suggesting that the Church would seek us to reflect in our laws a law that would ensure that people remained Catholics of good standing.  I know that is not their intention.  But it seems to me that there is a break in logic when it comes to this, that there is an element of special pleading involved.</P>
    <P>I was very struck by Dr. Cathal Daly's oral submission to the New Ireland Forum on 9 February 1984 when he described the difficulties the Church had with divorce.  In regard to religious and civil rights he said:</P>
    <P>It is not for us to formulate proposals for constitutional change or to draft <Col N="1234" /> blueprints for a future Ireland.  That is the business of legislators.  Because a new Ireland could take so many different forms we could scarcely be expected to say what our Christian position would be in reference to this or that specific problem in a united Ireland.  What we do here and now declare, and declare with emphasis, is that we would raise our voices to resist any constitutional proposals which might infringe or might imperil the civil and religious rights and liberties cherished by Northern Protestants.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong in saying this but it is my profound belief that Protestants &mdash; whether they live in England, Scotland, Wales or the North of Ireland &mdash; even though as is evident from the statistics I quoted earlier do not all want for themselves access to divorce, believe it is a religious or civil right they have.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we should enact this legislation simply because Northern Protestants might regard it as a civil right. The real question is whether we regard it as a civil right.  That is the nub of this issue.  I have given a lot of thought to that.  I have come to the view that if this House decides we are going to ask the Irish people to change the Constitution in this respect and allow divorce, then it means that the legislators believe it to be a civil right.  Frankly, I believe that, if the legislators believe this to be a civil right, the Roman Catholic Church, or any other church, should not and do not have the right to say it is otherwise.  They may have a sincerely held view but if the nub of the question is as I believe it to be &mdash; whether or not this is a civil right &mdash; then, if we pass this Bill, we declare this question to be a matter of civil right.  The Irish people will have to decide whether they want to adopt this proposal but we, as legislators, are taking the view that this is a civil right.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is that, whilst all of the polls indicate that most people in the country want to have a divorce law in a restricted form, there should not be any complacency about this matter at all.  I have already indicated <Col N="1235" /> Fianna Fáil's duplicity in their standing and expressed position on this.  I know Deputy Flynn will be playing an active part in the campaign, as will many other Members of the House.  I understand that the Catholic Church will be issuing one million leaflets, presumably containing the Bishops' pastoral letter.  I would hate to think anybody in this country might, some time in July, reflect on and regret the fact that they did not vote on the date of the referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be afforded an opportunity to place my personal views on the record in so far as this Bill is concerned and the introduction of divorce into this country is concerned.</P>
      <P>I have to admit that marriage and the family are under great pressure at present.  I see that pressure being brought about by the very difficult unemployment position, the level of poverty, the great hardship that renewed emigration is causing so many families.  These are only some of the things that create great pressure on family life.  I believe these pressures are having a negative effect on marriage. There is no doubt that it can be clearly shown that marital breakdown is increasing to some extent.  I also regard it as the duty of legislators, the Government of the day, to do everything possible to reduce those pressures and provide the remedies to reduce the tensions in society which generate those pressures on marriage and the family.  I see no evidence over the past few years under this Government of measures being taken to lessen those pressures in any way on the family and society generally.  In that respect the Government must stand indicted for their lack of interest in bringing to fruition any of the policy or legislative changes recommended in the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil position, contrary to what Deputy Molony might say, has been clearly stated in our statement of 25 April last.  In that statement we made it quite clear that we would consider carefully all aspects of the proposal, that we would <Col N="1236" /> consider the effects divorce would have on families and on the nature and quality of society.  That was a very reasonable thing for us to say.  We also accepted that there were different opinions held by different members of the party, sincerely held by very many and that, as a party, we would not therefore campaign politically in the referendum.  We said we hoped the debate would take place in a careful, considerate way, that it would not be along party political lines, rather that individual members of the party could, in any way they thought fit, contribute to or participate personally in the referendum campaign.  It is the understanding that many of us will do so.</P>
    <P>We have stated on more than one occasion &mdash; and it has not been altered by any speaker on this side of the House &mdash; that inevitably the matter will be decided by the people, that we accept that there are many with different views, that nobody is being brow-beaten into taking any particular stance.  That is another reason I have been afforded an opportunity to put my personal view on the record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We will all be like the B Specials in plain clothes, breaking up these superstitions but in their private capacities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed I presume my view is already on the record in the debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I am quite sure everybody quite clearly understands my personal position in the matter.  But it is just as well to avail of another opportunity to put it in precise terms on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need an informed debate &mdash; I agree with that.  We must avoid the acrimonious kind of build-up now evident in this debate.  I would have to say that acrimony has been started and generated by people on the other side of the House.  We would like to think the House would weigh up objectively and conscientiously the implications of bringing in divorce legislation. We draw a lot from the experience gained <Col N="1237" /> by other societies who introduced and use divorce in their jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Experience shows now, and the empirical experience is there, that marriage does change rapidly with the introduction of divorce legislation.  It does become a temporary contractual arrangement.  We must honestly admit that once the principle of divorce is conceded, no matter what limiting conditions are applied, the inevitability is that there will be greater liberalisation until a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; divorce system becomes standard practice.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair to condemn individuals, or Churches for that matter, for taking a determined stand in support of their point of view.  It would be unforgivable for the Catholic Church, as the custodian of the moral teaching of the majority of the electorate here, not to pursue their stated theological position that marriage validly contracted cannot be dissolved by human power.  That principle has guided Church thinking for centuries since the very start.  We have the word of the Church that they reject the concept of a confessional State.  Indeed, Bishop Cathal Daly referred to that in his forum contribution in February 1984, stating quite clearly that the Church do not see a Catholic State for a Catholic people.  In fact, he went so far as to say that the alliance of Church and State was harmful to the Church and harmful to the State.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, what the Church are doing is simply challenging the social expediency of introducing divorce and recognising re-marriage in society because they believe the institution of marriage and the family will be destabilised and undermined.  It is the right of the Church to point out the moral implications of the proposed legislation now being introduced into this House. Regrettably, I have to refer to one of the remarks made by Deputy Molony in regard to Article 41 of the Constitution that he is of the opinion that the vast majority of the people in this country do not now see any great relevance in that Article but I shall deal with that later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so; it is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1238" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution in Article 41 pledged itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded and to protect it against attack.  It also provides that no law shall be enacted providing for the granting of dissolution of marriage.  We all know that.  It is because of this commitment in the Constitution to protect marriage and the family that we should exclude divorce from Irish law.  It has been proved conclusively that divorce does not strengthen the demands of the Constitution but rather leads to the dilution of the stated aims and principles of Article 41.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, page 89, paragraph 7.8.30 where it was the opinion of every single member who served on that committee &mdash; and I was one of them &mdash; that the basic emphasis of Article 41 should not be altered in any way and that it should continue to place a duty on the State to protect the family and the institution of marriage, and to recognise the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society.  As far as I am concerned, divorce runs contrary to the agreed opinion of the unanimous wish of those members of that committee.</P>
      <P>I believe divorce based on failure as now proposed in the Bill will have a very serious impact on society.  It will have serious moral and social consequences.  It will change the character of society for the worse in this country.  It will introduce a radical change into society and change the complete legal understanding of marriage as we now see it.  It will weaken family structure here and will make the upbringing of children much more difficult. It will put them at risk in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Divorce transforms an irrevocable commitment for life into a temporary contractual arrangement, a terminable commitment revocable by either spouse at will at any time.  Divorce allows a spouse to obtain a divorce against the wishes of the other spouse.  It allows the spouse to obtain a divorce against the <Col N="1239" /> wishes of the children.  It lessens the right of the spouse to financial support.  It lessens the right of surviving spouses under the Succession Act of 1965.</P>
    <P>In many countries today divorced wives have restricted rights to succession. A judge may completely wipe out the succession rights when granting a divorce.  That does not apply here now, but it certainly is the case in other jurisdictions where divorce legislation operates. Divorce aggravates the situation to which it is proposed as a response.  The international evidence of the considerable hardship which follows divorce is also available to us, when spouses are divorced without their consent.  I do not believe divorce can be confined to limited circumstances of cases.  That has been proved conclusively.  It is impossible to achieve that aim and it has failed in every situation where it has been tried.  It cannot be done and will not be done in Ireland, either.</P>
    <P>These are some of the social issues which are often being ignored by many of those who would ask us to introduce divorce legislation.  There are questions to be addressed by the legislators here first and then these questions have to be understood and addressed by the electorate afterwards.  What is proposed is not a restrictive form of divorce legislation. Irretrievable breakdown and/or failure is the basis for the most advanced and unrestrictive form of divorce anywhere it exists in the world.  This is not the starting point for a moderate legal reform.  Failure is the end product of a long evolution in other jurisdictions.  In every country where introduced, legal restrictions on divorce proved themselves to be unworkable and they were progressively abandoned. One has only to look at the situation that exists since the introduction of divorce in other jurisdictions to have that point proved beyond yea or nay.</P>
    <P>Some reference was made to the fact that the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Haughey, was absent and, as Deputy Molony suggested, out of the country for strategic reasons.  I presume he takes that phrase from one of the daily <Col N="1240" /> newspapers today.  I have not been asked to defend the Leader of the party in what he is doing at this time, but I do know and can put on record that that is untrue. Deputy Haughey is abroad on business of a very important nature that had been agreed and arranged for at least six weeks before this debate was finalised by the Whips.  As he is most attentive at all times, and has been traditionally, to the business of this House, he certainly dearly wished to be here for the start of this debate, but it was not possible for a very good reason.  Agreements and arrangements had been made to meet many important personages in very high office in certain places in Europe.</P>
    <P>It was because of the mess generated by the Coalition Government in so far as the agricultural sector is concerned and other matters relating to the Common Agricultural Policy and other various matters as well that Deputy Haughey thought it mandatory on him to try to save the day for Irish agriculture and for others in difficulty at this time.  It is regrettable that people would try to read something into that while those arrangements of which we were very fully aware have been made for up to six weeks. Indeed, I am satisfied the Whips on the Government side were aware of that fact for some weeks in advance, also.  However, these things have a way of getting out and the wrong construction being put on them.</P>
    <P>I should also like to take the opportunity, now that it has come up, to refer to something concerning Deputy Haughey in the newspapers this morning in relation to a question of some kind of alliance which was reputed to exist between the Catholic Church and the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is a lie also.  I am probably the one person who can state that positively. Above anything else, if I have a particular view on this question I have to state I have never been contacted, spoken to, cajoled or in any way compromised by any member of the Hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, or of any other Church for that matter.  I do not know where people get the idea that there might be some grand alliance between <Col N="1241" /> what we do here and what the Catholic Church, in their right, are going to do in so far as this campaign is concerned.  I would like to put on the record that it is not true.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is that certain individuals are seeking confrontation in so far as they are trying to generate a political debate out of this Bill.  Perhaps they are trying to create a political fight which will involve Fianna Fáil in some way.  Our statement of 25 April stands and it is not going to be altered by anything which would appear in the media or anywhere else.  A balance has to be struck in so far as the reporting of this debate is concerned. Many questions have been raised, some have attempted answers, but it is mandatory on the media to report accurately what transpires here on both sides of this argument and to explain and inform the electorate so that they will have an opportunity of deciding in their own good time which way they want this country to go. These are the serious questions which have been raised and they demand a response.  I have the greatest faith that the media will take that on board.  The people will then decide and I have no doubt but that legislators will then act on their instructions.  I sincerely hope that the electorate will reject divorce when it eventually comes to them.</P>
    <P>The Christian ethic cannot lightly be set aside.  Those who would seek to cast it aside or to seek to convey that it has no influence on their thinking are, to my mind, less than honest.  Introducing divorce would give respectability to actions totally at variance with Christian ethics.  Those who facilitate actions that offend that ethic must share in the consequences for society afterwards.  One may try to persuade oneself and one's neighbours that he did not intend in his legislative action to contribute to hardship in family life or to the break-up of family life, but if that is the foreseeable consequence he is not entitled to plead ignorance or excuse himself from taking the right action.</P>
    <P>Divorce legislation may be a matter, as Deputy Molony suggested, of civil law <Col N="1242" /> rather than a matter of reality.  It, however, must be conceded that it also has inescapable moral implications for society.  We cannot legally enforce morality or impose virture by law, but certain laws can make virtue more difficult.  Consequently, law and morality are inter-linked. The law has an influence on the moral attitudes and behaviour of people. Law is regarded by society as what is socially and morally acceptable.  Many people regard what is permitted by law as also morally right.  Experience has shown that civil divorce does lead to the acceptance of divorce and remarriage as morally right and normal.  The availability of divorce leads to acceptability.  This is totally contrary to Article 41, which we are committed to support and protect.</P>
    <P>The first concern of legislators must be and should be the well-being and common good of society.  Surely, it must be universally agreed that the well-being of society is closely linked with the stability of family life.  Anything which would be perpetrated or done which would weaken that is contrary to the well-being or the general good of society.  I believe that divorce is such a thing and it would weaken and destabilise marriage and family life in this country.</P>
    <P>For a long time much reference has been made to the numbers involved in marital breakdown.  I spoke about this last December.  I was hoping that that was going to be the end of it and that people would not use statistics which have no foundation; but it seems that every second speaker who comes in still trots out the same old hackneyed figures without giving any statistical basis for them whatsoever.  One would have thought that they would have waited at least until the census returns were available before actually claiming any figure for marriage breakdown.  The labour force survey is the only repository of information in that regard which we have to rely on at this time.  Its figure is 21,000.  As I said before, it does not matter whether it is 21,000, 2,000 or just two, it is two too many.  The regrettable part is that the Divorce Action Group seek to suggest that all those people, <Col N="1243" /> whether the figure is 21,000 or 70,000, are seeking to remarry.  I do not accept that.  There are no accurate statistics in support of that claim.  All of the estimates which have been trotted out here are purely conjectural.  It is wrong to suggest that all or even most of those who are involved in broken marriages either desire divorce or approve of its introduction.</P>
    <P>Many deserted wives &mdash; I know some myself and I can state this positively &mdash; are determined to oppose divorce.  The statistics of broken marriages cannot be identified with the statistics of demand for divorce.  While people might think that I might not be always fully aware of difficulties which exist in so far as marriage breakdown is concerned, let met put it on the record that I meet in my constituency work, even in rural Ireland and in the west, many who have difficulties. But I would say that I have put it to every single person who has sought my advice or assistance with this difficulty over the past few months if in fact they were seeking divorce as a solution.  Out of the total I can honestly say that fewer than three suggested to me that divorce was the solution to their problem.  I also have to say that I am aware of some women whose husbands left them many years ago and who got divorces in other jurisdictions.  I took the opportunity also of asking them and, to my surprise, each one of those I asked &mdash; not many, I agree &mdash; stated that, even though their husbands had divorced them in other jurisdictions, they were not going to vote for divorce here.  Therefore, it is not true to say that all those who have marital difficulties and suffer marital breakdown are somehow expecting that this is the panacea for all the ills of their situations and will somehow relieve them of all their difficulties.  They do not.  I must say that quite a number of people will be surprised at the number and the types of people who will be voting against this legislation.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I will give a further instance from my personal experience which, I believe, speaks volumes on this matter. It happened quite recently in my office in <Col N="1244" /> Castlebar when a lady, who stated she was not a supporter of mine and who indicated that she would not be a supporter of mine in the future either, pointed out to me &mdash; and she came to see me specifically to say this and for no other purpose&mdash; that had divorce legislation been available in this country some 12 years ago when she got married both she and her husband would voluntarily have accepted it on more than one occasion in the first two years.  But 12 years later, with a happy family of two, she said how pleased and glad she was to report that she did not have to go that road and that it was not available to her.  That must speak volumes.  Why should I or anybody else bring about a situation which would cause that kind of failure in Irish society?</P>
    <P>Many people say this is a restrictive type of divorce.  I have stated that it is not.  It only takes a quick look at the jurisdiction across the water to understand how non-restrictive it is.  Since divorce was introduced in Great Britain in 1857, it has become progressively easier to achieve until they can now get it on demand.  In 1857 under the Matrimonial Causes Act it was introduced so that it could be made cheaper for individuals. In 1923 adultery by the wife was added as one of the causes.  In 1937 desertion, cruelty and insanity were added.  In 1949 it was divorce for all.  In 1969 the cause of irretrievable breakdown was added.  In 1973 it was no-fault divorce and in 1984 it was possible to get a divorce after one year.  Can anybody say that was not a progression from difficult divorce to a free and easy divorce?  We are taking on board the end of that evolution.</P>
    <P>I was determined, when speaking on this debate, to express myself as best I could on all sides of the debate.  Divorce for a very few could be a solution to cater for their personal problems.  Why should I pressurise others to cater for the difficulties of the few when the stable relationships of maybe up to 600,000 families could be put at risk?  It is compassion for the hard cases which leads many people to feel that divorce in some limited way is the solution.  What I believe is needed <Col N="1245" /> is more support for marriage and the family, and not less.  I would like to have seen a planned response to the factors which cause marriages to fail.  No Government, Minister or anybody sponsoring divorce can say we have not had it clearly spelled out what those causes are.</P>
    <P>We spent a long time in the Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown dealing with that issue, but nothing has taken place since.  It was the dear wish of all those who served on that committee, from both sides of the argument, that immediate action would be taken to try to create the legal framework to tackle the causes of marriage breakdown.  It is now expected that we will introduce divorce and that in some way other things might follow.  That has not been the tradition here.  I am not just sceptical about it.  I am downright sure that, if divorce was introduced here, then that would be the end of all the pious hopes which have been expressed by others here in supporting legislation.  Divorce accelerates the trends towards marriage breakdown that are already discernible in society.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at some of the remarks made by Deputy Harney this morning.  I heard her speak on many occasions on this matter during meetings of the committee and outside.  She makes her point of view in a stong unambiguous way.  I was a little taken aback today by some of her remarks.  I do not accept that politicians or political parties are trying to frighten or terrorise the women of this country.  Personally I do not think the females of this country are that easily terrorised.  To suggest that we are trying to terrorise them by trying to hype this up and to convince them that they would be much worse off if divorce was introduced is not true.  It is true to say that their positions will be much worse should it come about.  To suggest that people here are trying to create some kind of mass hysteria is taking language a bit too far.</P>

      <P>She suggested that women are being cast aside as machines or chattels by men.  I do not understand that kind of emotive language in so far as this debate is concerned.  It is not true and it cannot be substantiated.  It should not be stated in the House if it cannot be supported.  What a sad attitude she has towards the relationships that exist between men and women.  What a sad reflection it is on how she feels about family life in this country.  She compounds it by saying it did not matter what the views of the other partner were, if one partner wanted divorce then that was that.  That can only imply one thing, that the Deputy is not really concerned about the feelings of one side in a relationship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy Molony.  I intend to come back to other remarks made by Deputy Harney because they are critical of what is happening in the political system in so far as this debate and, indeed, other debates are concerned.  I wish to refer to the contribution made by the Minister, <Col N="1247" /> Deputy Dukes, yesterday when he introduced the Bill.  Just as Deputy Molony felt that a case was being made in a certain way by Deputy Woods, Deputy Dukes, as spokesman and Minister for Justice, was making the case in so far as the Government position was concerned. His speech was another example of the pious hopes associated with the introduction of divorce legislation in every country where it was introduced.  The Minister for Justice made a very poor defence of the Government's decision.  In many respects some of the things he said were misleading.  Having listened carefully to him, I found it was impossible to find a valid argument in his contribution.  I have picked certain passages in his speech for mention.</P>
      <P>On the first page he referred to the Report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown and he said that the majority of the committee felt that a referendum should be held.  I would point out to him that that is not what a majority of the committee decided.  We were all agreed that a referendum should be held, but many of the members who agreed pointed out that they wanted it written specifically into the report, at page 88, that the committee felt it important that it be stated clearly they did not necessarily imply support for divorce legislation.  The clear inference from the Minister's speech is that the majority of that committee were in favour of divorce legislation and that they were seeking a vote of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on this issue.  That is not so.</P>
      <P>The Minister apparently deliberately refrained from referring to the fact that a majority of the committee were against the introduction of divorce legislation.  I should know, because I was involved in the taking of the vote.  Therefore, the Minister referred to the report selectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how many TDs will support the introduction of divorce legislation. We must remember that this is not a &ldquo;hands up&rdquo; type of thing like a certain Senator on the committee attempted the first day we met two and a half years ago when she thought the <Col N="1248" /> proper way was to call &ldquo;All those in favour put up your right hands and vote&rdquo;. Senator Robinson got her answer from me then, and it was proved later that the majority were against the introduction of divorce.  I would go so far as to say that the majority of TDs would be against divorce legislation.  Those elected to this House were elected as the leaders of their communities to represent the attitudes of the people who sent them here, and if the majority of the people are against the introduction of divorce that must stand for something.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister for Justice did not give a balanced view.  In his speech he referred to opinion polls which, he said, had established a certain trend in the recent past.  If the Minister puts so much faith in opinion polls and if he has such regard for them why is he still here as Minister for Justice considering that all the opinion polls are telling him is that he has not the authority to be here and that Fine Gael are at their lowest level since the foundation of the party?</P>
    <P>We have had opinion polls on poverty, on unemployment and emigration, and if the Minister is so taken by these polls and finds it necessary to respond to them I suggest that he should think again and not resort to such a weak argument in support of a point of view.  He knows full well that the majority of the opinion polls were quite clear, that the people do not want a free for all no-fault divorce system.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said it will now be a matter for the people to decide, not the Government.  However, he or the Government are not leaving it to the people.  If they were, why are they sending in speaker after speaker to try to promote a certain point of view?  Why are the Government leading a campaign and appointing directors of election, including senior Government Ministers, if they are leaving it to the people?  Of course, they are trying to tell the people what to do.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil want the Irish people to be given an opportunity to decide the matter without being talked into anything. One particular party said they were <Col N="1249" /> totally against divorce legislation but they have now decided they are not.</P>

      <P>That is a gem.  We are getting double standards from this newest fledgling party.  Let us consider what else the Minister for Justice said.  He said the details of the Bill would be found in &ldquo;the accompanying document&rdquo;.  It is grossly unfair to use that document, which has no standing or point in law.  As far as I am concerned that is &ldquo;other business&rdquo;. That document was brought in by the Minister to try to mesmerise the uninformed. It implies that the Government will act in a restrictive way as far as certain things are concerned.  The Government will not have that choice because the people will decide, and even if they decide to allow the Government to introduce divorce legislation the courts can do what they like once the Constitution has been changed.  They will have power to act.  It will not be a matter for the Government to have to live up to their proposals as outlined in the accompanying document. It is not fair to use the document to try to convince certain elements of the electorate that this will be a very restrictive type of divorce if the referendum is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he is against the position that states that legislation defines all marriage as dissoluble.  He must consider us puerile if he thinks we will believe that.  If divorce is introduced every child <Col N="1250" /> will know that henceforth there will be no such thing as an indissoluble marriage. The Minister also talks about &ldquo;when a marriage ceases to be the source of happiness&rdquo;. I have to tell the Minister that has nothing to do with it.  A happy marriage can be dismantled at will for any or a whole range of reasons.  All of us want to see happy marriages but to suggest that a happy marriage could not be dissolved for a particular reason is not true. Divorce could be applied to a happy marriage and this has happened worldwide. Divorces have been obtained, even in happy marriages, for purposes of property, money or other arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The kind of loose talk in the accompanying document and in the Government's statement does not hold water.  In the course of his speech the Minister uttered several asides and perhaps they had more substance than what was contained in the script.  I cannot give his exact words but the essence of them was that no fundamental change would be made unless the people voted for change in another referendum.  That is not true.  I suggest that if the referendum is passed anything would be possible by a majority Dáil vote, having regard to the flexibility in the wording now proposed in the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the Government were fully committed to the protection of marriage but I challenge him on that.  The Government cannot be fully committed to it if they are seeking to introduce divorce, resulting in the dissolution or dismantling of existing legal marriage contracts.  He also said they would try to commit themselves to the protection of marriage in so far as that was realistically possible.  I do not believe the Minister, the Government or anyone here is entitled to that latitude if they support the existing Constitution.  It is obvious from <Col N="1251" /> some of the remarks made here today, from Deputy Molony in particular, from the remarks of the Minister for Justice last night and remarks in the past six months by the Taoiseach, that elements of the Government do not support the basics and fundamentals of our Constitution. That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Government's proposals are simply recognition of the fact that many marriages fail.  I accept that marriages have failed but I do not regard this legislation as a simple recognition of that.  I regard it as a much more fundamental change.  As far as the Minister is concerned, the only answer he sees for people who have difficulties in their marriages is divorce.  That is in direct conflict with the considered opinion of the vast majority of the members who sat on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I accept that there are people who have difficulties in their marriages but the Minister and his Government could have done more for them if they had introduced legislation as, collectively and unanimously, we asked them to do so many years ago.  It was grossly unfair for anyone to come here yesterday and say that this proposal to have divorce was an adequate solution to the difficulties encountered by so many unfortunate people.  It does not matter to me whether the number of people concerned is 21,000, 70,000 or even 22: as far as I am concerned it is 22 too many.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in the Government's considered view the balance of the social good lies in the introduction of divorce in limited circumstances.  I say to him he is wrong on both counts.  The balance of social good will not be enhanced by introducing divorce.  I do not believe what he is asking us to support is in any way regarded as limited.  That is the considered opinion of all those constitutional lawyers and others who have considered the wording and no doubt between now and referendum day many of those experts will voice their opinions.</P>
    <P>The Minister said to ensure that the proposals would not be in conflict with <Col N="1252" /> the provisions of the Constitution guaranteeing the protection of the family, they introduced the positive wording.  There is a clear implication there that the Government are seeking to undermine the guarantee that divorce must be seen as diametrically opposed to the main thrust of Article 41.1.1º and 2º.  How anyone can suggest that introducing divorce here will not in some way infringe on the thrust of that Article is beyond comprehension.  I have to say that during the 18 months they sat every member of the committee recognised that divorce would be in conflict with elements of that Article.  That was agreed even by those who were most vocal in support of introducing divorce.  Now the Minister seems to imply there is some way we can guarantee the protection of the family and marriage while, at the same time, giving wholehearted support to the introduction of divorce here.  That is not possible and the Minister had no right to say it.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to some pains to explain that as far as he was concerned divorce would only be available in restricted circumstances.  I put it to the Minister that he cannot guarantee that section of the legislation in advance of remarriage. Then the guarantee could be withdrawn, altered or, as is the case in the US and UK, terminated after a short period if the Legislature decided.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a short one.  The first three elements in Part II are totally non-restrictive. The question of a marriage failing has yet to be defined by anyone, constitutional lawyer or politician.  As regards the marriage having failed for a period of at least five years, there is no statement as to whether it is at the beginning or the end of the five years.  As regards no reasonable possibility for reconciliation between the parties in the marriage, one of the spouses could say at any time that no reconciliation was possible.  A statement of intent is all that is necessary there.  The provision that any other condition prescribed by law has been complied with is very vague.  The Government are saying that perhaps they may do something and any statement of intent is purely that.  I have heard of many Government <Col N="1253" /> intentions over the past few years on a wide range of subjects.  Many of them were never brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>As regards the maintenance of a dependent spouse, that can only arise after a divorce has been granted.  One cannot guarantee that section in advance of remarriage.  At that time it will be too late to do anything about it.  In a word, the legislation is flawed.  I do not like what it intends to do, but it is flawed anyway.  The document is so full of holes that it is a poor defence on behalf of the Government to support their introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that divorce legislation would be child centred.  What an abuse of the English language and the established thinking as far as divorce is concerned.  Divorce is individual centred and in no country is it granted in the interest of children.  I challenge anyone to deny that.  Yet the Minister, in an aside in his speech, had the audacity to say their divorce legislation would be different and would be child centred.  In other words, children first and everything else afterwards. That is not the case and cannot be so.</P>
    <P>In another aside the Minister said he did not regard the introduction of divorce as a threat to his marriage but he felt it was necessary to provide the means for a solution for those who had broken marriages. I do not like that superman complex approach.  Others have difficulty in their marriages and to discard them by saying: &ldquo;I am all right and everyone else can look after themselves&rdquo; is not very compassionate.  I do not feel like that.  I see people who have difficulties in their marriages and I should like to be part of a Legislature that would help them out.  I would gladly give my support to measures that could and should have been introduced over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that if the measures I suggested earlier, which were spoken about so eloquently and reported so widely had been taken on board and introduced here they would not just have had my support but that of every holder of a seat in this House.  What a wonderful thing it would have been in the eyes of <Col N="1254" /> our people and our neighbours if they saw that Dáil Éireann was prepared to take on board what was required to deal with individuals who had difficulties and allocate money to provide the necessary services to bring about a reduction in marital breakdown.  Regrettably that has not been done.  Hopefully when the referendum is lost the Minister will get around to doing something about the things he refers to as Government intentions.  I await his response to that.</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown is a tragedy for all the people concerned.  It is a social problem for the members of the disrupted families and society in general.  I recognise that.  As a result of divorce children are denied an opportunity to be reared in a proper family environment.  The children of divorced parents suffer psychological damage and have greater difficulty in establishing proper family relationships in later life.  That has been proved in studies undertaken worldwide but not in Ireland.  The one study I wanted the committee to undertake was in relation to establishing in a statistical way the incidence of marital breakdown but it was not agreed to by the committee. We did not have the few pounds available or the time necessary to complete such a study, but 18 months later we are talking about introducing divorce irrespective of the cost.  One would have thought that as a prerequisite to the introduction of this legislation some Minister would have made an unambiguous statement detailing the statistics.</P>
    <P>I understand that divorce means a legal dissolution of a valid marriage and a legal entitlement to remarry.  Countries with divorce generally limited the grounds for divorce to cases of serious matrimonial misconduct such as cruelty or adultery.  In practice, couples can quite easily obtain a divorce by mutual consent.  They conspire together and invent grounds for divorce. That would be the case here.  It is accepted that divorce granted on a limited fault based grounds simply cannot be controlled.  It has not been controlled in any other jurisdiction.  Are we so different that we will do what has proved impossible elsewhere?  The evidence is <Col N="1255" /> there.  Some Irish advocates of divorce suggest that a limited system is possible. That was the stamping ground for the Divorce Action Group and others who supported that point of view over the past year or two.</P>
    <P>Those who are advocating that type of limited divorce have not studied the question and the empirical evidence available in support of the alternative view.  They are just trying to deceive the public in the hope that they will mesmerise them and get the extra couple of percentage votes to put it over the hill.  I do not believe it is going to be that close in the final analysis.  I believe that when all the arguments are set down in a clear, balanced and responsible way the vast majority of people will not see divorce as a solution to marital breakdown.  That is what it is being promoted as.  It is not, and should not be promoted as such.</P>
    <P>Internationally, following the failure of fault-based divorce, the trend has always ended up in a no-fault divorce situation based on irretrievable breakdown.  Now, I understand the word to be introduced is &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  Advocates of this type of divorce argue that it no more than faces reality.  People have said that, if a marriage is dead, what harm is it to give a death certificate or divorce decree.  In fact, divorce based on irretrievable breakdown, or on failure of marriage, fundamentally transforms marriage, and that is every marriage.  That is where the difficulty is, and I wish people would admit that.  Divorce means that marriage is no longer a commitment for life.  It cannot be a commitment for life once divorce is introduced, and that must fundamentally alter the whole concept of the family and marriage as we now understand it.  That lifelong open commitment to marriage without divorce is replaced by a contract revocable at will by either party, and that is not denied by the Divorce Action Group or anybody in this House who supports the introduction of divorce.</P>
    <P>But I wish it was reported clearly in the media that that is exactly the position. Divorce means that partners cannot <Col N="1256" /> make long term plans or take long term risks on the basis of a short term revocable contract.  One of the penalties of the short term contract into which marriage has been changed by divorce is that marriage must be and is inevitably considerably weakened in providing the type of environment so vitally necessary for the children of a marriage to be brought up. As far as I am concerned &mdash; and nobody has proved to me otherwise &mdash; divorce undermines the financial support of spouses and children.  The international experience is there.  It shows that in the kind of no-fault system of divorce being suggested here this philosophy of short term rather than long term commitment has resulted in reduced maintenance for women and children.  In the English courts, when divorced women seek an increase in the amount of maintenance to take account of the reduced value of money over the years, they often get quite a big shock.  In December, when I was making this point, quoting statistics and reading from some of the files of court cases in this regard, Deputy Monica Barnes was in the Chamber and I saw her disagreeing with me by a shake of the head.  But I have yet to hear her make the argument in support of the alternative view.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barnes might wish to challenge the report of the English Law Commission in 1980, which states:</P>
      <P>It seems that in practice, even in times of high inflation, an application for variation is more likely to result in a decrease rather than an increase in the amount ordered to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to detain the House by going into the great detail of the evidence that I put to this House last December in this part of the argument.  As yet, nobody has confronted that argument; and, if they do, they are going to have to state the source of their reply so that I can check it out.  The question of maintenance for spouses and children has been a great bone of contention and has led to <Col N="1257" /> reduced standards of living for women who have had recourse to the courts for help.  Recent changes in English law have made the position of divorced wives even more precarious.  Let me refer to something I said about that time when I quoted from documents I had about maintenance for wives.  I said that in England legislation was enacted in the recent past which incurred the outrage of practically every women's group in the country when it was being enacted.  That was clearly reported in the document <i>Indissolubility and the Clear Break</i> by Symes.  I quote footnote 10, 1985:</P>
    <P>The practical effects of the legislation obviously have yet to be analysed. The legislation gives the court power to dismiss without his or (almost always) her consent a spouse's application for periodical payments of maintenance after divorce, and to order that no further application for these payments may be made.  In making an order for periodical payments or a lump sum in favour of a spouse, the Act requires the court, for the first time, to consider the appropriateness of exercising its powers so that &ldquo;the financial obligations of each party to the other will be terminated as soon after the grant of the decree as the court considers just and reasonable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, it limits the financial support to a specific period beyond which no support entitlement can be claimed.  The 1984 Act also removes the inheritance provisions in the Family and Dependants Act of 1975.  Therefore, the court, when granting a decree for divorce, nullity or separation, can remove the entitlement of a spouse to apply for reasonable financial support out of a decreased spouse's estates even when the spouse thus barred does not consent to being so disentitled. In simple terms, for the first time a divorced spouse may at the time of the divorce be barred from his or her statutory rights of inheritance under section 2 of the 1975 British Act.  I do not know whether people are taking any notice of the legislation that has been introduced in this way in the United Kingdom over the <Col N="1258" /> years.  However, as far as I am concerned, it has been noticed by me since coming here that, irrespective of what we were discussing in this House, eventually and inevitably, in due course, we slavishly followed what was introduced in the Commons.  If that is the case, there is no doubt in my mind that if divorce is once legislated for here there will be a demand from the pressure groups to have embodied in the legislation here some of the type of legislation that is now being practised in the English situation.</P>
    <P>Internationally, divorce has resulted in increased financial hardship for women; and that has been the case not just in the UK but in other jurisdictions as well. There is a very interesting item in the <i>Family Law Quarterly</i> which is well worth putting on the record.  I quote from volume 17, page 106:</P>
    <P>The findings are unpleasant, revealing that decisions about property and support often preserve extensive financial security and freedom for former husbands while relegating children and former wives to futures at or below the proverty line.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see a situation like this in Ireland in five, ten or 15 years' time.</P>
    <P>Mothers with young children in the United States have been severely damaged by divorce and women particularly have been disadvantaged by divorce.  The women who have been particularly disadvantaged &mdash; and I said it here in December &mdash; were older women who had devoted themselves to a life in the home rather than in outside employment. According to the <i>Journal of Family Laws:</i>&ldquo;Divorce is an economic disaster for most women and children&rdquo;.  These are not my words; they are the words of people who carried out studies in countries where there has been divorce legislation for many years.  I would hate to think that in a future Dáil Official Report we will read similar words following the introduction of divorce and after a few years experience.</P>

      <P>These developments are not the results of the misapplication of the procedures in divorce but of their true application.  Divorce says that marriage is not for life.  If marriage no longer involves a commitment for life, short term and reduced financial support make sense.  In support of that statement let me repeat something I said in December.  I would like to put it on the record since it did not get a lot of attention at that time, but perhaps now is the important time.  The real reason for the decline in financial support for divorced wives and children has much more to do with the nature and purpose of divorce itself.  Divorce is designed to enable people to remarry. That is what distinguishes divorce from legal separation.  Where marriage involves a commitment by both spouses to each other for life, it is reasonable and proper that this commitment should extend to financial support in sickness and in health for the duration of their joint life.</P>

      <P>Where, as a result of divorce, marriage no longer requires a commitment for life but instead merely requires a commitment to continue for as long as either spouse wishes, then the lifelong commitment to support comes to be seen as a millstone frustrating the chances of a successful second or subsequent marriage. In other words, the second marriage must be allowed to thrive, even if this must necessarily lead to the restriction of the entitlement of the first wife to support.  The values of modern divorce laws were spelled out with refreshing frankness during group discussions at the International Conference on Matrimonial and Child Support organised by the Alberta Institute of Law Research and Reform in May 1981.  They said:</P>
      <P>If we believe that divorce ends a marriage (as opposed to parenthood) and leaves one free for another marriage, it is difficult to argue that the ex-partners needs should come first.  Thus, if only on the pragmatic grounds of giving the second marriage some chance of succeeding, and because divorced people who remarried would naturally put their new partnership first, many argued that the second family must take precedence.  It is, incidentally, easier for an ex-partner to free himself economically and emotionally for a new partnership if, in strictly financial terms, his obligations to his ex-partner are clear and limited in time.  This would be so if he has to support his ex-wife only through a transitionary period.</P>

    <P>That is the kind of thinking that is being expounded, promoted and promulgated at all international conferences dealing with this question.  I suggest that kind of thinking, while it is not referred to now &mdash; in fact, the opposite is suggested as the Government's intention &mdash; must inevitably come to be seen and to be expected <Col N="1261" /> as the inevitable downstream of divorce legislation if introduced here.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, divorce would weaken the legal protection of women in relation to the family home. At present the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, protects wives against vindictive spouses selling the house over their heads.  When she contributed to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, Deputy Harney was very eloquent on this point and I support her. However, the Family Home Protection Act has been operated with a certain amount of compassion and sensitivity by Irish judges, not all the time, but by and large, and international experience shows that divorce undermines the rights protected by that Act.</P>
    <P>In countries with divorce, divorced wives generally have no unfettered right to occupy the family home.  Frequently they have to depend on discretionary permission from the court to stay in the house for a limited period.  The reason for the weakening of their position is not hard to find.  If a marriage does not involve a commitment for life, it would be inappropriate for the law to require a divorced husband to protect his divorced wife's occupation of the home.  The man may wish to live there with his second wife.  His first wife may restrict his opportunity to live with the degree of comfort he would wish for his second marriage and, as a consequence, the first wife would invariably be ordered to leave the house.  I do not believe we would like to see a situation like that brought into play in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am referring to the succession entitlements which I believe will be damaged by the introduction of divorce.  Under existing law when a spouse dies the other spouse has just succession rights in relation to the deceased spouse's estate.  The Succession Act, 1965, gives effective protection to wives <Col N="1262" /> against being disinherited by their husbands. International experience shows that with divorce these succession rights are invariably weakened, although not always destroyed.  Under legislation enacted in England in 1984 &mdash; and a lot of the legislation to which I have referred deals with the English position because they have had divorce for a long time and have a great deal of legislation backing it up &mdash; the court may make an order barring a divorced wife from applying for financial provision out of the deceased former husband's estate.  This is consistent with the philosophy of divorce.  If marriage is not a commitment for life, there is no point in attaching legal rights which will last until the death of either spouse.</P>
      <P>There is a growing volume of evidence that divorce causes many children significant psychological damage and many studies have been carried out on this.  The desire of children for their parents to become reconciled has always been there.  They do not like, wish or want to see their parents divorced or separated, yet for the parents to divorce is to destroy the possibility of reconciliation.  Divorce is concerned with the legal entitlement to remarry and the reason for divorce is generally to take up another relationship, and it is not for the Minister, Deputy Dukes, to say that divorce will be child centred.  It has never been so and it will not be that way here if and when it is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The marriage breakdown committee dealt at length with the question of children and everybody expressed great concern that children must be in some way specially catered for and protected. However, when adults are considering divorce I am afraid they consider first their personal situation and the children invariably come into second place.  Children are the chief casualties and victims of divorce and there is strong evidence from the US and other countries that children of divorced parents are prey to a whole cluster of psychological and emotional problems and personality disorders.  That <Col N="1263" /> can be substantiated by recourse to evidence available from authorities in all of those countries.</P>
    <P>Divorce is markedly spouse centred and is not a child centred development. Children are sacrificed to the interests of their parents.  Children experience divorce as a rejection of them by their parents.  No divorce system anywhere in the world has ever succeeded in satisfactorily assuring the welfare and happiness of the children.  Indeed, the no fault, failed situation idea of divorce, if accepted, will mean that less and less attention will be paid to the rights of children.  This is regrettable and it must be clearly stated so that the people who are to get the opportunity to decide on this matter will understand that the clear experience and evidence internationally, the empirical evidence, is that less and less interest is applied to the plight of the children once divorce legislation gets a grip.</P>
    <P>It has often been said and was said here recently that children suffer more from an unhappy home than from divorce. Certainly children suffer in unhappy marriages or from potential separation without divorce.  Nevertheless, divorce adds a dimension of damage to children over and above home tension or even parental separation.  Studies available suggest that children prefer even an unhappy marriage relationship between their parents to the divorce and remarriages of their parents.  Many children have been spoken to about this matter and the opinion of the vast majority is that they do not wish to see their parents divorced or to see difficulties in the home. They all stated that, whatever the difficulties, the chance of reconciliation and improvement is always there, but once the divorce becomes absolute they are taken hither and thither, to-ing and froing between fathers and mothers, stepfathers and stepmothers, and this has led to the most appalling problems for families and individuals in every jurisdiction where divorce legislation has been introduced. I am not saying there are not difficulties for children in this country <Col N="1264" /> now.  I am fully aware that there are, but we will add further to them if we introduce divorce at this time.</P>
    <P>Divorce upsets and disturbs all children involved in the short term and it affects them in the long term too, probably to a greater extent than is often commonly understood or realised.  The degree of distress caused to a child arising from conflicting loyalties may lead to a severe loss of integrity, self-esteem and capacity for responsible judgment which can affect his or her spiritual, mental, physical, moral and emotional development. Divorce involves spiritual dilemmas for children as well as for adults.</P>
    <P>It has not been agreed here, but it is well to put on the record that the experience regarding children produces a very sad statistic indeed in the UK.  About one million children in Britain at present have divorced parents and it is estimated that about 1.6 million children will have divorced parents by the end of this century. Whatever the cost involved in that for the economy of the country, there is no doubt in anybody's mind or in any of the studies undertaken that the divorce situation that exists in Great Britain today has contributed substantially to that one million children living in conditions which have brought in their trail very great hardship for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I refer as an aside to a study carried out in this country by a social anthropologist from Cambridge about 15 months ago who was studying Irish marriages.  He found that the non-availability of divorce helped to stabilise marriage and encouraged couples to work harder at marriage. He found also that marriage is still seen as a powerful symbol and something to be valued in Ireland, and that in Ireland children were not used as emotional pawns in family arguments and brief separations.  He found very much in favour of the situation that exists here. Whatever about the incidence of marital breakdown in this country, it must be stated clearly that the introduction of divorce would in no way be a solution to it and would in no way lessen the difficulties suffered by wives and children at this time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> I will finish by saying I hope the electorate will not pass this amendment when it is put to them.  That is my personal hope.  It is not the dictated view of the party, and I am pleased that the Fianna Fáil Party of which I am a member gave me the opportunity to state my personal view in this way.  It shows the mature and responsible attitude of the party that they allow all expressions to be voiced here by those who see divorce as a solution and those opposed to it.  I believe that if the balanced view being put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party in a responsible way is allowed to get over to the general public and if they are given clear understanding of the issues involved, in their own good time they will see that the introduction of divorce legislation and making marriage a temporary contractual arrangement as against a lifelong commitment will be defeated by the electorate in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious that very many Members of this House want to contribute to this major debate and on that account I intend to be brief.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Flynn at the beginning of his contribution deprecating any degree of aggression or accompanying high temperatures which might have entered the debate in this House or elsewhere. We have had for the most part a fairly reasonable debate so far inside and outside this House and I am under no illusion about the self control required on the part of all of us in the coming months not to react to certain phrases or accusations that may be thrown about.  Some of these are, quite naturally, seized upon by the media, highlighted in people's minds and are inclined to provoke equally violent reactions.  I believe &mdash; a view which I am sure is shared by many others &mdash; in the absolute sincerity of the views held by those on both sides of this argument and it would be enormously helpful if the position of mutual respect governed the temperature and the nature of the debate.  I very much hope we will be able to proceed along those lines and I <Col N="1266" /> welcome Deputy Flynn's remarks at the beginning of his speech to that effect.</P>
      <P>There seemed to be a certain understanding promulgated by Deputy Flynn which perhaps he did not intend which seemed to imply that the amendment is introducing divorce.  However, divorce can only be introduced by law as stated in the amendment: &ldquo;Where, and only where such court established under this Constitution as may be prescribed by law is satisfied that...&rdquo;.  At the end of the amendment it says that &ldquo;the court may, in accordance with law grant a dissolution of the marriage...&rdquo;.  The Government, therefore, very clearly set out the legal framework and the accompanying supports for marriage and reconciliation which would have to be in place before that law was enacted.  It is a very broad and carefully thought out scenario &mdash; and there have been many calls for this &mdash; which will support and help people in marital difficulties.  Because the amendment does not introduce divorce it was right for the Government to show our intentions in this respect.</P>
      <P>The fears which Deputy Flynn expressed so eloquently for children as a result of divorce are also valid and apply equally to children in the present situation of marriage breakdown.  That is a well researched and documented fact, and we are all agreed that the position regarding marriage breakdown and its effects on women, children and families generally needs to be improved.  It is the considered opinion of the Government that part of that improvement involves the provision for divorce and we have clearly explained the safeguards and procedures which we clarified in the declaration of intention. Those safeguards and procedures are intended to improve the present situation which everybody agrees is unsatisfactory. Part of that improvement is the introduction of a provision for divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the background of the general approach by Fianna Fáil to this question and the content of the views expressed by Deputy Woods and Deputy Flynn, I should like to address a direct question to the Fianna Fáil Party and I should be very interested in their answer.  If the <Col N="1267" /> people vote yes in the referendum and if Fianna Fáil come into Government, will they comply with the wishes of the people and introduce legislation for divorce? From the tone and content of speeches by major figures in Fianna Fáil to date it seems in Government they might decide that the people were mistaken if they voted yes.  Given the background to the major speeches we have heard, it is a major question which Fianna Fáil should answer.  If Fianna Fáil were in Opposition, would they oppose divorce legislation?</P>
    <P>A great many aspects of the debate have been exhaustively covered in recent years in this House and elsewhere.  Some aspects of the Government's proposals are of considerable importance.  I should like to join Deputy Flynn and many others in this House in saying that it has always been a very strong conviction of mine that marriage is for life.  The stability of a developing home, the maturing and mellowing of a married couple when they become parents, the various stages of the family with all the ups and downs of family life and the final chapter of old age, ideally surrounded and loved by children and grandchildren, seem to be the very best foundation for a stable and sane society.  For many people who have had the great good fortune to be part of such a family, it seems odd, even unthinkable, that other forms of living exist.  It is an understandable view which, unfortunately, has led to a reluctance on the part of people who have been lucky enough to have been brought up in those circumstances to come to grips with alternative lifestyles.</P>
    <P>This reluctance is illustrated by the length of time it has taken Irish society to recognise, for example, the existence of a deserted wife and her child, the unmarried mother and the battered wife.  I recall when a colleague of mine, now the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs, drew our attention to the plight of battered wives, it was greeted by a great many people with frank disbelief.  It is only in the past two <Col N="1268" /> decades that social legislation and support from the State have recognised that everything is not perfect in Irish families. As recently as 1970, the deserted wife's benefit was introduced and when other allowances and benefits were introduced for different categories of single parent families, there was not always a unanimous welcome for them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of attitudes which I find very interesting is that some women's organisations seem to consider divorce a women's issue.  I always found that very difficult to understand although I could see it was natural that the issue of divorce should be taken up by people who were and are dealing very admirably, and in such a dedicated way, with a great many aspects of the vulnerability of women in a marriage which has broken down.</P>
    <P>Divorce never was and is not a women's issue.  People seem to have moved away from that point of view but it is something that puzzled me some years back.  Perhaps one of the reasons that view was held was that in countries where divorce legislation existed the majority of applications for divorce came from women who, despite the great many disadvantages and problems they would encounter as single parents after divorce, felt it was preferable to living in a very difficult marital breakdown situation. That may have been a reason why some women here identified divorce as a women's issue.</P>
    <P>In the past many women have been greatly concerned that it was precisely the opposite, an anti-women issue.  I have detected, as other Deputies mentioned, an attempt to use this fear in the campaign against passing the amendment. The fear was and, where it still exists, is mostly based on a judgment that the Irish legal system would follow the example of other countries and would greatly undervalue and under-protect the fulltime homemakers' position in a divorce. That supposition was based on the fact that the professions, political and legal, dealing with these matters in courts or in the Legislature, are mostly male, mostly middle-aged to elderly, mostly relatively well to do and mostly educated in single <Col N="1269" /> sexed boys' schools which are notoriously conservative on social issues.  A lot of people felt that this combination of factors would not be conducive to any sensitivity to what might be described as the grim realities of life for a woman alone, particularly a woman who had given years and years to a home, a husband and children to the exclusion of all else and who was, in regard to marital breakdown extremely vulnerable.  It was also feared, and often still is, that as a corollary to this the rights of the breadwinner, who is usually male, to property and income would be very much over-emphasised by that section of our society who are responsible for the passing of our laws and the execution of our laws.</P>
    <P>I must confess that over the years one of the reasons I kept silent on the issue of divorce was because I shared those reservations.  Occasionally, I expressed them, but I was never involved in calling loudly for divorce legislation.  At the time, however, like so many others, I became extremely concerned about citizens who had sad, lonely and often irregular lives as a result of their marriages going so badly wrong that they were beyond hope. They were precluded from a second chance.  Those concerns grew considerably in society.  It is because I have those reservations that I am immensely satisfied that in the wording of the Government's amendment, and the accompanying statement of the Government's intentions, great attention has been given to the position of dependent spouses and children.  As well as that, we have specifically called attention to the opinion of the joint committee that a spouse, by giving up employment and thereby financial independence, should not be prejudiced in the matter of financial and property divisions.  I was glad to see that paragraph in the report of the Oireachtas joint committee because it dealt with one of the main worries many have about the question of separation and divorce.</P>
    <P>Again and again in the statement of intent, and more importantly in the actual wording of the amendment, the concern for the spouse and children is <Col N="1270" /> very clearly enunciated.  The expression in the amendment is:</P>
    <P>...the court is satisfied that adequate and proper provision... will be made for any dependent spouse and for any child of or any child who is dependent on either spouse.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Adequate and proper provision&rdquo; not only covers the question of financial provision, whether by the State or one of the spouses, but also covers many other things to do with the welfare of children and spouses.  Any court which is dealing with these matters will obviously be required to give very special consideration to this aspect.  The amendment wording and the declaration of intention together represent a considerable improvement on the present position, far from a worsening of it.  I do not for one moment believe that this requirement either in the wording of the amendment or in the statement of intent will solve with a magic wand the undoubted severe problems of any family breaking up. Divorce or separation of any form are not a perfect solution to problems.  But, unfortunately, the problems exist and they do not lend themselves to perfect solutions.  Today without any divorce legislation many families are breaking up. New unions are being established and it would be a great improvement to have at least a clear commitment to the weaker partners and dependent children of a marriage.  That clear commitment may well act as another brake on the divorce process but I would much prefer that we would err on the side of caution in this matter.  In this society only 18 per cent of married women are in the workforce, the lowest in the EC.  This emphasis in the Irish situation in the amendment and the accompanying document is essential.</P>
    <P>There has been some concern expressed that the introduction of divorce would add greatly to the burdens of the taxpayer in terms of supporting two families.  We must remind ourselves that the taxpayer is already supporting marital breakdown, particularly through the deserted wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>William Duncan in his book, <i>The Case <Col N="1271" /> for Divorce</i>, argues that the absence of divorce makes it impossible for an estranged wife to establish a legally protected relationship with a second partner who might be willing to support her.  In the case of divorce remarriage would be possible and the wife and her second husband would be bound in law to protect each other with mutual support and maintenance. Under the present laws, if a wife has an extra marital relationship, a second partner is not in law responsible for her support or the support of her children.  In that context the argument that divorce may place an added burden on the taxpayer wears a little thin.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it is not a divorce or the prospect of divorce which causes the taxpayer in general to enter the position of supporting families but it is the initial marriage breakdown and separation. Obviously the question of the social welfare legislation supporting the family will need to be looked at carefully. It is necessary to have a look at the social welfare legislation governing the support of the family.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed in the debate that somehow a person who has been divorced and who was not being maintained by the former spouse would be left without the State's financial support. I should like to assure the House that this will not be so.  It must not be forgotten that the very purpose of the social welfare code is to deal with financial need, particularly the needs of the weaker and unprotected sectors of our society.  I intend to see that the social welfare system is available in the most suitable and amenable way for individuals and families who may be involved in the divorce process.</P>
    <P>It must not be overlooked that in the first instance the court granting the divorce will have to be satisfied that adequate and proper provision is made for dependants.  In this context I have begun a detailed review of social welfare legislation in the matter of supporting the family.  The system already supports families with a wide variety of schemes <Col N="1272" /> and services.  In considering the situation arising from divorce, the schemes for the support of one-parent families are clearly the most relevant.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to consider the number of such schemes which have been introduced over the years to meet the particular needs of special categories of these families.  Examples are the schemes for widows, deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.  They arose over the years in a somewhat haphazard way in response to the way society felt at certain times that those categories should be protected.  Some of them came on the scene rather late in the day to recognise that all was not perfect in an Irish marriage. However they arose, they show that the social welfare code is sufficiently flexible to cater for a wide range of families in different circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the House that in my review of social welfare legislation it will be of great concern that in the relevant areas of social policy the provision of support for families in distress will, in so far as is possible, be made in a way that assists them in staying together and overcoming their difficulties.  In this context it is relevant to mention that the Commission on Social Welfare are just completing the task given them by the Government in mid-1983 to undertake a fundamental and wide-ranging review of all aspects of the social welfare system. I expect their report very shortly.  The developments in the area of support for single-parent families will be carried out with reference to whatever related proposals the commission may make.</P>
    <P>There are a great many other aspects to this amendment which are extremely important, which have already and will receive detailed consideration during this debate.  However, I should like to place on record my esteem for and gratitude to the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown who did such fundamental work on this whole matter.  The report of the committee and the Dáil debate that followed it mean that we approach this question in the right manner&mdash;at the end of a wide and considered, well informed <Col N="1273" /> public debate, and it seems to me, with a population ready to take a decision.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, in framing this amendment and the accompanying intentions for legislation, we have set about the right way in dealing with grave social and personal problems, which will not disappear or go away simply because they are unpalatable.  We are giving to those who have quite definitely got to a point where a marriage has long been a thing of the past, a second chance.  We are recognising a human and civil right for people to make their own decisions about remarriage.  We intend to do so with the kind of divorce processes which actively protect marriage, encourage reconciliation and investigate alternatives but which, in the final analysis, recognise reality.  That is what we are about and what we are putting before the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of putting my views on this important issue.  I want to advance reasons why this proposal should not be accepted by the people.  In doing so I should like to place on record my views in relation to many of the issues which are the cause of the unfortunate circumstances in which many married people now find themselves. I fully appreciate and recognise that there are many couples experiencing difficulties in their married life.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown examined in considerable depth the various aspects of marital problems. They recommended solutions in areas of potential difficulty.  Perhaps understandably, because of the deep divisions in attitudes held by the public generally, the members of the committee left other aspects for further debate and consideration. The committee probed cases of marital breakdown and outlined the consequences that could result from a variety of remedies for individuals and for society as a whole.  There is considerable agreement found in the report but it is also obvious that there were differences, mainly in respect of solutions in the areas of particular difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we need to protect marriage <Col N="1274" /> and the family, that the family unit is fundamental to the well-being of society and of the State.  The people responsible for formulating the 1937 Constitution clearly recognised that and included an Article which stipulated the lines on which the well-being of the family would be guaranteed.  Considerable changes in attitude, resulting from social changes, have taken place since 1937; but the philosophy that motivated those people who formulated the Constitution in regard to ensuring the well-being of the family is as relevant today as it was then.</P>
    <P>The family unit is subjected to tremendous pressures in modern times.  Social attitudes and needs have changed dramatically. Not so many years ago economic circumstances, particularly in rural areas &mdash; where a husband, wife and children needed to combine energies and resources merely to exist &mdash; meant there was little time to think about separation let alone decide on it.  I do not need to outline the changes that have occurred in recent times, where in many instances husbands and wives work, are financially independent of one another, and the effect of that on attitudes.  There may also be the case of a husband and wife being unemployed, subjected to the all-pervading advertising in the media and the pressures that brings on families.  The influence of these and other pressures on the individual today necessitates not only recognition of the rights of the family but also that the provisions of the Constitution in that respect should be accepted and acted on fully in order to secure the well-being of the family unit.</P>
    <P>Much more needs to be done if we are to put into practice the provisions of the Constitution in respect of the family. That is not to say that nothing has been done.  I realise that it has become the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; to suggest that the terms used in respect of the family in the Constitution are just pious platitudes but that little has been done in a practical manner.  Social legislation has been adopted, education has been upgraded, housing improved and great strides made with regard to our health services.  The problems confronting families today are different but, in <Col N="1275" /> many instances, no less difficult.  Their positive identification and a search for solutions are crucial.</P>
    <P>With regard to the importance of education in the preparation for marriage, the need for a structured approach to ensure that those preparing for marriage are made aware of their duties, obligations and rights and the practical means by which these can be put into effect, it has been said with more than a little truth that for far too long those making the most important decision of their lives &mdash; namely, to marry &mdash; did so without any preparation whatsoever.  The need for education and careful study, accepted as being necessary in the case of every other decision in life, appears to have been overlooked in the case of marriage.  In the case of marriage it was accepted that two people simply met, decided to marry and hoped for the best.  In earlier times when the background of most people was rural, there did not appear to be much need for preparation for marriage because then the family became an economic unit, its existence dependent largely on a close-knit working unit or group.  Today economic and social conditions have changed.  I am anxious to see the provision of a comprehensive programme, within our educational system, designed to prepare people properly for marriage.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on such a programme must be on its comprehensive nature.  It must not be confined to what is loosely termed sex education.  It must concern itself with the totality of relationships.  It must be about the respect of one human being for another human being.  It must be about communication and understanding. Reference to marriage as such need only be introduced incidentally in such a course.  The course must concern itself with relationships and have a bearing on all facets of living.  It must have more understanding if we are prepared to see the point of view of the other person.  If we are ready to respect others, whatever their social standing, class or creed, because they are people created by God, then much of the turmoil in <Col N="1276" /> people's lives would begin to abate.  If through our educational system we could improve attitudes towards our fellow human beings, we would be laying the foundation for the preparation of young people towards more responsible adulthood and ensuring that they approach the serious decision of marriage in an adult and responsible manner.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that our educational system has concentrated far too much on a rather narrow definition of the person and that the be all and end all of the system appears to be to get good examination results.  The pressure today to get as many points as possible in examinations effectively squeezes out the ultimate, much more important development of a human person in himself or herself and their relationships with their fellow human beings.  Thus, we produce people, who, whatever their academic or technical achievements, have no concept of how to relate to their fellows and their marriages could be doomed even before they think of marriage.</P>
    <P>This can apply at all levels of society. The restructuring of our educational system in this respect at all levels is fundamental to achieving our objectives.  As our educational system stands today, it would be quite reasonable for school authorities and teachers to point to the work load and say that there is simply not the time to concern themselves about matters that do not relate to examinations. It is not that they do not wish to promote human relationships but that the system does not permit it.  Therefore, I am convinced that, as all of us are in agreement about the importance of the family and the need to protect it and take cognisance of the tremendous pressures on the family today, it is vital that we act speedily in the educational sphere to provide the necessary structures to combat problems that were not even thought of a few short years ago.  Changes in the educational system are needed to combat modern insidious pressures on the family, the institution which we all appear to have accepted as being the <Col N="1277" /> cornerstone of the well-being of the nation.</P>
    <P>I dealt with educational development at some length because I believe that properly structured development could transform the scene in years to come.  At the same time I recognise that there are breakdowns in relationships and that considerable numbers of people are experiencing grave marital problems which we must endeavour to tackle and try to overcome in the short term.  There is an urgent need for the development of counselling services at the pre-marriage stage.  This is a matter which in recent years has been given considerable attention by the Churches, who have recognised the needs for counselling and have made considerable progress in the area.  Indeed, they deserve our thanks and congratulations for this.  However, the Churches have limited resources and the State must accept that it also has a responsibility.  I would suggest that the State might consult with the Churches and voluntary organisations engaged in this work to see how best it can help.  The State could clearly benefit from any efforts that would stabilise marriage.  Though it is a fact that we have at least a framework of pre-marriage counselling, we have little or no help in after-marriage counselling. Indeed, there is very little support or assistance for married couples.</P>
    <P>It is most important that problems which arise in the early years of marriage are tackled quickly.  The difficulty is that such problems may for quite a time be recognisable only within the immediate family circle and cannot be tackled because those concerned do not know where to turn, or may not have any place or anybody to turn to.  We are aware that many marriages break down in the early years of marriage.  Adjusting to the new state of marriage by two different personalities can be difficult, especially where there is very little preparation for marriage. But we have done very little to provide the services needed in such circumstances. There is therefore a grave need for locally based counselling and other services, well advertised, so that couples in need know what is available <Col N="1278" /> and where they can go for help to have their problems discussed, in the hope that they may be solved.</P>
    <P>Marriage is a lifelong commitment and young people contemplating marriage should be mature enough to understand and appreciate the responsibilities and duties which go with such a commitment. A rising over-indulgence in alcohol is a major cause of marriage breakdown, when it is noted that in 1982 the number of admissions to psychatric hospitals resulting from alcoholic abuse and alcohol related problems was 7,189.  This in itself gives some appreciation of the problem.  It is therefore the duty of the State to do all in its power to try to ensure moderation in the use of alcoholic beverages.  Effective measures must be introduced with regard to under-age drinking and ensuring that the law is upheld in this area.  Concern has been expressed by parents of teenagers about over-glamourisation of advertisements for alcoholic drink on television.  Moderation must be the key word in the approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>Lack of proper housing and unemployment are major factors in respect of marriage breakdowns.  Divorce records in Britain show that there is a close association between social class and the incidence of divorce in that country.  In 1979 the number of divorces per 1,000 husbands between the ages of 16 and 59 years in unskilled manual occupations was more than four times that for husbands in professional occupations.  The difference was even greater for young husbands, the comparable rates for the 20 to 29 year age group were 55 and ten divorces, respectively.</P>
    <P>Overall, the rate was highest for unemployed husbands who, it might be suspected, were disproportionately drawn from the unskilled for each age group. The divorce rate for the unemployed was double that of the national average.  All of this must be a matter of concern for the Government and local authorities. The hardships and suffering of the unemployed is self-evident.  Added to this, we must now note the severe effects which unemployment has on marriage and the <Col N="1279" /> family.  If we are sincere in our approach to Article 41 of the Constitution, we must redouble our efforts to reduce unemployment and ensure proper housing for all our people.</P>
    <P>Many of the matters to which I have referred come within the ambit of the State, namely, the provision and access to a pre-marriage guidance service and an easily accessible and effective counselling service for all married couples.  The raising of the minimum age for marriage and ensuring that the law is carried out in respect of under-age drinking must get serious consideration immediately. When problems cannot be solved by mediation, we need a family court structure which can deal with the problems of marriage breakdown and, indeed, which can deal with other family matters as well.  Such courts need proper staffing and a back-up welfare service.</P>
    <P>A favourable decision on the divorce issue can only be arrived at if it can be shown to be for the greater good of society.  I am not convinced that divorce is in the interests of society.  I have already pointed out that I am keenly aware of the very sensitive problems facing individuals in the area of marriage breakdown, but it would appear to me that the cure would become worse than the disease.  We must examine thoroughly the social consequences of divorce, and its financial implications, if we are to reach a proper conclusion.</P>
    <P>Again, I emphasise the genuine hardship in a number of cases in this country and recognise the traumatic experience of those whose marriages have broken down, the agony, mental torture and physical abuse experienced by many during the course of the breakdown and the exceptional need for assistance in such cases.  I have been committed, in the course of my public life, to doing everything possible to assist people who find themselves in such circumstances. However, taking into account the social upheaval which follows, I doubt that anybody could hold that the introduction of divorce into the countries where it now exists has been <Col N="1280" /> found to have been for the common good. Whatever may have been the good intentions, the granting of a divorce has meant generally the end of society's interest in those involved.  Very often a Government, having passed the legislation, believe that they have done their share. In many cases one of the partners, and sometimes both, becomes the flotsam and jetsam of society which nobody cares about.</P>
    <P>There is no denying the fact that where divorce is introduced respect for marriage and the family unit wanes and, however genuine the attitude of those who advocate divorce within certain limits may be its end result will be divorce on demand with the frightening social consequences that follow.  Many of those who advocate divorce say that it should be granted only in cases of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.  It has been proposed that such a provision should be written into the Constitution and copper-fastened there.  However, I would make the point that implicit in such a proposal is that divorce for any other reason is unacceptable and would be damaging to society in general and to the family in particular.</P>
    <P>In western countries where divorce was introduced there was specified stringent rules and regulations in respect of the granting of divorce, usually that divorce could not be granted except in cases of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. Invariably, as time passed, pressure grew for less control.  The original condition was watered down and eventually divorce on demand became the norm.  In Britain and America there is now one divorce for every three marriages and the figure is moving towards one in every two marriages. In Northern Ireland the number of divorces has escalated since divorce was introduced.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances we must accept that, should divorce be introduced here and granted on the condition of irretrievable breakdown, we will find ourselves ultimately in the same situation as other European countries and America where divorce is permitted.  Therefore, those who hold the irretrievable breakdown <Col N="1281" /> theory must accept that their proposal opens the door to the problems they obviously envisage in the granting of divorce for reasons other than irretrievable breakdown.  Therefore, I find it difficult to understand how they can sustain the irretrievable breakdown proposal. Even if irretrievable breakdown of marriage was the only condition, one would have to ask oneself how can such a breakdown come about.  One partner wishing to divorce and remarry can relatively easily contrive a marriage breakdown regardless of what the other person wanted.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the effects of divorce on children.  Adults may or may not be able to cope in a divorce situation but children, who would be the main concern, cannot cope.  They are the innocent victims of divorce proceedings.  The traumatic effects on them relate not only to the time of the divorce but in many instances remain all through their lives. The director of the Yale Child Studies Centre, Albert Solnit, reflecting on the increasingly significant impact divorces have on American family life, said that this is one of the most serious mental health crises facing children in the eighties.  In divorce children may not only lose a parent, they may also as a result of relocation lose their home, their school and their friends, because the parent they live with may often because of economic necessity work outside the home.  The children experience more time alone and more time with other caretakers.  For many children divorce means economic hardship.  Many children experience feelings of guilt, insecurity, anger and depression. Nearly all of them cling to the futile hope of reuniting their family, although this is never likely to occur.  Quite a percentage of these children never recover from the trauma and continue to be hurt and injured.</P>
    <P>From studies which have been carried out it is recognised that, once children realise that their parents are divorcing, they enter a state of crisis.  They feel that things have gone out of control.  They cannot by their behaviour pull together their crumbling world.  Parents often <Col N="1282" /> think there will not be a crisis.  Since the home was previously loaded with tension they believe that through divorce children will gain a sense of relief from anxiety in the home.  However, to ascertain the reality <i>vis-à-vis</i> the child, one must try to view it through the eyes of the child.  We are all aware of the saying &ldquo;When I was a child, I understood as a child&rdquo;.  A recent study has shown that less than 10 per cent of children experience relief at the time of a separation even though 30 per cent of them had witnessed scenes of physical violence between the parents.  Five years after a divorce more than 50 per cent of the children did not consider their family lives improved over what they had been prior to the divorce.  Although their parents had been unhappy, the children were fairly happy and did not believe &mdash; this is important &mdash; they were worse off than other families.  The parents may have felt relief from the divorce, but the children's psychological health did not improve markedly.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the change is that often less money will be available.  The family now have the expense of two households.  Often fathers do not or are not able to contribute at the former level of support.  It has been found that the average level of support for children of divorced parents was less than half the usual cost considered necessary for raising children.  To quite an extent all children of divorced parents are insecure because they live with one parent and they fear what would happen to them if they were to be abandoned by the other parent.</P>
    <P>Fear of being alone in the world is at the core of their perceived danger. Children need to be dependent, although they sometimes protest loudly to the contrary. Given the insecurity of their world, the need for dependence becomes obvious, especially in young children &mdash; for example, wanting to be in the same room, not going to visit friends, not wanting to go to school for fear that their parent, mother or father as the case may be, may not be there when they return. Children are often shuttled between homes.  When marriages end up in <Col N="1283" /> divorce the arrangement could be that the children will live with their mother and see their father for a day each week at the weekend.  During that weekend the children will have lots of games, eat at fast food restaurants, go on trips to the sea or to the mountains and new toys will be bought.  But, when they return home and must fall back into the ordinary pattern of life, helping around the house, being disciplined and so on, the children become irritated with the mother and become disturbed.</P>
    <P>Children pay a high price when a parent is removed from the family network. The father can be a very pleasant person in such circumstances.  Again, however, studies show that after a time there is a steady decline in attention to the children; and for many fathers after two years there was a significant decrease in the amount of time spent with the children as well as in the quality of their relationships.  I could say much more on this subject but I feel for the moment I have said sufficient to show how traumatic and how damaging to children divorce is.</P>
    <P>We are told that polls show that more than half of our population would change the Constitution to allow the Dáil to pass divorce legislation.  I wonder on what basis people have decided for divorce legislation?  Have they studied or are they aware of the social and financial consequences?  Is it because of their own personal situations or is it because of their knowledge of hard cases?  Are they influenced by the media?  Under the present law a married person may obtain a decree of judicial separation which entitles that spouse to live separate and apart from the other spouse, but not to remarry.  Alternatively, a married person can enter into a legal binding agreement enabling them to live separate and apart from each other and continuing agreed provisions settling questions of maintenance and the ownership and occupation of the family home.</P>
    <P>In the legislation now before us it is proposed to make a number of changes <Col N="1284" /> in the existing arrangements for judicial separation.  Such separations in the future will be dealt with by a family court presided over by a number of judges from the Circuit Court especially assigned for that purpose.  This change is to be welcomed. Procedures will be less formal and cases heard in the family court will be heard <i>in camera.</i> In all of these circumstances divorce, which creates so many problems for women and children, is not needed.  The implications of divorce, if ever it becomes law, will be regretted by many of those who are now its advocates. In the case of a woman being divorced from her husband and a settlement being made, she is no longer a dependant and would have no rights under the Succession Act.  In the event of her divorced husband dying she would have no claims to a widow's pension.  In the event of her divorced husband remarrying a new family is then set up and under the articles protecting the family in the Constitution the new family would be fully protected under these laws and would have inalienable rights above positive law.  A divorced husband's second wife could take an action through the courts against any part of her husband's property or income being paid over to his first wife with the full support of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The White Paper issued by the Government on marriage, separation and divorce has no legal standing and therefore too much cannot be read into it. While I fully accept and acknowledge the difficulties of many people, the setting up of family courts, as proposed, and legal separation is the way that these problems can be dealt with.  It has been conclusively proven in countries where divorce is the law that it has created more problems than it has resolved.  Our prime concern should be for the protection of the family, which was the prime objective of those who went before us in the drafting of the Articles relating to the family in the Constitution.  If these Articles are now to be changed the protection of the family within the Constitution will be severely weakened and unfortunately women and children will be the losers.</P>
    <P>Will the introduction of divorce resolve <Col N="1285" /> broken marriages?  Will the children of broken marriages find peace and contentment in the event of either parent remarrying? Will it relieve the State of the responsibilities in relation to contributing factors to broken marriages?  Some examples of the causes of broken marriages are unemployment, bad housing, drink problems and drug addiction.  It will have no effect in these areas other than to add to the problems and to bring untold misery to women and children.  Can we afford to impose this burden on our nation by allowing people to remarry and, by doing so, destabilising what is the cornerstone and the foundation of our society?</P>
    <P>I have the deepest sympathy for people who are deserted by their spouses and left to fend for themselves and their children. The State and the community must do everything possible to help people in such circumstances.  Marriage is a contract and a commitment by two people for life. Have we the right to weaken this and to place many more people in the circumstances which I have outlined?  I do not believe we have.  As a legislator, I believe it is wrong to introduce divorce for the reasons I have given and I will campaign for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in this referendum.  I ask that the amendment to the Constitution to allow people to remarry be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always believed very conscientiously in the real essence of democracy.  Hence I must believe in a referendum.  Generally speaking in referenda on every important issue to consult the people, to ask their views and to obtain their votes on major issues is the real essence of democracy. For that reason I welcome a referendum on divorce.  I have some questions to ask the Minister.  From the beginning of this debate up to now practically everything has been said for and against.  There are certain aspects of the whole referendum, its cause, its purpose and perhaps its results, which have not as yet been cleared up in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great breath of fresh air that for the first time since the setting up of Parliament we have an issue on which <Col N="1286" /> Deputies from all sides of this House can express their views.  Can there be anything more difficult than for one to continously vote and speak on something they inwardly do not believe in? It is a great breath of fresh air for a democratic Parliament that all parties are permitting their Members to speak out their minds in relation to this conscientious problem.  That has not come about without some sacrifice from some of the senior Members of this House.  If we did nothing else, as a result of our speeches and votes we have helped to bring about a situation in which every Member of this Parliament, of this freely-elected assembly, can say what they have to in relation to this constitutional matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the economic problems which are linked to this matter, 40 textile workers in my home town lost their jobs during the week.  There are 9,000 unemployed in my constituency.  There are farmers, students and teachers in distress. We have a society which presents serious crime.  Our prisons are full.  There are growing numbers of alcoholics.  Old people are beaten up and robbed and occasionally their lives are taken.  These are all very serious problems.  Our society is on the verge of complete breakdown and collapse.  There are 250,000 people unemployed, but there is no anxiety in Parliament to rush referenda or legislation through in order to relieve their plight.  Economically we are in a very serious position.  Our taxpayers are not in a position to pay the heavy levels of taxation, either in VAT, PRSI or other forms of taxation.</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago there was no money to make any further offer to teachers. Apparently, the money has been found to conduct a referendum.  Where is the demand for divorce in this country? There has been no demand.  There are 650,000 married people in Ireland.  We are told that there are 35,000 broken marriages.  Of the 650,000 married couples in Ireland only 6 per cent have broken marriages, but you have a demand by that 6 per cent to put at risk the marriages of the 94 per cent.  Through the media, that 6 per cent of marriages <Col N="1287" /> which are broken have been given the power, through agitation, to force the Government to provide divorce.  Consequently, 94 per cent of all marriages in the country are being put at risk.  Let no man say, or woman, to give her equality&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That constant agitation and pressure on people in high places and on the media have succeeded on behalf of the 6 per cent of those marriages that have broken down.  As I have said, that 6 per cent are putting at risk the marriages of 94 per cent of couples in Ireland.  That will happen if the Irish people are foolish enough to pass this law.  There is nobody as shrewd as the Irish voter.  He is no fool, particularly nowadays when we have better education and when people study and think.</P>
      <P>Every marriage in the country will be at risk if this reform is accepted.  Ministers have said that we all have freedom of opinion, and I am expressing mine when I say that all marriages in Ireland will be at risk.  All of us are very sorry that 6 per cent of Irish marriages have broken down and that that 6 per cent can affect the position so that every other married couple can have available a divorce system which will wreck families and destroy family life, which is not being helped by the economic circumstances obtaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here an environment of which none of us wants to boast, we have economic circumstances that are not conducive to happy living conditions; but, if on top of that we are to make divorce available, we are putting all marriages at risk.  Let us not say that the form of divorce that would be introduced through the referendum would not be easy to obtain.  Either divorce will be available or it will not, and it is only a matter of time, as in the UK, until divorce will be easy to obtain.  Once we have divorce we will smash marriage and the family as they are known and create all kinds of <Col N="1288" /> discontent and unhappiness.  The seriousness and the dangers inherent in this cannot be estimated and cannot be described in the language we use here. &ldquo;Disaster&rdquo; is only a mild word in this connection.</P>
    <P>Is it not true that from time to time many of us have been criticised for saying what we believe?  Is this not an opportunity for all Deputies to speak out against the real motive behind this, which is to put the cloak of respectability on adultery? That is what we are doing when we ask people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  That is the issue.  In Dublin, in the heart of the midlands, in the mountains and valleys of Kerry, among the rocks of Connemara, our people are being asked to give the seal of respectability on adultery.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to see where the urgency arises in this matter particularly when we know from statistics that 94 per cent of all Irish marriages are intact and reasonably happy, despite the serious economic circumstances.  What the Government should be engaged in is trying to promote circumstances in which the 6 per cent of marriages which have broken down could be brought together. We should be as enthusiastic about bringing those people together and helping to keep them together, by providing finance to help that process, as about putting forward a proposal to introduce divorce.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have children's allowances which are the worst, the smallest, in Europe.  In recent years we have taken from the family as a unit because we have given them nothing.  We have thrown the family on the scrap heap.  Indeed, It is surprising that only 6 per cent of marriages have broken down because we have not provided anything for them. There are young married couples in my constituency with one or both spouses living with parents.  We have children separated from parents because of lack of housing, because they have no room or any accommodation.  I see young married women having to climb several flights of stairs carrying cans of water.  One can imagine the discontent when the first child arrives and the parents have not a proper home.  No one could deny that <Col N="1289" /> such a marriage is not in danger, where a husband and wife cannot live together because of the lack of housing.  If that happens in rural Ireland I am convinced it happens also in this and in other cities.</P>
    <P>We have 250,000 unemployed and yet no one seems to worry about them.  All efforts are directed towards having divorce here but nothing is being done to get work for the unemployed.  It is wrong that we have not had a policy based on the family because the family is the fundamental unit in Irish society.  It is the natural and fundamental group and is entitled to protection by society.  Our Constitution entitles the family to protection, but is the provision of divorce protection for any family?  Is putting at risk 94 per cent of Irish marriages simply because 6 per cent have broken down protection for the family?  That 94 per cent of the 650,000 marriages will be put at risk because if the referendum is passed Article 41 of the Constitution will mean nothing.  The one way to protect a family is to ensure that they are provided for, that the wage earner or wage earners obtain employment to provide for their family.</P>
    <P>Another question has not been answered.  In the United Kingdom divorce costs the State £1 billion per year and it is estimated that the cost of divorce here would be £50 million per year.  I think it would be nearer to £100 million. Will the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health, who is a wizard at producing figures, or some other Minister please tell us where we will get this £100 million per year to provide for the families of first marriages?  In many cases free legal aid will have to be provided if they wish to bring their cases to court.</P>
    <P>We are told there is no money for anything in the country today.  How will the Irish economy be able to provide this £100 million per year?  Will the farmers be asked to pay for it?  Will the PAYE workers, who are already keeping the country going, be asked to pay more? The EC will not give us the money. Therefore, there is only one place it can come from, namely, the Irish taxpayers and they should be told that during the <Col N="1290" /> referendum campaign.  Taxpayers in the United Kingdom have to foot the bill there.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy referred to the fact that we have a great habit of taking our example from British legislation.  Often Whitehall sets the line for our laws.  If we are to follow the pattern adopted by Whitehall it means the moment the Irish people give the green light for divorce it is only a matter of time until Whitehall laws are adopted here and then it will be a case of free-for-all divorce.  It is no use saying that the divorce proposals here are very restrictive and that there will be a period of five years separation.  Is it not the position that a case will be decided on the basis of an affidavit from one of the parties?  Who will give evidence that a couple have been separated for five years?  What is to stop one of the parties saying they have been separated for five years when the reality may be they have been separated for only three years? There is nothing in the Bill to say that cannot be done.</P>
    <P>The Irish people are mature and they will not buy a pig in a poke.  They will want to know who will pay for all of this. That is the principal point.  I raised this matter because so few Deputies mentioned it.  We cannot get money for schools, roads or for housing for the elderly. There is no public demand or outcry for this divorce legislation.  Not one single person in my constituency ever asked me about it.  Now a vast amount of money will be spent but I ask, would it not be better to give that money to Willie Bermingham for the poor and for the aged?</P>
    <P>No tribe or society in any part of the world has survived where the family as a unit has deteriorated.  If people are sufficiently foolish as to support a plea for divorce it is important that they know the consequences.  The law will not affect many of us individually.  The real victims will be women and children.  The last speaker referred to that and there is no need for any other Deputy to deal with it in great detail.</P>
    <P>Divorce law gives to everyone who marries a legal right to remarry in certain circumstances.  That is the purpose of the <Col N="1291" /> referendum.  People are seeking under a mantle of respectability to cast aside their wives whom they took for better or for worse until death do them part.  That is what people who have cherished family life and marriage are being asked to vote for.  What a dreadful, awful, disastrous situation we are facing.  May we be delivered from such a desperate evil.  Taken with the other national evils from which we suffer this will be the last straw for our society.  There are many Deputies who know that but they are not availing of the opportunity to stand up and say so.  I hope that on polling day they will be there like good citizens and in the secrecy of the ballot box will not allow what their parents, grandparents and greatgrandparents cherished, our traditional Christian values, to be thrown away.</P>
    <P>The legal concept of marriage changes completely if divorce is approved of by the people.  The law will support temporary relationships because that is all any marriage will be.  The Minister for Education explained that in County Westmeath recently.  Those promoting this Bill want marriage to be a temporary relationship and a general convenience that could end with serious consequences for the children involved.  The State which introduces a divorce law makes marriage as a lifelong relationship legally obsolete.</P>
    <P>In the UK the first divorce law was for husbands only and was granted on grounds of adultery.  The 1923 law was for wives.  The 1937 Act extended the grounds to cover desertion, insanity or cruelty.  Under the 1969 Act all that was necessary was to say that the marriage had broken down.  As sure as we are assembled in this Chamber the same will happen here within the next 12 years if this law is introduced.  We have seen it happen in every European country and in the US.  The divorce rate in the US has trebled.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House that financially we are not in a position to support temporary relationships.  If we were in a position to do that some effort should have been made to assist the 6 per cent of broken <Col N="1292" /> marriages which we have at present.  The legal profession tell us that very soon the State will have to withdraw legal, economic and social support as a result of our economic condition.</P>
    <P>If a divorce law is introduced we will be back to the position which pertained before the Middle Ages when marriage was a private arrangement.  We talk about modern times, being up to date and trying to overtake prosperous countries but in this area it is towards the Middle Ages that we would be headed. The system in the Middle Ages led to a legal and social mess of the highest order.</P>
    <P>The consequences of divorce are frightening.  I am sure many Deputies have already explained the statistics in relation to both the United Kingdom and the United States.  The economic consequences are grave.  Married women in Ireland have substantial rights to maintenance from their husbands backed by a variety of enforcement procedures, including attachment of earnings.  We are now asking the voter to deprive married couples of the legal facilities that are already there.  The effect of divorce will be to minimise or reduce those rights and, in some cases, to abolish them completely. The experience of other countries which have introduced divorce based on the breakdown of marriage is that men are released from their former level of obligation to maintain their wives and children.  In those circumstances who maintains the wives and children?  The taxpayer does.  That is why the taxpayer should be given those facts in relation to this very serious matter.</P>
    <P>The provisions included in divorce legislation for providing some protection for the interests of children have proved useless in most countries, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States. In such societies divorce has only made a bad situation worse and that is what it is likely to do here.  The situation may be bad for the 6 per cent of marriages that have broken down but it will make it more difficult for the 94 per cent of marriages that are working because they will not have the legal protection of Article 41 of the Constitution.  Whether they <Col N="1293" /> have or not, it has not been implemented to date nor has it been effective in helping the family.  In some societies the influence of the family on its own members is greatly diminished and the powerful influence of the family in moulding the values of our society is not only diminished but the family is seen as a social liability and this is a very serious situation.  With the introduction of divorce the family and marriage become rudderless and drift upon the rocks that wreck all the human values we cherish.  That is what this Bill is endeavouring to do, to drive the 94 per cent of good marriages onto the rocks of human tragedy and misery.</P>
    <P>It is a fallacy that the conditions for granting divorce can be contained.  Once divorce is introduced the process is irreversible. Western society is becoming more like society before the middle ages. It is rudderless as regards values, vision and goals that are truly human.  The west, and other countries have lost the will to provide support for families, the Christian heritage and belief in the fundamental unit of society that is the family.  The family is at grave risk in this referendum.</P>
    <P>Article 41 of the Constitution guards with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is grounded and protects it against attack.  Who is being fooled by all this?  How can we say on the one hand that we must have divorce laws implemented and, on the other hand, say that we are pledged to guard with special care the institution of marriage?  This is no half-hearted statement.  We are pledged to protect the institution of marriage and protect it against attack.  If this Bill is not an attack on marriage, I am unable to read the Bill.</P>
    <P>It was very interesting to hear the Minister make a speech here during the week in which he said everybody was wrong except himself.  That is all his speech amounted to.  Those who were offering moral advice in relation to this matter were wrong; Deputy Alice Glenn was wrong; Deputy Woods was wrong; anybody else who spoke against divorce was wrong; and he was right.  I am a long time in this House but I would not like to have a mentality of that kind.  I like to <Col N="1294" /> give a man credit if he is right and to express appreciation of the views he has expressed.  But it would be ridiculous to say everybody in the House and outside of it was wrong and one man was right. I will not say anything more about that.</P>
    <P>Once the Labour Party in this country were looked upon with great affection and admiration.  The Leader of that party was none other than my own good friend and very loyal colleague, former Deputy Brendan Corish.  When Mr. Corish was addressing the summer gathering of 1973 &mdash; and he was a leader who was held in the greatest affection, esteem and respect &mdash; he said that we in Ireland esteem the family as the source of many social and personal values; that we believe the family to be the basic unit of society, that it was not enough merely to state the value we place on the family as an institution but we must go beyond that statement and deliberately create policies and programmes which reflect that value in human terms.  It is no wonder Mr. Corish is not a member of the Dáil because I do not think he would fit into the Labour Party of today.  I do not think he would fit in with the Labour Party of today.  I knew every member of the Labour Party at that time.  Many of them are dead now, God rest them.  They believed in true Christian values.  They believed, honestly and conscientiously, in Christian marriage &mdash; not a temporary marriage, not marriage for a year or two, but until death do them part.  Mr. Corish was quite right in 1973 when he appealed for policies and programmes to reflect the values of the family in human terms.  What a lovely and memorable statement by a man who was held in great esteem and affection by all Members of this House.</P>
    <P>There are reasons why 6 per cent of marriages do not work.  Marriage is a vocation and we must all try to make it work.  This may be difficult to do at times, but we have to do our part.  No marriage can be successful without a certain amount of give and take and a big effort being made by both parties, remembering the vow they made to each other &mdash; for better or for worse &mdash; realising that <Col N="1295" /> marriage is for life and that only death can dissolve it.</P>
    <P>Parents and others bring great pressure to bear on young people to get married because of pregnancies.  The age of marriage needs to be looked at.  People contemplating marriage must know what they are doing; they must realise that they are taking a partner for life.  Many young people get married to escape their parents and their environment.  Our young people are not educated to realise what is involved in marriage.  Would it not be better if we as legislators dealt with problems of this kind rather than putting 94 per cent of good marriages at risk?</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the Church's pre-marriage courses, but more needs to be done with financial backing by the State.  There is also the problem of in-laws interfering and the provision of proper accommodation.  Many young people get married without any experience of economics, of housekeeping and the use and control of money.  This is very necessary when one is taking on a partner for life.  Many young people who marry have no intention of changing their single habits for their new vocation of married life.  They should be told about these matters. In many marriages that break down there is an absence of a spiritual dimension, which is very important and which is essential for the success of any marriage. Selfishness can come to the fore because of immaturity and greed can creep in. Above all there should be give and take in the areas of trust and confidence.  This, too, is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to high mortgage rates, small flats and housing estates, but another problem is that these young people are not spending enough time together.  There are TV silences where they are only watching and there is no conversation.  Another problem is a lack of outside activities.  Many marriages have gone on the rocks because of an over-emphasis on alcohol and the nightly visits to the singing pubs.  Many marriages might not have broken down if such places had been avoided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> Some of the problems are a lack of ideals, a lack of goals and ambitions, no time for reflection, no time for thoughts of marriage or a frequent renewal of the marriage vows.  In many cases there has been an over-emphasis on status, social climbing, anxiety to be better than everybody else, and tension arises from delays in achieving success in life.  Problems also arise in the case of the &ldquo;workaholic&rdquo;, the man who is under pressure from his firm but puts his career before his wife and children.  No mother, no housewife, will be able to tolerate a man who works at his career 12 hours a day and who concentrates on his ambitions and success for the future.  Every man must have time for the family.</P>
    <P>Financial necessity often requires two incomes when one income is not sufficient for essentials.  Many are living beyond their means and with living costs as they are that is almost unavoidable.  All these problems should be examined.  When the referendum is over and calmness returns to public life after the amendment has been rejected, as I prophesy it will be, the State will pledge itself to work for the family, to build it up, reinforce and reconstruct it, not to dismantle it and blow it out of existence.  We have to consider housing, home-making, youth clubs, youth activities.  We have no press council to modify anti-family programmes on television, radio and in the newspapers. No other country in the world needs a press council as urgently as we do.  With all due respect to our high standard of journalism, a press council would be an asset to radio, television and the press, particularly in modifying the apparent inclination to deal unfavourably with family programmes.  About a fortnight ago I watched an RTE programme dealing with this divorce question.  It was so biased in favour of divorce that I do not know where they picked the people who took part in it, but they got them.  I wrote a letter to the Director General about it.  He may be a very busy man and I am still awaiting a reply to that letter. <Col N="1297" /> I think other Deputies wrote to him likewise. It was wrong, when we were debating this matter in this House and the people were preparing for a referendum, that RTE should televise a one-sided programme on the matter.  I hope that RTE will be able to produce a more balanced television programme on this, in view of the programme I have just referred to which was in favour of divorce and the break-up of marriages.</P>
    <P>In regard to outside influence on families, community radio could do a great deal to sponsor support for and strengthen the activities of families.  After the referendum when we all get down to doing something for the family, I hope we can provide marriage renewal courses.  So far no financial help has been forthcoming for this.  We should deal with such matters in addition to the bread and butter issues.  Some of the poorer families are those whose breadwinner has a job. Our children's allowances are the lowest in Europe and have fallen steadily in value since 1973.  What are we doing about children's allowances if we claim to be protecting the family in accordance with the Constitution?  I am sorry to learn that maternity grants and wife's and husband's insurance were abolished in 1983. That was a terrible mistake in regard to the family.</P>
    <P>What will divorce do for the many deserted wives and families who receive no financial help from the absent partners? It will do nothing except perhaps deepen their despair and misery.  Those husbands can gain respectability and a constitutional guarantee of protection in a second marriage whilst the stranded first wife and the children will be devalued in the eyes of the Constitution and the law, a most serious matter for these people.  Why?  Because the partner who opted out will be able to get a divorce, remarry and establish a second family and will then be regarded as a pillar of the community.  It may be noted that the second family will be, in the words of the Constitution, &ldquo;a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo;.  The first family will be <Col N="1298" /> thrown at this stage on to the rocks, to the mercy of the Irish taxpayer who will be unable to meet the bill.  I have quoted what the Constitution provides in regard to the family and it must apply to a second, third or fourth family after divorce.  The rights of the original family will disappear.  For example, the wife and children of the first marriage will have no succession rights once the marriage is broken up.  There is no answer to that.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputies saying that they are dealing with this simply because marriages break down.  Divorce will not improve matters in regard to marriage breakdown.  On the contrary, the availability of divorce will inevitably discourage a couple from making constant efforts to ensure that their marriage will work. Thousands of people are struggling to make their marriages work.  If the amendment is passed they will not struggle very much to that end.  They will take the easy way out and avail of divorce.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment will make a mockery of the Constitution as it stands. The second family will automatically inherit the benefits of Article 41.1.2º, that is to say, the State will guarantee to protect the second family under the Constitution as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State.  The first family, who were indispensable to the welfare of the State and the nation, will be dissolved and replaced by another moral institution which will then become indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State.  This makes a complete farce of the Constitution.  I hope and trust that the commonsense and intelligence of the voters in relation to this matter will save our nation from the disastrous consequences of the amendment being passed.  People have said that it would be difficult to obtain a divorce; on the contrary, it will be the most liberal form of divorce in the world&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On reflection, I hope that the voters will see that this is not for the common good of the majority. <Col N="1299" /> We can help the minority in the many ways to which I referred earlier and save ourselves from the disastrous effects of divorce, as has happened in every other country where it has been introduced.  I hope that the voters will consider every aspect of the matter, that their judgment will be calm, reasoned and proper and that they will listen carefully to the sound advice which they will receive politically, economically and morally in relation to this grave decision which will affect generations to come.  This could change the whole face of society as we know it.  I support traditional, Christian values and I will help to save the country from the serious consequences of legislation which will enable divorce to smash family life and which will put many marriages on the rocks.</P>

    <P>With the greatest respect, Deputy Flanagan's point that we will have the most liberal form of divorce in the world is contrary to the facts.  It is one of the least liberal constitutional proposals compared to Catholic Spain or Italy where the proposals regarding divorce were far less restrictive and restricting.  However, I do not intend to engage in badinage or argy-bargy with any individual, group of individuals or institutions on this issue.  I intend to follow a consistent personal line in the matter.  I am for the proposal and I made a speech on this matter last November during the debate of the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I said then that, having said my piece in this regard, I would, for the benefit of the people, remain silent, and I am sure there will be loud rounds of applause on that account.  I do not intend to get involved in the subsequent arguments for or against the measure.  I will make my speech here this evening and contribute as best I can on Committee Stage in regard to improving, where possible, the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment.  I want my constituents and others who may be <Col N="1300" /> concerned to know where I stand on this issue and, having done so, I will leave the matter to the people to decide.  In 1986 the population are well able to make up their own minds without intrusion of political advice from any party.  I do not intend this to be a carping point, but the less said by politicians after the conclusion of the passage of this proposal the better.</P>
    <P>The confusion which I noticed in <i>The Irish Times, Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Press</i> this morning in relation to Fianna Fáil's position on this matter is very understandable.  For example, <i>The Irish Times</i> had a headline &mdash;&ldquo;FF joins Church in opposition to divorce.&rdquo;  I understand how that arose and I am in no way critical of the headline, but it does not face up to the facts or to the historical position taken by Fianna Fáil on this issue.  I heard my colleagues, in particular Deputy O'Hanlon, and my friend, Deputy Brian Lenihan, read into the record of the House the statement issued from the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party on 25 April 1986.  Deputy Lenihan was paraphrasing the statement and Deputy O'Hanlon was reading an excerpt from, the statement.  However, the statement should be recorded in full and I intend to quote it:</P>
    <P>At a specially convened meeting today, the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party considered the proposal of the Coalition Government to seek the approval of the people for the alteration of Article 41 of the Constitution in order to allow for the dissolution of marriages in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The party carefully considered all the many aspects and implications of this proposal and in particular its profound effect on the position of families and the nature and quality of our society.  They also had regard to the many different but sincerely held views in the community on this issue and decided that the question should be left to the people as a whole to decide. Accordingly, the party will not oppose, in the Dáil or Seanad, the proposal to hold a referendum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> Fianna Fáil hope that this important issue will be fully and responsibly assessed by the people and a wise decision arrived at after an informed and balanced debate, free of rancour or prejudice. To ensure that the debate does not take place along party political lines, Fianna Fáil have decided that the party will not campaign politically in the referendum.  Because, however, many members of the party feel deeply about the issue, individual Deputies and Senators will be free to participate personally in whatever way they wish in their individual capacities.</P>
    <P>The family, under the Constitution, is the natural primary and fundamental unit of society, which the State guarantees to protect.  The State is also pledged to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded.  Fianna Fáil are convinced that the stability of our society and the welfare of the individual can best be protected by adhering to these principles in the Constitution and will press the Government to implement, as a matter of urgency, a comprehensive programme of measures to support and sustain marriage and the family as outlined in the report of the Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, having regard to one statement made by a prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party yesterday, it is understandable that the headlines in the newspaper suggests that Fianna Fáil join the Church in opposition to divorce.  I assume the Church meant in the headline was the Catholic Church. However, that is not the position.  The statement from the parliamentary party speaks for itself and I stand by that statement. I am not speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  I am speaking on my own behalf and members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party who have spoken or will speak in this debate will not represent the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  They will represent their own positions.  As I understand the English language, and the interpretation <Col N="1302" /> of that statement issued by the parliamentary party, that is what that means and no individual, or individuals, will bind the party.  I hope I have made my position and that of the party clear.  I, and all other members who contribute on this matter, speak as individuals.  The formula, &ldquo;we in Fianna Fáil&rdquo; does not apply.  Individuals in Fianna Fáil who wish to contribute, speak for themselves but not for the party.  I hope that point has been taken.</P>
    <P>I welcome the sensitive approach which has been a feature of the discussion in recent weeks since the introduction of the Government's proposed legislation.  I do not have any objection to the Church issuing pastorals or messages from the pulpit on the matter.  The Bishops are entitled to do that.  In fact, they may have been in dereliction of their spiritual duty if they did not do that.  Let them issue their message.  Let us hear from the Catholic Church on the one hand, the Protestant Churches on the other and from our Jewish citizens.  I do not think there is any great objection to having the various Churches indicate their positions in relation to this divorce legislation.  They have an obligation to guide their people but they must distinguish, as Bishop Cassidy did, between abuse and use of the pulpit. They must distinguish between guidance and intimidation.  They must draw that important distinction.</P>
    <P>The Catholic Church have issued pastorals in the past, will issue a pastoral on Sunday and will issue pastorals in the future.  We look forward to the pastoral on Sunday and the pastorals the Bishops may have in mind for the future.  The Bishops are entitled to issue pastorals and I do not think we should be critical of the Church on that account.</P>
    <P>With regard to the anti-divorce lobby I should like to pay tribute to the sane and sound leadership of my friend and colleague, Senator Desmond Hanafin.  I know he takes an opposite view to mine but I respect his views.  I re-echo Senator Hanafin's hope that the debate will be conducted in a calm and dignified manner.  I do not want to see this debate break down like the pro-life amendment <Col N="1303" /> debate.  I do not want that to happen to the country any more and I hope that, arising out of the divisions and horror stories of how both sides acted during that campaign, we have matured enough since then to offer balanced arguments one way or the other.</P>
    <P>On another occasion I said that as a Catholic legislator I would much prefer that the legislation enacted by the Dáil reflected in essence Catholic morality as I understand it.  However, as I stated on that occasion, I was not elected to represent one religion but rather to represent all those of whatever different views, backgrounds or religions in this society who vote in Dáil elections.  That is reasonable.  I am not apologising for being a Roman Catholic.  I am not pretending other than that I am a Catholic, but is anybody seriously suggesting to me, in particular, the Catholic Church, that this is a Catholic Parliament for a Catholic people?  I do not think anybody can propose that or sustain the argument. I am not denying my Catholicity but I am rejecting the notion that I as a Catholic in this Legislature should be required to legislate for Catholics only.  For that reason I endeavour to reflect in my approach to legislation the changing attitudes and beliefs amongst Irish people to moral and social issues.</P>
    <P>While politicians may cast a jaundiced eye on opinion polls, nevertheless, I must not ignore the significant change to divorce reflected in those polls, particularly in the last 18 months.  May I hurriedly say that my views on this, or on any other matter, are not swayed one way or another by opinion polls.  When I reach a decision about an issue I generally stick to it unless I can be dissuaded otherwise. Opinion polls in recent months have been significantly in favour of the proposal before us.  According to the latest opinion poll, published in <i>The Sunday Press,</i> a majority of 58 per cent of the people are in favour of the Government's referendum.  According to that poll 60 per cent of voters would like the Catholic Church to play what could be described as a passive role in the divorce debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> Politicians ought to adopt a similar approach.  If ever there was a debate which should separate Church and State, politicians and individuals, this is such a debate.  The issues that arise in this debate are intensely personal and in many cases heartbreaking for the individuals concerned.  The last thing that should happen is that politicians should attempt to lay down general moral guidelines for the electorate at large.  At the end of the day it will be the individual moral conscience of the voter which will decide his or her approach to the referendum. For Catholics that approach may well be guided by the theology of their own Church but would also take into account the reality of broken marriages in Ireland today.  In not opposing the holding of the referendum Fianna Fáil are reflecting their sensitivity to the intensely personal nature of the issues which have to be debated in this House.  I said, in the course of my contribution in the House in November last, that if all political parties in this House were to refrain from making this a political matter, allowing the debate to develop from outside the Dáil rather than from within, there would be a realistic chance of the referendum being passed.  In that contribution I went on to appeal to the leaders of all political parties, including the Fianna Fáil Party, to encourage open and rational discussion of the matter rather than taking hard and fast positions for or against.  In some small way I believe I had an influence on the attitude adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party in their approach to this proposal. I am glad that during the course of a lengthy parliamentary party meeting the party arrived at this consensus &mdash; each individual to speak on his or her own account and, having done that, to stand back and let the people decide.  That is an utterly reasonable and principled position to take.</P>
    <P>I would make the same plea to all the different pressure groups involved in the debate outside this House, to refrain from making this a major Church/State conflict or an issue which would divide sections of the population for many years to come.  That is not to say that we should <Col N="1305" /> sit on the fence and say nothing.  As a politician I would be abrogating my responsibility, as one who has taken a stance on this issue, were I not to continue my support for a change.  I know there will be statistics bandied about, some seeking to show that the new family will have a stronger constitutional position than the old, as witnessed by the number of speakers who were against the provision.  Others will seek to establish that the children of a marriage where the parents have been divorced can never be properly provided for, as has already been contended by the anti-divorce lobby in the House.  Statistical arguments can be very convincing.  My good friend and colleague, Deputy Faulkner, a committed anti-divorce Member of the House, gave a fulsome statistical outline of what he considered to be the facts and statistics against divorce.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the argument against divorce is that it represents a threat to the stability of family life and, thereby, to the social fabric of the nation generally. The anti-divorce groups point to the rising incidence of divorce in other countries, tending to show that the institution of marriage is under greater threat than ever before.  Our Constitution is committed to the institution of marriage, more so than constitutions, written or unwritten, in other jurisdictions.  Article 41 of our Constitution pledges to guard with special care the institution of marriage. The rights of the family, recognised by the Constitution, are antecedent and superior to all positive law.  In my view the introduction of divorce need not be inconsistent with that pledge.  What will be necessary is that the extended or new family does not receive any greater protection or legal authority than the marriage or the children of the marriage which has been dissolved.  To achieve that the courts will have to be vigilant and vigorous in ensuring that proper provision is made for the dependent spouse and any child who is dependent on either spouse.  We could not allow a situation to arise in which any concept of illegitimacy by stealth or accident come to be attached to the first family of a divorced person by <Col N="1306" /> reason only of the fact that they are the first rather than the new family of such a person.  It will be necessary for the Government to go ahead with the proposed legislation to abolish the distinction between legitimacy and illegitimacy so that the concept of legitimate or illegitimate has no validity or meaning within Irish law or family life.  We will have to come to terms with the concept of an extended family in which the spouses of the new family have to accept a moral, social and financial relationship and commitment to the spouses and members of the first family.  This may seem to be a novel concept but, if proper provision is to be made for dependent spouses and children, as is provided for in the proposed amendment, then the concept of the extended family may well be the most compassionate and psychologically sensible way of approaching the problem.</P>
    <P>Many different propositions will be put in the course of this debate &mdash; that divorce casuses marital breakdown; divorce is merely a symptom of breakdown; divorce leads to a general lowering of moral standards and principles.  All of these issues have been the subject of debate for many years in other countries where divorce is commonplace.  From my reading of those debates there are no simple solutions or hard and fast answers.  William Duncan in his recent publication <i>The Case for Divorce in the Irish Republic</i> states that the weight of international evidence favours the view that divorce is merely a symptom of marriage breakdown.  He goes on to say that divorce bears the same relationship to marital breakdown as does a funeral to the fact of death, that divorce is the burial ceremony for a marriage which is dead, not the cause of its death.  He says that to deny divorce in an attempt to prevent marriages breaking down, is like forbidding funerals in the hope of eradicating the problem of death.</P>
    <P>We have already provided in our laws for decrees of separation, nullity, barring orders, maintenance orders, almost every other order which can be made in relation to a marriage, except divorce.  In other words, whether we like it or not, <Col N="1307" /> we already accept the concept of irretrievable breakdown of marriage in Ireland and, to the extent to which it is possible, we should therefore provide in our laws.  Why then should we not take the last step and accept that, where there is such an irretrievable breakdown of marriage, there should be divorce and the right to remarry for the spouses of broken marriages?</P>
    <P>It is a cruel concept to consign a young couple, or not so young couple, whose marriage has broken down to a single state for the rest of their lives where such a single state is not desired.  It is cruel, uncharitable and unfair to suggest that people cannot enter into a new relationship, the original one having broken down.  The God to whom we all pray, whether we be Catholic, Protestant, Ba-hai, Seventh-Day Adventist, Jew, whatever, is a compassionate, forgiving, concerned God.  He is a God whom I believe, in the final analysis, would forgive people whose first marriage has broken down for entering into a second one.  That is the sort of God I believe in, a God of love, of compassion.  I cannot envisage eternal damnation as the punishment for a second marriage, far from it, not from the God I believe in, the God I believe my Church asks me to believe in.</P>
    <P>It is easy to contend that lives or homes are destroyed by marriage, just as it is easy to say that the breakdown of a marriage causes the disruption of the life of a spouse or child and of the home.  We cannot avoid noticing that people form new relationships after broken marriages and have children by their new partners. Are we to condemn those people to a lifetime of illegal cohabitation and illegitimacy notwithstanding that, under our existing laws, we have fully accepted the fact that their previous marriage has irretrievably broken down?  The estimated figure of broken marriages in Ireland at present is 35,000.  That is not an insignificant number; it is a sufficiently large number to warrant attention.  Taking that figure as being correct and assuming that there are at least two children to each <Col N="1308" /> such marriage, we arrive at a figure of 140,000 persons affected by the consequences of marriage breakdown.  That is more than the population of Cork city or the combined population of, say, Galway, Waterford, Wexford and Dundalk. Therefore, it is manifestly absurd to suggest that a problem of national significance does not exist in the context of marital breakdown in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>I have seen the weekly lists in the courts dealing with maintenance, barring orders, separation and all other facets which make up the marriage jurisdiction of the Irish courts.  It would be a salutary lesson if politicians and members of the anti-divorce campaign were to take a look at what is happening in the area of marriage law here at the moment.  They would only have to question the beleagured practitioners about their experiences with broken marriages to discover very quickly the extent of the demand for the right to remarry amongst very many members of these broken marriages.</P>
    <P>There has been divorce in Northern Ireland for some years now, which has not led to a rampant abandonment of moral principles, or to a corruption of standards within the family.  Traditional family life and family unity are strong in Ireland and will not be any less so in the years ahead because the inevitable victims of broken marriages have the right to form new and trusting relationships. To make comparisons between Ireland and California is absurd.  The social and historical characteristics of our people are so different from those of the New World, the Western States of America that they will have little or no bearing on the way in which our moral standards will change or develop over the next generation.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate on contraception, we were told there would be large queues of young people outside every chemist shop where contraceptives were available.  Here again that did not happen.  The confusion which was predicted did not arise.  The young people at that time were not given credit for their intelligence, their decency, their upbringing. In the circumstances of this proposal, <Col N="1309" /> those who are suggesting that young people will avail of divorce who are in strong and stable marriages at present are doing an injustice to that generation. They are being unfair.</P>
    <P>In 1966 the Law Commission in England commenting on rising divorce figures stated:</P>
    <P>These figures can reflect the fact that a growing segment of society is coming to regard divorce as more respectable than other outcomes of a broken marriage. They are therefore important figures for sociologists and people responsible for social policy, but they do not give cause for believing that morality is being corrupted in England, still less that it is the divorce law that is the corrupting agent.</P>
    <P>By and large, there is a high moral climate for religious belief and observance in Ireland.  To argue that in the final run, in an already extensive jurisdiction for the victims of broken marriage, divorce will lead to unlimate decay and disaster is unsustainable.  We should support this proposed referendum and ensure by our actions and our laws, our examples and our history, that the strength rather that the weaknesses of human individuals in marriage are encouraged and maintained.</P>
    <P>I am a practising Catholic and have been married for over 22 years.  I believe very strongly in the strength of the family unit in society and my hope is that my marriage will continue until death do us part and that my children will themselves marry and have stable relationships with their partners in their turn, for life. Whilst a Catholic, nevertheless my role is as a legislator for the whole community, irrespective of the various religions.  In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, I have come into contact mainly with my co-religionists, having regard to their majority situation, but also with the various Protestant Churches and with my Jewish constituents.  The Ba-hai religion adherents no later than two weeks ago made me a presentation of a tract.  These are a group of people very severely and <Col N="1310" /> seriously persecuted by the Ayatollah in Iran.  They are members of the community which I represent.  I have met with the Seventh Day Adventists and with people of no religion or no religious beliefs.  That is the type of Legislature which we should be seen to be.</P>
    <P>My attitude to republicanism is that, whilst we in this political party, Fianna Fáil, bow to the shrine of a Protestant republican on the one hand, we should be seen to be representative of all classes and creeds.  That is fundamental to my republicanism.  I believe it is fundamental to the republicanism which was given to us by the founder of the Fianna Fáil Party, Mr. de Valera, by men like Mr. MacEntee, Mr. Lemass, Mr. Frank Aiken and so many others &mdash; great men all.  That sort of republic is the type of Ireland that they would like to see.</P>
    <P>My mother was a practising republican and so was my father, in the best sense. They brought us up in a tradition of possibly old fashioned liberalism.  That old fashioned liberalism continues to be my consistent and sustained philosophy, based on the equality of man and woman, on the concept of equal opportunity and on the ideal of merit winning out, that people should be rewarded for their endeavours rather than penalised for doing well for themselves.  In other words, the philosophy of the begrudger was never part of my upbringing or my philosophy.  Envy did not enter into it but rather in our circumstances we were proud if any of our family succeeded, or our cousins, and where our friends and neighbours were successful, whatever their calling, we were proud of and glad for them.  That is the sort of Ireland that I would like to leave for my children and grandchildren.</P>
    <P>I have a very strong belief in the marriage bond.  We are not talking about a proposal which is compelling people to divorce.  As Deputy Flanagan has said, if his figure is correct, 94 per cent of marriages in this country are successful and I have no doubt that 94 per cent will continue to be successful, with or without divorce, with or without this proposal. Fundamentally, I believe in the family <Col N="1311" /> unit.  It is &ldquo;the family&rdquo; against the rest. We all love our own children but we are not obliged to love other children.  The family is the fundamental unit in our society.  It is a tremendously important sustaining factor in any society, strong family unit.</P>
    <P>Having been in Mainland China, I suggest that a people who believe very deeply in this concept are the Chinese, not only in the immediate family but the extended family.  They have a wonderful concept of family life, despite the fact that they are Communists, have Communist beliefs and do not believe in any religion.  They have this wonderful feeling for the family.  Mao has done a lot for China since the warlords were driven out ahead of his marching armies in 1949.</P>
    <P>Divorce is not compulsory.  It is like censorship, which happily is not that great a burden on the Irish people anymore, but we can engage in self-censorship. If I do not want to listen to Mr. Gay Byrne in the morning, I can turn off the radio and if I do not want to look at the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on a Friday night, I can turn it off.  Equally I can leave them on.  These are all decisions to be made by the individual concerned.  We are all adults.  There are those who say that marriage is not dissoluble.  If that is so, can they tell me why it is annullable?  On one hand, the Church can annul marriages and on the other hand the civil law of the State does not allow divorce.  These are questions that must be answered.  I believe that in a democracy divorce is a civil right, quite simply.  You can accept it or you can reject it.</P>
    <P>It is underestimating the intelligence of the people not to have the proposed amendment of the Constitution.  If I were to be absolutely honest about it, it is a provision I would not have put into the Constitution in 1937, in which case, we would not be discussing this proposal now.  I am certain that the Constitution of 1937 strengthened the fabric of our society and set standards for the society in which we are living today.  Its advantages continue to be apparent.  It would have made no difference whatever to the strong fabric of the society in which we <Col N="1312" /> are living today had the 1937 Constitution not have contained the divorce provision.</P>
    <P>I happened to have been a member of the New Ireland Forum and a signatory to its report as were the following: Charles J. Haughey TD; Brian Lenihan TD; Gerry Collins TD; Eileen Lemass TD; Ray MacSharry TD; Rory O'Hanlon TD; Jim Tunney TD; John Wilson TD; Garret FitzGerald TD, Taoiseach; Peter Barry TD, Minister for Foreign Affairs; Myra Barry TD; Senator James Dooge; Paddy Harte TD; John Kelly TD; Enda Kenny TD; Maurice Manning TD; Dick Spring TD, Tánaiste and Minister for Energy; Frank Cluskey TD; Senator Stephen McGonagle; Frank Prendergast TD; Mervyn Taylor TD; John Hume MP, MEP; Séamus Mallon &mdash; now thankfully an MP; Austin Currie; Joe Hendron; E. K. McGrady with the various substitutes. All of these individuals of all different political persuasions put their names to this report.  The report at page 27, paragraph 5.2 (6) states:</P>
    <P>Civil and religious liberties and rights must be guaranteed and there can be no discrimination or preference in laws or administrative practices, on grounds of religious belief or affiliation; government and administration must be sensitive to minority beliefs and attitudes and seek consensus.</P>
    <P>Surely, that is what we are about here today: we are seeking a consensus.  That is what the New Ireland Forum calls for. That is what I along with these individuals who signed the report believe it means.</P>
    <P>Chapter X of the Report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown in connection with divorce states:</P>
    <P>The Committee is of the opinion that:</P>
    <P>The referendum should be held in relation to the question whether the Oireachtas should be empowered to introduce divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>Any such referendum should be in a positive format, replacing the present Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution with a provision, specifically authorising the <Col N="1313" /> Oireachtas to legislate for the dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>Any such amendment should be drafted in such a way as to ensure that the basic emphasis of Article 41 is not altered, in that the Article should continue to place a duty on the State to protect the family and the institution of marriage and to recognise the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society.</P>
    <P>If any such referendum should be held and should be passed:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the referendum is going to be held and hopefully it will be passed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  A situation of divorce on demand would not be appropriate in this country and would not be acceptable to the people.</P>
    <P>(b)  It is essential that adequate safeguards must be built into any divorce legislation to take account of the State interest in fostering and protecting marriage and the family.</P>
    <P>(c)  It is essential that any divorce legislation should make proper provision for the protection of the dependent spouses and the welfare of dependent children who might be affected by the grant of a decree of divorce.</P>
    <P>(d)  Any such divorce legislation should be based on the concept of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>(e)  A decree of judicial separation should be a first step whereby a person could apply after a fixed period of time, from the granting of a Judicial Separation, for a decree of divorce.</P>
    <P>We run straight across to the proposal before the Dáil.  That reflects exactly the proposal under the heading of divorce in the Report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  Who are the signatories to that report: <i>Dáil Members:</i> Myra Barry, Eileen Desmond, Dick Dowling, Pádraig Flynn, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, Mary Harney, Willie O'Brien, Rory O'Hanlon, Alan Shatter, Madeline Taylor-Quinn, Michael Woods; <i>Seanad <Col N="1314" /> Members:</i> Katharine Bulbulia, Tras Honan, Thomas Hussey, Catherine I B McGuinness and Mary T W Robinson.</P>
    <P>The constitutional proposal, therefore arises almost directly fully clothed from the proposal of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I find very little wrong with the verbiage of the proposal, very little.  I do not know whether we as a party can genuinely offer amendments when the Bill comes to be discussed in committee.  If one examines the proposal &mdash; I shall not quote it as that would be wasting parliamentary time &mdash; there is only one area where I would imagine difficulty may arise.  I have no doubt that that difficulty will be dealt with by the Minister concerned on Committee Stage. It is the question, what is the meaning of the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo;?  How does the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; present itself in this proposal? Apart from that the proposal as a whole could be submitted to the people and, in those circumstances, we as politicians should stand back from the debate. Obviously, the Government have taken the decision that they will involve themselves in the debate.  Personally, I think it is the wrong decision.  It is a decision that will raise more problems than it will solve.  The Government are entering into a divisive situation, which is unfortunate. Fianna Fáil have taken the right decision in their attitude to this debate.  It is a principle decision and the proper one.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by quoting from the 1967 Report of the Committee on the Constitution where the question of divorce was raised.  I happened to be a member of that committee.  I had the honour and the privilege of sitting with some great persons in the history of this House.  Even at that time these individuals were discussing a proposal to do away with the religious bias against divorce and to allow the minority religions to practise in accordance with their religious views in the context of divorce. I quote from page 46, paragraph 129:</P>
    <P>The opinion has been expressed that these provisions constitute discrimination on the grounds of religious profession or belief within the meaning of <Col N="1315" /> Article 44.2.3º and that at least the penal provisions of the existing code will be declared not to have been carried over under the Constitution.  We recommend that this difficulty be removed by adding a suitable provision to this part of the Constitution to the effect that the prohibition on religious discrimination shall not prevent the enactment of different procedural rules relating to different kinds of marriage ceremonies with a view to ensuring that all legal rules are complied with by the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>With respect to all of us at that time, the solution was, to say the least of it, impractical but it was a genuine effort on a very seriously considered topic and subject and a very seriously offered solution to a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that, like the committee of the New Ireland Forum, the Committee on the Constitution sat for over a year. It was constituted in August 1966 when Mr. Lemass was Taoiseach.  It reported on 14 December 1967.  It is also interesting to look at the names on that committee.  They included the late Don Davern, my friend and colleague, who served initially but who was happily promoted to Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture.  He made way for Mr. Lemass, who ceased to be Taoiseach in September 1966.  I attended the parliamentary party meeting which elected Mr. Jack Lynch as Taoiseach. The names on the constitutional review committee were: George Colley, Chairman, David Andrews, James Dooge, Seán Dunne, Denis F. Jones, Seán F. Lemass, Robert M. Molloy, Michael O'Kennedy, Thomas F. O'Higgins, Eoin Ryan, Gerard Sweetman and James Tully.  It cannot be gainsaid that these people who were in some instances the founders of our nation, seriously considered and tackled the problem which is now confronting us.  I commend to anybody the chapter in their report dealing with marriage.  It is worth reading, evaluating and translating from that period, <Col N="1316" /> 1967 to 1986.  It would be a valuable piece of research.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by repeating that I will give the benefit of my silence to the Irish people.  When the debate is concluded in this House and in the Seanad I will wait for referendum day, go to my local polling booth in Blackrock and vote for the constitutional amendment.</P>

      <P>It is a source of particular satisfaction to me, and I am sure to many Members of the House, that this debate is taking place.  After a great deal of debate and soul-searching the Government have published their Bill to amend the Constitution and to remove the prohibition on divorce.  They have simultaneously announced our proposals for dealing with the dissolution of marriage.  Though I welcome the contribution of my colleague, Deputy David Andrews, and though I was very pleased with his support for the measure, I would not necessarily go the whole road with him in his suggestion that we should depoliticise this whole debate, that we should pacify it, simply state our views and then go to our beds and await the result.  It was a deliberate political decision of this House in 1937 that enshrined in the Constitution a particular aspect of Catholic social policy what was then perceived to be Irish national aspirations.  Those who voted for the 1937 Constitution in this House were expressing a view of Irish life and the way they wanted Irish life to be at the time. It meant to Deputies something extraordinarily deep and personal.  It was that political dedication which gave us divorce prohibition in our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am 51 years of age today.  When my parents got married in 1932 they came to Dublin to the Eucharistic Congress.  My father was a founder member of Fianna Fáil.  As a Cork man he had a particular affection for Michael Collins but he was still opposed to the Treaty generally.  He always had a great respect for the 1922 Constitution.  Being a member of the Republican Movement at the time he had been banned from the sacraments.  He went to the sacraments in 1932 when <Col N="1317" /> he attended the Eucharistic Congress. There was no divorce at that time.  He often said to me, and he was very adamant about it, that Michael Collins had a much more liberal view of Irish society and that Michael Collins did not claim to enshrine in the Constitution a positive lordship over Northern Ireland which was enshrined in the 1937 Constitution. Therefore, I come to the conclusion that we, the politicians, enshrined the divorce prohibition in the Constitution.  We cannot now say that we want to change it and leave it to the people and walk away saying that is our day's work done. We have to explain to the Irish people why we want that change.  To that extent we have to campaign in a rational and a reasonable way and give our views in that regard.  I have no desire overly to politicise the issue.  If we truly believe that there is a real need for change we must go to the people in the next five or six weeks and explain the depth of our approach for change.</P>
    <P>Equally it is very wrong to say that it is not a Church versus State versus Oireachtas versus political conflict. Unfortunately it is.  There is a serious clash of views.  Just as the Irish Constitution in 1937 reflected the finite ultimate viewpoint of Irish Catholic sociology, today we are trying to draw back from that global enshrinement.  The proposal is being vigorously and trenchantly opposed in a very definite way by the Catholic Church.  To that extent there is a conflict as to what kind of society we want to shape in Ireland for the year 2000 and for decades thereafter.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything wrong with a conflict of that kind, but to shy away from such a conflict is the age old Irish capacity to look at things and all problems from 55 different directions and in the end become so bemused that we do not know where we are.  To some degree, that is endemic in this House. Last evening I met a fellow Deputy, an esteemed colleague, and I said to him: &ldquo;What way do you think it is going?&rdquo; He said to me: &ldquo;It will be very tight, very narrow.  I do not believe in those opinion polls at all.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;What way do you <Col N="1318" /> feel about it yourself?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I am supporting it.  I am definitely in favour of the change.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;What do you think the result will be in your own constituency?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I think it will work out two to one against.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I am sorry to say that, but I think that is the way it will work out.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Are you going to send out an old circular or a letter to the members of your own organisation?&rdquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do not think so.&rdquo;  I asked him why and he replied: &ldquo;It would be as good as my seat might be worth in the next election, but I want to tell you I am in favour of the change.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Are you going to campaign?&rdquo; He said he would not.</P>
    <P>If that is the measure of commitment to change given by those who have a commitment to change I am afraid it is not a commitment that will bring acceptance in the referendum.  I am in favour of it and I suggest to colleagues in the House who are in favour of the change that they have a democratic parliamentary responsibility, by virtue of their election to the House, to go out, to meet their constituents and explain to them why they have this personal viewpoint. Therefore, I find it extraordinary that on the Second Stage of the Bill when general principles are being debated the Leader of the Opposition should give himself a Strasbourgian and a Parisian silence, an exemption from stating his views.</P>

In any other Parliament, on issues of capital punishment or major questions of the day, the leaders would state their personal views without hesitation. By doing so they would not impose their views on their party membership.</P>

      <P>Political power and electoral popularity in Ireland become an all consuming objective in Dáil Éireann. I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have decided to give the people an opportunity to vote on whether or not to remove the constitutional prohibition on divorce.  The people will decide whether or not they want divorce as a final resort for spouses in broken marriages.  They will also be voting on the wider issue of what kind of society they wish to see develop on this island.  The Irish people will have an historic opportunity to shape the social and political development of this country for perhaps a generation.  The manner in which we as a people respond to this opportunity will say a great deal about <Col N="1320" /> our ability to face reality, our true concern about the rights of people in both parts of this island and our maturity as a political democracy.</P>
    <P>Building a consensus that something must be done to reform marriage law in Ireland has been a long and difficult process.  The Labour Party have been in the forefront of the struggle.  In the lifetime of this Dáil alone, there have been four attempts to initiate action to deal with the problem of marital breakdown. The Labour Party were responsible for three of the four Bills tabled. Although the Bills did not succeed, they served the purpose of concentrating the mind of the Dáil on the problem and of educating public opinion about the need for change.</P>
    <P>We spent much time in Government in recent months framing the complementary proposals to put before the people and in this connection the work of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown was of enormous assistance.  In addition, the contribution of the Attorney General was outstanding.  Acting entirely as a law adviser to the Government and not in a political capacity, his advice and guidance have been of enormous help and I wish to put that on record.</P>
    <P>Those who support the introduction of divorce risk the accusation of being anti-family and anti-marriage.  That glib, facile smear is all pervasive against those who wish to see change.  I find it disturbing because it is far from being the truth. It is from a profound sympathy with those families who are trapped in broken marriages and of those families who are forced to exist outside of marriage that I advocate divorce.  I do not go for the hypocrisy of annulments, giving a cloak of sanctity to further liaisons.  That is theological hypocrisy that I as a Catholic, a legislator and, more particularly as a married person, find patronising, repulsive and unacceptable.  Above all else, the annulment process, the criteria used and the ultimate agreement to granting the annulment are, in my view, destructive of marriage.  It is the kind of divorce I do not want to see here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> All of us would prefer to live in a society in which every family was happy and every marriage a success but we know that, despite good intentions, marriage vows and the force of legal and social sanctions, marriages break down. No amount of theological analyses, the application of social principles or a veneer of compassion can eliminate the fact that marriages break down, irretrievably, irrevocably and in totality.  I find it difficult to understand how people cannot accept that simple human reality.  Needless to remark, in this House we are so anxious to save our seats we are afraid to admit that fact publicly and to say that something should be done.  That is political hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Marriages have always broken down. They broke down before 1937 and they have broken down since then but in the past economic and social pressures kept the parties in a failed marriage under the same roof.  There are people today in psychiatric hospitals who are in a state of perpetual trauma and who have suffered as a result of broken marriages.  There are people in hospitals today who are the children of such marriages, who have never known a shred of happiness and who are not capable of responding to any human relationship.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing willingness of parties in a failed marriage to split up, to form second relationships in some cases and to have second families.  There is no need for divorce in a society in which the partners in a failed marriage stay together through thick and thin but there is need for divorce in a society where the parties in unhappy marriages break up and form new unions not recognised by law.  At present these informal unions and families are outside the scope and protection of the law and Members of this House know only too well the appalling lack of protection afforded them.  As the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown pointed out, not only is the law being brought into disrepute, but the situation is &ldquo;harsh, unnecessary and unjust&rdquo; to the parties in such relationships.</P>
    <P>In the view of the committee, simple legislative reforms cannot adequately <Col N="1322" /> solve the problems at present experienced by parties in such relationships, one or both of whom may still be legally married to another person.  For example, let us consider the question of illegitimacy. I am very pleased we published the Bill relating to illegitimacy but I am deeply disturbed that Members of this House, and one Member in particular, should find even that Bill objectionable.  However, it has wide support and it will remove as far as possible the discrimination suffered by illegitimate children. Short of abolishing the concept of marriage itself, children born out of wedlock cannot be equal in all respects to children born in marriage.  There is one way to allow the majority of children affected to have the status of legitimate children and that is to allow their parents to remarry. The current prohibition on divorce prevents many such parents from regularising their own, and their children's status.</P>
    <P>The choice is clear.  We can continue to do nothing on the basis that the legal concept of indissolubility of marriage is more important than giving formal legal protection to an increasing number of families, or we can face the reality of marriage breakdown in our society and provide a mechanism whereby the parties in a failed marriage and involved in second unions can have redress and protection at law.  Of course, there are risks associated with the introduction of divorce.  An examination of the wording shows how difficult it is to frame a proposition to put before the House but we must not underestimate the risks of doing nothing.  Just as banning funerals will not abolish death, a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the referendum will not abolish marriage breakdown. If the Government's proposals are rejected, legislators and citizens will continue to be asked to respect laws that are incapable of dealing adequately with marriage breakdown and the formation of families outside marriage.</P>
    <P>The proposed referendum will give the majority of Irish people an opportunity to vote on the kind of political democracy they wish to see develop in this island. The present prohibition on divorce in the <Col N="1323" /> Constitution conflicts with what a significant minority of people on this island consider to be a civil right.  The Oireachtas joint committee pointed out that representatives of most of the minority religions sincerely believe that the current constitutional position discriminates against members of their Churches and religion.  The minority Churches believe in the indissolubility of marriage but yet see no contradiction in allowing divorce as a civil right.  Is the legal concept of the indissolubility of marriage more important than the principle of respecting the rights of minorities?</P>
    <P>I ask this question in the context of the whole island because it raises the issue of what kind of society we want to see develop North and South.  Is it a society in which each community stands behind its principles and shouts &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; or is it a society in which each community accommodates the viewpoint of the other and the legal system guarantees the civil rights of each?  The choice for Irish people is a difficult one.  God knows we are not known for our ability to compromise.  Yet the very survival of civilised living on this island depends on all parties agreeing to disagree and simultaneously respecting the rights of others.</P>
    <P>John Hume has rightly argued that divorce should not be introduced in the Republic simply because it exists in the North.  The people of the Republic he argues must decide for themselves whether or not to permit divorce.  Few are naive enough to believe that the introduction of divorce in the Republic would persuade the Unionists to look with more favour on their Catholic neighbours.</P>
    <P>However, in the proposed referendum we cannot ignore the implications of a decision to maintain the constitutional prohibition on divorce for our aspiration to bring peace and stability to this island. A &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote will re-affirm the traditional view of southern society that one moral principle of one Church, the indissolubility of marriage, is more important than the moral principle of fundamental respect for the rights of others.  A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will, on the other hand, be a vote in <Col N="1324" /> favour of a new Ireland with which all traditions may identify.  The stakes are much higher in the referendum than simply tackling the problems caused by marital breakdown.  They are fundamental and long term.</P>
    <P>The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill tackles the problem of marital breakdown, in the Government's view, in a highly responsible and practical way. The Bill will include in the Constitution certain minimum provisions which must be complied with before a dissolution of marriage can be granted.</P>
    <P>Thank God, there is a contrast between the Minister for Justice and the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice because the Irish are anti-intellectual. We detest people with clarity of mind. We would like a degree of mutual confusion. That was epitomised by our colleague, Deputy Woods.  Deputy Dukes, whether as Minister for Justice, Minister for Finance or an esteemed colleague in Government, has spelled out with clarity of mind what this Bill means and does not mean.  He is not suffering in any way from the monumental incompetent analysis given by the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Justice.  I preferred to listen on the monitor rather than stay in the House because I could fortify myself with miscellaneous language while confusion mounted on confusion during such contributions. I say that with respect to a colleague&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The dissolution can only be granted by a court of law.  The court must be satisfied that the marriage has failed, the failure must have continued for a period of at least five years, all reasonable possibility of reconciliation <Col N="1325" /> must have been tried and the court must be satisfied that adequate and proper provision has been made for any dependent spouse and child.  If passed, the parameters for divorce legislation will be established in the Constitution and can only be changed by a referendum.  All secondary legislation on marriage dissolution must comply with the parameters laid down in the Constitution and while it may be more restrictive, it cannot be more liberal.</P>
      <P>While the concept of dissolution of marriage will be new to the Irish legal system, the procedures which the Government have proposed for deciding on applications builds closely on existing legal provisions for separation.</P>
      <P>The Government's proposals for divorce proceedings incorporate the best practice in other countries regarding divorce.  As far as I am aware, the proposals for State supported reconciliation and conciliation services are far in advance of those available in most other countries.</P>
      <P>Some have criticised the restrictive nature of the conditions to be included in the Constitution.  Five years of separation is a long time for a couple to wait.  However, what is five years compared to the present life sentence?  It is also appropriate that the minimum conditions for granting a divorce should be enshrined in the Constitution given the reservations which most Irish people have about divorce.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the minimum conditions for divorce set out in the Bill are overly restrictive.  I believe that the Bill and the Government's proposals for subsequent divorce legislation strike the right note between the need for legislation to regularise the consequences of marriage breakdown and the justifiable fear of many Irish people of divorce on demand.  In the words of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, the proposals represent &ldquo;the balance of social good&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More serious criticism has come from those who believe that the Bill and the Government's proposals are too liberal. In particular, it is suggested that the grounds on which divorce will be allowed <Col N="1326" /> are amongst the most advanced and unrestricted in the world.  The implication is that the Government are proposing divorce on demand.  That is not so.</P>
    <P>The proposed grounds for divorce are advanced in the sense of enlightened but that does not mean that divorce will be unrestricted.  The grounds are advanced because Ireland, coming so late in the day to divorce, is able to learn from the experience of other countries and to avoid their mistakes.  The Government could have opted for a system in which a divorce could only be granted where one spouse proved that the other spouse had destroyed the marriage.  We could have gone down that road.  Such proceedings, in the experience of other countries, are acrimonious, degrading and, as we all know from reading those appalling English newspapers when growing up, an invasion of marital privacy.  It is for this reason that in the past 20 years the divorce legislation of many countries has been reformed to recognise that most marriages fail, not because of a fault by one or other of the couple, but usually through the actions or inactions of both.</P>
    <P>That is why we use the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; which is of critical importance in this Bill rather than the concept of breakdown, and I have no doubt that that will be elaborated on and analysed in great depth on Committee Stage.  The concept of marriage failure or irretrievable marriage breakdown has, therefore, become an increasingly common feature of the divorce jurisdictions of many countries. Few would disagree that irretrievable breakdown as grounds for divorce is an advance in many respects of those associated with earlier divorce law.  To argue, therefore, that the proposed grounds for divorce in this country are advanced is not to say that divorce will be unrestricted.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, the constitutional provisions will ensure that we will have one of the most restrictive divorce regimes of any country.  We have been told that it will be easier to divorce a spouse than to dismiss an employee.  This is nonsense. Our labour laws provide considerable protection for employees but so far no one has proposed that, before an <Col N="1327" /> employer dismisses any worker, he should seek a formal separation from a court for a minimum of five years, that he engage in reconciliation and conciliation procedures and that he make adequate provision for the dependent spouse and children of the worker.  It is hard to see how any more restrictive parameters for divorce could be included in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is argued that if divorce is introduced, the legal concept of a permanent, indissoluble marriage and family home will be revoked and marriage will become a temporary arrangement at the mercy of one partner.  I suggest that these arguments are more concerned with legal niceties than the reality of marriage in Ireland today.  Despite the legal concept of the indissolubility of marriage, marriages are breaking down and increasingly informal families are being formed outside marriage.  The reality is that growing numbers of people do not consider the legal concept of the indissolubility of marriage as an overriding consideration in their private lives.  The legal concept of a permanent marriage is not preventing marriage breakdown.  The prohibition on divorce is preventing informal families from benefiting from the legal protection which our society affords to families based on marriage.</P>
    <P>I am Minister for Health and within the Department of Health resides the office of the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages and one of the things which deeply disturbs me in the context of family social support in this country is the increasing number of young people who could not care less what we are talking about in this House and who could not care less what Church or what registrar is involved or what a marriage or birth certificate even consists of.  I suggest that all of those who are now wringing their pious hands about the alleged dissolution of Irish society should examine the number of ordinary returns of marriages being enacted in our Churches and in our civil registry offices and they will notice that there is a decline.  It is visible; it is evidential; it is documented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> There are also the several thousand additional liaisons every year where there is no regard for the law, where there is general disenchantment and disengagement, an informal marriage setup &mdash; and it is a marriage by whatever definition; people have a marital relationship.  I am gravely concerned that the social emissions from that situation and the impact on children of such families &mdash; because they are families, informal as they may be &mdash; will be such that our health services, our social support systems, our legal system will not be able to cope with the major problems of succession in the future and will face such difficulty that we will all be regarded in the relatively short term as being somewhat irrelevant by those families, and the impact on society will be entirely destructive.</P>
    <P>That is one very valid argument and I strongly hold that divorce for such families, and the bringing in of an updated process and body of law, will give fundamental protection to those children and to those individuals who, for one reason or another, with the changing attitude in society and particularly with the emancipation of women in society, now have an opportunity in the eighties to make up their own mind on very many issues rather than having social norms and legislative processes imposed on them.  This is something which, of course, is extremely difficult to argue but I suggest it is something which we must bear in mind when we talk about divorce in our society.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Justice has pointed out, the introduction of divorce will not define all marriages as dissoluble.  Under the Government's proposals marriages may be dissolved in law only in very restricted circumstances.  I trust that the Irish people in the year 2000 will not regard us as being enormously restrictive on their personal liberties.  But at this point in time it is the best constitutional protection we can afford to such families in the State itself.  Accordingly, I reject &mdash; and this is a personal view which I do not propose to impose on everybody &mdash; the assertion that divorce will have a devastating effect on the constitutional rights <Col N="1329" /> and the protection of every married family in the State.</P>
    <P>In particular it has been suggested that, if divorce were permitted, the focus of the constitutional guarantees for families based on marriage would switch to the second marriage.  I am no lawyer but this argument seems strange to me.  The Constitution obliges the State to protect families based on marriage.  If divorce is introduced, the State would surely be obliged to protect equally the interests of all families founded on marriage, whether first or second.</P>
    <P>Divorce, unlike annulment, does not have the effect of establishing that a marriage never existed.  A marriage which ends in divorce was a valid marriage. It does not go through the hypocrisy of annulment which says that the marriage never existed.  That is a piece of theological hair-splitting I have never been able to understand.  A marriage which ends in divorce was a valid marriage for the period it lasted and therefore is entitled to the continuous protection of the State where necessary.</P>
    <P>It is also argued that divorced wives would lose rights under the Succession Acts.  Less attention has been paid to the rights of divorced husbands under the Acts.  The Government realise that dependent spouses and children have special needs in relation to maintenance, financial and otherwise.  For this reason, the amendment Bill proposes to write into the Constitution that a condition for the granting of any divorce is that the dependent spouse and children are protected.</P>
    <P>If during divorce procedures property is divided in such a manner that is fair and leaves the dependent spouse and children in reasonable comfort, there is no need for any succession rights on death because the claims would have been made at the time of the divorce proceedings. As the Minister for Justice pointed out yesterday, a normal feature of existing separation agreements is a renunciation by each spouse of his or her succession rights on the death of the other.  The Government's proposals contain no departure from existing practice <Col N="1330" /> in this respect.  On the contrary, changes outlined by the Minister for Justice will strengthen the hand of the Family Court to protect the interest of a dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>Of great concern to me and to many other Deputies, is the effect divorce will have on the children of the divorcing parents.  There is little doubt that the decision of parents to separate is a traumatic one for children.  It is, however, the fact of separation not divorce itself which upsets children &mdash; separation itself is the real impacting point. Research findings on the effect of separation by parents on children is complicated by the fact that the research has been carried out in countries in which separation and divorce are synonymous. We have not carried out extensive research in this country on the effect on children of parents separating.  As Minister for Health I know there is no reason to believe that the trauma is any different for children whose parents separate in acrimonious circumstances.  Allowing separated couples to dissolve formally their marriages is unlikely to increase the shock of separation for their children. Nor does a comparison between the estimated number of broken marriages and the experience of divorce in Northern Ireland suggest that the introduction of divorce in this jurisdiction will increase the number of children affected by broken marriages.  The granting of a right to remarry will, however, give a greater sense of stability to the many informal families which now exist and particularly to their children.  The right to remarry will increase the sense of security for many children born into informal families, as well as removing the stigma of illegitimacy.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we would be unwise to introduce divorce to this country because we do not know the effect it will have for good or evil in our society.  I have no doubt that there will be unforeseen consequences of a decision to remove the constitutional prohibition on divorce.  However, we cannot ignore the consequences of doing absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> We would not have arrived at our debate today if there was not a growing recognition that the present situation was no longer tolerable and that the good of society demanded reform.  We must face up to the problem of marital breakdown in our society, to the need to reform our marriage laws and to the challenge of creating a society which reflects the shared values of all civilised people.  This sense that something must be done is, to judge from the two most recent opinion polls, shared by a significant majority of Irish people.  They are rightly concerned that there should be no divorce on demand and that divorce be granted only under the kind of restrictions which the Government propose to include in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am not foolish enough to predict the good or evil consequences of any change in legislation.  According to my assessment and my conscience, I can only take that decision of giving support here today.  I urge Deputies to speak to their constituents on this matter in the weeks ahead.  The public are no longer prepared to tolerate the evils of the present situation and I believe that on mature reflection there will be majority support for the Government's proposals on referendum day.  Those who favour the change should not assume that there will necessarily be a majority on polling day.  We will have to explain ourselves to the people, campaign for the positive referendum vote. We will have to do so unremittingly between now and referendum day because to do less would be to deny our fundamental responsibility as Members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation proposes to change the Constitution by removing the absolute ban on divorce and inserting in its place the provisions set out in the Bill.  The Minister spoke about people outside beginning to think that this House was a bit of an irrelevancy and that politicians were irrelevant.  He made that remark when he was speaking about people who formed liaisons and who have no intention of marrying.  The point he <Col N="1332" /> was making was totally irrelevant to the Bill under discussion which involves the right to remarry.  If people are not interested in getting married at all, I do not see why the Minister should be so concerned about them in the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's contribution, abetted by interjections from Deputy Kelly.  By his presence here this evening it appears he has changed his mind because in a radio interview he said he hoped this type of Bill would not be brought before the House this side of a general election.  Presumably he has changed his mind because of electoral consequence.  I look forward to his contribution as an eminent constitutional lawyer under whom I studied.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the result of the extensive work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee which was set up to consider marriage and family life, to examine the problems which followed the breakdown of marriage and to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas thereon.  In the debate on that report last November, December and January, it became clear that there were many points of consensus.  As it was an all-party committee, one would have expected it to get immediate priority from the Government in implementing reforms which sought the protection of marriage and of family life.  One of the points discussed in that report was divorce.  This Bill is a result of the deliberations of that committee and the discussions which have taken place since then with interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, there are many points of consensus in that report.  The Government claim &mdash; and I am sure they believe &mdash; they are upholding the status of marriage in our society but they have not seen fit at this time in bringing forward this Bill, which forms only part of their deliberations, to implement many positive proposals decided upon unanimously by that committee.  They have spoken about the need to ensure the recognition in our educational system of the importance of relationships and personal development, something which could be implemented by a positive decision by the <Col N="1333" /> Government in that regard.  They have spoken of the importance of pre-marriage counselling.  Deputy Shatter, in his contribution on that report in this House, spoke about the hope that the State would encourage pre-marriage counselling, would fund it and provide whatever resources were available to ensure that it would continue to do its work on a basis even more widespread than at present.  It would serve to help existing marriages which have not yet reached the stage we are speaking about here tonight, failure for a period of five years.  Therefore, many things can be done to help existing marriages.  I hope that the Government, being sincere about the matter, will not just emphasise this aspect, which I do not wish to diminish, but will assure us that they will give equal attention to helping and supporting the vast majority of marriages which have their everyday ups and downs but are sources of happiness to the partners in them.</P>
    <P>Some work is now to be done on other points of consensus.  The statement of intent of the Government resulting from the publication of this Bill concerns legislation to raise the age of marriage, and I welcome that.  I welcome also the fact that mediation and conciliation services will be available in a new family court structure to deal with this problem, which is difficult and traumatic for the people involved, to try to diminish the adversarial, confrontational approach that exists at the moment for those prepared to go through the cumbersome procedure of obtaining judicial separations or to go through the detailed discussions involved in drawing up separation agreements.  I welcome that also.</P>
    <P>However, I am a little disappointed that the mediation and conciliation services being provided by the Government will apply only to those marriages which have failed.  They will not be available to existing marriages which are undergoing difficulties, and perhaps the partners to those marriages would like to avail of the services, the professional advice, that will be available from both the Church counselling services and any services with the <Col N="1334" /> State might endeavour to set up to complement that work.  That is what I understand from the statement of intent of the Government.  If that is not the case, if we are to have a marriage counselling service funded and encouraged by the State available for all marriages which are not the subject of this legislation, perhaps someone from the Government, perhaps the next speaker, will clarify that for me and I will be quite happy to accept what he says about it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the family court system which is long awaited by the public and, indeed, members of the legal profession, who have to use the courts for the purposes of trying to regularise in some way the maintenance, guardianship and custody provisions.  The joint committee raised other points in their report which they believed were factors contributing to the breakdown of marriage.  They spoke about the abuse of alcohol, personality defects and many factors which obviously are difficult to quantify and on which statistical evidence was not available to enable any sort of informed decision to be made.  All those factors identified should mean that the Government, who are sincere in their attempts to bring a balance and ensure that an informed policy will be implemented in this area, will act in those areas which the committee have identified as contributing to the type of situations which will be the subject of the divorce legislation if enacted.</P>
    <P>Many cases are put forward for divorce.  There is the case that relationships have ended.  There is the fallacy of the existence of other relationships.  It is claimed that divorce will help to uphold the dignity of the individuals whose marriages have collapsed.  There is the opinion that the retention of marriage in such cases effectively undermines the institution of marriage and brings it into disrepute. We are told of many legal anomalies, of people who get foreign divorces or Church annulments and cannot get similar civil annulments because the grounds for civil annulments are much more strict than those for Church annulments.  Therefore, there is <Col N="1335" /> an implied argument that legal consistency can be brought about by the introduction of divorce.  Of course, that is not true.  Some situations will not be covered by the introduction of divorce because, as is clear to anyone involved in the area, both Church and State claim to have a jurisdiction in the family and marriage areas.  Therefore, it does not matter whether the State permits dissolution on grounds either consistent or inconsistent with the religious tenets of the parties seeking the dissolution.  Irrespective of the grounds on which a decree is granted, the marriage will be regarded as unaffected in the religious sphere.  It is only the civil contract of marriage over which the State has jurisdiction and for which it may legislate.  Obviously, if we have divorce here as a result of the passage of this amendment and, for example, Catholics obtain a civil decree of divorce, rather than a legal anomaly there will be another anomaly in that the Church will not recognise the dissolution.  Really, you do not clear the decks, as it were, by the introduction of divorce.</P>
    <P>It is important to discard the stereotype idea of the Church's position, which seemed to be gaining ground.  The Church have a right to state their position and they will do so in a mature way. Whatever the result of this referendum, one should not regard it as a victory or defeat for either Church or State.  It is simply that the Church feel, and all reasonable people accept, that they have a right to make their position clear to the members of their faith and it is for people of that faith to inform their consciences and vote accordingly.  In informing their consciences they may in good conscience decide to vote for the divorce legislation, and they are quite entitled to do that.</P>
    <P>I should like to state the position of the Church in relation to Church-State relations as outlined by Dr. Daly and Dr. Cassidy in the New Ireland Forum and their attitude to marriage legislation.  Dr. Daly said in relation to Church-State relations:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> The Catholic Church in Ireland totally rejects the concept of a confessional state.  We have not sought and we do not seek a Catholic State for a Catholic people.  We believe that the alliance of Church and State is harmful for the Church and harmful for the State.  We rejoiced when that ambiguous formula regarding the special position of the Catholic Church was struck out of the Constitution by the electorate of the Republic.  The Catholic Church in Ireland has no power and seeks no power except the power of the gospel it preaches....</P>
    <P>So far as the Catholic Church and questions of public morality are concerned the position of the Church over recent decades has been clear and consistent. We have repeatedly declared that we in no way seek to have the moral teaching of the Catholic Church become the criterion of constitutional change or to have the principles of Catholic faith enshrined in civil law. What we have claimed, and what we must claim, is the right to fulfil our pastoral duty and our pastoral duty is to alert the consciences of Catholics to the moral consequences of any proposed piece of legislation and to the impact of that legislation on the moral quality of life in society while leaving to the legislators and to the electorate their freedom to act in accordance with their consciences.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Mary McAleese, who was an adviser to the Irish Episcopal Conference at the New Ireland Forum put it well when she said:</P>
    <P>The Church believes in marriage as a sacrament, as an indissoluble union, a contract for life.  It is quite entitled to hold that view and to preach that view to its flock.  Its sole jurisdiction is in relation to its flock.  It does not seek to have any jurisdiction beyond that. It is not entitled to, nor does it seek to, tell any Government that the Catholic view of marriage should be enshrined in legislation because it is the Catholic view but it does reserve the right &mdash; the same right accorded to any group, <Col N="1337" /> any individual in a democracy which holds freedom of speech as a central element, as a matter of public interest &mdash; to comment in relation to issues of public morality.</P>
    <P>Those are reasonable sentiments expressed by a modern Irish Church whose flock is the majority of people in this country. During the week Dr. Caird, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, said we are dealing with the competition between two different social philosophies.  There are people who legitimately and sincerely hold the view that it is time for change and to allow the right to remarry to be part of the Constitution.  They are quite entitled to their views and they put forward many good reasons for change. There are others who wish to preserve what we have and who are convinced that would be in the interest of society and the common good.  I hope the debate in and outside the House when the Bill is passed and before the people vote will try to keep that in mind because there should be mutual respect for the strongly held views on both sides.</P>
    <P>As a backbencher, who was not a member of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, but trying to make an informed contribution in this matter, I am amazed at the Government's refusal to wait for the results of the census to see the size of the problem before they hold a referendum.  The last official report in this regard was the Labour survey of 1983 which said that something in the region of 1.4 per cent of marriages had broken down.  I do not know if that figure is accurate.  I do not suggest that the figure is more or less.  I just do not know.  We hear about thousands of people being divorced and hundreds getting annulments, it is all very imprecise.  While I agree that many people in filling up the census forms were not prepared to divulge their marital status, when putting a constitutional amendment to the people, it would have been better to wait for these results to ensure that the people could make an informed and mature decision.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with human misery and <Col N="1338" /> relationships which have turned sour.  No responsible person or party would deny that many marriages have broken down. However, what is at issue between the competing social philosophies to which I referred earlier is whether divorce would be for the common good.  Would it have a detrimental effect on other marriages? I do not know the answer but both sides hold strong views diametrically opposed in that respect.  That is another flashpoint which I hope will not generate rancour or bad feeling which, unfortunately, was evident in the pro-life amendment debate.  Deputy Andrews said we had learned from that debate and that it augurs well for the coming referendum. While all parties hold strong and sincere views, they are putting them in a way which ensures that the man in the street can decipher the point they are trying to make and come to a reasoned judgment as a result of listening to constructive debate.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the text and what will be involved if the referendum is passed. My comments are being made on the assumption that the amendment will be passed.  I am trying to visualise the type of arrangements that will have to be made in the event of the amendment being passed.  There is great concern among many people about the property rights of the first family.  The point of view in regard to this as expressed by Deputy Woods should be discussed.  The whole idea of the debate is to tease out precisely the implications of the amendment.  It is not for us to score points against each other.  We must put forward our views to help the general public come to their own conclusion.  We must remember that all constitutional amendments are at some stage subject to judicial review.  Legislation may be amended in the House but the courts have to interpret the Constitution.</P>
    <P>According to the Succession Act where a testator dies wholly or partly testate the wife has explicit rights.  Where there are no children she is entitled to half of the estate and where there are children she is entitled to one-third of the estate. However, in those testacy provisions in <Col N="1339" /> the Succession Act there are no corresponding explicit fractions for the children apart from the terms of a will.  I accept that section 117 protects children.  Under it an application may be made on behalf of a child of a testator to ensure that the testator lived up to his moral duty to adequately provide for him or her and to ensure that child gets a fair share of the testator's estate.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that because the words in the section are, &ldquo;child of a testator&rdquo;, the children of the first marriage will be protected in the event of the constitutional amendment being passed and the testator forming a second union and having children.  That is my view on the issue and it may be added to by people who are more qualified legally than I am. However, the public would like to know if that is the case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  The Status of Children Bill will rid us of the legal disabilities which attach to illegitimate children.  They will be able to obtain redress under that provision.  In that context we can say the children of the first union will be protected in the event of a divorce in regard to property rights of one of their parents who subsequently forms a second union.  The position is different in regard to spouses. When a testator who forms a second union after a divorce dies, the wife of the second union will be entitled to the <Col N="1340" /> explicit rights as set out in the Succession Act.  If he dies testate she will be entitled to half, where there are children she will be entitled to one-third.  If he dies intestate she will be entitled to two-thirds of the estate and the children will be entitled to one-third.</P>
      <P>I must point out that the rights of the children of the first marriage will by definition be diluted because if there are two children of the first marriage they will be entitled to one-third between them on an intestacy but if there is a second union and two more children of that union there will be four children to divide one-third of the estate between them.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with that or that the children of the first union should in some way get priority because they were born before the children of the second union.  However, people should be made aware that that is what will happen.  People can work out the mathematics for themselves but, obviously, the children of both unions have rights to equal shares.  It is obvious that when there is a second union the share of the children of the first union automatically diminishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not running that down or saying there is anything wrong with that.  I do not see the relevance of that interjection.  I welcome the statement that family courts will be established and that they will be able to make provisions in regard to the family home, the custody of children and so on.  They are not within the jurisdiction of the courts in regard to judicial separations. The proposed reform of the judicial separation procedure to make it less cumbersome and widen its ambit is something we should welcome.  However, in the event of a divorce a decision will have to be made on the property rights of the first wife, I understand the court will have a right to provide for a lump sum payment to the wife.  I welcome that because up to now the court could not do that.  That becomes relevant where a person who <Col N="1341" /> has a house worth £100,000 is divorcing his wife.  In that case a lump sum payment may be made to the wife to enable her to purchase a house.  At the moment under the judicial separation procedure it is only necessary to provide alternative accommodation and that need not be permanent accommodation.  It is important that such a provision is contained in any legislation introduced in the House in the event of the amendment being passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the proposed legislation will include a provision to deal with the pension rights of a husband who is divorcing his wife.  I hope it will be necessary for him to give an assurance to the court that a certain portion of those pension rights will be made available to the first wife in the event of his death subsequent to his forming a second union.  It is my view that the procedure will be that when a divorce decree is given and a lump sum payment is made to help the wife get a house, there will also be monthly alimony payments depending on the financial circumstances in each case.  People should be aware that it would be possible for the wife subsequently to revert to the court, in the event of a change of financial circumstances of her former husband, and have her alimony payments increased. There is the mistaken belief that, once divorce occurs, that is it, that the first wife has no possibility of having her alimony increased.  I do not think that will be the case but I await clarification by Government speakers who will know better the type of legislation to be introduced.  I think that is the position obtaining in the United Kingdom and that more than likely it will be the case here also.  However, people tend to think that, once divorce occurs and property rights are decided, that is the end of the matter.  I do not think that will be the case and I hope I am right in that assumption.  It is important that a wife have some redress subsequently, just as it is important in the event of a separation, when a spouse can revert to the court to have her maintenance order varied in the event of her former husband having an increased income.  There should be that facility in divorce proceedings also, or even to have <Col N="1342" /> alimony payments reduced if a former husband's financial circumstances deteriorate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the special provision being made for families or spouses where a couple may have been separated for more than five years at the date of implementation of this proposed divorce legislation &mdash; if and when it is passed by this House &mdash; there is a slight anomaly.  The proposal put forward by the Government in relation to the requisite two-year period after a judicial separation having been granted, or a separation agreement having been made a rule of court, is to enable the new family court to assess properly the effectiveness of the provisions made under those arrangements, to ascertain whether they are sufficient for the spouse and children who have been separated from the former spouse.  From my reading of the Government statement those provisions will not obtain in relation to those people who apply for a divorce under the special provisions outlined. I wonder why that is the case.  For example, in those circumstances, how will a family court properly assess how effective are those arrangements?  I take the point that, before applying for a divorce, a person must make adequate provision for the spouse but there does not appear to be a two-year waiting period required from the time the separation arrangements are decided.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing this Bill, placed some emphasis on divorces which arise from marriages which begin to founder from the date of implementation of the divorce legislation, emphasising that it is important there be this two-year waiting period in order to ascertain that the rights of the spouse and children are safeguarded.  In the special provisions outlined in paragraph 17 of the Government's statement that two-year period is not required, something which might well be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Various points have been raised in the course of the debate to date.  One that must be discussed more fully is that period of reflection.  In the course of his remarks the Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> People who have already been separated for five years at the time the legislation to provide for divorce comes into force will be able to apply for a divorce once they have proved that fact and also that proper provision has been made for dependants.  As regards people who are not separated for five years at the date of enactment of the legislation, it will be an additional condition to the general requirement of five years separation that they will first have to obtain a decree of judicial separation or enter into a separation agreement which is then approved by the court.  If they so desire, they may then present a petition for divorce when two further years have elapsed. The purpose of requiring a decree of judicial separation or court order approving a separation agreement is twofold.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am reading that incorrectly but I am not at all clear on that point.  When one tries to envisage circumstances that might arise in that respect, one becomes confused.  Perhaps that point could be clarified also.</P>
    <P>It is to the credit of the members of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and the positions adopted by the political parties in this very sensitive area of family law that the debate is proceeding in the manner it is.  Regardless of how small the number of people experiencing marital problems or difficulties it is good that the issue be put to the people to decide.  We are demonstrating some compassion and political will in allowing this matter to go before the people.  However, it is important that all of the views to be expressed be expressed in a tolerant manner.  It should be remembered also that the arguments against allowing this legislation be enacted &mdash; whilst difficult to express or back-up with statistics &mdash; constitute strongly held views.  We must remember that we are dealing with many people who take their religion very seriously and view this proposal as undermining <Col N="1344" /> their way of life.  However trenchantly the articulate members of the pro-divorce lobby wish to put their case it is to be hoped they will respect that other deeply held view widespread throughout the country.  There are many people holding that view who would find it difficult to give it expression but it is held.</P>
    <P>If we conduct the debate in that manner then, whether or not the proposal is passed, there should not be any traumatic consequences.  It is my hope that the acceptance or rejection of the proposal to be put in the referendum will not be seen as victory or defeat for Church or State.  In some of the speeches yesterday I detected an attitude that it is important for us to demonstrate that we are a democracy not to be interfered with by the Church, demonstrating our independence as a State.  I do not think that is necessarily true at all.  I believe that the Church has a role to play in this country and will continue to play that role.  I know the churches will put their case well and sympathetically in the difficult circumstances obtaining.  I do hope that nobody will try to emerge as a victor on this issue.  I would hope there would be no triumphalism on the part of people who are anti-divorce in the event of the proposal being rejected.  The problems obtain and must be dealt with as best we can in the circumstances.  I hope the electorate will be fully informed as to all of the implications and that their decision will be respected afterwards by the legislators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest and respect to a very sober and objective speech by Deputy Cowen.  I almost felt myself in a position in which his situation and mine were transposed, where instead of he having been a relatively recent student of mine, he was the professor and, standing somewhat aside from the dust of the area, the untidy pit of the lecture hall, was presenting both sides of the question impartially.  I hope he will not take it as meant offensively to him because I genuinely and unfeignedly want to compliment him on an extremely <Col N="1345" /> objective and well presented speech.  But he is, after all, in politics; and politics has something to do with leadership.  Perhaps it is a bug that gets at us, or something a little better than that or perhaps a little worse.  Perhaps because our mothers left us too long unattended on our potties, when we were small, we have a compelling desire to be taken notice of and feel obliged to spend the rest of our lives telling others how to run theirs.  For whatever reason, however deeply buried our motives, we are in this House to offer some kind of leadership.  I am sorry that Deputy Cowen should have spoken immediately before me; if another Deputy had presented a speech with the same thrust, or lack of thrust, I should have said the same thing &mdash; but of course without being able to add in that other Deputy's case what I can sincerely add in his, that his was a very objective, sober and in the deepest sense respectable contribution in every other way.</P>
      <P>However, the way in which it falls short of deserving respect is in its lack of offering direction to the people.  Surely that is what we are paid for.  Surely that is what we foam at the mouth about on porter barrels outside church gates.  That is what we demand people's votes for &mdash; that they shall entrust and confide their futures to us because we know best what is right and good for them.  I think that is a hellish presumption on the part of politicians.  I do not think I am unique in this, but I have long periods of dejection and lack of confidence, asking myself what gives me the right to be haranguing the people about how they should do this and that, lecturing them when I am not even able to keep this or that aspect of my life or thought in order.  What gives me the right?  Ought I not to close down, get out of the business?  However, so long as I am there, I try to say what I think and believe, not perhaps what others should do but I certainly do not draw a salary and run for election without at least telling the people what I am going to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowen is one of the youngest members of his party and I say sincerely that everybody in the House knew and respected his father.  Although he is in a <Col N="1346" /> different party from me and I regret that he is not in mine, and although his victory in the by-elections about two years ago was a defeat for us, I was glad to see him getting a chance.  I do not believe that anybody on this side was so begrudging as to speak otherwise about him.  I hope that he will have a successful and brilliant career here.  The sobriety and objectivity with which he presented his material this evening makes me think that he will.</P>
    <P>But so far as leadership is concerned, anything that he said here might have been compared with sealed orders given to a general by the mad King Ludwig of Bavaria.  The general might have led an army 500 miles across the Alps and become hunted by the Russians and the Kalmuks on the one side and the resurgent Italians on the other.  He might have been told not to open those orders until he reached the town of Tremezzo, for example.  All these people are slavering after his blood.  He opens the orders and they tell him that he is to maintain close formation, to deploy his artillery in such a way as to cover his infantry, he is not to expend his cavalry reserves too early &mdash; but they fail to tell him who he is to fight.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to wound Deputy Cowen.  He spent some years watching me and knows that I speak harshly and bitterly from time to time &mdash; none of us is free from that, or very few.  He knows me, I hope, well enough to know that I have really no animus against any Member of this House.  It is only an accident that I happen to be speaking immediately after him.  Had Deputies Barrett, Treacy or Leyden spoken immediately before me and had the same general lack of thrust, I should have said the same thing.  I certainly would not have expected to hear a speech along these lines from Deputy Leyden whose main concern in here, from listening to him previously, appears to be the unmarried bachelors in his constituency who are prevented by the Government's parsimony from engaging in the matrimony which this House is trying to make possible the dissolution of.  I would not have expected such a speech from Deputy Leyden but <Col N="1347" /> perhaps from Deputies Treacy or Barrett.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said, when he saw me here with my reading glasses, papers and wounding clippings from the paper which I intend to read out to hurt and annoy people, that I had all the signs of being set to make a speech but that it appeared that I had changed my mind about the subject because when he last heard me on the subject on the radio I had said that I thought it was a bad idea to go ahead with this divorce referendum.  He is quite right.  I did say that on the radio and still think it.  It is a debate which has been thrust upon some members of my party &mdash; I have not counted them and do not collogue with them and I hope everybody here knows that I do not intrigue or whisper behind peoples' backs &mdash; but I suspect that I am not the only member of this or the other party who would have preferred this issue to have been deferred for a little longer.  That is not so that we might shelter behind a screen and conceal our opinions &mdash; and I have not concealed my opinion about this, unconfident and faltering though it may be.</P>
    <P>This is the last year of this Government before an election, give or take a few months.  They have many serious problems on their plate.  I am personally unwilling that they should be defeated but do not mean to wound anybody on the far side by saying so.  I am not unwilling for any prospect of gain or lack of office on my own part but my honest judgment is that the country would be better served by keeping the other party &mdash; at least under their existing leadership structure &mdash; away from these benches.  If things change, if there is a thunderclap and the clouds roll away and the sun smiles on the hillsides and a different row of faces appear over the parapet over there from me, things will be different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I may perhaps come to the conclusion that the country's interest would be better served by our vacating <Col N="1348" /> these benches.  Although everybody knows the reservations which I have about the Coalition agreement between the two parties which support this Government &mdash; which explains why I am standing here at the back &mdash; I still believe that, with all their indecision and their frustrations in some regards because of different ideologies, it is infinitely better that they should continue in office than that they should be replaced by the kind of Government that we had in 1982, or between the years 1979 and 1981.  I am therefore very anxious that the Government should concentrate, between now and the next election, on issues which I am not saying are necessarily more important, and certainly will not be more urgent for people caught up in a broken marriage, but which are nationally of deeper and more permanent interest. Success in those issues will be crucial to our success in the election.  I think we should have been forgiven, but perhaps not by many groups &mdash; and I do not mean to diminish or belittle this aspect &mdash; who have a very anxious and urgent interest in reform in this area.  I intend to support and vote for this amendment, in case anybody did not know that before.  I do not think that there will be a vote here, but I am going to support it here and I am going to support it in the ballot box. However, I think that it would have been better had the debate and amendment process been left until after the next election, for the reasons that I have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody called on to speak on this or any related issue or on anything to do with morality in areas which are as highly personal as marriage and anything in the entire sexual sphere, or near or related to that, or caused or conditioned by it, unless the speaker is a buffoon or a hypocrite, must be something less than totally confident.  He has to be reluctant to speak on it.  I hate laying down the law.  I no doubt do it on other matters, but have always tried to avoid doing so on matters connected with this area, because I feel there is far too much imperfection in my own life, attitudes and mind to be a safe guide for anybody else.  I would imagine that many Deputies of both sexes and of <Col N="1349" /> all ages would be honestly willing to say &ldquo;me too&rdquo; in that regard.  I hope they would.  I hope I am not alone in that and I do not believe I am alone in that lack of confidence.</P>
    <P>Laying down the law on moral issues or on issues of a social kind which are conditioned by moral considerations is peculiarly suspect and to many people peculiarly hateful in a politician.  Politicians are a hissing and a byword to many people, wrongly so, no doubt.  Perhaps the public do not understand the motives which drive people into it, the bug which gets into them, or the psychological deficiencies which force them to try to make up in this arena what they lack in others.  They may not have enough sympathy.  All they see are a lot of fat cats or people who ride along enjoying a high profile and getting a lot of coverage and publicity on what they think is a lot of unearned money.  That is undoubtedly a false and unfair criticism.  I would say that no matter who was in office.  If there were a crowd of Marxists or Balubas in office and forced to go through the hoops which everybody here on both sides has to go through every week of the year, I would still say it.</P>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, the public perception and regard for politicians are not very high.  The last straw to the ordinary member of the public is to be pontificated to about his marriage, or about how he should run his sexual existence, by a crowd of fellows who do not mind robbing the State blind, because that is how he sees it, who do not mind running us into war if they could, because that is how he sees it, who makes excuses for murderers, because that is how he sees it, who palliate crimes for which he would be sent to prison a hundred times over, because that is how many citizens see it.</P>
    <P>The last straw to him is to be lectured, to be whinged and whined at by someone in this House about how he should run his marriage, about whether he should control fertility by an artificial or mechanical means, whether he should as I heard &mdash; I do not think it would be right to name him but anybody who looks back over the record will recall him &mdash; a Fianna <Col N="1350" /> Fáil frontbencher who spoke here today say when we were debating one of the very minimal extensions of the contraception law in 1979, resort to a urine dipstick as a means of calculating the fertile cycle of a woman in matrimony. Matrimony, relations between man and a woman.  He really thought we might reach the day when technology would allow us to decide matters of this kind and run a marriage with a urine dipstick. That was not very long ago, Sir.  You were in the House.  I do not think any other Deputy here was.  I think, Sir, it is only you and I who are left out of that vintage.</P>

      <P>That stinks to ordinary people.  Anyone expressing his or her views here on a matter like this is running the risk of incurring the contempt of many of the people who elected them.  No one here should be arrogant or positive about matters of this kind.  I have said how I am going to vote in my own ballot box even if I am not required to vote here, but I am not going to campaign to get anyone else to do so.  I feel too unsure about what I am going to do.  I hope I am not making a mistake and I hope I am not doing more harm than good.  I will not ask anybody else to vote that way, nor will I knock on doors, nor will I ballyrag or arm-twist anybody to follow my example.  I feel I am discharging my duty, and it is a hell of a sight more than some Deputies in this House will have done by the time the debate ends, by saying what I propose to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cowen and some other Deputies on both sides who spoke in pleading that the next six weeks should not be an acrimonious period.  I must say that one of the reasons why I was very much against holding this at all on this <Col N="1351" /> side of the election was that I dreaded the stinking cat-fight which we had here in 1983 on the abortion referendum.  I felt we were going to get a repetition of that. I must frankly tell the House I am agreeably surprised that has not turned out to be the case.  So far has it not been the case &mdash; I say it although it involves admitting I was wrong in my prediction &mdash; that I have not had one single letter, one single telephone call or one single urgent visit from a constituent or anybody else pressing me to join the Minister for Education, Deputy Glenn, Deputy Flanagan, or whatever other Deputy who may speak here taking the same line as they have taken.  Not one.  Maybe that is an exaggeration. I have had one or two letters along those lines but I certainly have not had the stinking cataract of propaganda and written material from both sides which I and every other Deputy had on this side of the House in 1983.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that if this campaign has to be fought it will be fought in a more civilised atmosphere than what we then saw.  Something of the 1983 atmosphere survived into the following year, or it may have been early 1985, when we extended the contraception law further with Deputy Desmond's Bill.  I am very agreeably surprised and grateful that nothing of that kind so far as my experience goes has been seen on this occasion.  I hope when the debate has ended, that will mean when the referendum is over, I will not have any reason to withdraw that tribute.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to say one other thing in regard to lobbying and sending of post and circulars and letters threatening electorate disaster unless I vote this way or that way.  We all have to live dangerously or if we do not, we are not earning our keep.  If anyone is not willing to say what he thinks in here, he is not earning his salary.  We have to live dangerously and take the risk of electoral disfavour by this or that route.  I know that many people who have voted for me are going to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in this referendum. I am sorry to offend them and I hope I will not lose their support.  I have to take <Col N="1352" /> the risk that I will.  I want to say this. The Government's outside allies on this matter are not going to advance the Government's position very far &mdash; I am speaking about the Government as a whole &mdash; if they say things of the kind which the Divorce Action Group were reported as saying this morning.  The Divorce Action Group consist I presume &mdash; I do not want to appear by using the word &ldquo;presume&rdquo; to be putting a disdainful distance between myself and them; what I mean by &ldquo;presume&rdquo; is that I do not know them personally &mdash; or take it for granted are people who either have in their own lives or are near enough or feel strongly and concerned enough about marital problems to form such a group.  That group are not a church.  They do not have a universal mission of any kind or conceive themselves as having that.</P>
    <P>Once a divorce jurisdiction has been attained that group will presumably regard themselves as <i>functus officio</i> and dissolve.  They are here for one purpose and one purpose only and once that purpose is achieved they will have no other purpose.  That group are making a serious tactical mistake &mdash; if I may presume to lecture them on tactics &mdash; in saying as they did, as they were reported as saying this morning, that the Catholic Bishops had no business launching a campaign or issuing pastorals on this theme.  I am not going to have time to get to the end of what I want to say before I report progress, but it is important for them to understand that tactical damage is done to what the Government are trying to do &mdash; I would have, as I said, preferred had they diverted it for a year &mdash; by that kind of thing.  Of course, the Bishops, even though they are giving advice which I do not feel able to take, are entitled to issue pastorals.  That is what they are there for. If they did not act as pastors, because that is their only pretention in the world, they too would not be earning their keep. They too would be subject to the reproach that they were swanking around, getting a high profile, their pictures in the paper with everyone bowing and scraping but that they were not doing <Col N="1353" /> their job.  It is only in issuing pastorals and giving guidance that they are doing their job.  The Divorce Action Group should get that into their heads now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy, in using the phrase &ldquo;a nuclear disaster&rdquo; envisages the dropping of a nuclear bomb or bombs on this country or the occurrence of an event of equivalent proportion in close proximity to this country, then I would have to say that it is highly improbable that it would be possible to provide immediate health care for the survivors of such a disaster.  I am sure that in that the Deputy will agree that the only practical action that we, as a small neutral country can take, is to try to ensure in the international fora to which we have access that such a contingency does not come about.</P>
      <P>So far as nuclear accidents are concerned, the action necessary in any particular case will be determined by the nature, kind and location of the nuclear incident.  In the case of the recent Chernobyl disaster the extent of radioactive fallout over this country was low and did not in general increase to a marked extent the background radiation to which we are normally exposed.  Needless to state at this stage my grave concern about any such incident is in no way diminished by the relatively low level of fallout.</P>
      <P>Should a similar situation arise in future, in which fallout was such that medical care was necessary, provision for it would be made in accordance with emergency plans which all health boards have drawn up to deal with serious incidents involving deaths or injury or serious disruption of essential services.  These plans envisage, in general, making available the accommodation, facilities and medical staffs to provide such treatment services as are appropriate in the case of any specific incident.  I should say that, in relation to incidents involving radioactive fallout, the service to be provided would primarily consist of advice about avoidance of exposure to contamination and about safe supplies of food and drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it has been agreed to provide additional staff and equipment for the Nuclear Energy <Col N="1173" /> Board to enable better arrangements to be made for the monitoring of radiation in the environment and to be able to cope in future with any incidents similar to the recent one.  The interdepartmental committee, which has been set up by the Tánaiste to co-ordinate actions in the wake of the Chernobyl accident, is continuing to meet to monitor the present position.  The Department of Health is represented on this committee.  It will also, in the coming weeks, consider the adequacy of existing arrangements to cope with problems such as those which have arisen during the past few weeks.</P>

I would like to assure the Deputy, however, that people in genuine need will not suffer undue financial hardship as a result of measures taken by the boards.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear also that there will be no reduction in the ambulance service which is an essential emergency service.</P>
      <P>Following is the information referred to:</P>
      <P>Arrangements made by Health Boards.</P>
      <P>Eastern Health Board&mdash;This board provides a limited level of non-emergency transport for patients attending clinics and out-patient departments etc.  These facilities are provided by the boards own vehicles only and priority is given to certain categories i.e. mental handicap, dialysis, geriatric patients and others who are unable either physically or mentally to avail of public transport.</P>
      <P>Midland Health Board&mdash;Transport is provided from hospital locations within this board's area for patients attending out-patient clinics in Dublin.  Patients who are referred by the board's consultants for in-patient treatment at extern hospitals are provided with transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Patients who are unable to meet the cost of necessary transport from their own resources are advised to make application to their community welfare officer for a special needs payment as <Col N="1176" /> provided for in section 14 of the Supplementary Welfare Allowances Act, 1975.</P>
    <P>Mid Western Health Board&mdash;Normal and emergency ambulance transport services are provided in this board area to transport patients to hospitals as necessary.</P>
    <P>A five day per week minibus service operates to cater for people attending out-patient clinics.  Both services are available for persons who are unable to provide transport from their own resources.</P>
    <P>North Eastern Health Board&mdash;This board provides a minibus service to out-patient clinics in Dublin from Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath on a four day per week basis.  A similar service is provided for County Louth, five days each fortnight and is supplemented by vouchers for public transport.</P>
    <P>Transport is provided in Meath for chest clinics, psychiatric clinics and child guidance clinics.  Patients from west Cavan are provided with transport for clinics in Cavan town.</P>
    <P>North Western Health Board&mdash;This board provides transport to day-hospitals, renal dialysis units, mentally handicapped units and from hospital to hospital.  The board is in the process of setting up a register of cases where special arrangements are to be made.</P>
    <P>Special concession travel has been made available by the public transport authorities in the area on presentation of an authorised clinic appointment.  Provision is also made for genuine hardship cases by the provision of a refund of reasonable expenses incurred.</P>
    <P>Southern Health Board&mdash;Where ambulance transport to and from hospital is medically necessary, this is provided free of charge to people in the full eligibility group.  Persons outside of this group are charged for the service.  Normally, people attending hospitals and clinics are expected to make their own travel arrangements and to pay the costs themselves. People experiencing undue hardship may apply for a refund for all or part of the cost.  The amount of the refund is usually limited to the cost of public transport except where this is not <Col N="1177" /> available or is unsuitable.  Refunds are related to a person's means and are not made if other means of transport are available (e.g. family car or entitlement to free transport).  In emergencies there is a system whereby a doctor or community welfare officer attending a patient may arrange for a taxi.</P>
    <P>South Eastern Health Board&mdash;This board provides transport to all out-patient clinics and hospitals for medical card holders.  This transport is provided by the board's own minibus service, by hired transport or by public transport.</P>
    <P>Western Health Board&mdash;Other than emergency cases, patients attending clinics or being admitted to hospital are requested to make their own transport arrangements.  In cases where people experience undue hardship in paying for their own transport costs to a hospital or clinic, refunds of all or part of the cost are made.  Each application for a refund is assessed on its own merits.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced that the introduction of a system as suggested by the Deputy would result in an improvement in the procurement of organs for transplant purposes. There is now a greater awareness both among the hospital staff and the general public of the need for donor organs.  An approach to relatives requires a great deal of sensitivity and as not all patients on life-support machines are suitable as donors the question of requesting vital organs from the next of kin is best left to the discretion of the medical staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Western Health Board that they have undertaken an examination of the position of persons in their area who hold both a medical card, under the GMS (&ldquo;choice of doctor&rdquo;) scheme and also a long term illness book under the long term illness scheme.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for a medical card is a comprehensive entitlement and, in the normal course of events, medical card holders are not eligible for, and do not require the benefits of the long term illness scheme.  However, there are certain items sometimes prescribed for the treatment of scheduled conditions in the long term illness scheme which, as non-prescription &ldquo;over the counter type&rdquo; items, are not available under the GMS scheme.</P>
      <P>As a matter of convenience to patients, those medical card holders who also have long term illness books have been asked to use the long term illness scheme to obtain the minority of products which are not available in the GMS.  This arrangement is in accordance with the statutory basis of eligibility for health services and the cost of the services provided will be met from the health budget. While there may be some slight reduction in the overall cost of drugs supplied to patients as a result of this review, the primary objective of the board has been to ensure that the appropriate services are used by the patients concerned.  I am satisfied that the board are acting properly in the matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The IDA is actively promoting Dublin's inner city area for suitable industrial projects particularly in the small industry sector to which the area is particularly suited. Since 1979, IDA has contributed significantly to the development of the area by the provision of enterprise centres at Pearse Street and East Wall Road and small industry units at The Liberties and Prussia Street.  In addition a further 18 units ranging in size from 400 to 800 square feet are being constructed at Gloucester Place and these will be available for promotion next month. Total investment in these facilities amounts to some £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1 January 1983 Dublin's inner city has been a designated area for special incentives by IDA for a five year period. This allows IDA to provide up to 60 per cent grant assistance towards suitable projects in the area and this will be used to good advantage by IDA's small <Col N="1181" /> industry Dublin team which has an ambitious target of approving 260 projects in inner city Dublin during 1986.</P>

    <P>A sum of £5,000,000 is available in my Department's Vote for 1986 for the provision of recreational amenity facilities. Of this amount, grants totalling £1,945,000 have been allocated to Dublin Corporation in respect of 24 projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> The projects being assisted in the north-inner city area are for the provision of a sports hall in Stoneybatter, outdoor recreational facilities in Sheriff Street and in the East Wall-Clontarf district and the floodlighting and improvement of existing football-tennis facilities in Ventry Park, Cabra.  The grant assistance available for these projects is £550,000 and I understand they will provide employment for some 40 people for a three-12 month period.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation Library at the ILAC Centre will be officially opened on 10 June 1986, and will employ a staff of 31 (including 14 new posts).  The library, which will have a total floor area of 22,650 sq. ft. will provide wide ranging public library and ancillary services, including lending and reference services, a commerce library, music services (including recitals and music programmes in the library) and audio visual services (including language learning, picture lending and exhibitions).</P>
    <P>Provision of £300,000 by way of grant-in-aid in 1986 has been made in my Department's Vote for the Dublin inner-city programme and fund.  The fund, which, as part of the Government's devolution policy, is now administered by Dublin Corporation, provides financial assistance for a variety of projects of a social, economic, educational recreational or environmental nature which can make a significant contribution to the rehabilitation of the inner city generally. A sum of £24,000 has recently been allocated from the fund for a pilot scheme linked to the existing employment incentive scheme, to provide an additional incentive for up to 100 inner-city employees.</P>
    <P>In continuance of the devolution policy and as outlined in the policy statement on the reform of local government published last year, legislation to be published later this year will provide for the establishment of district councils within the city area comprised of the city council members for the districts concerned.  The intention is that these councils will make local government in Dublin more accessible and they will be able to address <Col N="1186" /> themselves closely to the needs of particular areas.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the taxpayer is separated from his wife under a 1981 deed of separation. This information was not brought to the notice of the inspector of taxes until the end of 1984.  As the deed of separation pre-dated the 1983 legislation in relation to the taxation of maintenance payments by one party to a marriage to the other party the provisions of section 3 or 4 of the Finance Act, 1983, do not apply in the present case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxpayer is entitled, in computing his income for tax purposes, to a deduction in respect of the gross amount of the payment, which he makes to his spouse under deduction of tax, but he is chargeable to that tax at the standard rate (35 per cent) on that amount.  The taxpayer's wife is assessed to tax in respect of the gross payment but is allowed a credit for <Col N="1191" /> the tax deducted from the payment made under the deed.  Both parties to the agreement are entitled only to the single person's allowance.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer had been granted the married personal allowance for all years up to 1985-86.  Although the inspector became aware late in 1984 that the taxpayer was separated from his wife, due to an oversight in the tax office the allowances were not adjusted for 1985-86. The matter has been rectified for 1986-87 and it is not proposed to disturb the position for the earlier years.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer may wish to explore whether there might be alternative ways of arranging his affairs with a view to coming within the reliefs provided by the 1983 legislation.  He might consider approaching the inspector of taxes who would advise him on the matter.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of <i>pro rata</i> retirement pension since 16 December 1982.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last <Col N="1194" /> complete contribution year before reaching age 66.  The Department's records show that the person concerned had a total of 153 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, was from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1982. This is equal to a yearly average of only five and therefore he did not qualify for a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  Neither did he qualify for a contributory old age pension at age 66; a yearly average of at least 20 is required for this latter pension.</P>
      <P>Under EC Regulations on social security, a person who has been employed in another member state can qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> retirement pension on his combined Irish and British records, the amount payable being based on the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total.  The person concerned had a combined total of 1155 contributions in the relevant period (153 Irish and 1002 British).  This is equal to a yearly average of 39 for which the present rate payable under the Social Welfare Acts is £82.60 per week, where the claimant has an adult dependant under age 66.  His <i>pro rata</i> pension rate was calculated as £82.60 x (153/1155)= £10.94 rounded to £10.95.</P>
      <P>He is also in receipt of a British retirement pension.</P>
      <P>His entitlement to a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension at age 66 has now been reviewed.  Entitlement to this pension is dependent on his insurance record up to 5 April 1983, the end of the contribution year before he reached age 66. Allowing for an additional 15 credited contributions for the period from 16 December 1982 to 5 April 1983 while he was in receipt of <i>pro rata</i> retirement pension, his entitlement to the <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension has now been established at £11.85.  This has been calculated, on the same proportional basis but including the extra year's contributions in the calculations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has been asked to return his existing pension book and when this is received the replacement book at the new rate will be sent to him.  The arrears in respect of <Col N="1195" /> the difference from 16 December 1983 will also be issued to him.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed a retirement pension on 14 May 1985 and claimed a contributory old age pension on 4 February 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the conditions for receipt of <Col N="1197" /> a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts at age 65 requires a claimant to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reaches pension age.  The Department's records show that the claimant had a total of 522 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1984.  This is equal to a yearly average of only 16 and, therefore, he does not qualify for a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  Neither does he qualify for a contributory old age pension under the Acts from age 66.  A yearly average of at least 20 is required for this latter pension.</P>
    <P>Under EC Regulations where a person has also been employed in another EC country his contributions in that country may be combined with his Irish contributions to enable him to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension, the rate of which is based on the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total.  The person concerned had been employed in Great Britain and details of his British insurance were requested from the British Department of Health and Social Security.  His British insurance record was received on 13 May 1986 showing that he had a record of 663 British contributions in the relevant period.  The combined Irish and British records suffice to give him an entitlement to a <i>pro rata</i> pension at the present rate of £21.95 per week.  However, pension would not be payable to him from age 65 as he was in receipt of unemployment assistance at a higher rate.  Accordingly, he has been awarded a <i>pro rata</i> pension with effect from 4 April 1986, the Friday following his 66th birthday.  A pension book containing orders payable from 4 April 1986 has been issued to the designated post office for collection by him and he has been notified accordingly.  He will continue to be paid his British retirement pension and the arrears of that pension will be sent to him as soon as a re-check <Col N="1198" /> has been made on the amount of unemployment assistance which was simultaneously paid to him.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the contribution year governing the claim.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemloyment benefit from 11 March 1986. According to the Department's records she had not the necessary 26 contributions paid or credited in the contribution period 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985 which governed her entitlement to unemployment benefit from 11 March 1986.  However, the non-payment of contributions by her employer during the relevant period is at present under investigation and when these inquiries are completed her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the person concerned claimed unemployment assistance and following an investigation of the claim her means were assessed at £1.35 weekly, derived from the value of the benefit of board and lodgings in her parents' home. She is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £30.40 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in her case of £31.75 less means of £1.35.</P>
      <P>Arrears due on the unemployment assistance claim were paid on 1 May 1986. Further weekly payments of £30.40 will continue to be made as they become due pending a review of her unemployment benefit claim.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have not less than 26 contributions paid at the appropriate rate since entry into insurable employment.  The minimum age at which an employee enters insurance is 16 years.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was paid unemployment benefit from 20 September 1982 on the basis of having the relevant contributions paid on his behalf in respect of employment during the period 10 August 1981 to 13 September 1982. When making his claim he stated that his date of birth was 7 June 1965.  His employer has a similar date of birth on their records and PRSI contributions were deducted, accordingly, on the basis that he was over 16 years of age.</P>
      <P>It subsequently transpired that his correct date of birth is 7 June 1966 and consequently contributions paid prior to 7 June 1986 were not insurable at a class providing cover against unemployment as he was under 16 years of age.</P>
      <P>Following a review of his case he had not the necessary 26 contributions paid, and he was therefore not entitled to unemployment benefit on his claims of 20 September 1982 to 28 February 1983, 25 April 1983 to 13 October 1983 and 9 April 1984 to 18 August 1984.

      <P>My Department have sanctioned grants towards the cost of the eventual provision of 16 classrooms to cater for first level education in the district of Balgaddy, County Dublin.  I understand the Woodavens estate to be adjacent to Balgaddy in the Neilstown district.  Tenders for the construction of part of this accommodation as a first module of a new national school have been referred to my Department for consideration.  Because, however, the rate of housing development in the Balgaddy area did not proceed as rapidly as originally expected, a site more suitably located in relation to such housing development as has taken place to date is to be indicated to my Department.  When this matter has been resolved, the way will be open for the placing of a contract for the first part of the new national school.  I am not in a position as yet to say when construction may commence.</P>
      <P>With regard to post-primary education, Collinstown Park Community College was planned to cater for the Neilstown and Rowlagh areas of Clondalkin. Up to this year it was able to enrol the Quarryvale primary school leavers in addition to those in its own area.  Schools in developing areas such as Clondalkin are expected to cater primarily for their own area but, accommodation permitting, pupils from surrounding areas may be enrolled.  I should point out that the formulation of an intake policy is a matter for the board of management of each school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> I am aware that over 300 pupils have applied for places in Collinstown Park Community College for next September. I am also aware that, on educational grounds, and for longer term accommodation reasons, the board of management consider that it is not in a position to enrol such a large number.  In these circumstances some of the pupils who have applied will not gain admission to that college next September.  There will, however, be accommodation for them in other neighbouring second level schools. My Department are currently carrying out a detailed examination of the accommodation requirements in the north Clondalkin area.  In the course of this examination due consideration will be given to the future needs of all the pupils of this area.  My Department are satisfied that all pupils leaving Quarryvale primary school this year will have access to a post primary school.</P>

Through this programme special assistance has been provided for six schools in the north-inner city area of Dublin and it is hoped to assist a further six schools in this area in 1986.</P>
      <P>The special measures from which the schools benefit include the following:</P>

      <P>The policy of the Government is to ensure that all unemployment people should have at their disposal a wide variety of options in training, work experience, a place on an employment scheme or the opportunity to engage in a business for themselves. My Department have, accordingly, introduced and administer a selection of employment, training and incentive programmes to meet with the variety of problems which unemployed people encounter.</P>
      <P>The National Manpower Service, D'Olier House, have assigned four placement officers specifically to the Dublin north-inner city area to provide unemployed persons with advice on the programmes most appropriate to their specific needs.  In any cases where the services of other State agencies would appear more suitable, the placement officers arrange the necessary liaison.</P>
      <P>An indication of the activity of the National Manpower Service in the area may be had from the fact that 724 persons have so far this year been placed on schemes viz.</P>

    <P>In addition, a total of 174 persons in the area have been placed in full time employment.</P>
    <P>In the course of monitoring participation in the various schemes, the placement officers encourage employers to notify any vacancies in their undertakings <Col N="1218" /> to the D'Olier Street NMS office and every effort is made to match job-seekers against these vacancies.</P>
    <P>The NMS is the agency responsible for administration and operating the £10 employment bonus (in addition to the employment incentive premium) on offer via the Dublin inner-city group grant scheme.  The scheme encourages inner-city employers to employ inner-city residents.</P>
    <P>The procedures for registration of job-seekers at D'Olier House have been simplified to remove delays and placement officers are always on hand to deal with any queries from callers.  In addition, a large self-service display unit has been set up in D'Olier House to assist job seekers.</P>
    <P>I would also refer to the Taoiseach's statement in the Dáil on 23 October last in which various initiatives specifically designed to boost employment in the Dublin north-inner city area were announced.</P>
    <P>It would be my intention that everything possible will continue to be done to alleviate unemployment in the Dublin area and particularly the inner-city.</P>
