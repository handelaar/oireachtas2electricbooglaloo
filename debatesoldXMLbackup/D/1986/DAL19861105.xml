      <P>Would the Taoiseach say if the Government are prepared to allow time for Item No. 51 &mdash; Oireachtas and Ministerial Pensions Bill, 1986 &mdash; to be taken in view of the fact that apparently we cannot get any time in Private Members' time to take it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is nothing to stop the Government &mdash; if they do not dispute the principle of the Bill &mdash; giving time for it.

    <Title>Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill, 1986 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is in line with the Bill for the designated areas and for the improvement of the environment in the city.  It is necessary because of the deterioration in the environment of Dublin city.  It has caused a little controversy in its introduction but I do not know why.  It may be because the Minister has decided to do something about our city and its environment.</P>
      <P>There have been many complaints in the past few years about the state of the main thoroughfare from O'Connell Street to Grafton Street and also along the quays, from O'Connell Bridge to Heuston Station.  A study was carried out ten to 15 years ago by a group of archtitects from Britain.  They said that Dublin would be judged on what happens to its quays.  This legislation will help to turn the minds of the people who own property in the centre of Dublin to what has happened to it and how it appears to the citizen and to the tourist.  In that respect the Bill should be welcomed.  It is in line with the designated areas Bill and other pieces of legislation which are intended in the long term to improve the capital city.  We can add to that the recent decision by the Minister for the Environment to create a special amenity area order for the Liffey valley which is connected to the city centre.  It is amazing that legislation is required in order to get things moving.  When we get something moving there are objections to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been working for ten years &mdash; and that is what first took me into the political arena &mdash; to try to get a special amenity area order to protect the Liffey <Col N="1342" /> valley.  During the general election campaign of 1977, even though I was not then a member of any political party, I canvassed all TDs from all parties in the areas around the Liffey for their support. It is ironic that the TDs I did not get support from were Fine Gael TDs.  I got support from Fianna Fáil TDs at that time.  Ten years later a Fine Gael Minister for the Environment granted the order. That was after a large section of the population had pressed county councillors for it and objected to decisions which were made by them.  Members of the Opposition have seen fit to state that the Minister in this case is interfering with corporation members.</P>
    <P>The environment and urban renewal debate does not take the same precedence as, for example, the issue of job creation in the city.  It has not been an emotive issue up to now.  It takes people with foresight and people who are concerned with what is happening around them to try to get some interest in saving our heritage.  This is part of that scheme.  It is a tragedy for anyone who is familiar with Dublin city, particularly those born in it, to know what has happened in the past two centuries.  Those familiar with Morris Craig's book, <i>Dublin 1660-1860</i> will know that most of the good planning took place in the 18th century with the Wide Streets Commission and other bodies who were able to look to and plan for the future.  To a large extent we have destroyed that heritage.  We have not contributed very much to the future of the city either in design, architecture, layout or planning for future generations.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal is at a crisis stage.  It needs attention and what better place to start than right in the centre, on the main thoroughfares?  Most people at some stage like to walk from Stephen's Green to Parnell Square and around the shopping areas off the main streets.  That makes them feel part of the city.  Over the past couple of decades we have witnessed deterioration in standards and planning. Therefore, in that respect this small measure is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I am glad that we can pick up maybe <Col N="1343" /> £10 million as an estimated cost of what might be required to do something about this even though we are strapped for finances.  I would like to think that if other schemes can be put forward the Government will be able to see their way to getting money or investment or encouraging the private sector to invest in order to help ourselves.  This was a policy of the last Fine Gael Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave.  He always encouraged self-help in the community.  He always encouraged the community to become involved and not leave everything to the Government.  I do not know if that is the intention but that is the sort of thinking we want.  We cannot always be criticising; we must become involved ourselves.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been taken in the short time that the Minister has had this portfolio.  The Custom House dock site was another attempt at sorting out another important but neglected and devastated section of the city.  Another helpful attempt even last week in a Bill was the attempt to deal with housing through suggestions to building societies. All of this taken together will involve the people in deciding their own destiny and the future of the country environmentally. I have been saying here for a number of years that we have a beautiful country but not through our own efforts is it beautiful.  That is really accidental. It was presented to us like that.  We have a small population and not enough people to destroy our country yet but we are going rapidly in the direction of destruction not only in Dublin but in other cities and throughout the countryside as witnessed by recent and current reports on what is happening to our environment.  If the destruction starts with the capital then maybe it will spread and it will not be very long into the 21st century before our total tourist industry will be destroyed, the purpose of the £800 million that we are getting for it will be defeated to a very large extent and the only people who will be coming to visit us will be returned emigrant relatives of Irish people who are here and those <Col N="1344" /> people who travel for business or EC connections to this country.</P>
    <P>If there is any sin here it is that of doing something rather than doing nothing, of taking action instead of taking the safe way out and just sitting and not taking a chance and not making mistakes.  I myself have been accused of that in the last couple of months over daring to take action over part of the city which is crumbling. Whilst studies, work and enormous amounts of money have been expended in trying to get plans for these areas, it seems that it was never the intention to do anything or that many people do not want anyone to do anything about these plans; they just want them to stay there and to play around with them and salve their consciences by appearing to be doing something even though nothing is happening.  I am talking really about the city centre which has been a problem for nearly 20 years and the plans for the ten years since the plans were finished have just lain there.  Because somebody did something about it &mdash; not much really, just an attempt to get promoters involved &mdash; they can see that investment has been brought to the city and to this area, and there is an outcry from a few people who feel that we should do nothing with that area.</P>
    <P>The people who think we should do nothing with the area are privileged in the educational field and privileged by the opportunity provided by the taxpayer but the traditional general worker, known as a builder's labourer, who has not been fortunate enough to have got third level education or opportunity by virtue of his birth or place of birth, but who could benefit out of investment and out of urban renewal such as that does not come into the equation at all if a few gurus can come along and say that this sort of renewal cannot take place because it might disturb the decay that has been there for the last couple of hundred years and will be there for another couple of hundred years.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if 10,000 people could be taken off the unemployment register because we tackle renewal in that area, that is not a good enough reason for doing <Col N="1345" /> it because these people are not articulate enough and there are not enough people to speak out for them or to direct that something be done for them.  They will just suffer.  They have not even the opportunity of emigrating to anything worthwhile because of their lack of qualifications.  They are told that their future is on the dole and that they will have to sit in some concrete box in some part of the city and watch their children grow up and cater for them with the pittance they get on the dole, welfare or unemployment.  They are condemned in their tens of thousands to that form of life because the powers that be or the privileged classes or the establishment say that we must not interfere with the fabric of the city or with areas of the city. The sin is to do something about it.</P>
    <P>That is compounded by the sort of Doheny and Nesbitts economists who have such power now that they can virtually dictate what sort of investment should go on in the country.  Their power has extended to their being placed on the boards of some of our semi-State companies, and because they lecture in universities or are economists in professional organisations and are called upon by the Government to write consultancy reports, these people, because they are so incestuous and parochial in their outlook, are wary and give first thoughts to whether the schemes they are examining will go down well among their colleagues in Doheny and Nesbitts before they will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is better, Deputy, not to introduce personalities into the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Doheny and Nesbitts is a pub, Sir.  I have not named people.  I am just making that reference.  The preference is given to, &ldquo;What will my colleagues think?&rdquo; rather than, &ldquo;Is this good for Dublin, for Ireland, for job creation, for the future?&rdquo; That form of reliance on economists to tell us what the future has in store for us or whether we can create jobs or take risks or make decisions in any area that has come about in the last <Col N="1346" /> five to ten years is a mistake.  I hope the Opposition will not continue to oppose this legislation as they did before the recess and that they have learned their lesson.  Something that will be universally accepted should not be opposed for the sake of opposition.  Other cities around the world have embarked on this sort of renewal programme and it has worked quite well and it is a pleasure to go into these areas.  If we can have order and high standards in the city centre it will help to reduce the crime rate and improve the whole atmosphere in the centre of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Decay cannot be preferred to jobs.  In the last couple of years I have tried to draw the attention of the Minister and the head of the State body concerned to the advertising that is placed on one of the main bridges across the Liffey, that is, Butt Bridge.  The tourists and the population of the city must daily look at advertising on a huge scale just below O'Connell Bridge.  If CIE are that dependent on such advertising revenue, despite the fact that they get £100 million of taxpayers' money every year, they must be in a bad state.  I have put down questions here which were not allowed because they were not the Minister's responsibility, and that is fair enough.  I appeal to the Chairman of CIE to order the removal of all advertising from bridges, particularly those in the centre of the city, such as at Pearse Street and Butt Bridge.  These advertisements are garish and ugly.  One can actually get used to rotten surroundings.  It may shock one initially but after a long time looking at it one can get used to it.  Since I became a Member of this House, I have driven past there five days a week; I am annoyed and infuriated every time I come to Butt Bridge and have a look at advertisements for biscuits and drink and all kinds of things on a ten foot high hoarding going from the north side to the south side of the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that architectural sensitivity will, for the first time, be taken into account in the city centre area.  Maybe the &ldquo;plasticisation&rdquo; of Dublin which has <Col N="1347" /> taken place over the past ten or 20 years will be corrected.  One of the reasons places are made ugly and end up with dreadful streetscapes is lack of taste. Good taste is acquired and can be taught but a lead must be given.  Legislation has not been tried before.  This legislation has been very delicately approached.  There are no demands in it.  It is suggestion, it is nudging in a certain direction.  It is putting people who have good taste in a position where they can make judgments on what is acceptable and what is not. From that a learning process will ensue and tens of thousands of people will see that only a high standard is acceptable in the city centre and they will follow suit. This can happen alongside the restoration by a few people of the beautiful old interiors of public buildings and public houses which were ripped out in the last 20 years.  For example, this has happened at Waterloo House in the past couple of weeks.  The owner said that 20 years ago, because it was the fashionable thing to do, he ripped out the beautiful old Victorian interior and replaced it with plastic and rubbish but he has now seen sense and has spent a lot of money in restoring what was there originally.  This can happen on a much larger scale in the city centre.</P>
    <P>The Irish Tourist Board have estimated that tourists spend about a day and a half on average in Dublin; they get such a shock when they enter the city that all they want to do is to get out of it as fast as they can.  They want to get away from that awful sight of the streetscape, from the terrible traffic, from the pollution and noise and the lack of a decent transportation system.  Until we get those things right Dublin will be a problem.  I urge the Government to concentrate on a transportation system for the city, as the next step after this Bill, to improve the quality of life in Dublin.  The Dublin Planning Committee have said that unless they get a decent transportation system for this city in the next ten to 15 years, what the Minister is attempting to do in this Bill will not be possible as a very large proportion of the streetscape <Col N="1348" /> will be destroyed because we decided, in our lack of wisdom, that the future of Dublin lies in cars and not in people.  A city is its people.  We will spend hundreds of millions of pounds demolishing buildings and widening roads so that we can get cars into the city centre.  It must be remembered that cars come into the city centre for a day only then leave.  The streets will then be so wide that the people will not want to walk along them, the city centre will lose its personality and will become cold and severe.</P>
    <P>We badly need a good transport system and we need to reverse the policy of waiting 20, 30 or 40 years until the corporation have enough property to widen the streets.  When I was growing up in Dublin I did not know why there was so much dereliction.  I thought people did not have the money to carry out improvements or that they had abandoned their property.  I did not realise that the corporation had bought, by way of compulsory purchase order in some cases, the property in certain street because they wanted to widen the roads.  As I said, the corporation often had to wait up to 40 years to acquire enough property to widen the streets but in the meantime we had to suffer the dereliction that took place.</P>
    <P>If £10 million can be taken painlessly out of the coffers to encourage the improvement of the streets in the centre city, if £10 million can be taken out of the coffers to help the victims of flooding, if £100 million can be taken out of the coffers to help farmers who suffered flood damage, and if several hundred million pounds can be used to help other emergencies, may I urge the Government to concentrate their minds on the greatest emergency facing this country, namely, jobs?  Will they take a couple of million pounds to provide 10,000 jobs as a contribution towards the renewal of this city? These badly needed jobs would help to create a climate, such as Deputy Haughey was talking about last night, for investment in the city.  Listening to his appraisal of what lies ahead in the next four or five years, it came to me that the groundwork had been laid in the past <Col N="1349" /> four years.  He said he would not increase public expenditure but would create an atmosphere of investment in job creation so that we could have a growth of 2 per cent to 3 per cent and in that way reduce our deficit and solve our problems.  That is what we have been doing for the past four years.  There appears to be tacit agreement in the approach to solving this problem, and if we can put together the other piece of the jigsaw by providing investment by way of urban renewal and providing a large percentage of jobs, let us do it.  It looks as if we might have the witting or unwitting approval of the Opposition and the Government and there might be a way of agreeing what has to be done over the next five years.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that the objective was to revive the area and to restore its physical fabric to a condition that befits its status.  If we do that we will only be getting back to square one, to the time when the streets scheme was handed over to us in perfect condition. That streetscape plan was the envy of many cities throughout the world, but we have to make our contribution to improvements in this area.  That is the next task facing the Government.</P>
    <P>I unreservedly welcome this legislation and congratulate the Minister on his approach to these matters since he took over this portfolio.  The easiest thing is to do nothing, but giving due consideration to several problems in the Department and breaking new ground in the environment can only be universally welcomed. In that respect I applaud him.</P>

      <P>According to the Minister the purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission whose general duty shall be to secure improvement in environmental conditions, in the level of civic amenity and in the standard of civic design in the metropolitan area. One could be forgiven for having the impression that the Minister is saying that Dublin Corporation have failed in their responsibilities to the people of Dublin and that, in effect, the purpose of setting up this commission will be to replace <Col N="1350" /> democratically elected members of the city council, as well as the city manager and his officials.  Up to now they have had the onerous responsibility of looking after the interests of Dublin and of honouring their commitments to the people of Dublin to make our city a better place for all to live, for people to get to their destination and, at the same time, for the people to enjoy the facilities and amenities one normally expects in a capital city.</P>
      <P>In my opinion this Bill is a sham as far as the principles contained therein are concerned.  The only reason the Minister has decided to set up this commission is to take the responsibility and control of running Dublin city from the democratically elected city council, aldermen and councillors.  It is coincidental and ironic that the Minister should suddenly see fit to propose such major changes in Dublin now that the city council have been controlled by Fianna Fáil since the 1985 local elections.  This is a blatant withdrawal of the democratic rights of the people of Dublin to have some say in how their city should be run.  This is another example of the Coalition Government taking from the democratically elected council further control over their own destiny.  That is not democracy.  The Minister speaks about giving control of the city back to the people.  These are empty words, are utterly meaningless and are purely political propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the improvements and works the Minister spoke about are already being carried out by Dublin Corporation and many of them have been completed. Not so long ago Dublin City Council decided to improve the environmental standard of the central city area.  The excellent work by Dublin Corporation in the paving of Henry Street is an example of the kind of programme the council wished to pursue.  We had already pedestrianised Grafton Street, North Earl Street and Henry Street and work was well in progress in the O'Connell Street area to provide a mall with seating, additional trees, shrubbery, street furniture and other accessories which we knew were needed to make the main <Col N="1351" /> thoroughfare of our capital city something to be proud of and to admire.  Practically all the major features in this Bill were proposed by the Dublin City Centre Business Association in conjunction with Dublin City Council, nearly two years ago.  There was tremendous co-operation between the city officials and the association in coming to an agreement on many of the proposals put forward by the association during their many meetings.</P>
    <P>I have here a document prepared by the city manager, circulated to the chairman and members of the General Purposes Committee, dated 14 May 1986, which highlights many of the improvements we wished to see carried out in Dublin city.  It is not a coincidence that the Minister's Bill contains practically all of this document word for word.  This Bill was picked at a moment's notice and this document was copied to give us the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill.  It is not my intention to go through this document, but I will quote, for the purposes of the debate, some sections of the document.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of my contribution. The Bill contains many of the items in this document.  I am setting out to prove that what we have here is not a Bill prepared by the Minister but a Bill which has been pirated by the Minister and which is a copy of this document. One of the most important recommendations was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the pedestrianisation of streets, the special treatment of the street pavement surfaces, the critical examination of items of street furniture and their <Col N="1352" /> renewal or replacement as necessary. The tasteful treatment of streets in this fashion will have a spinover effect into adjoining areas and, it is hoped, will likely encourage owners of premises fronting onto them to take a special interest in their immediate environment.</P>
    <P>This is also contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>and to reflect this by way of improvement in the treatment of their own frontages, sympathetic material in shopfronts and sign writing, window displays, floral displays in window boxes etc.</P>
    <P>The document pointed out that the programme of works would of course be subject to budget constraints.  All local authorities, particularly Dublin Corporation have been subject to serious budget constraints over the past number of years.  The money coming from central Government to Dublin City Council has been cut year by year from 1983, in real terms.  The document went on to point out the major works that should be carried out in the Grafton Street area.  It was also intended to have a design for the O'Connell Street area which is our</P>
    <P>major national street prepared with a view to undertaking major renewal in a phased programme as funding is available.  The Centre Mall has been identified as having real potential as a pedestrian route.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's contribution great emphasis was placed on the O'Connell Street area.  We all accept that something has to be done about O'Connell Street. This was already undertaken by Dublin Corporation whose only problem related to finance to carry out the programmes that had been planned in conjunction with the management, the elected city council and the Street Traders Association.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is aware of the facts.  Apart from being a former Lord Mayor of Dublin and a city councillor, he was the guest speaker at a conference <Col N="1353" /> organised by that association in September 1985.  During that conference the city manager specifically outlined the plans of Dublin Corporation for the future development of the city and made it very clear that many of the works proposed to be carried out by the Corporation were those covered in this Bill as set out by the Minister for the Environment at his press conference in the summer.  We all accept that there are many deficiencies in Dublin city and that there are problems and difficulties, compared to other modern European cities which had been rebuilt and redeveloped after the last war.  We are also aware of many other capital cities which have more problems than we have and which do not have nearly half the attractive amenities or environmental qualities we have.</P>
    <P>For the past number of years Dublin Corporation have had to carry out their duties on a shoe string budget from central Government.  The Minister launching this Bill to a hand picked audience at a reception last June was euphoric about the provision of £10 million to the commission for its project.  This grant will be over a three year period, less a contribution to be paid each year by Dublin Corporation.  The contribution has not yet been fixed.  The Dublin Corporation budget for 1986 is something in the region of £292 million to cover works carried out all over the city.  As far as the centre city area is concerned many millions of pounds have been budgeted for this year alone for street decoration, pedestrianisation, cleansing, clearing of litter, lighting, paving and so on.  Is it the Minister's intention to take from Dublin Corporation the amount of money that the Department consider would otherwise be spent by Dublin Corporation in the areas I have mentioned if the commission had not come into existence?  If that is the case this £10 million over a three year period will disappear and there will not be a grant at all.  Present expenditure in the city centre on the areas covered in this Bill is far in excess of what the Minister has talked about, which is something in the region of £3.3 million per year. <Col N="1354" /> The cost would be nearer £10 million in one year to cover all the responsibilities outlined which are contained in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Nobody is more aware of what is needed to improve the image and amenities of Dublin city than the city officials and their only problem over the years has been a shortage of finance.  A grant of £10 million over three years will do little when compared to what would be required to achieve the objectives.  If this Bill is passed the goodwill of many city officials will be lost and the results can only be detrimental to the future of the city.  The officials feel very slighted that the Minister has passed this vote of no confidence in their ability to carry out their responsibilities and functions.  The Minister did a bad day's work for Dublin city and he will not be allowed to forget this in the future.  The functions outlined in this Bill cannot be carried out in isolation as many of the works and responsibilities of Dublin Corporation criss-cross other Departments and require the fullest co-operation and liaison with other workers in different Departments to function in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill states that the commission shall consist of a chairman and not more than six ordinary members. <Col N="1355" /> Who will these members be?  What type of experience will they have had in the affairs of the city?  Above all, will any of these members have a vested interest? Active traders in the business centre should not be members of the commission as they could very easily be accused by other parties of acting in a way which could be detrimental to other traders and their actions might be misinterpreted as being in their own self-interest. I wish to make it clear, however, that I am not making any advance accusations against any traders but I can see that there could be a very serious conflict of interest.  The last thing one would wish to see is that the development of the city centre would be held up or become an area of conflict which would be detrimental to its future development.</P>
    <P>It has already been indicated by the Minister that the city manager should be a member of the commission.  The manager is a very highly respected person in Dublin city and has been very active in pursuing what is good for the future of the city, but he could be excused if he was somewhat reluctant to be a very small part of this commission as he must feel that his ability to lead his officials has been questioned by the Minister.  He must also realise that the Minister is doing this purely for political purposes and, as always, in mad pursuit of taking away power from the democratically elected aldermen and councillors.</P>
    <P>Legislation was passed not long ago setting up the Dublin Transport Authority but this Bill seems to take away many of the responsibilities from that authority which had been invested in them by legislation.  This Bill appears to cut across a number of other departments within Dublin Corporation, for example, roads and traffic, community and environment, parks and planning, the cleansing department and of course the finance department.  Is it also envisaged to eliminate the role of the Garda traffic department? Will the commission be operating in liaison with the Garda?  These are questions which the Bill does not clarify.  None of these questions has been answered <Col N="1356" /> during this debate and the Minister failed to clarify them in his contribution.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very vague which indicates that it was hastily drawn up legislation prior to the recess in order to give the Minister an opportunity to save face after he had been rebuked by the Taoiseach in regard to the proposed motorway planned to run in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral.  It will be remembered that the Minister acted in a highhanded and cavalier fashion in giving the green light for the demolition of this old quarter of Dublin, much against the wishes of all the experts including An Taisce, the Dean of St. Patrick's and the elected city council including his Fine Gael colleagues who are members of the council.</P>
    <P>Following that decision a major controversy blew up and it was only after the intervention of the Fianna Fáil Party Leader and a specially convened meeting of Dublin City Council which rejected the Minister's proposals that the Taoiseach did a U-turn on the issue.  In doing so he embarrassed the Minister for the Environment and it was very clear that the Minister had made a major blunder. It was in that context that this Bill was introduced.  An effort was made to push it through the Dáil prior to the summer recess.  Having failed to do this and following the withdrawal of the Bill in the Dáil by the Government, the Minister proceeded to have it rushed through the Seanad.  It is now back in this House despite the fact that we should be discussing much more urgent and important legislation such as the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill the Second Stage of which was completed last evening but Committee Stage remains to be done.  That Bill is very urgent and more time should have been given to it over the past two weeks as its provisions will alleviate the problems of many homeless families.</P>
    <P>Section 5 refers to an improvement in environmental conditions with special reference to the general appearance of streets and buildings.  This would be highly commendable except for the fact that last year the Minister led a massive promotional campaign for cleaner streets <Col N="1357" /> and increased dramatically on the spot fines not only for those caught in the act of dumping rubbish but also for pedestrians and motorists who threw cigarette or match boxes or any other litter on the streets.  However, these measures were not enforced and when the Minister had completed the publicly campaign nothing more was heard of it until this Bill was introduced.  Replying to my question some time ago regarding this matter, the city manager informed me that, due to lack of funds, only one litter warden was employed by Dublin Corporation and something in the region of 12 charges had been brought against persons in one year who were found littering our streets.  Subsequently, even that one warden was withdrawn for financial reasons as other equally important work had to be done in the cleansing department and, due to lack of finance, the corporation had no alternative but to transfer the litter warden to other work and responsibilities. This, therefore, indicates that the massive anti-litter campaigns in the past were publicity stunts because nothing happened since.  A few short weeks after the announcement, no effort whatever was being made by the Department to assist the corporation or local authorities in imposing those measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know how much it takes to keep our streets clean and just because a commission is appointed does not mean that circumstances will change overnight.  Unless we provide sufficient finance to the relevant authorities to carry out their responsibilities, we can understand the difficulties of these authorities. The nub of the problem is finance and if this was given to the corporation by the Minister without setting up a commission, there is no reason why an effective and successful campaign &mdash; such as the anit-litter campaign &mdash; could not be waged against those who seem to have <Col N="1358" /> little or no respect for the appearance of our streets.</P>
      <P>Section 11 deals with the removal or alteration of structures or other unsightly signs.  This is a very interesting section as I am at a loss to understand how the commission can enforce this legislation. Planning laws are already in existence covering this area and we are faced with the question which had gone unanswered. What will be the relationship of the commission to the planning authorities? Who will supersede whom? Where does the final decision lie if action has to be taken?  The Bill does not lay down any penalties for those who fail to respond to notices to remove unauthorised structures, unauthorised signs or to improve the appearance of buildings, shop fronts or whatever is required.  Who will be responsible for the costs of removing these structures or improving shop fronts?  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the law whereby owners of buildings can claim compensation from the local authority if they are forced to carry out alterations which would dramatically change the appearance of the existing building.  I fail to see any financial provisions in the Bill for this possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister was genuinely interested in bringing about an improvement in the appearance of the city centre area he would, first, have called in the officials of An Bord Pleanála to ask them why they had on numerous occasions granted planning permission to amusement arcades, gaming halls and the many fast food shops which have sprung up all over the city centre area, particularly in the O'Connell Street, Abbey Street and Henry Street area despite the fact the Dublin Corporation planning officers had rejected those applications initially. Many of the problems in the city centre and suburban areas have been caused by the activities of such arcades and shops where planning permission had been granted by An Bord Pleanála on appeal. Dublin City Council have faced this problem on many occasions.  Recently I received information that in the region of 80 per cent of appeals submitted by these applicants have been granted by <Col N="1359" /> An Bord Pleanála against the wisdom, judgment and decision of the local planning authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Who granted the gaming licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something radically wrong where the local planning authority who have the reputation of being reasonably flexible are overridden subsequently by An Bord Pleanála without any reference to the other parties involved such as residents living nearby, other traders or even the local Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another debate we are waiting for in the House.  The Minister is taking a long time to introduce that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation granted those gaming licences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>There are hundreds of unsightly signs, both plastic and otherwise, overlooking O'Connell Street. These are destroying the appearance of the street and the environment but most of them arise from the type of business I refer to.  As I indicated, at least 80 per cent of these appeals were granted by An Bord Pleanála.  I would like to see greater liaison between the board and the local planning authority.  If the Minister was in a position to do something in that respect, he would be doing a good day's work for everybody concerned and for the appearance of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other unauthorised businesses in operation in the city area. Many of the people concerned, knowing how the law operates, have been in and out of court for many years but nevertheless continue to operate in an unauthorised way.  This is an obvious area where the Minister for Justice should channel some of his views and time and introduce legislation which will take care <Col N="1360" /> of this blatant abuse of the planning laws. The reason I emphasise this point is because provisions are made within the Bill in relation to planning matters in the city centre area.</P>
    <P>Section I of the Second Schedule which relates to improvements refers to renewal of buildings and facades in need of improvement, redecoration, renovation or renewal.  This section also deals with the renewal of roadways, footpaths, traffic islands, resurfacing and repaving. The Minister has put no cost on this work. All of these works have for many years been part and parcel of the responsibilities of Dublin Corporation.  If the money was made available to the corporation, all of these works would have been carried out in a very fast and efficient manner.  The fact that we are setting up a commission will not change things overnight unless sufficient funds are made available.  If sufficient funds were made available to carry out these works, there would be no need to set up a commission.  Dublin Corporation are capable of carrying out these functions without the assistance of a commission. Indeed, the commission might impede some of these programmes.  It is unfortunate that the Minister has seen fit to take this retrograde step of setting up another bureaucratic body which will be powerless and toothless so far as the implementation of the various works are concerned.</P>
    <P>One should not overlook the achievements of Dublin Corporation in recent years, particularly the marvellous work they have carried out in so many of our parks such as Fairview and St. Anne's. The rose garden in St. Anne's is one of the finest and most attractive in the world.  I had the pleasure earlier this year of meeting many people from different parts of the world, from as far away as Australia, who had come to Dublin to participate in the world rose championships. The praise these people lavished on St. Anne's made me proud.  I was absolutely delighted to be able to express those views and to pass on the many compliments to the head of the parks department.  Great progress has <Col N="1361" /> been achieved in other parks such as Elm Mount in Santry.  There are many beautiful parks all over the city.  These are a tremendous amenity to the people living in those areas.  Dublin Corporation who have developed these parks deserve lavish praise.  They have proved beyond doubt how capable they are of carrying out their work and functions if sufficient funds are made available.</P>
    <P>The new inner city housing programme which the corporation commenced a few years back has brought tremendous improvements to the appearance of our city.  There is no doubt that so far as providing attractive local authority housing in a capital city is concerned, Dublin is undoubtedly the leader.  That is evident from the fact that many delegations from other countries have come to Dublin to view the schemes and talk to the city architects and officials.  I am very confident that given the necessary and required finance Dublin Corporation could undoubtedly redevelop our capital and its amenities to a standard which would match the best in any part of the world.  It is a great pity that they have not received the full support and co-operation they are entitled to receive from the Minister's Department and other semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to refer to the great problems caused by CIE so far as their bus fleet is concerned in the city centre.  For too long CIE have allowed their buses to fall into a terrible condition. Particularly in the city centre the air is badly polluted by fumes from noisy buses.  Our roadways are destroyed by grease and oil and noise levels are unacceptably high.  The manner in which CIE have taken over the city streets is most irresponsible and shows little regard for other people, be they motorists, cyclists or pedestrians.  CIE have used our main streets for the purpose of parking their buses for hours during the day.  In residential areas they have caused all sorts of problems to residents by the location of bus stops and the routes they have chosen.  Regulations should be introduced whereby CIE would have to seek planning permission for the location of <Col N="1362" /> bus stops and permission also to run their buses through certain residential areas.</P>
    <P>CIE are far too much inclined to act in a very irresponsible fashion and to make their own arrangements even though these might be unsuitable, dangerous or inconvenient to residents or other users of the road.  I accept that there is an obligation and responsibility on CIE to provide a bus service in the city area but that is not to say that they should take all their own decisions in isolation and without due reference to any other bodies of responsibility where the views and requirements of other citizens could be taken into consideration.  It is ridiculous that even the Garda have no say as to where CIE locate bus stops or the routes of their buses.  That surely is wrong.  If there is bad management in a company and they have an open range, like CIE appear to have in the Dublin area, their inefficiency can have a serious effect on everybody.</P>
    <P>The Bill, if passed, will be a negative piece of legislation.  It will do nothing for the city and will only add one more strand of bureaucracy.  Dublin Corporation should have been given more finance and more responsibility.  The Minister deserves no credit whatever for endeavouring to bulldoze this type of legislation through the Dáil at a time when the Government should be giving attention to more serious problems.  The Minister would be better off looking at our planning laws that are treated with such contempt by so many people in the city.  He should do something to update those laws and help provide a much better environment and a better city for the benefit of all citizens.</P>
    <P>Last week a colleague of the Minister, Deputy John Kelly, in the course of the debate on the Bill made a scathing attack on Dublin Corporation.  That attack was unfair and unjustified in that it was directed at the officials of the corporation who are not in a position to defend themselves. A contribution like that from an experienced Member such as Deputy Kelly does not do anything for him or the corporation.  I condemn his remarks. Deputy Kelly appears to have a chip on <Col N="1363" /> his shoulder as far as local authorities are concerned and that has come clear on other occasions in the House.  The officials of Dublin Corporation at all levels have been treated shabbily by Deputy Kelly.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a vote of no confidence in the management and staff of the corporation.  I hope the Minister, if Second Stage is passed, will see fit to accept major amendments to the Bill. The best thing the Minister can do is to withdraw it and give the corporation the finance and the power they lack at present so that they can do a better job for Dublin city.  The corporation are capable of doing that.</P>

      <P>In the Bill the Minister proposes to establish a commission, entitled the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, which will be under his direct control.  The Minister has set out clearly how he plans to control the commission whose function it will be to improve the environment, amenities and safety for pedestrians along the Grafton Street/O'Connell Street spine.  We welcome any realistic and practical plan to improve Dublin city.  Indeed, we have participated fully in carrying out improvements in the city in recent years. However, we unreservedly condemn the Minister for his high-handed and undemocratic plan to undermine the position of the elected councillors by taking responsibilities from them and giving them to a seven person commission to be appointed or dismissed by him at will.  This represents a last minute attempt by a lame duck Government whose time has run out, to bypass elected representatives.</P>
      <P>The Government parties know that the Coalition is dead and the Taoiseach made that clear at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis. The Labour Party also made that point clear.  The Government are aware that only 22 per cent of the people are satisfied with their performance, according to the most recent opinion poll published last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an effort by the Minister to <Col N="1364" /> buy himself into the future through this commission but in so doing he is acting in an extremely high-handed fashion. Basically, what he is planning is good but it is an idea that emerged from the corporation.  The idea has been hijacked by the Minister who wants to exclude public representatives from any participation in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have produced an integrated programme involving the corporation and public representatives.  He should have given them the £10 million to get on with this job.  The corporation are capable of doing the work if they are given the resources.  The Minister is aware that the corporation completed many excellent schemes in the city when they were given the resources.  He should give the corporation the resources needed to carry out the work he considers a priority.  I do not think he would have any difficulty with the corporation officials if he wished to specify a programme for high priority.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister picking seven people who are not elected by the public and whose only qualification is that they are considered by him to be capable of doing a better job than the corporation officials and the public representatives? This reminds me of the approach of the Taoiseach, having three wise men to do everything.  The Minister's proposal is to appoint seven people deemed by him to be wiser, more capable and competent than the corporation and public representatives. I do not agree with that.  I accept that wise people or experts should be involved in the corporation's programmes. They have a significant and important part to play in those programmes but that programme should be devised and spearheaded by the democratically elected people who are given the job of carrying out such tasks on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>No amount of smoke-screening or confusion by the Government, or the Minister, will get away from the fact that this is an undemocratic approach, an attempt to set aside the democratically elected representatives.  One cannot but be <Col N="1365" /> impressed by the standard of representatives from all parties elected to the corporation in the recent elections. Those elected are capable of tackling Dublin's problems.  I agree with the Minister that as our capital city Dublin is important not only to the people of Dublin but to the population of the country. It is also an important tourist centre and for that reason the Minister's objective is one we all share.  However, Dublin has become a city of shutters.  The area dealt with in the Bill is shuttered up and protected because of the extent of crime and vandalism.  People are afraid to walk along the streets, particularly at night, because of the amount of crime and vandalism. We have been told that 60 per cent of all indictable crimes occur in Dublin city and that 256,000 non-indictable crimes are committed in that city. Crime has a major bearing on life in the inner city and the area dealt with in the Bill.  Consequently, any plans to improve the area must include a provision to allocate more gardaí to patrol the area and communicate with the business people.</P>
    <P>We know that the incidence of malicious damage to cars, of robbery and of personal attack is at a very high level in Dublin.  There will no longer be compensation for malicious damage to cars because that provision has been removed.  It costs in the region of £8 million or £10 million a year in the Dublin area alone.  By doing away with malicious damage to cars of Dublin citizens the Minister would be freeing for other uses far more than the amount involved here.</P>
    <P>Crime is important in this area.  Some businesses in the area the Minister has defined cannot get insurance or cannot pay the high level of premium demanded because of the frequency of break-ins. There is a major drugs problem in this area.  It is a problem which can be tackled if the resources are applied.  Unless this is done, the drugs problem will continue and the Minister will simply say that it has &ldquo;plateaued out&rdquo;.  Plateaus are normally on mountain tops and the drugs problem in Dublin city is on the top of a mountain. It is at far too high a level and must be <Col N="1366" /> reduced.  The resources must be applied along the spine the Minister has mentioned. This areas suffers very much from drug trafficking and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the Minister can achieve his objective of improving that area without involving the Garda Síochána in the plans, as well as the public representatives. I do not see how he will achieve anything of lasting value.  Of course a few facades can be changed here and there.  The appearance of things can be changed but the substance will remain the same.  What is required is an integrated approach by the different groups who are directly involved in the city area. We must realise, of course, that the greater Dublin area has very extensive problems of a similar nature and is in need of resources and attention.  Many of the new towns and housing developments around the city need resources to develop their appearance and amenities.  That will have its own effect on the development which the Minister proposes in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister get away from the idea of having an integrated approach?  He seems to be stoutly resisting this idea.  Indeed, the Government have continually resisted the proposals to prepare an integrated development programme for the Dublin region, a programme which clearly would have the full support of the European Community, which recognises the need for a strong emphasis on integrated operations.  Yet here the Minister is going absolutely in the opposite direction, proposing not only one specific development but taking that development out of the hands of the people who are directly responsible for the overall integrated development of Dublin city.  By shutting out the corporation, the Coalition are showing contempt for local democracy and local public representatives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady has dealt with many of the detailed aspects of the work done by Dublin Corporation.  I agree entirely with him.  It has been my experience that, where they have the necessary resources and the involvement of the public representatives, they have given excellent <Col N="1367" /> service to this city.  They are fully capable of doing that in an integrated way in the plans which are before this House.  They may have to pick up the pieces when the Minister is long gone and the developments started by this plan are still only at the teething stage.  Section 4(1) provides as follows:</P>
    <P>Not later than three years after the establishment of the Commission the Minister shall by order (in this section, other than subsection (5), referred to as a &ldquo;dissolution order&rdquo;) provide for the dissolution of the commission.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that there are many technical difficulties to be overcome. I have to agree with the Minister as to the need for specifying these objectives and overcoming as dynamically as possible the impediments and technicalities which are in the way.  I have no disagreement with him in that respect. There is a need to specify particular objectives and to pursue them vigorously, overcoming the technical difficulties which must be surmounted.  He would do that far better if his proposals were applied within the framework of our local democracy.  Not only in the short term could he achieve more, but certainly in the long term when there would be more opportunity for participating in those achievements.</P>
    <P>The need is for specified finance &mdash; money allocated specifically for a task which is clearly identified.  Secondly, there must be a commitment to doing that specific job.  The job the Minister has in mind is certainly well worth doing, provided it is integrated with the other elements involved.  Thirdly, there is a need for an integrated plan and an integated approach.  The local authority must be involved, particularly the public representatives. Finally, it is crucial to involve the Garda Síocháin because of their onerous responsibilities in the area. This could all be done through the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister would find that if instead of fighting local authorities, disagreeing with the officials and later needing their <Col N="1368" /> support he worked through them he would have the full support of this side of the House for a dynamic approach to the problems of our capital city.  This would leave us all feeling very proud of the achievements in development, as we are of many of the individual achievements of Dublin Corporation to date.  It is our job as public representatives to indicate and specify the priorities which should be pursued and to provide the resources to pursue them.  Regrettably, in this Bill the Minister is going about it the wrong way.  I advise him to look again at the Bill and consider how he can integrate the proposals into the work of the local authority and involve public representatives and corporation officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett (Dublin North-West)</NameTxt>
      <P>As an elected member of Dublin Corporation, I very much welcome the opportunity to make a few remarks on this Bill, the purpose of which is to set up a commission for the development and redesigning of the city of Dublin.  The implications of this Bill can only be seen as taking away authority and democracy from the local authority in so far as they will have no function whatsoever in relation to the proposed design and development which this legislation proposes to bring about.  When the Bill becomes law the members of Dublin Corporation will have no function in city centre affairs.  That function of the elected members will be taken over by members of the commission and the members of the city council will have no input into the proposed plans.  Those plans can have an effect on the environment of the city and of its business life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill transfers to the commission the functions of Dublin Corporation in relation to the construction, maintenance and improvement of the public roads in the metropolitan central area.  My reading of the Bill is that when it becomes law the proposed commission will have full authority over the development and running of Dublin city.  That will take away authority from the members of the city council who were elected by the people of Dublin and who <Col N="1369" /> are answerable to those who elected them.  They are answerable for every development in the city of Dublin in relation to how it could affect the business life and environment of the city.</P>
    <P>The Minister, according to the proposals in this Bill, will allocate £10 million and this money will be made available to the commission.  If that sum were given to Dublin Corporation they have indicated they would be prepared to undertake this development.  They have the experience and the personnel, the vision and expertise to carry out the development that would be required.  The Bill also removes some responsibility from the Dublin Transportation Authority in so far as the commission will be responsible for the movement of traffic in the city and that authority have not even got off the ground.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an insult to Dublin Corporation, their elected members, officials and staff.  The Minister has not outlined how the £10 million will be spent and where this money will come from.  It is just stated the Minister for Finance will transfer this amount to the Minister and he in turn will pass it on to the commission. It is most important that Dublin Corporation have an input into decisions the commission make, in particular in relation to planning and development. Otherwise local democracy will not be allowed to operate.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil do not agree with the implications of this Bill because if any policy is to work satisfactorily it must have the goodwill of the people.  By introducing it the Minister and the Government are showing contempt for local committees and for real democracy.  It takes away the confidence of the local people.  Dublin Corporation must be complimented and congratulated on their achievements in recent years for the many fine schemes, particularly housing schemes, they have built in the city of Dublin.  Some very attractive schemes have been carried out which have improved Dublin's image, the many housing development schemes in and around the city, particularly those in the centre city, the development and paving <Col N="1370" /> of Henry Street and the plan which the corporation have to carry out further paving schemes in adjoining streets.  The pedestrianisation of Henry Street and Grafton Street is another development which Dublin Corporation have carried out, as is the development of the small parks within the inner city and the decoration of the city for all festive occasions and events.</P>
    <P>All these developments and improvements have been carried out with the full agreement of the city council and the advice and expertise of the Dublin Corporation officials.  The members of Dublin Corporation are proud of their officials.  Every elected member of Dublin City Council welcomes plans for design and improvement in Dublin city, providing the elected members have a say in those plans.  Under the present Bill the commission will decide on the design of the city but when the commission have completed their term of office, who will take over the liabilities?  Will Dublin Corporation be expected to take full responsibility for any developments which the commission may carry out?  It would be most unfair of the Minister and the Government to expect that body, in a case of disagreement with the commission, to have to make a financial contribution towards costs in relation to legal and other expenses that might be incurred.</P>
    <P>Will the grant of £10 million to be allocated to the commission have any effect on the subvention grant which is paid to Dublin Corporation?  Will they be paid the same level of grants as other councils?  Will their grant be reduced because of this allocation?  I should like the Minister in his summing up of this debate to deal with those matters.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill it is proposed to confer by order the enforcement powers of Dublin Corporation on the commission. The problems of the planning department of Dublin Corporation will be rendered even more difficult because the planning authority will rest with them but the enforcement of authority in respect of some matters will rest with the streets commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> Members of Dublin Corporation are at present reviewing the development plan. I notice that there is no reference to the development plan in the Bill.  Indeed, the present state of the city of Dublin could be attributed to the activities of another body established by the Government. Here I refer to An Bord Pleanála.  An Bord Pleanála have over-ruled all decisions of the planning committee of Dublin Corporation and of the Dublin City Council in granting applications to have premises converted to gambling halls and take-away food shops that have turned a once beautiful O'Connell Street into a Las Vegas.</P>
    <P>That board, somewhat similar to the commission the Minister proposes setting up, are not answerable to anybody; they take decisions themselves, indeed, it can be said that they are wholly responsible for the present state of the city of Dublin and many of the streets on the outskirts. Yet the elected members of Dublin Corporation opposed all development because of local objections.  Those elected local representatives had the confidence of the people on the ground who were aware of the implications of those proposed developments which, if implemented, would lead to the destruction of the city and its overall appearance. An Bord Pleanála must accept full responsibility for the present state of Dublin city.  Can the Minister guarantee that the members of the proposed streets commission will demonstrate any more vision or consideration for local people or their environment?</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will place Dublin Corporation in the back seat, completely deprived of the democracy previously enjoyed by the elected members of Dublin Corporation and of the Dublin City Council.  Henceforth they will have no part to play in the overall development or design of the city. As far as planning and design are concerned the Government must be well down in the league.  We remember when, in 1981, the Taoiseach, on television, outlined the Government's plans for what he described as the Tivoli gardens of the city <Col N="1372" /> of Dublin, the plans for having water boats sailing on the River Liffey.  It was around the same time that the Taoiseach and the Government promised that every woman in Ireland would receive £9.60 per week, that they would not even have to collect it, that postmen would drop the envelopes in their letterboxes.</P>
    <P>Under this Government local government has been driven into the background, mainly because of lack of finance for local authorities.  Dublin Corporation's housing stock is in a state of dereliction because of lack of finance to carry out the necessary repairs.  For example, there are at present approximately 300 flats lying vacant in Ballymun. Those flats will remain vacant as Dublin Corporation have not the requisite manpower or finance because of Government cut-backs.  I should be interested to know from where the £10 million the Minister proposes making available to the streets commission will emanate.  This Government appear to say continuously that there are no funds available.  Yet, out of the blue, millions of pounds can be found, from where I do not know.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, local elections were due to be held in 1984.  The then Minister for the Environment and the Government decided to postpone those elections, the reason being given that the Government intended to introduce what was described as local government reform.  Part of that reform was to afford local authority members more power and say in the running of their affairs.  I question whether the provisions of the Bill before us are along the lines the Government and Minister proposed at that time, in other words, to give local authorities more power and say in the running of their affairs.  It is my contention that the provisions of this Bill take away any say local authorities had in their affairs.  It should be remembered that those local representatives were elected by and are responsible to the people.  They will have no hand, act or part to play in the development proposed under the provisions of this Bill.  Under the local government reform package there was a proposal to establish what was to be <Col N="1373" /> known as a metropolitan council in Dublin, consisting of members of Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and of Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.</P>
    <P>The local elections were held in June 1985, the results of which we all know. Yet we have not seen any evidence of local government reform or the establishment of that so-called metropolitan council.  I am aware that Dublin Corporation would be prepared to carry out the work.  I would have every confidence that, were they provided with the requisite funds, they would do a far better job than any proposed commission.  They have the staff, engineers and so on, with the expertise and experience to undertake the task supposed to be undertaken by the proposed commission.</P>
    <P>Since this Government assumed office there have been severe cut-backs in funding to local authorities, causing them grave problems.  That is the most serious problem confronting elected representatives at present.  I should be interested to know if the members of this proposed commission would have any expertise or experience in the type of development proposed under this Bill. For example, will their members have any specific qualifications?  It should be remembered that the members will be appointed by the Minister.  I wonder if they will be selected because of their political affiliations rather than their experience.  If the former applies I would be gravely concerned that it would lead to the total destruction of the city.</P>
    <P>There has been much publicity in the media generally about Deputy Skelly's plans and proposals for the city centre.  I wonder if the Government or the Minister will recommend to the proposed commission that they should initiate Deputy Skelly's plan.  Perhaps the Minister will inform us if Deputy Skelly's plan will be implemented or included in the overall plan for the city.  Deputy Skelly is to be informed by the 20th of this month whether his proposals will be agreed or implemented.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the remarks of my colleague, Deputy Woods, about the extent of crime and vandalism in this <Col N="1374" /> city, indeed the way people are being intimidated.  There have been reports in the media of protection rackets, that many unfortunate shopkeepers have to pay in order to maintain their premises and continue trading in the city centre. Also we have a serious drugs problem. The number of gardaí available for patrol duty in the city centre is not nearly sufficient to cope satisfactorily with the serious problems being encountered.  Neither do the gardaí have sufficient resources with which to deal with those problems. It is regrettable that neither the gardaí nor elected representatives will have any hand, act or part to play in the activities of the proposed commission.</P>
    <P>What is needed is the provision of sufficient finance.  If this is done Dublin Corporation will be well qualified to do this job.  Fianna Fáil are very concerned about the implications of this Bill because it completely shuts off the democracy to which the elected members are entitled. It is a cosmetic measure which excludes the elected members from being part of the commission.  It excludes the views of the local people and elected representatives and they are replaced by people appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle I welcome the commitment by the Government in investing both political priority and finance in dealing with the very serious problems of degeneration and confused planning in the city centre.  Much of the criticism of the initiative has confused us. I do not think it is important how a job is done.  What is far more important is that it be done.  I find it a source of some bemusement how people can be shrill in their criticism of additional investment when the same people have been loud in their demands that that investment be made over many years.  Any Government who give money and propose a solution for a problem should be applauded and should get some degree of credit for it. The structure that is proposed may not necessarily solve the problem.  The paramaters within which the approach is being made are fairly clear.  They are narrowly defined.  They are precise as to their <Col N="1375" /> location, their likely impact and their funding.  The scale of the problem has been pointed out by many speakers who have been critical of this Bill.  The problem is very serious.</P>
      <P>I will mention two or three points which have not been dealt with properly in the course of Second Stage discussions so far.  The essential problem in relation to Dublin city centre is not a question of bad management or the quality of management. It is essentially a question of the structure of management.  Much criticism has been levied at the planning board and, by implication, at Dublin Corporation who are in the first instance the planning authority.  A recent application relating to a building on the corner of O'Connell Street and Abbey Street which is now one of the fast food stores was the subject of much criticism.  At the time people were unrealistic in their attack on this new development.  There was an empty building on that site.  Very often planning is not about a choice between what eventually emerges and what would otherwise have been ideal, but a choice between what emerges and wasteland or derelict sites or houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are sometimes a little less than frank about assessing difficulties such as this.  None of us wants to see what Deputy Michael Barrett described as a Las Vegas.  I do not think we have any casinos in Dublin at present.  I would not be against that possibility if it were proposed in due course.  The people should decide the shape of their city, the choices they want in their city and the planning norms and standards.  The people are represented by a number of structures, the local authority and by central Government. Ultimately it is what the people want that should apply.  It seems to be nonsensical that people many of whom live nowhere near the city and never had any experience of it should be critical of the way the city is developing.  They believe that the city centre should be some kind of an esoteric exotic area which is nice to gaze at but which is not a living, vibrant city which is useful to <Col N="1376" /> people and functional in terms of the needs of people.</P>
    <P>The problem with Dublin city is that nobody is responsible for its absolute management.  It is managed by a plethora of agencies, bodies and organisations. Let us look at the area of traffic.  Dublin Corporation build the roads; the Garda regulate traffic enforcement; CIE run public transport; the taxi services operate independently; and traffic wardens operate although they are obviously part of the traffic regulatory mechanism operated at one time under the local authority but now under the Garda.  It is a multifaceted approach to management of traffic alone.  I have been very involved in committees over the years trying to rebuild parts of the city centre in terms of housing.  The local authority have been extremely successful in that respect.  It is not just a housing problem.  I remember suggesting that the new housing development in the Seán MacDermott Street area at the back of the Gresham Hotel should be a totally new plan which would revise traffic patterns.  That was outside the remit of the local authority and, therefore, we had the old traffic patterns with the new houses.  Accordingly we have difficult residential arrangements. For example, children are expected to study at night six to eight feet from traffic travelling by the windows.  The reason is that nobody got all the bits of the jigsaw, forced them together into one amalgam and gave somebody the responsibility of managing the city.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as an earnest attempt to do something about the city centre but, nevertheless, it creates another new structure.  We have the same liaison, consultations, informal discussions and talks with the local authorities, the Garda, the planners, the city centre business association and the organisations which represent various aspects of it.  It is another reason for inertia.  What is needed is a sharply focused management arrangement which would allow for all of the facets that make up good city management to be handled in one forum.  That is not to say that it should be undemocratic or autocratic, <Col N="1377" /> but the various elements that work independently at present should be focused inwards to that centre and their operations harmonised so as to produce a city that is clearly being managed.  That is not happening now.</P>
    <P>The converse of that is that the city is growing.  The result is that in a few years time we will have an urban ribbon stretching virtually unbroken along the east coast from Belfast to Waterford with the very big bulk of it in the Dublin area. That is not good for anybody.  There is a desirable upper limit to the size of a city. That should not be dictated by Government but should be encouraged and aspired to.  Planning approaches, grant incentives and the whole area of commercial development and draft development plans of local authorities, all the areas that the Government and local authorities can make a contribution to, should be focused and designed to bring about that desired norm as the standard size of a city.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has read <i>Small Is Beautiful</i> by Schumacher will know what I am talking about.  I concur with that kind of approach.  When a city grows it becomes unhealthy in a number of respects and inevitable patterns emerge.  The centre becomes depopulated except quite often for very elderly people or relatively poor people.  Fringe areas become the areas in which to live.  Certain city centre streets become office block areas, mausoleums at night.  People who come to work there during the day see them as places in which they can function for a period of hours and then leave.</P>
    <P>Therefore, city management is the problem, not whether the local authority can manage this Bill or not.  The local authority, like any other organisation, like political parties, are means to ends. They are not particularly important in themselves.  They should evolve and change regularly.  I will be happy enough if the local authority do what they do well.  They cannot be faulted on a great amount of what they do because they are circumscribed and limited in so many ways.  For example, if the local authority wish to clean up a simple thing like public <Col N="1378" /> house street furniture or clutter on the streets they have no power to do that. They have no function to tell CIE not to put a bus stop free standing on the edge of a path where blind and elderly people find themselves hampered and impeded but instead to put the bus stop sign on a lamp standard.  The city manager with a budget of something like £260 million this year has not power to do that.  That is a small indication of the lack of co-ordinated, focused planning I am talking about.  Therefore, some of the criticism we have had is misguided.</P>
    <P>It is about time we stopped all the denigration of the city.  The city has improved.  There are problems there to be sure, but talk about about the city being destroyed is negative nonsense.  I have lived in the city since I was a child and I have seen how it has grown.  There are problems and difficulties but it is still a fine city in many respects, and the image we portray, exchanging negative and depressive remarks, does not help or uplift anybody.  There are people living in these areas and we have their self-image to think about.  We should be balanced in our approach.  There are problems certainly, particularly in the city centre at present, but we should have a sense of balance.  There are also huge improvements.  It is not so many years ago since there were ghettoes within 500 yards of O'Connell Street which are not there now.  That is the positive side.</P>
    <P>With regard to the manner in which this Bill will impact on local authorities, I am not perturbed about whether the local authorities are intrinsically involved in it.  In a sense it is sour grapes, mainly by councillors incidentally.  I have not heard management going on in this way at all.  Maybe management tend to be silent in these matters, but some councillors apparently have taken umbrage at the fact that they have not been given more power, more responsibility.  A wide range of managerial functions is carried out by management in local authorities which is not the responsibility of councillors. It is given to managers for good and wise reasons and not to the local representatives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> We are all in favour of local government reform, whatever that means.  I assume it means giving more powers to people on the ground, but it is not as if somehow this Bill creates an incredible precedent.  Houses are allocated by management, not by councillors.  Planning decisions are made by managers, not by councillors.  All staffing arrangements, appointments and conditions, are the responsibility of managers, not councillors, and so on.  Therefore, if there is a proposal by Government, to adopt a task force-like approach to a problem in the city centre that could not be faulted on the grounds that it has not been given to the local authority who already have a clear jurisdiction and remit.  I assume there will be some degree of interfacing between the local authority and the commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill I would like to see is one which would introduce a whole new arrangement for the government and the management of the city which would be much more sharply focused, in which extraneous peripheral elements would be located in one central decision-making form and which would be democratic centrally and locally.  Councillors talk about local government.  To think in terms of the local areas we represent as being local government is nonsense.  They are neither local nor governmental.  They are not local in terms of their scope or size.  I represent an area on the city council which is not very much smaller than the area I represent in Dáil Éireann. It is not governmental because it has few decision-making powers and the area of discretion in economic terms is a tiny percentage of the budgetary responsibility of the city council themselves.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a certain sense of balance should be introduced into our discussion here.  I have no view one way or the other as to whether the commission being proposed is the best way of doing this.  I know there is a problem which someone has recognised and has said, &ldquo;Here is some money which we are going to throw at the problem.&rdquo;  I doubt whether that in itself will solve the problem because the <Col N="1380" /> problem is not only one of a Government and local authorities mix.  Ultimately if you have, as we have all over the city of Dublin now, an empty building or a derelict site, we should not blame the local authority for giving permission to somebody to put up a building which in our view is not ideal &mdash; whatever that means; presumably we are all into buildings which are aesthetically beautiful, environmentally attractive, economically viable and so on, expect they do not exist very often.  Quite often people whose business it is to provide such buildings have no interest in providing them.  There is no point in pretending the market will provide the kind of environment which we believe is ideal.  It does not do so and it will not.  What makes a city alive and exciting is the cut and thrust, the tension that develops and the organic growth and evolution of our city which are developing all the time, developing and evolving from what were in many cases poverty stricken ghettoes, from ugliness and sordidness into something which is much better even though it is not perfect.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Bill has a great deal to recommend it.  We should give some credit where it is due.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill well and I hope that in due course the Minister will tell us he intends to look again at the over-riding need for one single governmental structure for Dublin city which will be able to insist on proper co-ordination of all those elements which go to make up a city, such as housing, planning, traffic and all the other areas which are at present spread over a wide range of interest groups and authorities none of whom are obliged to interact with each other.</P>
    <P>The last example I want to give came up in the context of a report from my Committee on Public Expenditure.  Take what is relatively simple at least from a conceptual point of view, the problem of road openings by various agencies throughout the city such as the Dublin Gas Company, BTE and the local authorities. I am talking about management of a city.  Here is a microcosm of the problem where each of those individual bodies do their own thing.  The systems <Col N="1381" /> we have at present are conductive to encouraging further mayhem on the streets in that respect.  At present the Dublin Gas Company have hundreds of these road openings in their jurisdiction or possession.  For the benefit of the House, let me say that the way they operate is that the agency &mdash; or utility as they are called &mdash; do their work on the road, put in their pipelines and cable, reinstate the road temporarily and hand it back to the local authority to do a permanent reinstatement.  The local authority then send a bill to the utility which the utility are supposed to pay.</P>
    <P>If you have a utility with cash flow problems &mdash; Dublin Gas have had their own difficulties as has everybody else &mdash; and if they do not hand back the road openings then they do not have to pay the money.  I hope I am not doing the Dublin Gas Company an injustice here. There are cases where they have had these openings completed and temporarily reinstated, by which I mean mounds of tarmacadam on the roads, but they have not handed them back to the local authority because, as soon as they do so, they will get a bill.  By the way, the Dublin Gas Company are not the only culprits in this respect.  I am talking about the various utilities who at present engage in this incredible scenario.  Last year my committee discovered that one piece of roadway was opened 78 times in two years.  That is a symptom of the inadequacy of the city management we have at present.  Anything that helps to focus our minds on improvement of the city or better city management is welcome. I hope the Minister will go a lot farther in terms of knocking the heads together of all of us who have either responsibility or representational responsibility or jurisdiction in this area. If we want proper city government we have to change the structures, and not everybody will be pleased.  So far as I am concerned that is part of the price, and I look forward to the day when we will get a really radical Bill which will insist that our city can be governed in a modern, efficient, streamlined, co-ordinated, organised way.  That is the crying need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> In the meantime I wish this Bill, and the Minister in its pursuit, every success. It is much better than no Bill and no money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few brief comments on this Bill.  I would like to qualify my remarks by stating that I welcome any moves by any Government or local authority which would improve the general condition of our city centre.  Most city dwellers, and indeed the population of the country as a whole, will be glad of any moves in this direction.</P>
      <P>However, what my colleagues on this side of the House have been outlining is that we fail to understand why the Government saw fit to bring in legislation which, when boiled down, means that they are transferring the functions of Dublin Corporation to this new commission. We have argued that Dublin Corporation had a report before them about two years ago which stated a number of the areas in the centre city area that could be improved.  If the corporation had been given the time and the money to carry out these suggestions, there might be no need for the legislation before us.  I do not see why this legislation has now been brought into the House.  I feel we are wasting the valuable time of this House in discussing it.</P>
      <P>The fact that something must be done is agreed by everyone.  But we question the manner in which the Government are bringing this legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If money had been provided Dublin Corporation could have carried out all the functions that are contained in this Bill.  The Bill is nothing but a copy of Mr. Frank Feeley's report to the Dublin City Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have often heard the first impressions of visitors to our country. Thirty minutes after arriving at Dublin Airport or through the ports they travel through what can only be called the greatest plastic, burger, honky-tonk street in Europe, which happens to be the heart and focus of our first city, O'Connell Street.  O'Connell Street is a scar not only on Dublin but on our country.  It is a disgrace and those who have allowed it to <Col N="1383" /> degenerate to this sorrowful state stand indicted.  I will not say that the executives of Dublin Corporation or of an Bord Pleanála are to blame.  But whoever allowed O'Connell Street, the centre of our capital city, to degenerate into that condition must answer to somebody. They must answer to the people of Dublin and the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The speed of urban decay in the city is frightening.  The erection of tasteless advertising signs and of plastic facias on retail outlets in O'Connell Street is adding to the visible signs of decay.  The problem of litter in the city centre cannot be overlooked.  I question why the Dublin Corporation and the management of Dublin Corporation are not more forceful in using the 1982 Litter Act.  Anybody driving through the city late at night or early in the morning can see the condition of that part of our fair city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because they have not adopted any by-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>They stand indicted then. Far from being a showpiece of architectural and environmental awareness, our capital city's main thoroughfare is one big eyesore.  One of the results of the enactment of this Bill will be that the corporation will give up their functions in relation to road traffic and litter.  The Dublin Transport Authority was to take over these functions but now we find that even before this Authority gets going its functions are passed on to the new streets commission.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for the transfer of a variety of traffic management functions in the metropolitan centre area from the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to the new commission. Is the Minister also stating that he has no confidence in the Garda authorities to carry out their functions in organising traffic management?  After the enactment of this legislation two bodies will now be running Dublin, Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 2 of the Bill, the Minister <Col N="1384" /> may, by order, alter the boundaries of the metropolitan central area.  Can we get a guarantee from the Minister that this will not be so?  If not, when the Bill is enacted will we see the Minister and the commission take gradual control, over a three year period, of the whole of the corporation area?</P>
    <P>It is interesting to listen to some of the members of the corporation speaking on this Bill.  My colleague,  Deputy Barrett, mentions that over 300 flats are vacant in Ballymun because sufficient funds have not been provided by the Government to Dublin Corporation to put these flats in such a condition as to be able to allocate them.  The Government should be turning their attention to these areas.  I understand that in the Tallaght area a large number of houses are vacant; that because of their general condition they cannot be allocated to tenants.  Listening to the radio recently I heard the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, refer to the credits the Government have had.  He said that applicants for rehousing can now get a house on demand.  This may be so in parts of Dublin but down the country there is a severe shortage of housing.  I know a number of rural people, young married couples with one, two and three children who were very hurt by those remarks of the Minister.  Many rural authorities would like far more funding to build the houses that are required in their areas.</P>
    <P>The commission will assume the power of litter prevention and road cleaning, the repair functions of Dublin Corporation and the traffic management functions of the Dublin Transport Authority for that area.  If these powers were given to Dublin Corporation they would be carried out.  Is it pure politics we are playing at the moment?  Is it because, since the last election, the balance of power has changed in Dublin Corporation and the Minister is afraid now to give the Fianna Fáil controlled corporation the credit for carrying out the improvements to our city centre which should have been carried out during the course of the administration of the Coalition <Col N="1385" /> parties?  That question begs an answer and I suspect the answer is that that is the reason.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Minister, so far as I am concerned, has copied the corporation report of 1984-85. He has changed some of the wording.  The emphasis still remains the same.  I still do not see why the corporation were not given the money to do this much needed work.  This Bill has been brought into this House because of the change in the balance of power in Dublin Corporation.  As I said, I welcome anything that will enhance our capital city but I cannot believe this is the way to go about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for contributing to this debate is the dangers and parallels I see in the setting of this commission to take over the functions of Dublin Corporation and the functions of the Garda Síochána in the control of traffic, which is done at present in association with Dublin Corporation.  I see this as the thin end of the wedge in setting up similar commissions in other cities.</P>
      <P>I support my colleagues in opposing this measure.  There are many reasons I feel concern about this legislation. Deputy Nolan mentioned one big worry, that is, the current membership of Dublin Corporation and the attempt to take from the elected members of that body the credit that would be given to them by the citizens of Dublin for successfully achieving the recommendations set out in the Dublin Corporation report of two years ago.  Those recommendations were not acted upon until the present corporation were elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see this as an exercise by the Minister to denude the elected representatives of power and to hand it over to a commission appointed by him.  This commission will not be answerable to the electorate.  Through the commission the Minister will have the privilege of attaining something during his or her Government's term of office.  We have heard a great deal from this Government about devolution of power to local authorities and to locally elected representatives, <Col N="1386" /> but now we have this ridiculous legislation taking from elected representatives power they already have, and any powers they may get in the future.  All these powers will be taken if this commission are appointed to do the work of the elected representatives and staff of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>At the outset I mentioned dangers and parallels for other cities, but I want to mention specifically my own constituency which includes the city of Cork.  Recently we discussed in this House designated areas in need of rejuvenation and after consultation with Cork Corporation the Government designated areas of Cork which needed refurbishing and rejuvenation. I complained of the small acreage for the city of Cork that was included in that Bill.  We are no different from Dublin or any other city in Europe.  In years past the trend has been to move out to the suburbs and even into rural areas surrounding cities.  We all want to see living city centres.  I contend that the elected representatives and officials of the corporations of Dublin and Cork know their cities and know what is required.  This information is fully documented in many reports.</P>
    <P>Great strides have been made to restore activity in the centre of Cork city. I see in this proposal a danger that at some time in the future when we are about to achieve success a similar commission will be set up to do the work already done by local authorities.  Dublin Corporation, like the corporations of Cork, Limerick and Galway, have been appealing for funds for various projects in their jurisdictions.  More often than not, when the money is being allocated &mdash; whether for housing, infrastructure, services, water, or sewerage &mdash; they are told there is a limit to the amount of money that can be provided.  Over a period of four years this Government have been restricting the amount of grants paid to local authorities and county councils.  Nevertheless, with the setting up of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission a sum of £10 million was plucked out of the air.  The mind boggles at this sort of activity.  Where was the <Col N="1387" /> demand for this commission?  Where is the need for this extra layer of bureaucracy? I heard no outcry or protest.  I am not aware of any group or groups demanding the setting up of such a commission. I can visualise similar commissions being foisted on other local authorities if this Bill succeeds.  I hope it will be defeated.  It will also depend on whether the present administration remain in office long enough to carry out this or any other ridiculous proposal.</P>
    <P>It is a gross insult for elected members to be told, as is happening in this case where a commission is being set up for special areas of Dublin, they are not doing their job, that they are not capable of doing their job, or that they are unlikely to be able to do the job that will be required of them in the future.  I do not see any evidence which requires the taking of the functions of the local authority from the elected representatives and staff of the corporation, and the handing of them to a commission.</P>
    <P>The changes which have taken place in O'Connell Street have been mentioned by many Deputies.  I agree that in recent times many of the refurbishings on that street have defaced our architectural heritage.  Even allowing for that, I do not accept that we need this commission to correct errors of judgment in planning and this seems to be the argument put forward by the Minister and the Government. I condemn unreservedly the defacement of our fine buildings. However the fine craftsmanship on many of our buildings can be retrieved if we take away the ridiculous facades that have been imposed at the lower levels of the street.  The upper storeys on many of the buildings are fine, but nobody looks up into the sky when walking along the street.  The reason for introducing this Bill is insufficient.  There must be ways of correcting the errors under the 1963 Planning and Development Act, subsequently amended in 1976 and 1983.</P>
    <P>I do not welcome the proposal in section 10 of the Bill to transfer the control of traffic to the commission.  The present arrangements operated by the <Col N="1388" /> local authority and the Garda Síochána are working excellently.  The commission could control traffic in a small area only. Will the Minister be available to adjudicate on differences of opinion relating to traffic flow?  Will a one way street of the commission enter a one way street of the corporation, the traffic approaching from opposite directions?  Will the Minister make the decisions?  This proposal will be nonsense in Dublin city and it could apply to Cork and other cities if this ridiculous legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister saying by inference, in this Bill, that present traffic arrangements are unsuccessful?  The Garda Síochána and the local authorities, I am sure, have spent many hours finding the best solution so as to accommodate traffic and maintain the safety of pedestrians over the years, having regard to the change in the number and type of vehicles used by the people, and so on.  The infrastructure in cities has had to be altered in the course of time to take account of developments in traffic.</P>
    <P>Great progress has been made in our cities and I have no doubt that the land use and transportation study for the region I represent had and is having a major influence on the control and designation of traffic.  The local Garda will continue to have an important role to play but this legislation says by inference that the commission are the best people to take care of the problem in certain areas of Dublin designated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to section 12 of the Bill. Local authorities, because of the need to develop infrastructure, roads, water, sewerage and all the other services required, have been seeking capital allocations but are limited because of the demands on the national purse.  I accept that we cannot always be looking for money that is not there.  A colleague of mine who was in this House for many years said that asking this Government for capital allocations is like going to the goat's house for wool.  However, in recent weeks there has been a flurry of activity, particularly in constituencies where certain seats may be in danger, in regard to promising money.  It has been <Col N="1389" /> said that the Government will sanction money for certain projects but that it will not be paid until 1987.</P>
    <P>In one instance at a meeting with departmental officials about a school, the delegates were reminded that there could be a change of administration and that the project might not go ahead.  The Minister knows that every local authority will continue to look for more capital allocations no matter what Government are in power.  In recent years we have been falling behind in the development of infrastructure although plans are in existence for major roadways throughout the country.  Unfortunately, there are not sufficient funds for infrastructure development as we would like it to be. Our plans and programmes could be brought to fruition by the allocation of funds.  I accept that because we are in this economic morass at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to bore the Minister but if he likes I will list the many areas of my city which need a commitment which has been given to other areas.  I was surprised that we did not get a commitment in relation to the extension of the airport, but that is beside the point.</P>
      <P>In seeking allocation of funds we have been continually told that money is not available but suddenly a sum of £10 million is provided for Dublin.  Subsection (3) is interesting because it says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation shall, in lieu of expenses that would otherwise have <Col N="1390" /> been incurred by them in the Metropolitan Central Area, contribute annually to the Commission such sums of money as shall be agreed...</P>
    <P>I do not know of any local authority &mdash; and I am sure the same applies to Dublin Corporation &mdash; whose finances would enable them to contribute annually to the commission as we are told in subsection (2) that the total amount of grants paid to the commission shall not exceed £10,000,000.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the financial position of Dublin Corporation but I am familiar with the position of the authority of which I am a member.  I am also aware of the financial position of Cork Corporation, the authority for the greater part of my constituency.  Unless the finances of Dublin Corporation are at variance with those of other local authorities I abhor the suggestion that they should contribute annually to the commission. Subsection (3) also says that in the event of disagreement the amount shall be determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The main part of the Bill which I find obnoxious is the removal of power from the elected members to perform their functions as members of a local authority to a commission.  Thankfully, there is no mention of the members of the commission so I cannot be accused of being critical of them personally.  I am critical of the proposal and the various sections of the Bill which seek to remove power from elected members of local authorities. It is the greatest insult that can be offered to them.  Taken in conjunction with the pious platitudes of the Minister for the Environment, expecially before the last election, about the devolution of power to locally elected members&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Dá bhrí sin is ceist anphráinneach í anois.  Cén sórt báid farantóireachta nua a bhéas á chur ar fáil in áit <Col N="1394" /><i>Naomh Éanna</i>?

Leis an ngeimhreadh ag teacht anois, ní ceart go mbeadh muintir na n-oileán fágtha gan cuidiú de chineál ar bith agus gan polasaí ceart chun feabhas a chur ar chúrsaí farantóireachta.

      <P>Tá cuid de na daoine ar na hoileáin i gcruachás maidir le taisteal agus cumarsáid agus go háirithe i rith an gheimhridh.  Ach tá dul chun cinn anmhór déanta agus ba cheart go mbeadh a fhios ag an Teachta mar iar-Aire go bhfuil sé sin fíor, cuir i gcás Oileán Cléire. Tá bád ansin agus tá airgead á íoc in aghaidh na bliana ag mo Roinnse i leith an bháid sin, bád a chosnaigh £320,000. Maidir le hÁrainn Mhór, chuireamar bád agus áiseanna calafoirt ar fáil ansin a chosain os cionn £500,000, agus tá an dá cheann sin ag obair go han-mhaith. Chomh maith leis sin, tá airgead á íoc againn ar ais le haghaidh Oileán Toraí, ach tá fadhb ansin, mar atá a fhios ag Comhaltaí an Tí seo.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá aerthaisteal fáil anois faoi Aer Árann Teo., agus tá áis aerthaistil ar fáil trí heileacaptar a chur ar fáil ag an Údarás.  Níl dóigh liom go bhfuil éinne fágtha anois san fhaopach mar a bhíodh siad go dtí seo, toisc go bhfuil na háiseanna seo á gcur ar fáil.  Ach níl mé sásta go bhfuil an jab críochnaithe go fóill.  Is <Col N="1395" /> ceist airgid é, agus dá mbeadh níos mó airgid againn le caitheamh ar na háiseanna seo, bheimis ábalta iad a chur ar fáil.  Le go mbeadh scéim farantóireachta sásúil ag gach uile oileán, taimid ag caint ar suim mhór, na milliúin punt.  Tuigim go maith go bhfuilimid ag caint ar dhaoine agus ar an saghas saoil atá acu ar na hoileáin, ach tá praghas iontach ard le díol air sin, agus níl an t-airgead againn faoi láthair.</P>

      <P>Yes, the Community is taking some action.  A poster campaign aimed at educating the public as to the dangers of the spruce bark beetle is in the course of preparation.  This poster describes the insect and is accompanied by a photograph of it.  This campaign will be mainly concentrated on points of entry into the country, particularly the sea ports.  Caravans, in particular, are regarded as a potentially high risk vehicle for the introduction of this pest.  The Department are taking all the steps that are necessary.</P>

Such research is carried out on a variety of projects, details of which are set out in the annual reports of the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department which are available in the Library.</P>
      <P>The pollution of forests by acid rain is also monitored by the Research Branch of the Forest and Wildlife Service and there is also close collaboration with An Foras Forbartha, the Electricity Supply Board and the Meteorological Service in monitoring possible depositions.  As part of the EC research programme, the Forest and Wildlife Service co-operated with the Macauley Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, on a project relating to the acidity of rainfall in the south and west of Ireland and part of Scotland.</P>
      <P>With regard to plant health, the main work has been and continues to be on the implementation of the forestry aspects of the EC Plant Health Directive which involves regular dockside inspections of imported timber and forest plants, laboratory examination of samples and the issue of phytosanitary certificates.  Apart from the EC matters to which I have referred, there has been no EC involvement in the area of forest protection, but it is hoped that some EC funding will be made available for the observation network set up to monitor acid depositions.</P>

There are two in the Dublin-Wicklow region and eight in the Clare-Limerick region.  It is hoped to have established 20 projects in all by the end of 1986.  That proves that there are a certain number of people working in this area.  If the Deputy asks me a direct question in relation to the number I can tell him.  The remaining plots have been sited in the Slieve Bloom and Wicklow areas which we hope will cover the east coast.  As a result of some of the mapping that has already been done &mdash; and I am talking about the area which the Deputy represents, the Cork and Mayo areas done in the period 1982 to 1985 &mdash; the evidence is that there is no acid rain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 79 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies can be assured that I will <Col N="1406" /> take all steps open to me to safeguard the employment of forest workers.  I think, however, that the Deputies may be misinterpreting recent action terminating the employment of temporary workers as a measure affecting permanent workers. This is not the case.  My Department have always employed a number of temporary workers either on a seasonal or short fixed term basis to augment the permanent workforce and to meet peak demands in forest operations.  The number employed each year varies between 200 and 300 employees.</P>
    <P>The situation referred to by the Deputies concerns the current year's temporary employees.  These workers were employed for seasonal work or for a specific period in nurseries and forests throughout the country with due regard to the financial allocation provided for such work in this year's Vote for forestry. In fact, I understand that a number of the workers involved were retained in employment for longer periods than was envisaged when they were originally recruited.</P>
    <P>The number of workers whose employment is being terminated is 197 and these are spread throughout 114 forests in all areas of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is interested in safeguarding the jobs of forestry workers would he not ensure that those 197 be retained, in view of the fact that it is widely known there is work available for them and that while they are not working they draw social welfare and PRSI?  In order to overcome those difficulties and make additional work available for seasonal or full-time workers, have the Minister's Department considered felling, trimming and selling trees on the roadside rather than selling them standing in forests, making work available for people outside the country rather than those within it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the second option encompassed in the question is being considered at present.  Possibly it is something we could investigate. I thought I had explained clearly in the <Col N="1407" /> course of my reply that the situation this year is no different from that which has obtained over a number of years.  There are a number of temporary people employed.  They are not employed in the same areas each year but rather where, as anticipated, work will be available.  We are now dismissing people who had been employed on a temporary basis.  That happened last year and the year before. I presume that temporary people will be employed again in 1987.  As far as the Department are concerned, they will be temporary employees only, no more, no less.  They start and finish at various times of the year.  Some are employed for the planting season between the months of February and June, the lining out programme in nurseries between the months of June and September and other seasonal activities, or for specific periods of short-term employment or mainly for harvesting.  That type of employment always has been a feature of forestry and, as far as I can foresee, will always be a feature of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the unemployment obtaining will the Minister not retain those people in the national interest to develop the roadways in our forestries, taking out all of the fine timber that is rotting away awaiting harvesting, rather than spending vast amounts of money trotting around the world endeavouring to create jobs in industry? Is he aware that we are allowing a native industry to rot?  I have seen the finest of timber rotting in south Tipperary because there is not the requisite manpower to develop roads in order to have that timber taken out, while we import timber because sufficient is not available.  It is a national scandal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy says.  All I can do is repeat what I have said, that these people were employed on a temporary basis.  They knew it was on a temporary basis and knew that before the end of the year their employment would be terminated.  It is the system that has been in operation <Col N="1408" /> over a number of years.  Perhaps we could examine it with a view to employing additional people at some future date on a permanent, full-time basis.  The people employed on a temporary basis were aware of that fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient funds have been made available to the central board to carry out the valuable work they are undertaking?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would probably contend that all of our lakes are insufficiently stocked.  There was a press release by the Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry, on 24 September 1986, stating that he had decided to defer the closure of the trout angling season on certain lakes &mdash; on the Kilkee reservoir and in the Shannon fisheries region this year and in future years &mdash; until 12 <Col N="1409" /> October rather than 1 October which has been the practice to date.  The reason for this is that scientific evidence indicates that stocks of trout in these lakes are under-exploited at present, which would indicate that the policy pursued by the regional board in the area is quite successful. The extension of the trout angling season would result in increased exploitation of these stocks, especially as there will be sufficient emerging insects in October to make angling worthwhile. The Minister went on to say that the extension of the trout angling season would also go some way towards generating valuable tourist revenue during the off-peak period.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the recent commission proposal for measures to improve the structures in the fisheries and acquaculture sectors.  As the proposal is a rather comprehensive one, I have arranged for a copy of it to be placed in the Library.  In general, it provides for a ten year programme of structural aids for the renewal and modernisation of fishing fleets, aquaculture projects, exploratory fishing, joint ventures, provision of facilities at fishing ports, market exploration and adjustment of fleet capacity.

      <P>As I said, the new proposal will cover a ten year period from 1987 to 1996.  As the Deputy is aware it will not be in operation until it is passed by the Minister.  The proposal indicates there will be £637.6 million available over the first five years of that period, from 1987 to 1992.  All grants will depend on the production of two multi-annual guidance programmes for each of the five year periods.  These will be subject to annual updating.  A register of persons will be drawn up on the basis of these programmes and data will be supplied to the member states.  It will have to be drawn up for the simple reason that the present regulations expire at the end of this year. There will have to be a new programme if we want further aid from the EC.</P>

Proposals for new timber processing developments are, in the ordinary way, a matter for the Industrial Development Authority who normally consult with my Department as to whether there are adequate supplies of timber available within the total national demand to accommodate a new proposal.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to establish a wildbird sanctuary at Baldoyle Estuary, County Dublin.  As the Minister indicated to the Deputy in reply to a similar question on 8 April last he is satisfied that the coastal region between Dublin and Dundalk Bay is already adequately served with wildbird sanctuaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Dublin County Council unanimously passed a resolution requesting that the Minister make this wildlife sanctuary? Is he also aware that the Baldoyle Estuary Preservation Society who represent 5,000 people have supported this resolution, as did Dr. Richard Nairn of the Wildlife Conservancy who identified rare species of birds who over-winter in this estuary?  On foot of those facts would the Minister reconsider this matter with a view to making it a wildlife sanctuary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>These coasts are already well served with bird sanctuaries. <Col N="1416" /> Apart from Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland there are sanctuaries of Ballymascanlon and Lurgangreen in Dundalk, Bray and the Boyne Estuary, all in County Louth, the North Bull Island, Rogerstown Estuary and Brittas Ponds all in County Dublin, Broadlough in County Wicklow, the Slaney River, the Wexford Wildlife Preserve and Rosslare Point all in County Wexford.  However, there is no doubt that the Deputy has made a very convincing case and there seems to be a unamimous decision by Dublin County Council that it should be declared a sanctuary.  We will have another look at it and, if we can accommodate the Deputy's point of view with that of the members of Dublin County Council, we will make an attempt to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 39 and Question No. 37 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the shares of total allowable catches available to member states are enshrined in the EC Common Fisheries Policy.  I should say that with the exception of one or two species, where small reductions have occurred, quotas available to Irish fishermen have generally either remained at a constant level or have increased <Col N="1417" /> slightly over the past couple of years. With regard to the 1987 fishing season, the Deputy can be assured that I will continue to press in the course of the negotiations for the maximum quotas for our fishermen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that, because of the inadequate quotas that we have, incomes of fishermen are reduced, processing plants are not working to full capacity and jobs in the processing sector are also at risk.  Will the Minister of State give some indication that it will be possible to secure an increased quota in view of the limiting effect the present quota has on the prospect of development in the industry and prospects of increasing incomes of fishermen at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what the Deputy says in every way possible.  We hope that, as a result of negotiations which will take place to decide the quotas for 1987, the interests of Irish fishermen will be looked after in the best way possible. As the Deputy who acted in this capacity in 1982 will be aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we get a percentage of the total catch.  That was acceptable at the time.  Possibly the best way to benefit Irish fishermen would be if the total catch were increased and as a result the allocation to Irish fishermen would be increased.  I doubt very much that other people within the Community would be willing to donate part of a tonnage or a percentage of their catch to Ireland at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not asked for that. I am asking if the Minister has sought to increase the percentage catch for Ireland in view of the fact that there are now limitations on expansion and development of the industry because we are so tied down with the percentage we have. In view of the fact that increased fishing performance has increased our catch over the past number of years, the case is now <Col N="1418" /> adequate to seek an increased quota at Community level.  Will that be done by the Minister?  Did he mention this to the Council?  Will he raise this issue at the Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he will raise that issue at the Council.  The Deputy is aware that a number of species are under a quota system.  We will be encouraging fishermen to get out of fishing non-quota species because I can see the day when these fish which are now non-quota will become quota species also.  If people do not get out and have a large catch of a non-quota species then when the time comes &mdash; I am not saying it will come &mdash; our percentage will be small in relation to the overall percentage or the overall take in the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is right in what he says, but that is a separate issue.  We are speaking about quota species. What is the present situation in relation to the mackerel quota which is totally and purposely inadequate now because of the increased catching capacity we have?  There must be some case now at Community level to seek an increased quota.  Is that case still made? Is the matter on the agenda for the next Council meeting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's plan <i>Building on Reality</i> set the planting programme for the three years 1985 to 1987 at an annual average rate of some 7,500 hectares.</P>
      <P>In 1985, 7,052 hectares were planted, comprising 6,288 hectares of State planting and 764 hectares planted by the private sector.  It is estimated that planting in 1986 will exceed 9,200 hectares, comprising some 6,960 ha. by the State and 2,300 by the private sector, while in 1987 it is expected that total planting will reach 10,000 hectares.  That is real progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that the State planting programme is now in decline.  He is trying to confuse the issue by including in the figures for planting private plantation, which is a separate issue.  Have the Government any plans to increase State planting in view of the fact that they have only half reached their target for this year?  The sawmills are working at half capacity; the industry is in total disarray; and there seems to be no indication from the Minister that he is really serious about dealing with the crisis in the timber business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I have given indicate clearly that there is an increase in planting.  It went from 7,000 in 1985 to 9,200 in 1986 and we hope to hit 10,000 by 1987.  Surely that is progress. Added to that we hope to have a revision of the western package planting scheme where at the moment about £800 per hectare is being offered to plant trees. We submitted a number of proposals to the Commission in April 1986 to get that increase to over £1,000, as a matter of <Col N="1421" /> fact to £1,050 per hectare, in order to accommodate people who may not be enticed into the scheme at the moment. One would think from what Deputy Daly is saying that nothing was being done. A scheme to allow farmers to receive headage payments for a period of about 15 years provided that, if they planted some of their land, they would receive a headage payment on the stock attributable to that part of the land.  The reason for that is to try to get them into forestry and so we hope to ensure a better livelihood for them.</P>

      <P>I want to make some observations on the various sections of the Bill in addition to the general references I made before the Adjournment.  My principal objection to this Bill is based on the setting up of this commission to replace elected members.

Cleansing is mentioned in this section and in another section.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to be anything but in accordance with your ruling and with general practice and behaviour. I will not discuss sections of this Bill, although I thought that was the proper way to conduct this debate, but if you say that is not the general practice I will accept your ruling.  I am sure as I glance through the Bill I will be able to speak about the phrases and terminology which catch my eye.  I will, of course, refrain from saying anything that would not be in accordance with your ruling and the general practice of how the Second Stage debate is conducted.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the improvements required in Dublin city centre and the responsibilities for such improvements being charged to the commission.  The elected members and the statutory authority of Dublin Corporation are being replaced by this commission.  This proposal has a relevance to other urban areas.  I know there are improvements needed in places like Cork city&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but this Bill is confined to the city of Dublin and only passing references to other cities are relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and agree that only a passing reference is needed.  I believe that the setting up of this commission to replace the elected representatives on Dublin Corporation <Col N="1494" /> could lead to something similar being done in other boroughs.  I fear that something like this might be applied to Cork.</P>
      <P>A sum of £10 million is being made available for the commission over three years, and the annual budget for Dublin Corporation is £292 million for 1986. Why does the Minister think it necessary to take from an authority like Dublin Corporation the powers and functions of a local authority?  This is unnecessary and I do not see any reason for it.  That is my opinion.</P>
      <P>If improvements are identified for the safety of pedestrians, buildings or whatever, the commission will submit to the Minister any such proposals and the Minister will consider any objections made to the scheme by Dublin Corporation. That is fine as far as it goes, because at least it recognises the responsibility of the corporation, but in comparison with the 1963 Planning and Development Act, and the amendments to that Act in subsequent years, I fail to see any allowance being made in this legislation for the private individual who may wish to lodge an objection.  The people have that right under the existing Planning and Development Acts but that is not recognised in this Bill.  The public should be considered when we are drafting legislation like this because very often their opinions are taken into account by the planning authority or by An Bord Pleanála, but not always.  We all admit there are occasions when there are differences of opinion, but I am concerned that provision be made for the private individual to make an objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cleansing of the Dublin metropolitan area is also covered in this Bill and we have run into very serious problems there.  I want to make a passing reference to the fact that Cork city too is experiencing difficulty in this area.  Do I take it that the commission will have their own staff for the cleansing of the areas under their jurisdiction?  That being so, surely they will require further administrative staff.  I am not too happy with that overlapping. It is a further indication that we do not need this proposal.  Does the Minister think a commission would be <Col N="1495" /> more successful in cleaning this area than the Corporation were?</P>
    <P>In relation to traffic control, will the commission at least renew consultations and be part of the system that has been successfully used until now in regulating traffic?  From my understanding of this Bill, it seems to transfer the management functions to the commission and it appears that the corporation and the Garda will have less and less input into traffic management.</P>
    <P>Controls in relation to litter are referred to in other sections of the Bill. If one drives through the streets of Dublin or any other town one will draw the conclusion that the Minister's litter awareness campaign has been ineffective.  That is regrettable having regard to the Minister's public relations exercise in launching this campaign.  Perhaps the Minister feels the commission will be more effective in handling an anti-litter campaign, although I do not have evidence that that will be the case.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill, which refers back to section 6, deals with planning.  I understand the ruling of the Chair as to the difference between Second Stage and Committee Stage, but I am very concerned that the planning functions of the local authority in addition to other functions will be taken away from the elected representatives and placed in the hands of the commission.  The Minister should look at that section again.  A local authority will have built up a bank of experience in the area of planning and development and that is a most useful aspect of their functions in planning and development.  It is not a good idea to transfer the planning and development functions for this area to the commission. We do not yet know who will be on the commission and I doubt that they will have available to them the acquired experience of the planning authority. That is one of the most serious shortfalls in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I accept that the planning authority for the area under discussion have allowed <Col N="1496" /> the erection of unsightly hoardings, placards and so on, and I am aware that one of the functions of this commission is to reverse that state of affairs.  I do not disagree with correcting that trend.  Why could not the local authority have been given the powers that are now being given to the commission in order to correct these developments.  There is no need to set up a commission and fund them with £10 million to improve Dublin city centre.  In Cork city and in other cities there are areas which need refurbishing and attention.</P>
    <P>It would be more appropriate if the moneys proposed to be spent in the areas mentioned in the Bill were made available to those authorities who have made plans and proposals.  I am sure the Acting Chairman is aware of Dublin Corporation's plan for the city centre.  Would it not have been more appropriate for funding to have been supplied to Dublin Corporation to enable them to carry out their plans?  Is it true that the EC indicated to representatives of Dublin Corporation that, if a plan was made available to them which had been approved by the Department, a contribution would be forthcoming?</P>
    <P>I am sure my colleague on the Government benches will confirm that our land use and transportation study is going well.  It was well planned and I am sure the Deputy would not welcome a proposal like this for Cork, to take away the functions from the corporation and to let someone else put the plan into operation. The kernel of the matter is that elected members will be pushed aside.  I am afraid it will be indicated to them &mdash; as happened to members of Dublin Corporation &mdash; that they do not know how to do their job and that a commission will be brought in and given a sum of £10 million to spend.  It is important to note that the elected members of the local authorities in Cork are composed of a majority from one political party who are not in Government, so they will not get any credit for achievements.  We would not like to have the effectiveness of the land use and transportation study in the Cork area taken from us and credit for its success <Col N="1497" /> going to non-elected people.  Any funds available for centre or inner city improvements should be given to the democratically elected local authorities who answer to the public every six or seven years, depending on the whim of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>A Bill to remove powers and functions from elected members should never have been introduced.  It is an insult to elected members to deprive them of such powers. It is also an insult to me, as an elected representative of another council.  So much for the devolution of power to local powers about which we heard so much. If this is the criterion for the devolution of power to locally elected members, it falls very far short of my interpretation of such devolution.  I unreservedly oppose the proposals in the Bill and I hope that Members of this House who are on local authorities will realise that it is an insulting Bill and take the necessary and appropriate action to ensure that it is not passed.  It is disgraceful, obnoxious legislation and I hope it will be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The best that can be said about Deputy Lyons' speech is that at the commencement he described it as innocuous and at the end he described it as obnoxious.  I congratulate the Deputy on the fact that in my 17 years in Parliament it is the first time I heard a five second contribution expanded to 55 minutes.</P>
      <P>Some of the contributions to this Bill were extremely difficult to follow.  The most honest speech from the Opposition was made by Deputy Nolan who acknowledged the tawdry, run down state of O'Connell Street, its unfortunate appearance and the fact that it is now at a stage where none of us could be proud of the main street of our capital city.  He described it as the equivalent of a scar &mdash; not just on the capital city &mdash; but on the country.  I did not use any of those expressions in introducing the Bill, or in my contribution in the other House. However, I suspect that much of what Deputy Nolan said would be reluctantly concurred with by the vast majority of the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> Deputy Nolan said whoever was responsible for allowing the capital city of any country to be reduced to that state bore a heavy responsibility.  I agree with the Deputy's remarks.  I wish to make it quite clear that it was the intention of the Government, in introducing this Bill, to recognise that the central core of the capital city is a special place, not just for Dubliners, although I suspect many of them think the area has a special significance, but for the people in general. They want to identify with the city, to be proud of it and they know it should be kept to a higher standard than any other public place.  It is quite clear from contributions made here and in the other House, and from the reaction of the general public and interested parties, that my comments represent the view of the general public.  There is, in effect, a consensus that the centre of Dublin has declined and that immediate action is needed to prevent further deterioration. The establishment of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission will have that effect and I hope that in a very short time &mdash; three years is a relatively short time and the period was chosen deliberately &mdash; a radical revitalisation and refurbishment of the centre of our capital city will have been carried out.  We need to identify that the area we are talking about is part of our heritage and that the city needs to build on its past in order to create the kind of environment which will help to attract people back to using the city centre.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies suggested that this Bill is an erosion of or an attack upon local democracy.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Bill has been carefully designed to ensure that the commision will be established for a three year period to carry out specific work of improvement and refurbishment in the centre of our capital city, after which time the area will automatically, by provision of the statute, be transferred back to the care and maintenance of Dublin Corporation with one proviso: that it will continue to have, in law, a special status. An obligation will remain on the corporation to keep that area maintained at <Col N="1499" /> the special level to which it will have been taken by the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commissioners.</P>
    <P>There is great merit in the idea of having a single function authority established to carry out a particular task and to do it in a defined timescale.  One of the difficulties which all bureaucracies face, and Dublin Corporation are one of the biggest in the country, is that they are multipurpose and multifaceted authorities. They have to attend to a very wide range of functions in order to provide all of the services and endeavour to meet the requirements and needs of the population of the capital city.  Accepting all those responsibilities, it is difficult to expect that the authority charged with a myriad of responsibilities under the various local government Acts can, as it were, turn their attention to an area designated for a particular length of time.</P>
    <P>What I found extraordinary about the contributions from the Opposition was that they appeared to be opposed to the principle of establishing single function authorities to carry out specific tasks. When the Urban Renewal Bill was introduced and discussed in the House last May &mdash; a Bill to set up special tax and other incentives for designated areas in Dublin city centre and in the centres of four other cities &mdash; this principle was addressed extensively by the Opposition. The provisions of the Bill which established the Custom House Docks Authority were discussed in the House.  The powers of that authority are very similar to those of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  On 28 May, during the debate on the Urban Renewal Bill, while deploring the fact that the Minister only had power to designate the Custom House Docks area, Deputy Burke said and I quote from the Official Report, volume 367, column 277:</P>
    <P>... he has no authority to appoint development authorities for any other area in the country.  We consider this to be a very shortsighted approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke went on to say in column 288:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> I fully support it and do not find that it is anti-democratic.  It supports the whole democratic procedure by giving extra powers to get jobs done which cannot be done using the present machinery and planning laws.  We should take the opportunity to designate more areas and appoint more authorities.  My only complaint with the Bill is that it does not go far enough. The Minister is tying his own hands is not allowing himself the opportunity to appoint more authorities.</P>
    <P>The predecessor to this Bill was introduced a month later to establish a similar authority to carry out a specific task as suggested by the Opposition spokesman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so; they are two different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>His party opposed that Bill and this Bill today on the basis that they are anti-democratic.  Why is it not anti-democratic to establish a Custom House Docks Authority to prepare improvement plans for the Custom House docks area and to see within a designated period an improvement in the refurbishment and the rebuilding of that area but it is anti-democratic to establish a commission to do something with an area which virtually everybody in the country accepts is run down, tatty and tawdry, an area which instead of being proud of virtually every one of us is ashamed of?</P>
      <P>In the same debate Deputy Burke said, and I quote from column 319:</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House feel very strongly that the concept of a development authority is such an excellent one that it should not be restricted to that one site.  This Bill should be amended in such a way as to give the Minister of the day, whoever that may be, the power to establish development authorities for any other special urban area within the country where this spotlight treatment would be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urban development authority <Col N="1501" /> has very special planning powers, functions and controls which are not available to a local authority.  Because of that, these powers should be used in very specific areas.</P>

      <P>We ought to have accepted the spirit of Deputy Burke's proposals in May and amended the urban Renewal Bill to take unto ourselves, as was suggested, power to establish development authorities in any area which the Minister considered appropriate for the revitalisation of particular areas of urban decay.  Had we done so, this Bill would not be before the House and the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission would have been established as intended last summer and the centre of Dublin would look a lot better this Christmas than it will now.  Because this area is of national significance it is appropriate that there should be a specific Bill to establish the commission and the House should have the opportunity to discuss the Bill in a constructive manner and make suggestions as to how the area might best be improved.  I have not heard in this House, whatever about the other House, from the Opposition one single constructive suggestion as to how the commissioners might go about their work, or one single constructive idea which would help them in that task.  I had hoped that might have been the general thrust of the debate on this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had accepted the Opposition's suggestions in May there would have been no debate and the commission would be in existence.  Deputy Lyons' fear, as he invited us to meander with him through Cork, that a similiar commission might have been established in Cork could have been a reality by now had I accepted his party spokesman's proposal. I could have established a commission for Cork, Schull or Skibbereen but I felt that, if there were proposals from time to time on specific reasons to identify important areas and establish single function authorities to do specific tasks in those areas, it should be done on each occasion by a <Col N="1502" /> specific piece of legislation.  Being reasonable, who could have thought, having heard those views expressed by the Opposition spokesman in May, that a proposal such as this would have met with outright opposition in June and the filibustering tactics displayed over the past few weeks?  The genuineness of the Opposition's case has to be questioned when one compares the written record of what apparently was Opposition policy in May with the performance of the Opposition and their reaction to this proposal which was put forward in June.</P>
    <P>I provided in the Bill that a commission should be established for a three year period and I chose three years deliberately. I support the principle of establishing single function authorities.  They can carry out specific tasks by concentrating their efforts and the resources given to them to that task.  It is right that there should be a time limit put on their work so as to impress upon them the urgency of the work and the fact that it must be carried out within a limited timescale and completed satisfactorily to allow their successors to continue to maintain the completed work.  I fear that the impact of some other authorities or groups that have been established from time to time has not been as great as it might have been because very often a completion time was not imposed upon the group from the outset.</P>
    <P>Keeping those principles in mind I sat down to prepare the Bill before the House and I decided on the period of three years for a specific reason.  Had the Bill been enacted in June by the Dáil and in early July by the Seanad, a three year period would have meant that the area to be administered by the commissioners would have been returned to the care and maintenance of Dublin Corporation several years before the present corporation finished their term of office. Even with the quite unnecessary and upsetting delay brought about by Opposition tactics between early summer and now, if the Bill is enacted this month the area will be returned to the care and maintenance of the corporation before the next local elections are due.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> I must absolutely and utterly refute any suggestion that the Bill was conceived, published or introduced because a particular group happen to be in the majority on Dublin Corporation.  The Bill is based upon proposals contained in a policy document published by my party in early 1981.  When I was made Minister for the Environment earlier this year I set about preparing the Bill and getting Government agreement to the proposition.  I must emphasise that irrespective of which party grouping might or might not have been in a majority at any time in the local authority concerned, I would have advanced the Bill because I believe it to be the best way to deal with what is a very difficult task, the refurbishment of the core of the capital city.  The way to do that is to invite a small number of people to come together and give all their time and expertise to concentrating on the problem, how to address it and to bring the centre of Dublin to a standard comparable with but, hopefully, better than most equivalent capital cities throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I found the contribution of some of the Deputies opposite who are members of Dublin Corporation difficult to understand. Today the Opposition Whip, Deputy Brady, bemoaned the fact that there are so many gambling arcades in the city centre.  He sought to attribute their presence to some other body, suggesting they were in existence as a result of decisions of An Bord Pleanála.  That is not so.  Permission has been obtained for some of them, not all, from An Bord Pleanála but those who engage in gaming do so under the aegis of Dublin Corporation. That body have the legislation in the administrative area governing such gaming arcades.  In that respect Dublin Corporation have the remedy in their own hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brady and others complained about the lack of litter control in the centre of Dublin but Dublin <Col N="1504" /> Corporation, the biggest local authority in the country, like the majority of local authorities have yet to adopt litter by-laws under the Litter Act, 1982.  Deputy Nolan referred to this matter.  I find it very difficult not to be critical of local authorities who have not taken onto themselves the powers available to them under that legislation.  It would have helped them in a marked way to bring about improvements in regard to litter control.  The last anti-litter by-laws adopted by Dublin Corporation were adopted in February 1938 and the last by-laws regarding the cleansing of footpaths under the public health Acts were adopted by Dublin Corporation on 5 June 1899.  Those by-laws provided for the cleansing of footways and pavements, the removal of snow, dust, ashes, rubbish, filth and house refuse, the cleansing of earth closets, privys, ashpits, cesspools and dust bins and they were made by the Rt. Honourable Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of Dublin and adopted by the municipal council on 5 June 1899.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that some of those who have a dual responsibility, as Members of this House and as members of the corporation, would have looked first at how they could update their own powers and implement new powers that are available to them before bemoaning the fact, that they did not, apparently, have those powers.  I find it difficult to comprehend Members of the Opposition deploring, as I have done, the growth and proliferation of plastic shop fronts and facades in the city centre when we all know that an amount of that proliferation is there without planning permission of any kind and that quite an amount of it is there on foot of permission granted by the local authority concerned.  There has been extraordinary activity in the past two months and we have been told that the corporation are going to wage war on authorised shop fronts and advertising signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to believe newspaper reports, the Lord Mayor has established a committee to try to decide what should be done with O'Connell Street but in all reasonableness one must ask, why is it <Col N="1505" /> only now, after the Government have published their proposals and had this Bill dealt with by the Seanad, that attention is being paid to this matter.  Why is it only now after all these years that the local authority in the capital city are turning their minds towards the main street of their entire functional area?</P>
    <P>Much play has been made by Members of the Opposition with some supposed plan prepared by the corporation in 1985. Unless I have been misled by officials of that body &mdash; and I do not for a moment suggest that I have &mdash; there is in reality no such plan.  There are a few sheets of paper which were presented amongst other documents to members of one of the corporation committees in early 1985. There was reference in these sheets of paper to possible pedestrianisation of various parts of the centre city.  These are laudable objectives but they are far from being a plan to cover or embrace the same area which is addressed in this legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the documents refers to pedestrianising a route between Henry Street and Grafton Street.  The core of it suggests designating a route and improving facilities for pedestrians from Henry Street, along Upper and Lower Liffey Street, the Halfpenny Bridge, Merchants' Arch, Crown Alley, around the Central Bank, across Dame Street at a pedestrian crossing, Trinity Street, St. Andrew's Street and Suffolk Street to Grafton Street.  That was published on 11 February 1985.  I hope I am referring to the correct documents; I suspect that I am.  This is the great plan upon which I am supposed to have modelled the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I refer the House to the policy document of my own party which is, as I have explained already, the basis for the proposals before us.  It was published in 1981.  The 1981 Fine Gael policy document <i>A New Deal for Dubliners</i> stated:</P>
    <P>We further propose the establishment of a major pedestrian area within the heart of Dublin by linking the pedestrianised Grafton Street with Henry Street along another new pedestrian route through Suffolk Street, <Col N="1506" /> the Central Bank plaza, Merchants' Arch, the Halfpenny Bridge and Liffey Street, as was, we understand, proposed some time ago by the City Centre Traders' Association.</P>
    <P>The plan to pedestrianise certain streets in the city centre, streets not covered by the proposals in this legislation, put forward some time in 1980 or 1981 by the City Centre Traders' Association and adopted and endorsed in a Fine Gael policy document in 1981, eventually found its way in February 1985 into a document from Dublin Corporation Roads and Traffic Department, submitted to the members of the corporation. That has been dragged in here and I have been accused of modelling my proposal on some document or plan put forward by the corporation.</P>

      <P>Eventually a map came with these documents.  This is supposed to be the plan on which the Bill before the House is based.  None of the area covered by the Metropolitan Streets Commission Bill is covered or addressed in the plan which accompanies those documents, except Grafton Street. O'Connell Street, Westmoreland Street, D'Olier Street, College Street and College Green are not addressed in any way. It shows, of course, the pedestrianised route I have outlined, the pedestrianised Henry Street and the occasionally pedestrianised Grafton Street.  From the point of view of colour illustration, the greatest trouble they went to was to colour the Liffey blue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Virtually every city and every urban centre of any consequence throughout Europe has had major city centre revitalisation plans in progress for some years.  They have major areas which are <Col N="1507" /> traffic free, permanently and exclusively devoted to the use of pedestrians so as to encourage them to use the area on a 24-hour basis and bring heart and vitality back into the city centre.  What have we, as a capital city, to show?  It is 19 years since Grafton Street was first occasionally pedestrianised.  Whenever the corporation want to dig up an adjoining street the traffic is diverted through Grafton Street, as happened within the past few years.  It is also turned back into a traffic route every evening of the week. We should be ashamed of ourselves if we talk about a supposed commitment to pedestrianisation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It involves the same sort of problems which face public authorities in every other country, but they have addressed these problems.  I recognise that to carry out this plan in a structured way would require an additional allocation of money and that is why the Bill provides for an injection of Government or taxpayers' money to the extent of £10 million on a three-year basis so as to make this concept a reality.  Questions have been asked as to whether £10 million is enough or even perhaps too much.  I do not know, but I know on the record to date that unless a body like this is established, given a mandate, given particular powers and finance, it will never be done.  The centre of my city, our city, the nation's city is daily running down and being degraded.  The time is not now; something like this should have been done years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite any Deputy, any Member of this House, to go out as I have done and walk through the streets of Dublin.  Start at the top of Grafton Street, walking perhaps a little more slowly than usual, and go as far as the Parnell Monument. Look at the surroundings &mdash; the clutter of street furniture, its poor condition, the broken flagstones in the footpaths, the areas where flagstones have been lifted and replaced with lumps of tarmacadam, <Col N="1508" /> the amount of litter, the filth, the stains on the pavement, the street markings. Look too at the quite beautiful examples of architecture at various stages along the route, most of them obliterated or defaced with generally tawdry plastic or neon-type signs.</P>
    <P>I invite them to look at the state of traffic in the principal street of the city and the pollution caused as a result.  I defy any Deputy who has any interest in the city to walk that route and not be pretty ashamed, disgusted and despondent by the time he or she reaches the Parnell Monument.  I defy any Deputy in the House not to decide that some major initiative is overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give the powers of the commission to the Dublin Transportation Authority for that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission will have the powers of the Dublin Transportation Authority.  That is contained within the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Dublin Transportation Authority will have no say in that area.  The powers will be with the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  An amount of the powers being given by this Bill to the commission are also powers which were already vested in Dublin Corporation and which they, for whatever reason, have not used.  Deputy Keating earlier in the House complained about the lack of thought in the siting of bus stops and the clutter of street furniture and sign-posts generally.  Again, that is a power in which the corporation are directly involved at present.  The siting of bus stops is a matter ultimately for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, who consults with the corporation and with CIE.  The question of where buses stand in the street ultimately involves the corporation.  The question of the coordination of road openings about which Deputy Keating complains so bitterly <Col N="1509" /> rested with the corporation under a particular arrangement, admittedly apparently not very satisfactorily.  Under the Bill dealing with Dublin transportation, the DTA will now have the statutory power to decide in relation to co-ordinating road openings, but in this designated area to be administered by the commission the commission will have that power for the three years.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to dwell on this point but because I pointed it out so often already I feel hurt that misstatements are being repeated.  This Bill was not introduced because any particular party happened to have a majority in Dublin Corporation. This Bill was not modelled on any corporation proposals; I do not want to appear denigratory about them, but they are relatively modest proposals of a small nature and do not at all address, in the way the Bill does, the core area of the city as I am trying to do.  The Bill is not modelled in any way on document 185 or anything else.  I never heard about these documents until this debate began in the House; I had to seek them out from the corporation.  The Bill sets out to address a particular problem and to do it in a structured way in a limited time span on the basis that when the work is done and the completed work is transferred back to the corporation it will be an area of which all of us will be pleased and proud. The corporation will then maintain it to that level because of the special status that it will have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed, in comparative terms, in the contributions here and the discussion on this Bill in the other House. A large part of the success of the commission will depend on a close co-operation between the corporation and the commission.  I always envisaged that that would be so.  The House will appreciate that it is usual to suggest publicly the names of any persons who might serve on a commission or authority set up under statute before the statute is enacted, quite simply for fear that the debate often happens then to centre around the names suggested for membership rather than on the proposal itself.  I took the unusual step at the outset of indicating that I felt <Col N="1510" /> it would be appropriate and self-obvious that the Dublin City Manager should be a member of the commission, so as to emphasise the close linkage I saw between the responsibilities of the corporation and the work of the commission. I very much hope there will be the closest of relationships between those two bodies so that a mutual objective of seeing the centre of the city raised to the highest possible level can be brought about.</P>
    <P>I feel disappointed that Deputy Tunney is not present at the moment.  I took the trouble, some hours before I announced this proposal publicly, to visit Deputy Bertie Ahern's predecessor as Lord Mayor, Deputy Tunney, and I brought Deputy Fergus O'Brien, Minister of State at my Department and himself a former Lord Mayor, with me to that meeting.  I dislike having to say this, but I feel that Deputy Tunney ought to have referred to this in his contribution. I outlined to the Lord Mayor of the day the proposals, the Government's intention to establish a commission, their decision to allocate funding to that commission and the purpose of the commission. At that meeting those proposals, which took printed form in the legislation now before the House, were welcomed by the Lord Mayor of the day, who wished the Minister of State and myself the best of luck with this commission and expressed his hope that it would be successful.  I invite the House, when the printed record of today's debate is published, to read the contribution of Deputy Tunney and compare it with my report of the conversation I had with the Lord Mayor of Dublin in June of 1986.</P>
    <P>I have a suspicion that a number of Deputies from all sides of the House are in favour of this proposal but some feel obliged to subscribe to a particular party line.  I do not understand the basis for that party line.  I would not have thought, even for the most pragmatic of reasons, that it was electorally popular, but I have a suspicion that a number of Deputies who contributed here might perhaps privately have some different views as to how this commission might go about their work.  All I shall say further in that <Col N="1511" /> respect is that I hope, when the commission are established, that those Deputies &mdash; especially those who are also members of the local authority involved &mdash; will, because of their commitment to this city, endeavour in whatever way they can to help the commission in their objectives and to help what I think must be regarded generally as the worthwhile objective of restoring the centre of Dublin to the grandeur it once had.</P>
    <P>I was rather disappointed and surprised at Deputy Mac Giolla's description of Dublin of 30 or 40 years ago, because it gave me a fairly rare old insight into perhaps the political ideology behind it all.  His description of the centre of Dublin was presumably based on recollection. I presume it is not particularly party ideology in the way that Deputy Mac Giolla describes his recollection of O'Connell Street at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What we need to do is to identify the great architectural features of the street and its surrounding areas. There is an enormous amount which can be built up.  There is an enormous amount of restoration work which can be done <Col N="1513" /> on facades of buildings.  There is an enormous amount of goodwill on the part of property owners who, once they see a plan being devised and addressed, will respond positively.  There are examples of how that has happened in other parts of the country, admittedly in smaller towns on a much smaller scale where, of necessity, the problem, once reduced in size, becomes easier to address.  I am quite convinced that, with goodwill on all sides, it will be possible to do the sort of thing we want to do here.</P>
      <P>Of course, the central median of O'Connell Street should be the focal point of the street and should be restored, as was the original intention of the wide streets commissioners.  It should be restored to a uniform width along its entire length.  That central mall should then be used for the provision of items of street interest, street furniture, whether they be fountains, pieces of sculpture, cafés, display boards, adequate seating, security kiosks, perhaps even Garda kiosks.  The footpaths in O'Connell Street need to be widened.  There should be proper kiosks provided for street vendors. Enormous care and attention should be given to every single item of street furniture.</P>
      <P>The first thing that should be decided is: is it necessary at all?  The second thing that should be decided is: how can it most tastefully be provided in a way that enhances the street?  There should be an overall style to the street furniture provided, running from O'Connell Street right up into Grafton Street.  There should be decisions taken on whether items such as ESB junction boxes and lots of the other clutter are necessary at all.  There should be somebody with a guiding hand &mdash; the commission &mdash; to decide on how that entire area is furnished. I believe that, if the commission attend to the smallest detail of how the street is set out, how traffic is regulated and street furniture provided, traders and shopowners will respond very positively in setting about the refurbishment of their shop fronts.</P>

      <P>It is one to which I have already directed my mind.  Obviously it would be quite impractical to decide, in improving the area to be covered by the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, to cause traffic chaos in adjoining areas.  There are already certain proposals afoot in that regard.  Perhaps in the course of the Committee Stage debate those points can be addressed more fruitfully, I have to say, than they were in the gist of the Second Stage debate.</P>
      <P>This Bill, to be successful, requires the co-operation of very many people.  It requires the co-operation of officials and members of Dublin Corporation, of the Garda Sióchána, especially as one of the points most emphasised by people talking about the city centre area is that, if they are to use it, they must have a feeling of security, they must feel happy and safe. They must feel it is a place to which they can bring their children and feel safe in so doing.  Perhaps the most acid test of all for adults is: do they feel safe being responsible for children in an area like that?  It requires the active co-operation of the Garda, of bodies such as CIE, the Dublin Transportation Authority and the city centre traders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All of those involved, for one reason or another, in the provision of services in that area.  Deputy Skelly spoke this morning about CIE.  He complained about advertising on Butt Bridge. I have to say that I share his view regarding that advertising.  In fact I took the matter up recently with the chairman of CIE who wrote back to tell me he believed, according to surveys carried out in other areas, that people favoured large, outdoor advertising in urban areas because they brightened up the scene. I find that a little difficult to credit.  I especially found the last part of the letter of the chairman of CIE a little difficult to take when he suggested to me that advertising on Butt Bridge was a part of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got round to replying to the chairman of CIE.  I am thinking of writing back to him saying: &ldquo;If advertising signs on Butt Bridge are a part of Dublin so were Guinness drays and trams, the Pillar, Monto, The Capitol, and Bang Bang, but they are all gone&rdquo;.  There are other things like pollution from heavy traffic, dereliction, plastic shop fronts and begging on O'Connell Bridge which should have all gone.  What must now happen, as is happening in so many areas all over the world, is that all of us must realise that, for whatever reason or combination of <Col N="1516" /> reasons, we have allowed what can only be described as an attack on our heritage to continue over a protracted number of years.</P>
      <P>For a long time we did not realise just how important our inner city and urban areas were, not just this area but urban areas generally in towns and cities throughout the country.  We have allowed many of them to run down to a dangerous extent.  There is now a very special task facing all of us, whether at national or local government level &mdash; to endeavour to identify what is best in what remains, ascertaining how best we can go about restoring what is restorable and building on what was originally provided.  We must identify, in every way we can, how we can build on that heritage, endeavouring to render it better for those who will succeed us.  The wide streets commissioners received an amount of criticism and had their work disregarded in their early years.  The recognition of the importance of their work did not come about until virtually after they were disbanded.  Now everybody realises that the centre of Dublin would be radically different and worse today had not the wide streets commissioners been established. I am satisfied that the task facing the Dublin metropolitan streets commissioners is just as significant and that the work they have to do is just as important. As I said in the other House, if they are successful, generations of Dubliners will be in their debt and the success of their work will be to their credit.  If they are not successful the Deputies can come back afterwards and blame me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Much more major legislation with regard to the role of building societies is required.  It is about time the Government introduced legislation covering the possibility of giving the societies the right to enter into the whole area of commercial banking.  Building societies since their foundation have played a major role in helping people to provide their own homes and something in the region of 80 per cent of all mortgages have been obtained through societies. On a point of order, may we have a little less noise?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The societies themselves must also have a very serious obligation to the public, and this should not be forgotten.  When you go back to the original objectives, when societies were first formed, you find that they were set up for the purpose of helping people in the lower income bracket to purchase their own homes.  I am afraid that many of the societies, unfortunately, are inclined to forget this and I shudder to think of the massive advertising costs, for instance, that a number of those societies <Col N="1520" /> have undertaken in recent years, some of them quite unnecessarily.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment recently expressed very serious concern and anxiety about the 3 per cent increase imposed by building societies.  Indeed, he threatened all sorts of dire actions and consequences, but the truth, of course, is that despite this legislation or any other the Minister can do absolutely nothing to prevent the latest rise or any other rises in interest rates.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the DIRT has had a devastating effect on all operations of all building societies and in one swoop took away the main attraction that building societies had for so many small savers who were not anxious to have the extent of their savings revealed to the Revenue Commissioners.  A sizeable proportion of depositors were willing to accept lower interest rates in exchange for what was a guarantee of confidentiality.  However, the DIRT removed this one attraction and brought building societies into line with the commercial banks and the consequential effect, of course, was that building societies had to compete with commercial banks for deposits and thus interest rates had to be brought to par or even made more attractive.</P>
      <P>Funds of dubious origin can be invested with complete confidence anywhere now because there is no longer an obligation on any of our financial institutions to disclose names of investors.  Previously an investor benefiting by £50 or more per annum in interest automatically came into the tax net.  It was always felt that confidentiality was breached and this was something that the small investor felt very concerned about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Building societies must now compete strongly with other financial institutions for deposits and in recent months competitors, such as the commercial banks, have been able to offer more attractive rates which naturally drew funds away from building societies.  The societies have claimed that in 1985 total deposit income for all building societies was £172 million but that in the current year it is estimated new deposits will be less than <Col N="1521" /> £80 million which is a drop of more than 50 per cent.  If this trend continues the mortgage holder will continue to be the victim of higher interest rates.  I believe the Minister must seriously consider allowing societies to operate in a way similar to commercial banks and this would then allow the societies to hold down mortgage rates.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the non-disclosure rule in the past cushioned the building societies and gave them a major advantage over commercial banks. Unfortunately, on the other hand it would appear that the societies themselves did not operate as efficiently as they should have done and management expenses soared to ridiculously high levels as can be seen from the latest financial reports covering in particular the &ldquo;Big Four&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is amazing, indeed, when comparing management expenses of the different building societies to notice the huge gap that exists in these expenses from the highest end of the scale to the lower end and this varies from, in one case £2.56 per £100 in assets down to £1.32 per £100. The office network of building societies in unbelievably wide as even some of the smallest towns around the country can boast of having up to maybe three or four branch offices of the various groups.  One must very seriously question the necessity for this type of expenditure by societies which, of course, in the final analysis must be borne by the mortgage holder.</P>
    <P>Building societies should examine whether this vast, wide network of branches all over the country is absolutely necessary.  The societies also must operate in the best interests of their depositors and again, I believe, the largest percentage of our depositors have their investments with building societies for one reason or another.  Recent circumstances have, of course, accelerated matters since the introduction of the DIRT which has driven up to nearly£1,700 million savings from this country since its introduction last January.</P>
    <P>The building societies cannot be isolated from the movements in the <Col N="1522" /> money market and one must be particularly concerned at the threat that mortgage rates in the future will be based on the performance of rates on the Dublin inter-bank market.  Inter-bank rates have always been much higher than mortgage rates and if the difference were to close, even in a small way, it would be even a more serious blow to the mortgage holder in the future.</P>
    <P>The overall management of the economy by the Government is, of course, the vital cog as far as financial institutions are concerned.  It is very obvious that if the Government run a current budget deficit of £1,500 million, which is the highest in money and percentage terms in the history of this State, this must have a serious, traumatic effect on the funding of the Government and money markets which, in turn, has a disastrous effect on the small investor and also on the mortgage holder.</P>
    <P>The managing director of one of our major societies said recently that the imposition of DIRT will, on its own, bring a .5 per cent increase in mortgage rates.  It is, therefore, ludicrous and dishonest for the Minister to say that such increases would not be acceptable to the Government when in reality it is he, and his Government, who have been the major contributors to the difficulties in the money market with the consequential effects on the building society sector in particular.</P>
    <P>The Minister's criticism of financial institutions is very much in contrast with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, who recently said when interviewed on radio with regard to the threatened 4 per cent mortgage rise that there was very little he, or the Government, could do about it as this was a trend outside the control of the Government and ourselves as a country.  This is a complete contradiction of the stand taken by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself I should like to refer specifically to section 4 which relates to tiered rates as this has been one of the most publicised and controversial issues of the Bill.  In principle very few people could oppose the removal of the <Col N="1523" /> two-tier rate structure but, nevertheless, guarantees must be given by the Minister that the removal of the premium rate for large borrowers, which will result in a reduction of their repayments, will not be at the expense of the lower scale mortgage holder.</P>
    <P>It is illogical for the Minister to presume that removing tiered interest rates increases competition among building societies and must therefore be in the borrowers' interest.  What will happen is that the large borrower, instead of paying the premium for a large loan, will get his loan at the same rate as everyone else. The level of basic mortgage rates will then be likely to increase and obviously will be at the expense of the borrower in the smaller bracket of £25,000 to £30,000. Tiered rates have, of course, been a very common principle as far as the commercial banks are concerned and the principle has been very long established.</P>
    <P>I welcome the prohibition or restriction on the charging of redemption fees, the making available to the borrower of valuation reports and the alteration in the insurance of the property.  Nevertheless I feel that building societies will have very strong reservations about the insurance aspect of the property as it may well be impossible for the society to safeguard their particular interest if they are not aware whether the property is adequately insured or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Most of these changes will obviously result in additional costs to the society and, as always in such cases, such charges are very rarely carried by the financial institution itself and will obviously be passed on in some form or other to the mortgage holder.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister did not go into the area of introducing greater legislation for building societies and it is obvious that this Bill has been rushed into with great haste following the recent disagreements and quarrels the Minister has had with the various executives and institutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister must not fail to recognise that the reality of the situation is that mortgages constitute the single most <Col N="1524" /> important expenditure of 120,000 Irish families.  I would be concerned that the implications of this Bill may bring more increases on mortgage holders due to the Minister's window dressing and piecemeal legislation which may in the long term be unhelpful to everybody.  It is essential for the long term future stability and security of the mortgage holders that the air be cleared completely as far as the economy is concerned.  It has been indicated by a number of prominent people in financial institutions that only an early general election can ease the present uncertainty which has become a major barrier to investment with the resultant serious effect on interest rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the very important subject of building societies, their operations in our society, control of them and their impact on a large and very responsible sector of our society.  All this to my mind is very important.</P>
      <P>In the explanatory memorandum the Minister says that the Bill will empower building societies to make loans for such purposes, and subject to such conditions, as may be prescribed by the Minister for the Environment and not solely on the security of a mortgage as heretofore.  All Members of this House know that one of the bonanzas for the banking institutions for some time has been the provision of bridging loans at very high rates of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister is endeavouring to empower building societies to provide bridging loans.  I presume the rate of interest that would be charged on bridging loans would not be significantly greater than the agreed interest charged on the mortgage.  This is important. There is not much point in giving power to building societies to provide bridging loans if all they do is provide the bridging loan at a high rate of interest.  I know young people who have decided to take the very serious step of purchasing a house.  They have been practically strangled when there was a delay in the provision of the money by the building society, for whatever reason.  Very often <Col N="1525" /> the reason is connected with the legalities of the procedure &mdash; the titles are not easily verified and so on.  A legal personage in my county told me that in County Cavan and many other counties people are living in houses which were built originally on property to which they had not title.  This of course, rectifies itself through the passage of time, but apparently it is true and he gave me a number of examples to prove it.</P>
    <P>I do not know what other areas the Minister might have in mind for the empowering of building societies to make loans but that is one which I would support in the terms I have mentioned, namely, that the interest rates would relate closely, if not identically, to the rates about to be charged when the mortgage is through.  It could be argued that there was a little element of risk there compared with the mortgage when the site and house were there to guarantee the mortgage but, if this Bill addresses this serious social ill of people being bled to death by high interest rates on bridging loans, it is to be welcomed by the House. Even before now this House should have taken cognisance of the colossal amount of profit that was made out of young people about to purchase their houses and having difficulty before the building society provided the money or the legal people cleared up the problems.</P>
    <P>The second point made in the first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum deals with tiered rates.  I have not listened to all the contributions to this debate so far but I am sure this has been teased out already.  This is a very difficult area and we must take a balanced view of it.  I am afraid that removing the higher rate from the higher loan will, like a bad drainage scheme, back up river and cause the person on the lower loan to eventually pay some part of an integer of a percentage more for this mortgage.  If that is so, I would be opposed to it.  No doubt the rationale will be given and explained by the Minister in his reply, but as of now I am not convinced that the poorer man will not be paying for some of the advantages given to the richer man.</P>
    <P>Section 6 empowers the Minister, <Col N="1526" /> after consultation with the Registrar of Building Societies to make regulations prescribing building society rules.  When both Houses pass a Bill, the President signs it and it is put on the Statute Book but if it gives powers to the Minister that are not circumscribed, that is a dangerous move.  The idea of empowering in that way has been criticised many times here by people experienced in legal matters.  Some of the objectives of the empowering are to be welcomed and praised but, nevertheless the principle of empowering a Minister without his having to come back to this House is something we should be very chary about.  The explanatory memorandum says that the building societies have to be consulted, but if the consultation takes the form a great deal of the consultation which has taken place recently between the Minister for the Environment and the building societies has taken, I cannot see how it would have much impact in making the Minister modify his decisions.  It is a running scandal that the Minister and the building societies are not pulling together in the interests of the citizens, either those who invest in building societies, and there are many of them, or those who have mortgages from the various societies.</P>
    <P>The first restriction is the prohibiting or restricting of the charging of redemption fees, that is, any amount over and above the principal and interest due at the time of redemption.  I am in total agreement with that.  I am sure there was an attempt at justification for that when it was originally decided upon but it is like the final flick of the whip for the donkey just when he is going free.  Whether any claim is made that a service is rendered in lieu of the redemption fee I do not know, but it does not seem to be justifiable in any way.  The second restriction is:</P>
    <P>the making available to a borrower of the valuation report on a property required under section 79 (1) (b) of the Building Societies Act, 1976;</P>
    <P>This seems to be only fair and just, that the person who pays for the service <Col N="1527" /> should be entitled to have a view of it. The next is:</P>
    <P>removing or restricting the right of a society to require a member to insure the property with a particular insurer;</P>
    <P>That, of course, is enhancing the freedom of the borrower and in that sense it is to be welcomed.  One point on that is that if the society is dealing with a specific insurance company as is usually the case, there is a possibility that the society would be able to get a better deal seeing it is doing big business with the company.  If that society passes on this benefit to the customer there would not be anything particularly wrong about it. I suppose the society will continue to do that, to pass on the advantages of doing business with the insurance company to the borrower, if the borrower is willing to accept the policy from that company as recommended by the building society. There is a freedom in a number of directions which is important.  I presume the intention here is to remove the compulsory element so that the member of the building society would have the freedom to insure some place else than the place recommended by the building society.</P>
    <P>The next restriction in the explanatory memorandum is:</P>
    <P>&mdash;precluding or restricting a society from requiring a member to pay its costs of legal investigation of title to the property which is being mortgaged;</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any distinction made between the words &ldquo;precluding&rdquo; or &ldquo;restricting&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Precluding&rdquo; means cutting it out altogether.  Perhaps the Minister would let me know about this. Technically until the last mortgage repayment is made, the site and the house belong to the society.  I know there are various qualifications on that and that the society cannot do what it likes all through the 25-year or 30-year period of the mortgage, but the fact is that at the start of the operation anyway the biggest ownership input is by the society and it seems to be <Col N="1528" /> only right and equitable that the society should pay.</P>
    <P>This point about the insurance could equally apply to the next restriction which is:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the arranging by a society with an insurer for mortgage protection insurance.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already that one of the regrettable aspects of this Bill is that it is coming in a climate of antagonism.  The building societies are embattled and the Minister is attacking.  As Bernard Shaw said at some stage, &ldquo;Irish people are not at their best when they are in an angry mood&rdquo;.  I am just wondering how that climate may have impacted on this Bill. The Minister said he intended to expand much further than this Bill the areas of activity for building societies and many building societies are clamouring for just that.  They are under pressure from the banks.  There is no doubt but that the banks have been conducting a kind of guerrilla warfare against the building societies for some time.  The banks are very powerful institutions and the societies are convinced that the whole procedure of the retention tax, the DIRT tax, and the attempt to equalise the banks and the building societies with regard to their powers to attract investors was a deliberate move by the Government in favour of the banks and against them. The societies are anxious to be allowed to engage in other banking activities in order to be able to attract more customers. They took exception to the Government's agreement to the Bank of Ireland being allowed to take over the ICS Building Society.</P>
    <P>I was on an RTE programme recently where the managing director of one of the building societies said that as a result of that vast sums of money were transferred from the Bank of Ireland into the Irish Civil Service Building Society.  I have no way of knowing that but the figures for investment are such that there is an indication such a transfer took place. One result of this whole action has been that the building societies feel that money has gone, in that instance to another <Col N="1529" /> society that does not belong to their group, but in many other instances away from the country altogether.  The element of confidentiality seems to have been restored with regard to banking deals now and this has always been jealously guarded by the building societies.  That is a good thing.  We may have made a mistake in that we did not establish ourselves as a country where money could be lodged and where, barring criminal circumstances, nobody could find out where that money was lodged.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the rule that the banks had to report interest accrued over a certain amount &mdash; when Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance he reduced the figure overnight &mdash; was a mistake.  Small places like the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands gained from the lack of confidentiality with regard to money matters. Switzerland has enriched itself by establishing very strict rules in regard to confidentiality. The building societies prided themselves on maintaining confidentiality, they made a deal and they paid tax which was increased in recent years.  The pressure was on them and I am sure the fact that they were ready to accept deposits enriched this country with money which otherwise would not have been deposited here.  I am thinking of the time we joined the European Monetary System and when it was reasonably well known &mdash; at least in my part of the country &mdash; that we got money back from Britain and the Six Counties and that much of it was lodged in the building societies.  That is a very important aspect of the whole banking scene.</P>
    <P>The recent increase of 3 per cent is a very severe blow, particularly to those who are just starting off and who have very tight budgets.  Nowadays young people who buy a house by getting a mortgage from a building society have to cost it very carefully.  It has been a tradition that people have deprived themselves of even frugal comforts in order to be able to buy a house.  I know that we have the highest percentage of house owners in Europe but I was told recently that we have the highest percentage in <Col N="1530" /> the world in that regard.  It is true that people with very substantial salaries in some European cities could never hope to own a house in a European city roughly the size of the greater Dublin area.  Home ownership is desirable and for that reason it would be the wish of the House that the rise of 3 per cent will not last too long.  The House would wish also that the social ambition for people to own their own houses would continue.  I remember being at an educational conference years ago and a man from Munich, who had a very substantial salary as headmaster of a gymnasium, told me that he would never own a house despite the fact that his salary was treble that of people buying houses here.</P>
    <P>There may be Deputies who, because of their age bracket and because they have been through the business of applying for and getting mortgages, are perhaps a little too complacent about the problems of young people.  Of course we must relate salaries to what they were 20 or 30 years ago but nevertheless income comparisons influence our thinking though the price of houses may have multiplied 20 times during that period.  Salaries and wages have not kept pace to the same extent.  There should have been representative costings produced so that a full realisation of the heavy load placed on young people at present could be made in the House.  When you think that a house which was bought for £2,500 in the sixties now costs £40,000 &mdash; even though prices have fallen &mdash; it gives an idea of the scale of the increase.  Perhaps young people are not willing to make the same kind of sacrifices we made but we can be a little hard and critical of them because they do not invest in a house. Several young couples of my acquaintance are scared to make such investment even where the husband and wife are working.  Indeed very often it is essential for the wife to work because of heavy payments on mortgages.  In many cases the wife does not work by choice.</P>
    <P>The general financial policy of the Government has been largely responsible for high interest rates.  Any commodity which is scarce gets dearer and this <Col N="1531" /> applies as much to money as to chickens, potatoes, coal, oil or anything which is scarce.  The parlous state of the country's finances at present is responsible to a great extent for the high interest rates in a period when inflation has dropped.  A number of comments have been made on what happened to the money to make it scarce and the big talking point is not the national debt and the Government's inability to get money in the market.  The Taoiseach announced that the Government had to call down loans from Europe recently.  The House will remember that he did that when there was near panic regarding a further devaluation of the IR£.  The Taoiseach had to say they would confine their budget deficit next year to 7.4 per cent of GNP.  All this is linked to the question of the rates of interest on mortgages.  Commentators generally contend that the sum of £1,500 million went out of the country because of the retention tax.  Even small savers were scared that the £100 interest on which they were depending would now be £65. It is well known that little suitcases full of money have been travelling to Newry, Enniskillen and Derry in the wake of this tax.  Of course that is not taking the big stuff into account, it is switched around nowadays by pressing buttons.  These amounts of money leaving the country are a serious drain and this has an impact on the building societies, banks, borrowings and loans.</P>
    <P>We also have the repatriation of profits by foreign companies located here.  The removal of that money from the country makes it harder for banks, building societies and the poor unfortunates who borrow money in the hope of establishing homes for themselves.  We have received an assurance that the budget deficit next year will be 7.4 per cent of GNP.  The former Minister for Finance told us that the deficit for 1986 would be £1.25 billion. Recently we were told the deficit would overrun that figure by £180 million.  The most recent forecasts are bringing it up to between £1.4 billion and £1.5 billion. In those circumstances our hopes that the <Col N="1532" /> problem about mortgage interest rates will go away fairly quickly are unjustified. I hope I am wrong.  The Government stand condemned.</P>
    <P>The Government had great advantages since the period when oil prices began to fall.  That money was left in this country for investment.  It was lifted out and put down in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, the UK, Norway, or wherever oil was for sale.  I do not think people realise the extent of the drop in oil prices.  As I say, that money should be here and should be available for the purposes we are talking about.  For example, in January 1979, the year when prices went crazy, the price of a barrel of light Arabian crude oil was $15.95.  In February, the price was $19.50; in March, $20.80; in April, $21.20 and in May, $34.25.  The average for 1981 was $39.25.  The current issue of <i>The Economist</i> quotes a figure of in and around $14.  Since Sheikh Yamani went it is said they have been trying to push up the price to $17 or $18 a barrel.  That will take some extra money out of the country.  That money should be in this country.  We are now paying only one-third of what we were paying for oil in 1981 and that money should be available here.  There is an obligation on the Government to organise their taxation policy and their fiscal and financial policies in such a way that that money will be left in the country.  If there was a glut of potatoes, your four stone sack would be cheaper.  Consequently, money would be cheaper if it was organised in such a way that that money was left here.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion when the building societies were suffering a temporary inflow problem the then Minister for the Environment went to the EC and arranged that funds would be made available to the societies.  They were guaranteed against exchange rate losses which in turn protected the mortgage holder from a higher interest rate.  Can the Minister say whether any such effort was made to obtain EC funds to relieve the high pressure on mortgage holders in this instance?  The Minister says, and I accept his word, that his aim is to protect the mortgage holder.  If that is so, that is <Col N="1533" /> another avenue he could have explored. I have already said that commentators are of the opinion that interest rates will not remain high for a long time.  I hope that is true.  I gave my reasons as to why I doubt that.  Agreeing to the premise that it will only be for a short time is an added reason some attempt should have been made in Europe to try to alleviate, in the short term at least, for a brief period the position of the mortgage holder.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the definite arrival of English building societies to do business here.  I have heard it stated that, until there is a considerable relaxation of the rules, this is unlikely to happen.  I am enough of a traditionalist to want to see the Irish societies hold their position and sustain both the inflow of funds and issuing of mortgages at the level at which they are doing so now.  I am only talking about England at present.  There is no reason why societies from other countries may not locate here under the right of establishment in the Treaty of Rome. There are 120,000 mortgage holders and 800,000 depositors in the country.  In the best sense, a segment of our society is deeply interested in what this House does about the rules for building societies. There is an obligation on this House to protect the mortgage holder and there is an obligation on this House to protect our citizens who have invested in building societies.  I appeal to the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland, to come back again, after he has simmered down and allowed peace to break out between himself and the societies, with more comprehensive legislation which will be to the benefit of investors, the holders of mortgages and the country in general.</P>

Ach mar sin féin, tríd's tríd, caithfimíd glacadh go ndearnadar an-chuid maitheasa do dhaoine óga, daoine nach raibh chomh hóg san, a bhí ag iarraidh teach a cheannach.

      <P>Much has been said throughout the country about our building societies and it would be wrong if one gave the impression they were held in any great form of endearment by people who over the years have had occasion to go to them for financial assistance to purchase a house.  However, it must be admitted there are countless thousands who own their own home, something we all regard as socially desirable, and who would not have it were it not for the assistance, understanding and services made available to them by our building societies. That should be acknowledged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion to make representations to local managers expressing my displeasure about bridging finance, or when I discovered that the solicitor operating for the building society also operated for the purchaser.  I had some reservations also when it seemed to me that there was an undesirable affinity between building societies and insurance companies.  I did not regard that operation as ideal.  If we take the proof of the pudding being in the eating of it we must say that the results of the investments, and the assistance given by societies were very good. I know many people who invested in a house, with the assistance of a building society, and when the value appreciated over the years they recovered their investment and moved to a greater investment.  That would not have been possible without the assistance of building societies.  In those cases it was not <Col N="1535" /> possible for local authorities, or the Government, to make money available. Building societies made it possible for people to purchase their own home, a desire that is inbred in Irish people.  For those reasons we must recognise the contribution of building societies.</P>
    <P>I understand that in 1988 freedom of services legislation will come to us from the EC as a result of which we will have an influx of continental interests.  That may cause havoc to our own institutions. I wonder what protection they will get from this Government if they are in power in 1988 but, thankfully, one does not have to be a contributor to Old Moore's Almanac to know that that will not be the case.  We must bear in mind the attitude adopted by the Government when the Bank of Ireland moved in on the Irish Civil Service Building Society. Promises were made then about protecting building societies.  I know that building societies are not waiting for my advice on this matter but if I was anticipating what may happen in 1988, irrespective of the emotional terminology of cartels, monopolies and so on, I would expect to find it difficult to preserve my position and withstand the attacks that will come.  I do not think they will get protection from the Government.  The Government are anxious to accept every directive that comes from the EC.  Their first response to the Single European Act was to demonstrate there was nothing at all in it, that it was just another obligation and everything would be grand although a blind man could see that it would be a continuation of the gradual erosion of our sovereignty, our freedom and our right to remain neutral.  The building societies, in the light of their contribution in regard to the provision of housing, should watch their position.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I was critical of building societies who were not, in my opinion, fulfilling their <i>raison d'être</i> by attending to those in the middle income group who were anxious to buy houses.  At that time I had information that building societies were making money available to the builders rather than to those who were <Col N="1536" /> anxious to buy houses.  However, I do not have any great objection to a special rate for those who borrow beyond a certain figure.  Deputy Ray Burke, in the course of his contribution, said that in the Minister's case, his Rambo-type posturing provided him with the occasional favourable heading in the short term but resulted in a poisoning of the atmosphere between the societies and himself to the detriment of the hard-pressed families of the country.  I must admit that when that statement was made I had some reservations about it but, having listened to the Minister today on another matter that affected me I am prepared to go further than our spokesman on what motivates the Minister.  I am attributing to him in introducing the legislation an attitude that derives from his failure to get the building societies to respond to him in a way that suited him but was not beneficial to the building societies.</P>
    <P>I have had an insight into the Minister's attitude in connection with the legislation the House debated earlier, the establishment of a commission to look after part of Dublin.  On 17 June the Minister advised my secretary that he was anxious to see me but he did not disclose the purpose.  As I had been in contact with the Minister about another matter concerning a constituent of mine I assumed the Minister wanted to pay a courtesy call on me to discuss it.  When the Minister, and his Minister of State called, I, as Lord Major of Dublin, made them as welcome as everybody else who called.  In fact, as he was a Minister, and was accompanied by his junior Minister, I made a point of making him more welcome.  He mentioned his intention of making more money available to Dublin in respect of its improvement.  I welcomed that good news.  Before leaving he indicated that he was doing it by means of overlooking the responsibilities and obligations of the elected members and I told him I would not anticipate that the members of Dublin Corporation would be very happy about what he was doing.  That is the position as it occurred on 17 June.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaking an hour or two ago attributed to me an insincerity in my <Col N="1537" /> contribution on the legislation because I had welcomed the news he gave me.  I did no such thing.  I welcomed him and his Minister of State and I regret now that I did so.  I indicated to them that the members of Dublin Corporation would be most unhappy about it.  I have spoken to the Minister since but he says he did not understand that.  He did not tell the House and did not tell me on that occasion that he was going to a lunch where he would announce the establishment of the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant.  Our spokesman said that the Minister's Rambo-like posturings against the soft target of the building societies which have provided him with the occasional favourable headline in the short term have resulted in a poisoning of the atmosphere between the societies and himself to the detriment of the hard-pressed families of the country.  I must accept that <i>in toto</i> because the Minister's attitude towards me as a Member of this House and as Lord Mayor of Dublin in respect of the other legislation was precisely the same. That is the point I am endeavouring to make.  Because of the Minister's attitude to these matters I am afraid that what he has in mind here is not entirely to the benefit of the people for whom he would claim to express concern but rather it is his way of demonstrating to the building societies &mdash; who, after all, operate on the <Col N="1538" /> democratic principles which govern this country &mdash; that unless they respond to his dictates he has the means of forcing them to do so.</P>
      <P>I am not unmindful of the fact that the building societies are trying to survive in that horrible world of money and have been endeavouring to move into other banking areas, especially since the introduction of the infamous DIRT tax.  The Minister may be indicating to them that unless they play ball in regard to this legislation he will thwart their efforts to survive in other areas.  I have no doubt about it, from my insight into the mind of the Minister, what motivates him, what he is capable of saying and how he is prepared to distort what happens and give an appearance of truth to what he knows to be untrue.  I did not say he was telling lies.</P>

      <P>With the reservation I have expressed, I acknowledge the contribution that building societies in general have made to the social and economic life of this country.  I express concern that the pressure to which they are being subjected at the moment is not necessarily in keeping with what is best for them or the people; rather is it the outpourings of a Minister who for his own good reasons thinks he is a man to whom the powers to dictate rather than co-operate have been given. These are my reservations and accordingly I would be more in favour of being in error with the building societies than being right with the Minister.</P>

      <P>The building societies have played a most important part in affording to thousands the opportunity to purchase their own homes.  The building <Col N="1539" /> societies are not perfect.  I had a great deal of experience of dealing with them prior to coming into this House.  It would be untrue to say that all these dealings were of a happy nature but looking overall at the benefit derived by the people from the building societies it is only fair to say that without them this country would be a poorer place.</P>
      <P>There is no disagreement about the necessity for an updating of legislation covering the operations of building societies.  It is ten years since such a review took place and during those years the financial goalposts have moved considerably. Does this Bill treat seriously and in depth the underlying problems which face the building societies?  I contend that it does not.</P>
      <P>During the past week there has been an increase in building society rates and the implications of the increases are very serious for many thousands of families. In this period of depression when unemployment is at a high rate and thousands of workers are barely hanging on to jobs or accepting reductions in wages, increases in mortgage rates are a tremendous pressure on families.  A person with a £30,000 mortgage faces an extra bill of £60 per month.</P>
      <P>This increase has been brought about by a number of factors.  The Minister and the Government must take the major responsibilty.  The Government's total mismanagement of the country's finances has resulted in a complete collapse of confidence in the money markets which has driven general interest rates to record levels as against inflation.  The factors which have brought about this situation are a record current budget deficit, a spiralling national debt and unacceptable levels of foreign borrowing.  We were told four years ago that all of these were to go in the other direction, but it has been shown that those who were going to bring this about were not capable of doing so. Might I take this occasion to say that it would be the honourable thing for them to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to see some members of the so-called Government coming back into the House.  As Members are well aware, one of the reasons for the interest rates rising in the last number of years is that the record of the Government with regard to their current budget deficit has driven them through the sky.  We have a spiralling national debt and unacceptable levels of foreign borrowing.  On previous occasions when the societies were suffering inflow problems, Fianna Fáil arranged that EC funds would be made available to them and guaranteed against exchange rate losses, thus protecting the mortgage holder.  The protection of the mortgage holder is of prime importance today.  Unfortunately, the present stance of the Government towards the societies and the mismanagement of Government will have blown the roofs off many family <Col N="1541" /> homes.  It is of increasing concern that over the past number of months more and more people with difficulties about their mortgage have been coming to see me and, no doubt, to many other Deputies. The blame falls firmly into the lap of the present Government.</P>
      <P>In the future, with the changes resulting from EC decisions, there will be an influx of British and continental societies into this country.  Our national interest would best be served by a comprehensive measure which would strengthen the base and clarify the role of our societies in the future within our economy.  The Minister has failed to do this in this Bill, a Bill which he and many speakers for the Government intimated would do so.</P>
      <P>An area in which we on this side of the House feel there is a potential for greater competition is that of banking.  Comprehensive legislation should cover the possibility of extending the rights of entry into the banking arena to the societies. Unfortunately, the Minister has missed that opportunity because what he was seeking apparently was some short term political gain by being seen to attack the soft target of the societies.  We in Fianna Fáil feel that there is considerable room for improvement in the operation of the building societies and also that the Minister has lost the opportunity to protect the vital national interest.  Surely one area of job creation in the future must be the financial services.  It is vital consequently that we have a strong home base for this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The societies play a major role representing, as they do, over 120,000 mortgage holders and approximately 800,000 depositors.  It is the responsibility of the Government to deal with the societies, their borrowers and depositors, in a responsible way.  This sense of responsibility was lacking with the introduction of the deposit interest retention tax which has driven up to £1.5 billion of savings from this country since last January.  The building societies as well as the banks are governed by movements on the money markets.  We are concerned at the threat that mortgage rates in the future will be based on the performance of rates on the <Col N="1542" /> inter-bank market.  Recently there has been a difference of up to 4 per cent between the inter-bank rate and the home loan rate.  The overall management of the economy by the Government is consequently of vital importance to the societies, their mortgage holders and their depositors.  When this Government also run a current budget deficit of £1,500 million, which is the highest in money and percentage terms in the history of the country, this has a traumatic effect on the funding of the Government in the money markets which, in turn, has a catastrophic effect on mortgage holders. When the DIRT provision was spelled out back in January, immediately the building societies stated that it would bring about an increase in mortgage rates of around .5 per cent.  The Minister said this would not be acceptable but what has he done about it?  The reality is that he will not be able to interfere with market forces.  The Minister for Finance was reported recently to have said about the threatened 4 per cent mortgage interest rise that there was very little the Government could do about it.  We have one Minister saying it is not acceptable and doing nothing about it and another saying that he cannot do anything about it. Which do we believe?</P>
    <P>One of the most publicised sections of this Bill is section 4 which relates to tiered rates.  In principle, I would not be opposed to the removal of a two-tiered rate, but what be the effect of that?  We fear that the removal of the premium rate for large borrowers will result in a reduction in their payments &mdash; about which we are not complaining &mdash; but at whose expense will that be?  It will be at the expense of the standard scale mortgage holder, and that is what we object to.</P>
    <P>For example, under the provisions of the Bill, a person borrowing, say, £60,000 instead of paying the premium for a large loan will get his loan at the same rate of interest as everybody else.  This means that the basic mortgage rate will be likely to increase.  The result will be that the less well off, those people scraping to provide a home for themselves and their <Col N="1543" /> families, will be faced with higher repayments. Is this what the Minister wants? Is that what the Labour Party want?  Will the Minister confirm that that will not happen because otherwise we shall find it extremely difficult to support the provisions of this section?</P>
    <P>Section 6, among other things, prohibits or restricts the charging of redemption fees, a principle we welcome.  It also recommends the making available to a borrower of the valuation report, the alteration of the insurance arrangements on the property, changes in legal costs and the arrangement of mortgage protection insurance.  Just as with the proposal to abolish tiered interest rates we fear that these measures will result in extra repayments for borrowers.</P>
    <P>We welcome the proposal to abolish redemption fees and give greater freedom of choice with regard to insurance. However, the societies claim that that will lead to a reduction in their income which cannot be offset by greater efficiency within their operations and will have to be passed on to the already hard-pressed borrower.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal to allow borrowers to see the valuations on their properties the societies claim that those who carry out valuations on their behalf would find it difficult to insure themselves against third party actions if their valuations were found to be negligent.  In turn that would lead to a rise in valuations costs which again would be passed on to the borrower by way of increased mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points the Minister made in regard to section 6.  However, there is an underlying current, which is that mortgage payments will be increased at every turn.  In replying I should like the Minister to explain what he foresees happening.  Would he confirm to us that borrowers will not be faced with greater repayments especially in these hard times?</P>
    <P>The position of building societies needs to be examined in the light of their changing role.  This review of the Building Societies Act, 1976 has been undertaken <Col N="1544" /> with undue haste.  The Minister seems intent on pushing ahead regardless of the resultant potential increase in mortgage repayments.  Interest rates have risen in recent months and will rise again because of the implications of the deposit interest retention tax.  The Minister must recognise this reality and also that mortgages constitute the single most important expenditure of 120,000 Irish families.  I fear that the implications of these provisions will heap more increases on mortgagors. The Minister's window dressing exercise, his piecemeal tinkering with this whole area will not hide that fact.  The effect of all of this will be that the basic mortgage rate will be increased so that a borrower with a £20,000 mortgage will pay more while someone else with a £50,000 mortgage will pay less.</P>
    <P>The answer to the problems in our society today &mdash; in an atmosphere in which there is no confidence, when everything is going downhill &mdash; is to have a general election so that a party capable of governing would be back on that side of the House.</P>

      <P>I would be an advocate of an approach to less Government interference within our economy.  However, I recognise that, in Irish economic life, we tend to allow the original purpose of any agency to be lost.  There is no doubt that the development of the building societies has been worthwhile but, when they assume such a size and importance within that economy, there is very little that can be done about it.  Undoubtedly they have provided the necessary mortgage finance to fund a great deal of house purchase and building.  But the major building societies have grown in such enormous proportions they now assume an importance within our economy about which any Government can do little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill constitutes a cosmetic exercise in which any Government of the day must become involved.  Under the law of the land we must incorporate regulations regarding building societies to protect the ordinary consumer.  In my opinion the passage of this Bill will not make one whit of difference to the operations of <Col N="1545" /> those building societies.  I read of a survey carried out recently to the effect that the management expenses of Irish building societies on the whole are far greater per £1,000 invested than is the case with the major building societies in the United Kingdom.  Apart from one Irish building society, namely, the Irish Nationwide. which has the lowest management expense ratio in the country, and which could compare with some of its UK counterparts, the others have large management expense ratios.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of this Bill is to abolish tiered interest rates, to abolish the societies' practice of charging redemption fees, to have the societies make available to house purchasers their surveyors' reports and allow a purchaser free access to any insurance company of his or her choice.  However the reality is that the building societies will have to ensure a certain return.  Anybody who has had any dealings with a building society will know that there are many charges involved in the execution of a mortgage, charges such as those in respect of insurance, surveyors' reports, legal expenses and so on.  I anticipate that what will happen will be that building societies will get together in a type of cartel or on a nod and wink basis, when interest rates charged to mortgagors will rise.  That is the reality of the building society world in Ireland.  I presume the Minister has done his best over the past couple of months in an endeavour to hold down mortgage interest rates for borrowers but the building societies control such a large segment of the mortgage market that this strengthens their hands. It must be remembered that they compete for depositors' funds in the same market as the banks, insurance companies and indeed the Government.  I am sure the Minister has come to realise that the building societies play such a dominant role in our economy, there is sweet damn all he can do about mortgage interest rates.  I hope he will have learned that lesson when he comes to introduce <Col N="1546" /> further legislation with regard to building societies in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to pick up the point that was being made by Deputy Wallace.  Perhaps we might get some clarification on it.  Too often charges are sent hither and thither across the House without any consideration as to what might happen as a result of them.  If charges of the nature Deputy Wallace mentioned have been made, they should <Col N="1550" /> be substantiated.  I do not think any public representative, certainly not any that I know, would embark on something that would cause a tremendous amount of difficulty, not to that public representative, but to the people to whom the advice had been given.  It would be a very serious matter if a public representative did that.  If the Minister has evidence of that he should give it to the House so that it can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>In the very short period of time that has been allocated to me I would like, in the strongest possible terms, to support what I think is a very sensible Fianna Fáil motion, that is, that Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and the Government to rescind their directive giving city and county managers the power to fix local authority rents and to restore to local authority tenants representatives, the National Association of Tenants' Organisations, their right to negotiate a national uniform rents scheme on behalf of tenants.  It is stretching credibility to the ultimate to think that this change from central control will mean an improvement in the services to the tenants.  Since this announcement was made various Government spokesmen lauded the change stating that it is a further indication of the commitment of this Government towards the devolution of more power to the local authorities.  It is another pointer to the Government's desire and determination to make local authorities more relevant and to give them a greater say in their own decision-making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pose the question as to what the Government are really doing here.  They are involved in a cynical exercise of sleight of hand designed to create the illusion that they are genuine in their statement in relation to the devolution of more power to local authorities, in their declaration that they will give them real authority and relevance.  This so-called devolution of powers was sold as an indicator of the Government's intent and commitment, but the reality which took some time to appear is completely different like so many other examples of action by this discredited Government.  When <Col N="1551" /> the proposal was examined it became evident that, far from power being devolved to local authority representatives, as was first indicated, power was being made an executive function.</P>
    <P>One would have thought this Government would have learned a lesson from the 1983 legislation which gave the city and county managers power to impose service charges.  For two years we saw the battle that created all around the country. We saw the Government, prior to the 1985 local elections, suddenly having a change of heart and having the gall to try to indicate that by giving power to the local authority members to charge water rates and service charges they were doing those local authority members a great favour.  In reality they were just remedying the deplorable decision that Fianna Fáil warned them at the time would cause tremendous problems, but in a flurry of publicity they sought to convince people of their goodness and their generosity in changing their own decision.</P>
    <P>Why was this decision made?  The answer is simply a lack of political will and political courage.  This Government for the purpose of political expediency and electoral advantage refused to increase local authority rents during 1984 and 1985 because of the European and local elections.  That is how this scheme was born.  They are now trying to use this opportunity under the guise of devolving power to the local authorities.  They are running away from the risk that might attach to the raising of local authority rents.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment even this week gives an indication of the chaos that will arise from this directive.  I know it has been read before but it is important that it be read again.  The amendment states that:</P>
    <P>the rent payable should be related to income</P>
    <P>It does not say why:</P>
    <P>and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income householders;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> It does not say what that proportion is; it leaves it to each individual city manager. The amendment continues:</P>
    <P>allowances should be made for dependent children;</P>
    <P>Will the allowances in Dublin be greater or less than those in Cork, Mayo or Donegal? The next provision is:</P>
    <P>a contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners in the household;</P>
    <P>That is a new one.  It was there first and it was changed, now it is back again and now the city manager can carry the blame for something the Government have not got the courage to do.  Next:</P>
    <P>provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>
    <P>That amendment is a recipe for chaos, confusion and disaster.  That amendment, like the circular, has sent shivers through city managers and it has driven them into conclave.  They are in the process of trying to see how they themselves can come to some consensus because as that amendment is now drafted it would mean different rents for people of the same income almost in every county.  I am a member of Ballina District Council and Mayo County Council.  The town of Ballina is approximately two and a half miles from the Sligo border.  Three local authorities are operational in that area, Ballina District Council, Mayo County Council and just over the border Sligo County Council.  Under this new directive that has been given to the city managers you could have local authority tenants on the same income with the same size of family and the same commitments but paying three different rents.  That is a recipe for confusion and chaos and there is no logic at all to the decision that this Government have made.</P>
    <P>It makes little sense &mdash; as a matter of fact it makes no sense at all &mdash; that this <Col N="1553" /> Government should seek to depart from a scheme which has been a great success over the past 12 years or so, a system that has given stability and peace throughout the country, that has given confidence to thousands of local authority tenants and that has enabled them through their organisations to have a say in how their rents were fixed.  Most of their organisations are affiliated to the National Association of Tenants' Organisations who were the body who carried out the negotiations with the various Ministers of the various Governments over the last approximately 12 years.  Why then, one can ask legitimately, do the Government seek to depart from a system that has brought that stability?  The only reason that this well-proven system has been abandoned is the Government's lack of courage, the Government's need to wash their hands Pontius Pilate like of the slightest chance of having to raise rents. Because of this Government's determination to preserve themselves from any appearance of causing a rise in the cost of living, because of their determination to preserve&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Through you, a Cheann Comhairle, I appeal even at this late stage to the Minister of State, a sensible man, and to the Government to have the courage to acknowledge that what they have done is wrong, to accept that they have made a mistake, to accept the Fianna Fáil motion here tonight and return to the system that <Col N="1554" /> has proved itself a very valuable aid to tenants, local authorities and the Government over a number of years.

      <P>The Progressive Democrats support the devolving of power from central to local authorities because we believe it strengthens democracy to have strong, multipurpose local authorities providing the infrastructure for development and administering the services people avail of in their daily lives.  Local authorities should be freed from the <i>ultra vires</i> rule and enabled to operate as progressive development corporations for their areas.</P>
      <P>The reform of local government is urgently required.  Although recent Governments have paid lip service to the idea, little has been done by way of positive action.  There has been the odd gesture and pretence at doing something. An attempt is being made now to give the impression that this change in regard to rents is a major step in strengthening local government.  It is not.  The real truth is that the Government had decided to increase local authority rates quite some time ago, but when it came to actually applying the rates they funked it.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the Cabinet carefully considered a proposal from a Labour Minister for the Environment to substantially increase local authority rents, and collectively decided that the rents should be increased by 20 per cent approximately.  This Cabinet decision was never implemented.  It certainly had not been implemented up to the time of the change from Minister Kavanagh to Minister John Boland.  What we all know now is that the Minister, like a good rugby outhalf has passed the buck to the county councils, to the county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> This decision it seems is designed to get the Minister off the hook.</P>
    <P>It is clear the Government do not have the political will to implement their own decision.  Already we have seen the result of this decision with managers now proposing increases of up to 20 per cent approximately in some local authority rents.  It is not good enough for Government Ministers to pretend that this decision was motivated by the sole desire to see greater powers given to local authorities. To seek to convey such an impression displays a grossly cynical attitude on the part of the Minister and his Government colleagues.  Prior to the local government elections in 1985 the Government published a document which listed a wide range of services and functions which were to be devolved to local authorities.  The list included new house grants, improvement grants and other things.  Nowhere did it say that local authority rents were to be devolved.  This decision has more to do with political expediency than anything else.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aside, I must ask if the change has any merit at all.  Having carefully considered it, I conclude that it has some merit.  I would prefer to see local authority members with more to say in important decisions affecting their councils. I must agree that it is preferable to have the manager make some of these decisions rather than the Minister who is remote from the problems of the individual tenants.  The new situation at least allows the manager to fix local authority rents, and in doing so he must adhere strictly to the criteria laid down by the Minister.  One can of course see the shadow of the Minister over each manager who has now to do the Minister's bidding on something that the Minister had not the courage to do himself, which of course is another sign of a weak Minister and of the weak Government we suffer under.</P>
    <P>The only merit I see is that at least the manager has to sit down and deal with his local authority members at their regular meetings.  He will be more likely to heed <Col N="1556" /> the pleadings of his members than a Minister might in a remote office in Dublin. Therefore, on balance, the Progressive Democrats feel that it is preferable to have the local authority involved, even though it is through the manager, rather than have total departmental control. There is too much central control in all our affairs.  We do not support the Fianna Fáil motion which seeks to revert to that situation with no local involvement at all in rents.  I see nothing wrong with the situation which allows the Galway Corporation to have lower local authority rents than, say, Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil motion is a regressive step and I am surprised that they have reversed their policy in this area.  We recognise the right of the National Association of Tenants' Organisations to make representations to the Minister regarding matters affecting the level of rents, as we recognise the right of all legitimate representative groups to make their views known to Ministers, county managers and public representatives.  We see no difficulty arising in this matter unless the Minister announces that NATO will not be allowed to make representations on rent matters in future.  I do not think the Minister has made any such statement.  We feel therefore that the second part of the Fianna Fáil motion is irrelevant.</P>
    <P>All local authority tenants have the right to participate in the democratic election of members to represent them on their local council and in Dáil Éireann. It must always be the responsibilty of elected representatives to ensure that only fair and reasonable rents are levied, taking into account the condition of the dwelling, the income of the tenant and allowing for further reductions in hardship cases.  The best representative of local authority tenants is a democratically elected local authority member.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment introduces a new matter extraneous to the two principal proposals in the substantive motion put forward by Fianna Fáil.  We do not support the Minister in his amendment and will oppose the motion proposed by Deputy Brady.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> Before concluding I must put on record my dismay that some public servants in the Minister's office chose to make available to some members of this House a confidential Cabinet document outlining that Government decision to increase rents by 20 per cent approximately.  Naturally an Opposition Member will always be ready to read such documents if they are placed before him but it must be said that officials who leak such documents are a threat to the democratic system and must be condemned for their actions.</P>

      <P>This motion, tabled by the Opposition, is in keeping with many of their motions.  It is designed to create confusion and even division among local authorities and local authority tenants and the National Association of Tenants' Organisations.</P>
      <P>I believe in the devolution of power.  I have campaigned at every opportunity for it.  That is what every local authority in the country, through the agency of the General Council of County Councils, has been campaigning for.  The greater level of local authority involvement in the delivery of services to its community automatically implies a new degree of responsibility in discharging its duties. Regrettably there is considerable evidence that such responsibility is not forthcoming from some councils controlled by the Opposition.  This development does nothing to enhance the reputation of elected representatives in fulfilling the statutory obligations vested in them by reason of their democratic election to the local authority.  Unless we face up to that challenge it behoves central Government to further examine the political sense of such a devolution policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities spend considerable sums of money, particularly in the area of local authority housing.  It goes without saying that such expenditure demands a proper degree of accountability.  The local authority member who is oblivious to the wasteful use of that resource, a nearly scarce resource, and indifferent to the securing of a reasonable return for money, must stand indicted by the electorate. As a democratically elected <Col N="1558" /> member I would resist any attempt to extract rents which were beyond a person's capacity to pay.  This Ministerial directive sets out in clear, unequivocal language the direction that rents payable from here in should be related to income on the one hand, and that is extended further in giving a sense of discretion to the county managers to take in other factors which would prove very useful to the local authority member when making a case on behalf of a tenant.</P>
    <P>Capital investment by central Government into local authority housing is quite substantial.  One would venture to say that it has reached an all time record. The cost to the taxpayer in making up the difference between what is recouped in rents and the costs on the capital investment side is quite significant also.  The management and maintenance of local authority rented housing is the function and responsibility of local authorities. Each year all local authorities pay out more money for maintenance on existing housing stock than is subscribed by tenants.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Minister referred to this last night when he said that there were 114,000 tenants at the end of December 1985 contributing in total about £41.5 million in rent and the cost to the taxpayer of providing funds for total maintenance was about £65 million, leaving a considerable shortfall of about £25 million.  There is a very wide gap between the cost of local authority housing and what is funded by the tenants.  I am not suggesting that we should extract additional moneys from tenants.  What I am saying is that we must take account of these cost factors in assessing what level of rents are to be paid by local authority tenants.</P>
    <P>In my council area, and this applies to most council areas, the average cost of a local authority house is in the region of £25,000 to £30,000.  Even allowing for an average mortgage of £25,000, and in accordance with the subsidised small dwellings acquisition loans, the cost to the Exchequer is still of the order of £50 to £60 per week.  I know a number of <Col N="1559" /> people on small incomes who have committed themselves to mortgages and are finding it extremely difficult to meet these repayments.</P>
    <P>People in local authority houses are paying low rents.  The average rent in 1985 was about £7 a week and that can go up to £15 or £16, but the low rent was £3.50 per week.  It has been said that in some cases it would be better for people to give up working and enjoy the benefits of a local authority home rather than work and provide a home out of their own resources.  Unless we find a formula to diminish such discrepancies we will fast reach the stage where it will be financially more favourable to rely on local authority housing than to provide a house out of one's own resources.  That would be a most unwelcome development.</P>
    <P>Local authorities depend on rents to fund maintenance programmes.  It is vitally important, therefore, that existing stock be maintained in good sound condition. In that context I want to draw attention to the low cost housing imposed on this society by a short-sighted Fianna Fáil administration in the sixties and seventies.  Many of these houses were a disgrace and the fruits are still with us. These houses are causing endless problems for every local authority.  We had the misfortune of trying to remedy the damage done.  In <i>Building on Reality</i> significant commitments, financial and otherwise, were made to renew and refurbish that type of dwelling.  The cost was borne almost totally by the State, and by the taxpayer, and by local authorities who got loans to the tune of up to 80 per cent from the central Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The significance of that programme is that most of these unsightly housing schemes are fast disappearing and tenants can live in comfort and dignity.  I have met tenants living in these housing schemes, and some outside my own constituency, and they have no hesitation in telling me they would be prepared to pay a higher rent if their houses were in a proper state of repair.  I am glad to say that has now been put in train.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> No Government since the foundation of the State have committed a greater share of their resources to the provision of housing both public and private than this Government.  New house grants have doubled and a major innovation programme for existing private stock is in train.  Grants as high as £8,500 have been approved under the new home improvement scheme.  Never have I seen greater activity in house improvements than I see now and I hope that will continue for many years.  Fianna Fáil do not have such a record.  They saw fit to withdraw the house improvement grants when they were in office.  The £5,000 grant for local authority tenants of three years standing enabled people to purchase their own homes and this was widely welcomed. The effect was two-fold: it benefited the tenant and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Never has there been less pressure on local authority for housing.  The long queues of needy house applicants of the late sixties and seventies have been considerably diminished and in some areas have totally disappeared.  That is the record of this Government in the field of private and public housing.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the ministerial directive is to further apply the devolution of power from the central to the local area, something I go along with. Local authorities build and maintain houses and administer the necessary services. It goes without saying that they must have the right to determine the rents.  I never wish to see a time when tenants would be obliged to pay more than they can reasonably afford.  This direction has a built in safeguard to allow county managers discretion in such circumstances. Very few county managers will take a decision without considerable consultation with the elected members, the tenants' associations and everybody who can make a valuable and useful input into the determination of a proper rent structure.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation local authorities have considerable flexibility in the provision and allocation of local authority houses, having regard to the financial constraints imposed by the central <Col N="1561" /> Exchequer.  It is important in that context that similar flexibility be applied in rent fixing on a county by county basis.  The present arrangement whereby local authorities are obliged to implement rents arrived at by ministerial discretion is a further negation of what local government is all about.</P>
    <P>Another considerable argument in favour of this ministerial direction is that local factors can be more fully considered than under the present system in arriving at a fair rent and the overall rental income should reflect the management and maintenance costs of estates within each local authority's jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It is my view that this motion is designed to secure short-term electoral support but in endeavouring to achieve that objective, it will have the effect of creating division and dissention among tenants in housing estates and will impose financial hardship on them in the long term.  I call on all responsible tenants to repudiate this expedient and insincere approach on behalf of the Opposition and to reject out of hand such political opportunism.</P>

      <P>The decision to introduce the new tenant purchase scheme and to devolve responsibility for tenants of local authority dwellings does not represent a breach of commitments to NATO and should not lead to hardship for tenants.  For me as a member of the Labour Party it is extremely important that we see this as not being a diminution of the role of NATO in negotiations representing local authority tenants throughout the country. It was a Labour Minister, Mr. Jim Tully, who first gave negotiation rights to NATO and it is the intention of the Labour Party, either in or out of Government, to ensure that that will continue to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenant purchase scheme was introduced in response to demands from tenants anxious to buy their own houses.  The <Col N="1562" /> previous tenant purchase scheme expired on 30 June 1984 and tenants who did not have the opportunity to purchase for two years were justifiably becoming anxious. The new purchase scheme is similar to previous schemes with two important changes.  First, local authorities will be able to renew the scheme annually by reference to the previous August value of money table and so avoid delay between the expiry date of one scheme and the introduction of another, which has occurred in recent years.  This has been a cause of considerable concern to elderly tenants who were anxious to secure their own houses.  The second is that the market value may be used to determine the gross sale price of the dwelling.  This is more favourable to the tenants than using the existing formula for updating the all-in cost.  This is a significant concession, particularly in the case of dwellings built in recent years, and was the only major change sought by NATO in their proposal for renewing the existing scheme.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss as to why Fianna Fáil are critical of the Government for introducing this scheme.  They say we are trying to by-pass NATO in our negotiations. This scheme came about as a result of NATO intervention.  It is because of the proposal they put to the Government that the market value is now taken into account.  This is a major breakthrough. Labour have been campaigning for this for a number of years and the Government have seen fit to incorporate this into the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be generally welcomed by most people and will remove much of the uncertainty associated with delays.  The principles underlying previous schemes and the one proposal for changes put forward by NATO in the discussions are incorporated in the new scheme.  In relation to the decision to devolve responsibility for rents, I welcome the agreement in principle by Deputy Molloy but I question the reservations expressed by Deputy Calleary who is a member of two local authorities. I, as a member of Cork Corporation, had an input into the striking of a rent scheme <Col N="1563" /> for the tenants.  Up to now local elected members did not have an opportunity nor did Members of the House have an opportunity to express views on rents. The schemes were usually conveyed from the Department to the local authorities. For the first time we now have an input at local level.  I am satisfied this does not represent a breach of the commitment given nor does it give rise to hardships. My party have a great concern for the welfare of lower paid tenants and tenants on social welfare and I would not support any decision which would be to their detriment. The framework on which responsibility for rents has been devolved strikes a proper balance between giving local authorities greater discretion and making adequate provision for the needs of lower paid tenants.  The safeguards built into these new arrangements ensuring that all new schemes are income-related and that genuine hardship cases are taken into account will ensure that rent is reasonable in relation to income.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke in his speech last night said that rent was a key element of the household budget.  Everybody recognises that.  The provision of shelter should be the primary call on income.  It is, therefore, reasonable that the rent payable be commensurate with income.  While the level of rent increases is a matter for each local authority having regard to local circumstances, it is worth noting that in this context welfare incomes have increased by between 32 per cent and 38 per cent since the last review, while income for those in employment has generally increased by no more than 24 per cent in the same period.  Rents, with the exception of the relatively few cases where family circumstances changed in the interim, remained at their 1983 levels.  Deputy Calleary interpreted this as being an act of cowardice on the part of the Government. We should remember that in 1984-1985, four meetings took place between NATO and the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, and agreement was not reached.</P>
    <P>Much has been made about the <Col N="1564" /> increases in rent under the new arrangements. The Opposition have grossly exaggerated the level of rent increases and chosen selective examples of rents increasing and highlighted the percentage increase.  They mentioned increases of 100 per cent and 200 per cent in Cork.  I was a member of Cork Corporation when the increases were put before the council. The minimum rents in Cork are being increased from 50p to £1, a 100 per cent increase in percentage terms but in absolute terms it is only an increase of 50p per week.  This must be taken in conjunction with the increase in incomes since the last review of rents.  A single person on unemployment assistance would have been paying 50p in rent in 1983.  Since then there has been an increase of £10.45 in welfare per week.  In those circumstances the rent of £1 is not unrealistic. In addition to providing houses the local authority have the responsibility for keeping them in good structural repair.  It is nonsense to talk about rent increases without relating them to income.  Rents determined on the basis of the circular issued to local authorities for fixing rent schemes will be reasonable in relation to household incomes.</P>
    <P>I will correct misleading statements by Opposition spokesmen.  I am not aware that the local authorities in implementing rent schemes have assessed children's allowances for this purpose.  The new system will not give rise to undue hardship in respect of the contribution of members of the household to the rent. The parameters laid down by the Government require that as with other income the contribution of a subsidiary earner towards rent must be based on a proportion of the income of a subsidiary earner.  I must stress that it is a charge proportional to income and I would expect local authorities to be reasonable in applying this provision.  This is not a new charge but it has been a feature of all recent schemes.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are trying to suggest that the only equitable rent scheme is a national uniform scheme.  This is simply not so.  Rates, service charges and other local authority charges vary from one <Col N="1565" /> local authority to another.  So do employment levels, income levels and concentrations of population.  Housing types vary as does the standard of the housing stock.  Some areas have a greater potential than others for increasing rents and have a correspondingly greater need because of the standard of their stock.  A national uniform rent scheme does not cater to this situation.  A high average increase under a national rent scheme, no matter how carefully a scheme is framed, may bear unnecessarily heavily on tenants in some areas, while a low average increase under such a scheme to cater for areas of high unemployment can prevent authorities from gaining a reasonable level of rental income where such potential exists and can prove a major obstacle to a proper maintenance programme.  It is more appropriate, therefore, that local authorities should determine their own rent levels having regard to local factors and maintenance needs.</P>
    <P>Rents of local authority dwellings relate directly to the functions of authorities as landlords and owners of their own houses and are quite different in their nature and impact from the imposition of other local charges.  Housing rents are not a means of increasing the general revenue of local authorities but represent the means through which the authorities can alleviate some of the losses arising on their housing activities, provide some degree of funding to go towards the costs of essential repair and maintenance works not appropriate to the tenants and seek to ensure that the task of seeking new housing needs is not made totally unviable for them.  Managers are responsible for the day to day running of local authority affairs.  The running of their housing estates, including the charging of rents, is part and parcel of that responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new arrangement will facilitate more effective maintenance and management of local authority housing and will ensure that it is more responsive to the needs of tenants.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with some of Deputy Calleary's points.  The Deputy <Col N="1566" /> suggested that the circular letter sent to various managers throughout the country sent shivers through the city managers. None of the managers could be accused of standing back from their responsibility and of not being prepared to make the necessary changes required in the scheme.  Deputy Calleary also said that the scheme which operated until now gave stability and peace.  One way of ensuring peace is to have no increases. However we cannot maintain our housing stock without rent increases.  The Government have acted responsibly in trying to resolve the problems.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion which reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and the Government to rescind their directive giving City and County Managers the power to fix local authority rents and to restore to local authority tenants representatives, the National Association of Tenants Organisations, the right to negotiate a national uniform rents scheme on behalf of tenants.</P>
      <P>It is very clear and nothing I heard so far tonight or last night changes my view that that is the proper course to follow.  I agree with my party colleagues who said that the Government are running away from their responsibilities.  It is interesting to hear the Minister of State say that local representatives &mdash; I presume he is referring to Fianna Fáil because we control so many local authorities &mdash; are afraid to take on responsibility.  Proposals have been put to the Government of which we know they approved but the Minister said it was too hot for him to handle and passed it on to local city and county managers. It is the same in this case, the Government are afraid to handle the issue and are passing it on to the city and county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I caution the Government to be careful because city and county managers over the last number of years have been carrying a very heavy workload and have been trying to maintain essential services in all local authority areas in spite of decreased funding.  They have had to keep a very substantial house programme going and some semblance of repairs on our national and secondary roads.  They have also tried to keep our sanitary services and fire brigades up to date.  I congratulate county managers on doing this with very little help from the Government. The decision of the Minister to <Col N="1568" /> transfer the power of setting rents for local authority houses to managers is regrettable for the reasons I have outlined. The Minister is running away from his responsibilities and he is the person who should carry out changes in the format for setting rents.  This will now be an executive function.</P>
    <P>The Government refused to initiate a fair rents scheme for 1984-85 mainly because they had to face European and local elections.  When they saw the outcome of those elections they did an about turn.  They know that a general election is imminent and anything that reflects badly on Government candidates will not be handled.  A rents strike is now taking place in many parts of the country and that is causing great problems to local authorities, especially in relation to their finances.  As most Deputies know, funding for the maintenance of housing stocks in local authorities comes from the rents the tenants pay weekly.  These rents are not now being paid in some areas and, unfortunately, the standard of houses will deteriorate.  In some cases tenants may be able to move out of local authority estates and purchase private houses. Most tenants of local authority houses are young married couples who may not be in a position to get a mortgage to buy a new house.  Sometimes, if their circumstances improve as a result of securing employment, they will try to better themselves and they should be congratulated on doing so.  What happens if these young people buy private houses? Those left in the estates may be unemployed, whole families may be out of work and local authorities are unable to maintain the housing stock in the estates to a certain standard.  They end up as ghettoes which is very undesirable.  Those left behind will be living in squalor.</P>
    <P>We have seen what has happened as a result of the failure of local authorities to collect service charges.  It is interesting to note that last year there was a new ploy by the Government in plundering capital accounts of certain local authorities.  This can only go so far.  In my local authority area the Minister for the Environment said that £500,000 had to be taken out <Col N="1569" /> of the capital account of Carlow Urban Council in order to pay expenses on the revenue account.  When local authorities are setting their estimates for the year, they take account of the money they will receive from public service charges. However, the reality is that service charges in many cases have not been collected. Local authorities budget for what they will receive from public services and water charges and they spend that money in the belief that they will recoup it.  At the end of the year they find they have been unable to collect the money.  We are living in a fool's paradise if we continue to ask local authorities to levy public service charges on people who are unable to pay them.  In my county almost £400,000 is outstanding in relation to service charges but we have already spent that money. We take money from our capital account just to keep things going but that must stop immediately.</P>
    <P>We have called for a return to the national uniform rent scheme which was first introduced by a Labour Minister, Jim Tully, in 1973.  Prior to that, the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government at the time, Kevin Boland, gave recognition to the central council of corporation tenants to negotiate on behalf of the tenants.  That was a good scheme while it lasted and I see no reason for changing now.</P>
    <P>Comments were made in regard to the enlightened schemes which the Government introduced in the form of house improvement grants.  I agree that those were imaginative schemes.  They have helped many householders improve their dwellings.  However, the current scheme whereby applicants for house improvement grants have to await anything up to 12 weeks for an inspection is a national disgrace.  The Government, in introducing the scheme, made colourful remarks about the benefit of the scheme to householders and the building industry. God knows the building industry needs a boost but that scheme has not provided it as only 40 per cent of their workers are employed in the construction industry.  It was the biggest trick of recent <Col N="1570" /> years and the Government have succeeded in ensuring that householders whose dwellings are in urgent need of repair have had to carry out makeshift, running repairs while waiting an inspection from the Department of the Environment. Tens of thousands of pounds have had to be spent by these unfortunate tenants.  After the first inspection people have to wait a further 12 or 14 weeks for a final inspection and perhaps it will be another six or eight weeks before the grant is paid.  When Government Deputies talk about fine, imaginative legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suggest that many Deputies on the other side of the House are not familiar with what the Government are proposing to do.  I get the impression that they believe the power to set local authority rents is to be given to the members of local authorities.  That is not so.  It is an executive function and the county and city managers will carry out that function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average cost of building a house in some rural local authority areas is in the region of £30,000 to £40,000.  The average weekly rent in some of these rural local authority areas is between £7 and £15.  No one on this side of the House is arguing against these rents being updated and reviewed on a yearly basis but what we are arguing against is the manner in which the Government are proposing to have these carried out. Within two miles of the centre of Carlow town there are four local authorities.  The managers in those four areas set different criteria for deciding local authority rents. There is great confusion between the <Col N="1571" /> peoples of those areas.  In some cases, you can have members of families in four different local authority areas.  How can anyone suggest there will not be confusion if four people in similar circumstances are paying different rents? There will be total chaos.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask Members to reconsider their position when voting on this motion.  Our proposal is fair and it is only right that the Government should grasp the nettle which we have been told they are prepared to do, and sit down with members of the tenant organisations to renegotiate a national rent scheme.</P>

      <P>The Worker's Party support the Fianna Fáil motion in regard to recognition being given to the National Association of Tenants' Organisations. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, seemed to say that right is still there.  Can he clarify that point?  At present it seems to the National Association of Tenants' Organisations and to everyone else that they have no rights whatsoever, that they will not be consulted in any way.  The Government have no intention of consulting with them with regard to rents.  The rents are already being implemented by the local authorities all over the country.  Therefore, we support the Fianna Fáil motion that their right to negotiate on behalf of their tentants be restored.  Every Minister, previous to this Minister, will be aware that the National Association of Tenants' Organisations have been highly responsible and in previous negotiations have correctly fought for the rights of their tenants but have also recognised the rights of local authorities.  Every Minister will agree that they negotiated in a very responsible manner and once they negotiated an agreement they insisted that their tenants adhere to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of the National Association of Tenants' Organisations is very good. Furthermore, most local authorities, the Dublin city manager, the Dublin city Council and the Dublin local authorities recognise the importance of tenant organisations in the estates in which they <Col N="1572" /> are organised.  They do an excellent job and have excellent relations with the local authority.  They also help in the management of the estate.  I am sure the Dublin city manager will agree that without tenants' organisations, particularly in some of the large flat schemes, it would be impossible for him or the council to manage those schemes.  They have co-operated in every way with the local authority where the local authority were prepared to co-operate with them.  It would be very remiss of the Minister to miss the opportunity to re-establish relations with the National Association of Tenants' Organisations.</P>
    <P>It is not only in the matter of rents &mdash; although from the point of view of the tenant the rent is the most important factor &mdash; that the tenants' organisation help tenants.  They work day and night to help local tenants to establish themselves. They move in and help them with any problems they may have.  They also get in touch with the local authorities in regard to these problems.  They serve a tremendous purpose which the Minister will destroy if he takes a confrontational position with the tenants' organisations from the beginning.  He is an abrasive Minister and immediately he wants to show who is boss.  He will put in his rents whether the tenants like it or not.  It would be a grave mistake for any Minister to adopt such a position in a modern democratic society where people have rights and will insist on them being implemented.  Tenants have rights despite what some members of Fine Gael seem to think.  They seem to think tenants have no rights whatsoever to be in a house paying a reasonable rent.  The implication seems to be from the comments we have heard tonight that they should pay £60 a week like other people.</P>
    <P>As Fianna Fáil speakers mentioned, it is very important to have a uniform rents system where there will not be different levels of rent for similar types of houses in adjoining estates.  Our amendment adds &ldquo;that no rent increases be applied pending negotiation with NATO&rdquo;.  This is very important because we believe a grave injustice is being done at present.  These <Col N="1573" /> rents are being implemented.  I can only speak for the Dublin area where there has been an increase in rent of £3 in every case.  When I say in every case I mean that a £9 maximum rent goes up to £12. That is a 33? per cent increase.  A £20 or £24 rent also goes up by £3.  There is no basis or reason for this increase.  The city manager does not negotiate with local councillors or tell them what he is going to do.  He simply implements the increases. We hear it from the tenants.  We go to the city manager to see what it is all about.  That is how it operates.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I heard of two other cases and at present I am endeavouring to understand how they occurred.  The first case involves a family of nine children receiving £129.65 a week in long term unemployment assistance.  Their rent was £7.45 and it went up on Monday last, 3 November, to £13.70.  The second case involves a tenant from the same area who has eight children and an income of £123.40.  His rent was £7.10 but this has been increased to £13.40, almost a 50 per cent increase.  I do not know how to explain this and I am endeavouring to find out.  Grave injustices such as those are being done and no negotiations take place with anybody.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know what scheme is being implemented.  We are told it is the 1983 scheme.  Yet, the 1983 scheme specifically excludes, under family income, disabled person's maintenance allowance.  However, disabled person's maintenance allowances are included by the Dublin City Manager in assessing the current rent increases in Dublin.  Will the Minister tell me if the city manager is entitled to do that?  Why has that change been made?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to suspend the rent increases because they are totally unjust.  No reason has been given for imposing them and the many anomalies that exist are not taken into consideration. We agree with the Fianna Fáil motion but in our amendment we are asking that no rent increases be applied pending negotiations with NATO, which are essential and I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, accepts <Col N="1574" /> that.  In his comments he seemed to indicate that he recognised the rights of NATO but he cannot say that organisation have any rights at present.</P>

      <P>For the past four years there has been continuous criticism from the Opposition of the Government's failure, as they saw it, to give local authorities more authority in the provision of services.  To some extent I shared that view and I was in sympathy with the call to devolve more powers to local councils and corporations.  I felt miserable about the fact that those powers were not devolved speedily.  In 1978 when I was a member of Limerick County Council I had to stay silent as the county manager announced a rate for the county struck by the Minister in Dublin. We were a redundant group.  There was a danger then, because of the policies pursued by the Government at that time, that local democracy would die.  It is not hard to imagine the frustration of councillors at that time.  All local representatives look forward to negotiating with the county manager on the striking of a rate but that right was taken from us in 1978.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gallagher is not aware that an 11 per cent increase was decided on by the Minister in 1978 and not by the local representatives or the county manager.  I am pleased to note the Government are making a move in regard to devolving power to local councils. I was delighted to hear that a number of administrative and grant schemes will be operated by local authorities.  We will now have some say in the administration of grant schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure the Minister that <Col N="1575" /> corporations and county councils appreciate his move.  It is good to know that the Minister is handing back the authority to where it belongs, with local representatives.  It is sad to hear Deputies opposite express no confidence in the housing committees of local councils or in county managers.  Local representatives, assisted by county managers, have been doing a fine job.  They live among the people who pay rates and rents and have contact with them.  Tenants appreciate being in a position to conduct business with the county manager or housing officials in council offices rather than having to communicate with the Department in Dublin.  I understand that the rent of 20,791 tenants will rise from £3 to £6.99 &mdash; that the rent of 21,000 tenants will rise from £7 to £10.99 &mdash; that 16,723 tenants will face an increase from £11 to £14.99 &mdash; that 5,210 tenants will face a rise from £15 to £15.99 and that the rent of 1,222 people will rise from £20 to £24.99.  It is unfortunate I do not have time to develop this subject but I am sure that if the Deputy opposite checks my figures he will apologise for the remarks he has just made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an dtairiscint curtha os comhair na Dála ag urlabhraí Fhianna Fáil, an Teachta Burke.</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and the Government to rescind their directive giving City and County Managers the power to fix local authority rents and to restore to local authority tenants representatives, the National Association of Tenants Organisations, their right to negotiate a national uniform rents scheme on behalf of tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with the fact that many fundamental matters of principle have been cast aside very cynically, I should like to refer to the remarks of the last speaker and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan.  I was confused by the contribution of Deputy O'Brien who commenced by referring to the need for <Col N="1576" /> the devolution of power to local authorities. It is interesting to note that a policy statement issued by the Government on the devolution of power from central Government to local authorities stated that the traditional role of local government had been too restricted for local democracy to achieve its full potential and that much of the vitality had gone out of this system over the last number of years.  That famous, and for the Government best forgotten, national plan of the Government described local authorities as an intricate part of the system of representative government. The plan stated that through their work programmes and the services and employment they provided they played a major part in the social and economic life of the State.  The Government in that plan said they were determined that local reforms to which they were committed would ensure that local authorities were enabled to fulfil the role to the best effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien having started his contribution on one topic got lost in a sea of confusion as time went on, like Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained.  We did not get from him a treatise on how the Minister's action reflected a devolution of power but a shifting of ground on the argument.  This does not represent a devolution of power, it is a transfer of the Executive function of a Government Department to a paid official.  It is cynical and cowardly and amounts to throwing local democracy out the window.  It represents a total disregard for local councillors and a system that has worked so well, has been fair and uniform and has meant peace in the area of rent payment in the past 12 or 13 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision to transfer the power of determining rents of tenants and in the process dismantling a national system of negotiating a uniform rent was wrong.  Uniformity has been one of the hallmarks of the whole system.  Later I will refer to the part the Labour Party played in bringing about uniformity in the system.  This system was negotiated between the Minister's Department and NATO, the tenants' representatives.  It is most regrettable that a decision has been <Col N="1577" /> taken at this time to transfer the executive function from the Department and to dismantle the process of negotiations. I am very confused at a reference made earlier to the right of these tenant organisations to continue negotiations at a level and within the terms established ten or 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>This action must be condemned as a blatant act of cop-out where the Government, finding themselves in the most unpopular set of circumstances of any Government in recent times, decided to shirk their responsibilities.  They have responsibilities to the tenants, to their representatives and to the country.  They decided to shirk their responsibilities in the area of the fixing of rents and to foist them on city and county managers.  The insensitivity with which this has been done at a time when household budgets have been so depleted is reminiscent of those bleak times in the 18th and 19th centuries when landlordism was such a dirty word to almost 90 per cent of Irish people.</P>
    <P>What has been called for, and what to a great extent has been achieved over the past 12 years, has been a reasonably fair and uniform rent scheme throughout the country.  Every tenant, whether he be an income earner or dependent on social welfare, is only too well aware of the burden of rent payments and the gap it leaves in his household budget.  I accept that this has been acknowledged across the floor tonight.  It is fair and reasonable to say that the overwhelming majority of tenants in recent years have lived up to their responsibilities and have kept their rent payments up-to-date, even at times when they found it extremely difficult to do so.  They were willing to do so because they understood the system to be reasonably fair and nationally uniform.  They were secure in the knowledge that their representatives, the National Association of Tenants' Organisations, would have a significant input into any negotiated review of the rate at which they would pay.</P>
    <P>They were happy to co-operate with the system known as the differential rents scheme because they were satisfied it was <Col N="1578" /> calculated in relation to their income and each tenant realised and accepted that he was paying the same rate as his counterpart in exactly equivalent circumstances, no matter in what local authority area that person resided.  That gave a great sense of fairness and uniformity.  It created goodwill and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Given the extent of peace that has reigned in this area for the last 13 years, it is absolutely inconceivable why the Minister has now chosen to throw the scheme into chaos, since that is what his decision of 14 August last means.  He has now decided that he, his Department and his Government are not prepared to negotiate nationally with the tenants' representatives a fair and equitable review of the differential rents scheme. The easiest course is to cop out and to direct paid officials, the city and county managers, to do the dirty work for them. When this is seen against the background of depleted household budgets due to crucifying taxation and the gradual dismantling of the social welfare system, it makes it all the more incomprehensible and cynical.</P>
    <P>One has to ask if the Government have seriously thought through the implications and consequences of their actions in this area.  If we look back to the period prior to 1973 and the chaos that reigned throughout 1972 in the national rent strike, the Minister in some sense must be wishing this on us again.  It is fair and reasonable to say that the system that obtained up to 1973 had many built-in inequities and had lost the confidence of the tenants.  When tenants lose confidence in a system which is supposed to bring equity there will be a lashback.  The records show how wounds were created and how difficult it was to heal them. However, it must be acknowledged that the Coalition Government that followed brought in a system of rent assessment and they implemented a system of negotiations with the National Association of Tenants' Organisations, recognising that body as the body representing the tenants' interests in relation to the assessment of rents.  The differential rents system which has been in operation since <Col N="1579" /> then has promoted peace in this area. Any system that works without undue disruption, as this system did over the past 12 or 13 years, must, despite whatever warts are inherent in it, be regarded in general as a good system.  It was a scheme that provided for co-operation, goodwill and harmony.</P>
    <P>The irony is that the party which over the years could justifiably have taken much credit for the implementation of that system &mdash; I refer to the Labour Party, whose Minister, Deputy Jim Tully, introduced the scheme &mdash; are now prepared to co-operate and conspire with the Minister in what can best be described as a cloak and dagger operation.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, we are in the early stages of a national rents strike, a situation that cannot be condoned, although it might be understandable given the Government's irresponsibility and refusal to negotiate with the tenants' representatives.  I will refer later to the limited and short-term negotiations which did take place, only in response to queries from this side of the House.  One cannot condone rent strikes since they are wrong in themselves but I am extremely concerned, as are Members on this side of the House and, I hope, Members on the other side, as to the consequences of a national rent strike for many of the tenants.  Tenants with good intentions will save money which has not been paid in rent, but that money will be quickly eaten into in the event of family pressures and expenses.  When the strike is over there is a huge problem for people in receipt of social welfare payments and those on low incomes in trying to pay off arrears.  It is a frightening and daunting prospect and it is built into this system being created by the Minister in passing the buck.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects of this whole scenario which need to be teased out and placed firmly on the record.  An impression has been given that local authority tenants have not been paying increased rents in recent years.  We all know that nothing could be further from the truth.  A system of differential rents <Col N="1580" /> is directly income-related and as tenants' incomes increased their rent payments increased proportionately.</P>
    <P>A point that needs to be made firmly is that Fianna Fáil are not opposed to rent reviews.  Nobody on this side of the House stated at any time yesterday or today that we are opposed to such reviews.  If rent reviews have to go ahead, let them be carried out in a manner that is perceived to be fair and uniform so as to achieve agreement and peace.  That is our stand.  There is little point in paying lip service to democracy if you refuse to operate it.  That is precisely what this Government are attempting to do in this instance.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that in 1984 the Government made a decision to revise the rents scheme and there is a very strong suspicion they intended bringing in many elements to the assesment procedures. I recall Deputy Burke attempting on a number of occasions to elicit information as to what the Government had in mind but despite his best efforts he was not very successful.  As a result of the pressure exerted from this side of the House, an attempt was made by the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, to negotiate.  There was only one meaningful attempt to negotiate with NATO to devise an agreed system and when the proposals he presented were rejected he abandoned the negotiations. If that is national negotiating by a Minister with responsibility and authority, then I am a Dutchman.</P>
    <P>The Government chose during the summer to issue a press statement entitled &ldquo;Devolution of Powers to Local Authorities&rdquo;.  It is a most regrettable and unsavoury development that when unpopular decisions have to be taken this Government have decided the best format is to issue a press statement.  If possible, it should be done when the House is not sitting so that the Government cannot be &ldquo;got at&rdquo; and the matter cannot be clarified.  We cannot have the matter clarified, we cannot have the information teased out as to the fairness <Col N="1581" /> or otherwise of the method the Government are adopting.  This is a most unfortunate and regrettable form of administration by the Government.</P>
    <P>The mechanism decided upon on 14 August last is a very cowardly and dishonest way for any Government to do their business.  They are using the city and county managers as buffers behind which to hide.  The increase can be imposed by executive function and local councillors have absolutely no say.  I am sure we are all perfectly clear on that. People responsible to the community at local level are totally disregarded, as they have been on a number of occasions in the past year by the Government, including the case of the water charges.  We have seen that system fall into disrepute and we shall see this system fall into disrepute very quickly also.  It is not based on the principles of fairness, equity and uniformity.</P>

I believe he has opted out of his responsibilities.  He has cynically dismantled a good system that has served successive Governments well over the past 12 years.  By his actions he has deliberately brought inequities into a very sensitive rents scheme and in so doing has thrown out any shred of fairness and confidence in the system and co-operation with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be as brief as possible, sharing my time with my two colleagues in south Tipperary, Deputies McCarthy and Griffin.</P>
      <P>My reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment was in an endeavour to safeguard the jobs of approximately 500 people and their families who are about to lose or have lost their jobs in forestry, particularly in the south.  Bearing in mind the 250,000 people already unemployed and the other 100,000 who have emigrated over the past four years it is a national scandal that there is timber rotting in our State forests, with no roads or manpower available with which to harvest it.  It must be pointed out also that our sawmills are operating at 50 per cent of their capacity while we import millions of pounds worth of timber.  There is no commitment on the part of this Government to safeguarding the permanent jobs that can be created in connection with agriculture, afforestation and other areas.</P>
      <P>The Government are letting down our young people.  It would be much more beneficial to spend taxpayers' money on the harvesting of our national assets rather than trotting round the world endeavouring to attract mickey mouse industries from foreign lands.  When Fianna Fáil were in power in 1982 they allocated £20 million for the development of afforestation but the present Government cut that very severely.  They gave only £10 million this year.  That is an indication of their lack of commitment as far as afforestation is concerned.  It was estimated that the Department would receive £15 million for 1985.  Where is all the money going?  Why is it not being spent to secure jobs for the people who have a right to live in this country?  We should be exporting our timber, not exporting our people.  Much of the timber in my constituency is rotting and the same applies all over the country.</P>

      <P>It is sad to think there is timber rotting in our forests with no manpower and the roads not developed in my constituency to take out the timber. I am sure the same applies in other constituencies also.  Some 86 per cent of our forests are State-owned.  It is like a farmer with a field of wheat who has not the courage to cut it.  It is very bad economics and a lack of commitment to his business. We import about £400 million to £500 million worth of wood products each year but, at the same time, we are letting off our men.  This Government have lost their belief in this nation and in its people. Experts estimate that 80 per cent of this foreign imported timber could be replaced by our own native timber. Instead of letting people go, we should be taking on more people.  The EC is only 50 per cent self-sufficient in timber and we should be exporting our timber there. We could have a market on our doorstep in the UK.  They import £4.5 billion worth of timber each year while we are letting our timber rot.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister earlier in the day waffling about customary seasonal jobs. Our people should be employed from Christmas to Christmas.  They should not be let go when the leaves fall off the trees. It is a disgrace the Minister has not a commitment to keep on those people. We have the soil, the climate, the workforce and the markets but not the commitment to continue harvesting.  I am sure the Minister must feel guilty about this too as the same is happening in his constituency.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank my colleague, Deputy Byrne for allowing me to say a few brief words on this very important subject.  It impinges on the basics of what is vital, important and dear to us, that is, that we should support basic indigenous industries such as afforestation. There is something peculiar, weird and queer about this Government. They seen to have a sort of antagonism towards anything that is natural and towards the promotion of Irish life.  Anything Irish and anything we can develop in relation to our own indigenous projects seems to be rejected.  They seem to be much more concerned about helping out the coffee shops of their pals than they are with more important things.</P>
      <P>In relation to afforestation, the programme is totally in decline.  The Department and the Government have not maintained their planting programmes. Land reserve is critically low due to the fact that land for planting was not acquired to any extent over the past three years.  In 1982 when Fianna Fáil were in Government they acquired over 8,000 hectares and there was over 20,000 acres for planting.  This year the Government acquired only 4,000 hectares.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Byrne for allowing me to speak very briefly on this.  I would like to disassociate myself from some of the colourful and flamboyant expressions of Deputies Byrne and McCarthy.  I would rather approach this matter in a more mundane fashion and from an economic <Col N="1588" /> point of view.  I put it to the Minister that rather than have some of these employees draw unemployment benefit &mdash; and the cost of the unemployment benefit comes from the national Exchequer &mdash; it would be far more effective to have them working and the nation getting some return for their work.  I should like the Minister to concentrate on that aspect of it in his very brief reply.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne indicated that it would be something in the region of 500 people.  The lay-offs are scattered over 114 forests throughout the country.  Those people were taken on on a temporary basis and they knew that when they were taken on.  I say to the Deputies who are listening to me and who may try to stop me from expressing an opinion, when the Vote on forestry came before the Members of this House those Deputies were the people who said there was enough money in the Vote for forestry.</P>

To be fair, Deputy Treacy and Deputy Griffin expressed a very clear point of view but I cannot for one moment go along with the points expressed by Deputy McCarthy and Deputy Byrne.  On the one hand, Deputy Byrne spoke about wheat.  What has that got to do with forestry or does he know the difference?</P>

He continued on to say that the EC is only 50 per cent sufficient in what they need by way of timber.  We are all aware of these facts.  Earlier today Deputy McEllistrim complained about the export of timber products to an EC country.  What do the Deputies want? Are they ever satisfied?  As I already said, there were 197 people laid off for the very simple reason that they were taken on on a temporary basis.  They knew that from day one.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The White Paper on Industrial Policy published in 1984 assigned to Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited a pilot role in the development of the food processing sector whereby it was to develop and list initiatives and programmes which, if successful, would be applied on a national basis.  To carry out this pilot role, which is its main function in the food processing area, the company identified a need to provide specially designed buildings for the development of the food industry.  Phase I of this project has now been implemented by Shannon Development at Raheen and it comprises 43,000 sq. ft. which is largely fully occupied.  The manufacturing projects in the centre are expected to provide jobs for 140 people at full production.  In addition to manufacturing projects, there is in the centre an experimental food kitchen-laboratory where potential project promoters can test the feasibility of preparing new food products.  Construction of Phase II of the Raheen food centre buildings which will comprise an additional 20,000 sq. ft. was recently announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, with a view to developing the food industry in the context of the <Col N="1433" /> role assigned to it in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, the company is engaged in the following activities:</P>
    <P>&mdash;generally increasing public interest in food processing and encouraging the establishment of new processing firms.</P>
    <P>&mdash;identification of new products for manufacture.  Food idea generation workshops are being held in Limerick city and county, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the development of agri-business farm programmes including farm-based food processing projects.</P>

      <P>The Farm Tax Act sets out extensive criteria which have to be observed in classifying holdings in terms of adjusted acreage.  The nature and quality of the soil is only one of several factors which must be taken into account when the capacity of land for agricultural production is being estimated.  To the extent that some of the criteria do not lend themselves to precise measurement it may be necessary for the farm tax commissioner to apply an element of judgment based on his own professional expertise and experience.  I am satisfied that the criteria specified in the Act provide a valid basis for the classification of land and that the commissioner has taken appropriate steps to ensure that field staff apply consistent standards in classifying holdings in all parts of the State.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the task of compiling figures of the amounts of income tax outstanding is a large and costly one.  It is undertaken annually by reference to the position at 31 May for the purpose of providing information for publication in the annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the appropriation accounts.  The latest information on the balances of income tax (excluding PAYE) and of PAYE income tax outstanding relate to 31 May 1985 and are shown in Schedules 1 and 2 of paragraph <Col N="1451" /> 18 of the report on the appropriation accounts for 1984.  The balances in question contain a large element in respect of estimated charges and accordingly the attention of the Deputy is invited to the estimates in the schedules referred to showing the amounts likely to be collected.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The Department's records show that the person concerned had 296 reckonable contributions from 1953 to 1958 and a further 259 such contributions from 1 April 1974 to 5 April 1985, the latest date for which contributions are recorded in respect of him.  The total of 555 is equal to a yearly average of only 16 in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1986.

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the contribution year governing the claim.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 12 May 1986.  He had been insurably employed in the United Kingdom during the contribution period 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985, which governed his claim from 12 May 1986.</P>
      <P>Article 67 of EEC Regulations 1408/71 allows for the transfer of insurance records from one member state to another for unemployment benefit purposes, providing the last history of reckonable insurable employment is in the country of claim.</P>
      <P>The most recent employment of the person concerned was in this country but was for one week only at the beginning of May 1986.  It was necessary to make inquiries regarding the insurability of this employment to establish whether his United Kingdom insurance record could be invoked to determine his entitlement to unemployment benefit from 12 May. These inquiries were completed recently and it has been established that he is entitled to unemployment benefit on the basis of his United Kingdom contributions.</P>
      <P>His claim has been allowed at £65.10 weekly from 12 May 1986, increasing to £67.70 weekly from 11 July 1986 which is the appropriate rate applicable in his case.  Arrears of benefit due will be paid to him this week and further weekly payments of £67.70 will be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was last employed in April 1985.  She was in receipt of maternity benefit and disability benefit between June 1985 and March 1986.  She claimed unemployment benefit from 5 June 1986 and this claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for employment.  She appealed against the disallowance and, following an oral hearing of her case on 10 September 1986, an appeals officer also decided that she was not available for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She continued to sign the unemployed register and, accordingly, her claim was submitted for decision from 11 September 1986, the date after the appeals officer's decision.  The claim was again disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not available for employment as she had not furnished any evidence of fresh efforts made by her to <Col N="1473" /> obtain work.  She appealed against this decision on 24 October 1986 and arrangements are being made to have her case submitted to an appeals officer for determination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>From mid-November 1986 men and women claiming benefit, assistance or pension under the Social Welfare Acts will be treated equally.  Up to now a married man claiming a social welfare payment automatically got an increase of benefit for his wife and children living with him but a married woman could only get an increase of benefit for her husband and children in very restricted circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From mid-November 1986 the definition of dependency is being changed to make it the same for men and women thus removing the discrimination which has heretofore existed against married women.  A spouse will be regarded as a dependant of the other spouse only where he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that person and spouses entitled to social welfare payment in their own <Col N="1476" /> right or with earnings in excess of £50 a week will not be regarded as dependants. In circumstances where neither spouse is dependent on the other, half the normal rate of increases of benefit for the children will be paid when either spouse claims benefit.</P>
    <P>The person concerned is at present in receipt of disability benefit at the personal rate of £41.10 plus an increase of £26.60 in respect of an adult dependent and £37.30 in respect of four child dependants.</P>
    <P>The claimant's wife is employed and earning in excess of £50 a week and consequently from 17 November 1986 he will be entitled to £59.75 weekly, that is £41.10 personal rate and an increase of £18.65 for four children.</P>
    <P>However, should the wife of the person concerned claim and qualify for benefit on her own record, she would also be paid the full personal rate and an increase for qualified children at half rate.</P>

      <P>Following reinvestigation, the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed from 14 May 1986 by a deciding officer on the grounds that his means, derived from benefit from his wife's earnings, exceeded the statutory limit.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the means assessment and an appeals officer assessed his means at £79.50 weekly from 14 May 1986.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £0.40, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £79.90 less means of £79.50.</P>
      <P>If the person concerned is of the opinion that his circumstances have changed since the last investigation of his means it is open to him to apply for a review of his case.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  In order that a person may be considered permanently <Col N="1478" /> incapable of work it is necessary for him to, <i>inter alia</i>, have been continuously incapable of work for a period of one year.

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, provides for equal treatment for men and women in matters of social welfare. It includes a revised definition of the term &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; and gives men and women an equal right to claim increases for child dependants.  In accordance with regulations under the Act a claimant's spouse who is in insurable employment and earning more than £50.00 weekly will not be admitted as a dependent of the claimant and the increase in respect of child dependants will be paid at half the appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is a married man claiming increases of unemployment benefit in respect of an adult dependant and three child dependants.  He is at present in receipt of unemployment benefit at the weekly rate of £122.72, comprising personal rate of £41.10, an increase of £26.60 in respect of an adult dependant, a further increase of £28.60 in respect of child dependants and £26.42 pay-related benefit.  His current total weekly rate of benefit is limited by the condition which requires that the sum of weekly flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85% of the average nett weekly earnings of a claimant from the beginning of the tax year to the date of claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a reply to a questionnaire issued by the Department to enable his entitlement under the new provisions to be determined, with effect from 20 November 1986, he has indicated that his wife is insurably employed and earning more than £50.00 weekly.  Accordingly, from 20 November, he will not be entitled to an adult dependant allowance and he will be entitled to half the child dependant allowance only.  However, because of the <Col N="1480" /> reduction in flat-rate unemployment benefit, his total benefit will no longer be limited by the 85% condition and he will be entitled to the full amount of pay-related benefit appropriate in his case of £30.80 weekly.  His total entitlement from the operative date, therefore, will be £86.20, being £41.10 personal rate, £14.30 in respect of child dependants and £30.80 pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>If the person concerned continues to claim unemployment benefit he will have drawn his maximum entitlement of 390 days on 21 February 1987.  In advance of this date, however, his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be examined. His case will be referred, in the first instance, to a social welfare officer for investigation and then to a deciding officer for assessment of means.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined in the light of this assessment.  In assessing his means, his wife's income will be taken into account. On the assumption that she will still be working and not, therefore, his adult dependant, half their joint means will be assessed against him.</P>
    <P>The position regarding claims for dependants on his unemployment assistance claim will be the same as that which applies to his unemployment benefit claim, that is he will not be entitled to an adult dependant allowance and will be entitled to half the appropriate child dependant allowance.</P>

      <P>The State sector has, as a result of the implementation of the 1977 Act, remained in the forefront of developments with regard to structural forms of participation.
