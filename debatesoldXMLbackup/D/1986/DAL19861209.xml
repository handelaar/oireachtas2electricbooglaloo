      <P>Bíonn mo Roinnse i dlúth-theagmháil rialta le pobail na n-oileán Gaeltachta, go háirithe trí na comharchumainn atá ag feidhmiú ar a mbunáite, agus táim sásta gurb é sin an bealach is fearr chun fadhbanna a aithint agus teacht ar shlite lena réiteach. Bíonn tairbhe na scéimeanna éagsúla atá á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse agus ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ar fáil ar na hoileáin Ghaeltachta agus bíonn cabhair níos airde ná an gnáthráta deontais iníoctha sna hoileáin sin faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) agus faoi scéimeanna áirithe de chuid mo Roinne.</P>

Tuigim gur cuireadh é sin ar aghaidh.

Freisin, tugadh £1,150,000 do na heagrais Ghaeilge ón Roinn i mbliana freisin.  Agus déanann siad san sárobair chun an Ghaeilge a leathnú ar fud na tíre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá sé fite fuaite taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh. Mar shampla fuair Gael Linn i mbliana £315,000; fuair Comhdháil Naisiúnta na Gaeilge £240,000 agus fuair Conradh na Gaeilge níos mó ná £100,000 i mbliana.

Ach níl an freagra díreach ar do cheist anseo agam.  Is dóigh <Col N="1758" /> liom go gcaitear cuid mhaith den airgead sin lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Ní mór dom fiafraí den Aire Stáit faoin cheist seo de bharr go bhfuil méadú tagaithe ar na Gaelscoileanna tríd na tíre seo, an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Aire nó ag an Roinn i leith na ceiste atá luaite, is é sin ceist a dó ansin, rud éigin a dhéanamh chun tacaíocht a thabhairt do na tuismitheóirí agus do na leanaí agus iad uile atá ag freastal ar na Gaelscoileanna?  Nach bhfuil sé soiléir don Aire nó doibh siúd atá ag obair san Roinn gur cóir freastal ar na daoine seo?  An gcreideann sé go bhfuil sé soiléir anois go bhfuil leathnú ag teacht ar an nGaeilge de bharr na nGaelscoileanna seo agus an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Aire agus ag an Roinn cúnamh a thabhairt do na daoine san? Sin an cheist atá ann.  Nílim ag caint faoi na heagraíochtaí anois.  Luaigh tú Conradh na Gaeilge agus iad siúd.  Nílim ag caint futhu siúd.  Táim ag caint faoi na tuismitheóirí agus na clainn atá ag bunú na nGaelscoileanna seo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontáim leis an Teachta go bhfuil níos mó brú le déanaí ná mar a bhí le fada an lá chun Gaelscoileanna nua a chur ar bun ar fud na tíre.  Tá ceist, sílim, ag an Teachta O'Rourke faoi na naionraí Gaeilge níos fuide síos ar an liosta agus tabharfaidh mé an t-eolas duit ag an am sin más maith leis an Teachta ach tá fhios aige freisin go dtugann Bord na Gaelge cabhair do na naionraí lán-Ghaeilge tríd an Comhchoiste Réamhscolaíochta agus tugann sé sin cabhair airgid chun an Ghaeilge a leathnú agus a neartú ar fud na tíre.</P>

Táim anois ag fiafraigh den Aire Stáit an aontaíonn sé liom go bhfuil 900 postanna ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí ach nach bhfuil an t-airgead ag an Údarás chun na postanna sin a chur chun cinn.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>While no significant progress has yet been achieved in the control of Dutch Elm disease, my Department continue to be actively involved in research on the disease.  The Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department is co-operating with the chemistry department of University College, Dublin, in an EC project involving chemical analysis of the pathogen.  Regular contact is also maintained with researchers in Holland who are investigating the use of a systemic fungicide as <Col N="1769" /> a means of controlling the disease.  The Forest and Wildlife Service is also represented on a panel of EC experts which meets regularly to monitor developments.</P>
      <P>In the long term the selection and breeding of resistant strains is considered to be the most satisfactory solution to the disease.  This remedy is, however, by its nature a slow one but scientists are confident that a resistant strain of elm can be developed.  In this connection the EC has sponsored an international tree-breeding programme in which the Forest and Wildlife Service is participating as part of a general research programme into Dutch Elm disease.  Selected strains of elm have been outplanted at the John F. Kennedy Park and their growth is being monitored.</P>
      <P>The Forest and Wildlife Service has also carried out a series of experiments using the new biological method of control involving the use of a fungus.  The results of these experiments are currently being evaluated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give me any indication of the expenditure in his Department and the number of personnel involved in this area?  The Minister must surely be concerned that, in spite of all the research work that has been done to date, Dutch Elm disease is almost out of control and some greater effort will be needed by his Department if the situation is to be brought back under control again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the amount of expenditure and personnel in my Department involved here, I have not got that information as it was not required of me in the question.  We must accept that, in the long term, the selection and breeding of resistant strains of elm is considered the most satisfactory solution to the disease.  That is as a result of various investigations that have taken place both here and abroad.  Although various fungicides have been tried the disease by its nature, has proved to be resistant to most of the present controls that have been tried.  Indeed, until some systemic fungicide has been found, either here or <Col N="1770" /> abroad, the method I have suggested is probably the only one at the moment. A new developing systemic fungicide is under investigation in Holland and there are some hopeful signs that it may be an answer to the disease, but at this stage there are no specific results.  Scientists believe that in the long term the only solution to the problem is breeding a resistant strain of elm.  The news may not be very encouraging but this is as a result of study over long periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The treatments that are being tried and tested abroad are being watched by researchers at my Department and if something is brought forward by way of a fungicide that can be used to inoculate these trees then undoubtedly that will be used.  It can only be used, obviously, on an individual basis rather than by way of spraying a stand of timber.  If this is found to be effective, then we will certainly use it.  At this time I have to say that the treatment that has been tried on this species of trees &mdash; we have planted some out in John F. Kennedy Park in Wexford &mdash; is being monitored as to its results on these trees.</P>

      <P>There has been no serious reduction in the number of fish caught in Lough Sheelin in 1986.  The level of reported catches fluctuates from year to year.  According to anglers' returns, the number of fish caught in the years 1984, 1985 and 1986 were 1,299, 1,538 and 1,123 respectively.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the concern among anglers at the deterioration in the condition of the lake which was admitted by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment? Will the Minister say whether his Department have any role to play in <Col N="1772" /> the prevention or control of pollution in Lough Sheelin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware there has been a certain amount of concern expressed about Lough Sheelin and the fish catches there but I have to say that the figures I have just given indicate there has not been a great fluctuation between the years 1984 and 1986. There was an increase in 1985. The earlier part of this year showed encouraging results but the latter part has not been quite so encouraging. As the Deputy knows, primary responsibility for water pollution control rests with local authorities under the provisions of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  In the case of Lough Sheelin that control rests with Cavan County Council who, as the Deputy may be aware, have two representatives, one of whom is the chairman of the Lough Sheelin management committee, and who have issued section 12 notices to various individuals.</P>

      <P>My Department employ a number of temporary workers each year to assist with seasonal operations or to meet peak demands in other work.  The termination of these workers' employment arises either from the completion of the work on which they were engaged or when the funds available for their employment is running out.</P>
      <P>My Department have always employed temporary workers for these reasons and I expect that they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  As temporary employment becomes available in the future these workers will be considered for re-employment.  Deputies will be pleased to know that of those let go recently it has been possible to offer further temporary employment to 28 workers.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the threat posed by the wreck of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and I share local concern in the matter.</P>
      <P>My Department are co-operating fully with the operations group to ensure that damage to fisheries, wildlife and habitats in the area is prevented or curtailed to the minimum.  Specially constructed protective booms have been put in place across the entrance to the Lough Hyne Marine Nature Reserve.  Wildlife staff are patrolling beaches along the southern coast to locate and treat any wild birds found to be contaminated by oil.</P>
      <P>Members of my Department's staff and officials of the South Western Regional Fisheries Board are also monitoring the situation and advising on the protection of fisheries.  My Department have taken samples of fish and oil for analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been any indication to date of the extent of damage to fish stocks or indeed to the coastal areas concerned?  Can the Minister also indicate what specific action &mdash; other than having wildlife staff patrolling beaches &mdash; his Department are taking to prevent this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that there is a slick of oil coming from the submerged tanker of approximately 30 meters wide, flowing due east, which is visible for about three or four miles. My Department, the Department of the Environment &mdash; which is the leading Department dealing with oil slicks &mdash; the Department of Communications and the local authorities in the area are involved in this whole operation.  They are monitoring the situation between Roches Point and Youghal and between Lough Hyne and Rosscarbery.  I can inform the Deputy that 270 dead birds have been found by Departmental staff and they are mostly guillemots.  In addition, approximately 120 lightly-oiled birds have been observed.  These are gulls, oyster catchers and rain plover.  Reports received from other concerned groups suggest that about 30 other birds have been killed by oil.  With regard to the Deputy's other supplementary question about fish, I can tell him that only today as I was leaving my Department I met our official from the area.  He is satisfied that the fish life in the area is not being affected to any great degree.  Continual monitoring will be maintained in the area to ensure that the position does not deteriorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that the whole episode of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the way it has been handled by the Minister involved leaves a lot to be desired.  The Minister must be aware also that we very nearly had a major catastrophe in the whole south west area and the prevention of such a catastrophe was due more to good luck rather than <Col N="1776" /> any action taken by the Minister or his Department.  Can the Minister give us some indication now of how the situation will be dealt with because there is widespread anxiety that major damage will be done not only to stocks but to existing mariculture projects and other marine life there?  Is he aware furthermore that people are not satisfied that his Department, who have responsibility there, are prepared adequately to deal with that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Deputy that there has been any degree of slackness or laxity shown by any of the Departments responsible.  As he will be aware, the leading Department with regard to the application of controls in this area is the Department of the Environment. The Department concerned with both ships involved in the area is the Department of Communications.  I can tell the Deputy also that as soon as the problem arose officials from all Departments were despatched to that area and operations commenced.  Great credit is due to everybody involved that the damage that resulted was contained to one ship so far and has been to a very limited degree.  The actions subsequently taken have been all that could have been taken by any Department operating as they did so effectively and quickly after the accident.  The fact of two major catastrophes happening in the area &mdash; the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the <i>Capo Emma</i> events &mdash; at the same time created a problem for members of the staffs of both Departments and the local authority but immediately it happened and by 7.30 a.m. on 24 November, control centres were set up in both Skibbereen and Bantry to deal with the risks from the two ships.  The priority areas in the vicinity of the Stags Rock including Lough Hyne, were identified and immediate arrangements made to protect some of them by using booms.  It was also necessary to concentrate on protection of shore and clean up measures, as fuel oil from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> did not respond to dispersement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is wrong in saying that <Col N="1777" /> there was any mismanagement; the opposite was the case.  There was a great deal of activity to ensure that the danger to animal life, fish life and the tourist areas around the southern coast was minimised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that if adequate action had been taken this matter need never have arisen.  If a detention order had been served on the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> she need never have left the vicinity.  However, that is a separate issue.  How many personnel from the Minister's Department were involved in this area and were specialist people available to advise what action should be taken, for instance, for the protection of wild birds and fish stocks there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that, first, the Department to which he referred originally in his supplementary question should have been the Department of Communications.  I am satisfied that the action they took was the proper action in the circumstances.  Second, as regards my Department, again I assure him that the operations group who were set up in 1984 as the result of another problem on the Irish Sea represent all those Departments.  These are the Departments of the Environment, Communications, Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry and Defence as well as the local authorities, Waterford County Council. Cork County Council, members from the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the Department of Energy.  My Department's officials are involved as are members of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board as required.</P>

      <P>There is no record in the Department relating to the condition of the dam prior to the acquisition, in 1954, or of the land on which it is situated. The dam was, however, thoroughly inspected by the Department's engineer as recently as 1981 and found to be structurally sound.  Prior to that, and up to the time of its collapse, it had been inspected from time to time in the course of the normal management of the surrounding forest land and there was no indication that any repairs were necessary.</P>

      <P>As I said, the Department's engineer carried out the survey in 1981 in connection with improvements carried out by the Forestry and Wildlife Service to a road which runs over the dam.  During that survey, the dam was inspected and found to be completely sound.  Prior to 1981 and since then, routine inspections of the dam have been carried out by the local forest management and no structural faults were detected.</P>

      <P>In early 1986, a special unit was set up within my Department to deal specifically with aquaculture matters.  Since the setting up of this section, 13 areas have been considered for designation.  This brings the total number of such areas to 22. Eleven areas have now been designated. Eight of these cover extensive areas of the Galway and Mayo coastal regions which are the major centres of aquaculture interest.  The making of these designation orders will facilitate the early consideration of applications for aquaculture licences within the areas covered by the order.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining eleven areas, I have decided not to designate one area near Rogerstown, County Dublin and am considering the reports of the other relevant inquiries to see what parts, if any, of the areas in question can now be designated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is, or has been, a rapid deterioration in the fishing fleet.  There is, in fact, a continuing programme of fleet modernisation being carried on with the aid of BIM and FEOGA assistance.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are, at my request currenly reviewing their marine credit plan with a view to making the best use of the available State funds for (i) modernisation of the fleet, (ii) the introduction of a certain number of new vessels in each category and (iii) obtaining the maximum benefit from the proposed new EC structures regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that we need considerable investment to modernise the fleet and to bring in new vessels.  Can the Minister indicate if there will be a greater uptake in demand for new vessels and modernisation under the new structures policy than under the last one because the amount of aid got from the Community under the last programme was the second lowest of any member state?  A very small allocation was obtained to replace and modernise the fleet compared with what was received by other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in seeing a greater hope for expansion of the fleet under the new structures document which has lessened in some cases the amount of local contribution and increased the amount of the FEOGA grants.  In that respect there could be a greater takeup.  In other respects, along with modernising the fleet the limits imposed by the EC have been improved as a result of our discussions of 3 <Col N="1784" /> December.  If the Deputy has not already seen the full details of the result of the structures discussions he will be reasonably happy with the outcome with regard to our fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody could be happy with the provision which we got from the last policy structures document and proposals. The Minister will be fully aware that the aid which we received is very low and that nothing has been done in the past four years to modernise the fleet or to get new vessels.  Can the Minister give some indication that we will do better now, having regard to the complications in the new structures policy, than we did over the past three or four years?  Will there be a new Government plan to help to modernise the fleet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of measures are being taken in the Department.  The fleet will be modernised with State funds. I regard that as a priority.  With more money from FEOGA this should now be possible.  The big problem is to provide the amount of money which we need to provide to meet our share of the FEOGA grant available.  The changes we have achieved in the structures programme will mean that our contribution may be somewhat smaller for a given amount of work that can be done in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that it is really the lack of State investment which is hampering the development of the fleet.  The FEOGA money cannot be claimed because the State is not providing its contribution.  Under the new regulations it will be more difficult because the State will now have to pay 10 per cent rather than 5 per cent.  How can the Minister square that, having regard to the fact that we have done so badly up to now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry if, given that total overseas tourism revenue in 1986 is estimated to be down 6 per cent on 1985, with a decline of 4 per cent in total visitor numbers, he considers that this poses a very serious problem for the industry; and if he will make a statement on his plans to deal with the crisis in the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. M. Moynihan) Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. M. Moynihan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the figures quoted by the Deputy are correct, I do not accept that there is a crisis in the sector.  As the House is aware, the overall decline in overseas visitor numbers and revenue in 1986 is due to exceptional factors outside our control which seriously restricted the level of North American traffic to Europe.  These factors resulted in a 20 per cent decline in visitor numbers to Ireland from the North American market but notwithstanding our overall tourism performance was up on 1984 which was itself a good year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1987 promotional and marketing campaign will seek not only to recover the ground lost in the North American market this year but to achieve real growth in all our main markets.  The campaign will focus on exploiting the recent favourable developments in relation to access transport services.  In particular a major sales drive involving Bord Fáilte, the carriers and the various other sectors of the industry will be launched next February in the British market to ensure that <Col N="1786" /> the attraction of Ireland and the new lower air and sea fares are fully promoted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the major drop in the American market was concerned, it was minimised to an extent due to a very early joint Bord Fáilte-industrial promotion drive to America. While we regret the drop in the American trade, we have fared much better than our other European competitors in this regard.</P>

      <P>There has been considerable progress on the implementation of the environmental initiatives mentioned in the White Paper on Tourism. While my Department do not have primary responsibility in relation to environmental matters, they liaise very closely with other Departments and Bord Fáilte on relevant issues in view of the vital importance of the environment to tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the White Paper the Government directed that other Departments and agencies should take full account of tourism needs and interests in their programmes. Through the interdepartmental committee <Col N="1788" /> on tourism, my Department are ensuring that there is the maximum coordination in relation to environmental matters as they affect tourism.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, very concerned about any threat to the environment from pollution. In relation to recent incidents off the south west coast to which I assume the Deputy is referring, I am satisfied that my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment and Communications, have as far as is possible taken all the necessary measures to protect the environment.  My Department are of course actively involved at local level in co-operating with the other agencies and, where necessary, taking action in relation to specific tourism, fisheries and wildlife interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on Tourism contained a number of initiatives on the environment.  The following matters are those which were to be implemented by Bord Fáilte.  Firstly, the agreement of a pilot area with the City and County Managers' Association which will be a model for a project on litter bin design, provision and servicing. This project has now been completed. Dún Laoghaire was designated as the pilot area and it is hoped that local authorities around the country will adopt the proposals of the pilot study.  Secondly, the computerised mapping of the country's physical attractions.  This has been implemented by Bord Fáilte.  Thirdly, the carrying out of a study of our national heritage of outstanding landscapes to identify those areas of tourist importance which may be under threat from development. A Bord Fáilte study on the Connemara landscape is currently in draft form.  It is intended that similar detailed assessments of other key landscapes will <Col N="1789" /> take place, subject to an agreement with the county councils.  Fourthly, the production of a policy document on water pollution and its implications for tourism. Bord Fáilte have employed a consultant to examine this issue and a report is expected during 1987.  Fifthly, the intensification of Bord Fáilte co-operation with the planning authorities.  In 1986, Bord Fáilte made a detailed submission to local authorities who were reviewing their country development plans.  Similar submissions will be made to local authorities reviewing their plans in 1987.</P>

He confirmed that all soldiers serving in Northern Ireland are given clear instructions that incursions are not permitted and that the greatest care should be taken to avoid even accidental crossings of the Border. Mr. King assured me that special briefings are given to regiments when they arrive and that regular reminders are issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of recent incursions, the standing instructions to soldiers will be re-emphasised.  It has also been agreed that urgent discussions will take place in the Secretariat to discuss what further <Col N="1791" /> action can be taken to avoid incursions in the future.</P>
    <P>Incursions are simply not acceptable, but let me add that we need to bear in mind the background of these incursions, namely, the campaign of murder and destruction in the Border area and the difficulty for the Northern security forces of patrolling a frequently unclear Border under constant threat of death.</P>

      <P>I am glad to note that the Minister raised the matter at the meeting yesterday.  I know the Minister would agree with me that there is all the difference in the world between inadvertent strayings across the Border by, perhaps, newly arrived soldiers or inexperienced troops.  Is the Minister satisfied, however, that that was the case in this instance?  Is he aware in relation to the incursion near Glassdrummond that the British Army Press Office described it as a &ldquo;hot pursuit&rdquo; military operation? Would the Minister care to indicate what information he has about that aspect for the benefit of the House?</P>

      <P>There were a series of explosions from a mortar-type weapon on the afternoon in question.  There was an effort made to apprehend people &mdash; this is, so far, an unconfirmed report I have &mdash; who drove away in two cars.  It appears the soldier in question was not fully aware of the precise place where the Border was and he was apprehended under a citizen's arrest by two members of a family on the farm where he was on at that moment who turned him over to the Garda Síochána.  They, in turn, took him to Dundalk where the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that a file should be prepared and the soldier in question should be released if an assurance was given if he would appear again, if necessary, at a trial.  Beyond that I have no further details.  It certainly was not, as far as I know, a hot pursuit in the sense of a deliberate crossing of the Border to proved otherwise during any trial.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister confirm that the standing practice in this regard is still being adhered to, namely that the contact in cross-Border security operations is between police force and police force?  There seems to be some indication that in this incident there was communication between the British Army and the Garda.  It is an important point and I should be grateful if the Minister would indicate that the former practice is still being followed through.  I wish to ask also about the new military observation posts which have been placed by the British authorities very close to the Border.  Is the Minister aware that these are causing a great deal of anger and disquiet on both sides of the Border, especially among small farmers on the northern side of the Border who have been very rudely and arrogantly displaced? Is he aware also that the implications of these observation posts for people on our side of the Border are somewhat intimidatory?  Can the Minister give any information or reassurance about these new posts and say whether he or the Government or the Garda were aware of their establishment and the purposes of them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that the practice of communication between the security forces is RUC to Garda.  Regarding the second point about the observation posts in south Armagh, I met a deputation of small farmers from that area who were brought to see me by the Deputy Leader of the SDLP, Mr. Séamus Mallon, and they strongly expressed to me their concern about these posts.  That concern was conveyed to the British Government through the secretariat established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. On the Deputy's third question, I had no prior notice of the erection of these posts.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that while cross-Border co-operation in security matters is important, it is equally important that incursions by British military personnel across the Border should <Col N="1793" /> be totally prevented in so far as possible? All those who would favour cross-Border security co-operations would nevertheless have grievous doubts about incursions by British military personnel into the territory of the State and there are widespread feelings of resentment and animosity about such incursions. Whereas in the normal course of events it is difficult to prevent accidental strayings across, the general public here would like to be fully assured that any incursions in future would be restricted to such accidental crossings.</P>

I understand, of course, that there are occasions when they take place in error.  The Secretary of State expressed his regret for the incursion that had taken place and undertook to reconfirm instructions given to troops in Northern Ireland about the necessity strictly to observe the Border.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances, and notes with satisfaction that the provisions in Title III of the Single Europe Act relating to the co-operation of the High Contracting Parties (that is, the Twelve member States of the European Community) on the political and economic aspects of security and the closer co-ordination of their positions in this area do not affect Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> That Dáil Éireann further notes and welcomes the provisions of Article 23 of the Single European Act on Economic and Social Cohesion, which enhances and strengthens the commitment of the Community to the achievement of the objectives set out in Protocol No. 30 on Ireland appended to the Treaty of Accession of Denmark.  Ireland and the United Kingdom to the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The debate on this motion is being taken in conjunction with motion No. 9 approving the terms of the Single European Act and with the Second Stage of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1986.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has two operative sections.  Section 1 will make certain provisions of the Single Act part of domestic law.  These provisions are those which amend the existing European Community Treaties which are already part of domestic law.  Because of the provision of the Single Act which permits the European Parliament to be formally described as the Parliament rather than the Assembly, section 2 of the Bill provides that references to the Assembly of the European Communities in any earlier Act or statutory instrument shall be construed as references to the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>The provisions of Title III of the Single Act, which deal with European Co-operation in the Sphere of Foreign Policy, do not amend the Community Treaties and do not, therefore, require to be made part of domestic law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have placed a motion before the Dáil in order to permit the Dáil to reaffirm Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances and to note with satisfaction that the provisions of Title III <Col N="1890" /> of the Single Act relating to the co-operation of the Twelve on the political and economic aspects of security and the closer co-ordination of their positions in this area do not affect our position of neutrality outside military alliances.  Furthermore, the motion will give the Dáil an opportunity to note and welcome the provisions of the Single Act on Economic and Social Cohesion which enhance and strengthen the commitment of the Community to the achievement of the objectives of Protocol 30 on Ireland appended to the Treaty of Accession.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act as a whole, including the foreign policy provisions, will involve charges on public funds and it is for this reason that I have placed before the Dáil the second motion to approve the terms of the Single Act.</P>
    <P>The debate today is of great importance for our membership of the Community, and for our place and role in its further development.  Therefore, in considering in this debate the Single European Act, which represents the opening of the way towards the further development of the Community, it would, I think, be opportune and desirable to make some assessment of our experience of membership to date.  This I intend to do at the outset in order to set the debate in its proper context.</P>
    <P>First, may I say I do not really think that there is anyone in this House who would at this stage of our membership be prepared to suggest seriously that Ireland should leave the Community.  The argument that Ireland would be better off outside the Community was, of course, comprehensively answered by the Irish people in the 1972 referendum before our accession.  It has also been clearly answered by our experience of membership.</P>
    <P>Two fundamental considerations underlay the original decision that Ireland should seek membership of the European Community.  These considerations were clearly explained at the time and set out explicitly in the 1972 White Paper on Accession.  First, it was considered that membership would provide an opportunity, unprecedented in <Col N="1891" /> the history of this State, to participate fully with other democratic and like-minded countries of Europe in the movement towards European unity.  Secondly, it was considered that membership would provide the conditions in which we could best pursue our economic and social development; conditions much more favourable to us than any we could hope to enjoy if we were to remain outside the Community.  This was the basis on which we applied to join the Community.  It was the basis on which the Irish people by an overwhelming majority vote approved our becoming a member and it is the basis on which successive Governments have sought to promote our interests in the Community.</P>
    <P>We have accordingly sought since accession, not only to pursue our immediate economic interests, but also to play a constructive and positive role in the movement towards European unity. Such closer European integration among the member states of the Community has rightly been perceived to be in our clear, longer term interests.  And I think it is fair to say that this role which we have chosen over the years of membership to adopt has won for this country considerable respect and goodwill.</P>
    <P>The substantial economic benefits which have flowed to Ireland from membership are manifest.  I shall deal in more detail with such benefits, but before I do so, I wish to refute two misleading assertions which are made from time to time about our membership.</P>
    <P>The first assertion, is that we joined an exclusively economic Community for exclusively economic reasons.  This is not at all the case.  Although there were incontrovertible economic arguments for our becoming a member and although these arguments naturally carried very considerable weight in our decision to join, Ireland's application for membership was clearly made in full awareness and acceptance of the political ideals and aims of the Community.</P>
    <P>The second assertion is that Ireland has approached the Community only with a view to what it can get and not with a <Col N="1892" /> view to what it can contribute.  Again this is not the case, as our record of membership demonstrates.  In fact, while seeking to protect and promote our interests and concerns, successive Governments have recognised that the Community means more than a series of deals and that, beyond the negotiations and bargaining which take place, there is a process of economic and political integration under way which it is very much in our interests to be an integral part of.  Furthermore, our positive approach to ongoing Community business and to the further development of the Community reflects our position as very clear net beneficiaries from Community policies, and is a significant factor in our negotiating approach to the various issues.</P>
    <P>A few simple facts illustrate clearly the extent to which this country has benefited from Community membership.  Between 1973 and 1985 this country received, after allowance is made for our national contributions, transfers amounting to £4.7 billion from the Community budget.  In 1984, the latest year for which comparable statistics are available, Ireland's net transfers amounted to 4.2 per cent of our gross domestic product.  This percentage is almost double that of any other member state.  Indeed, relative to our population and share of Community gross domestic product, Ireland receives the highest financial benefit from the Community of any member state.  In 1985, net budgetary transfers alone to this country amounted to £900 million, the equivalent of 13.6 per cent of current Government revenue.  By way of illustration of the importance of such transfers, I would point out that, if they ceased, the tax bill of the average income tax year would have to increase by 30 to 40 per cent in order to make up the necessary revenue.  Since we joined the Community we have received, for example, more than £4.5 billion through the Common Agricultural Policy and about £1 billion from the Social Fund and the Regional Fund.  Our receipts from the Community continue at a high level.</P>
    <P>But Community membership confers <Col N="1893" /> very important economic advantages other than financial transfers.  Membership ensures access for our industrial and agricultural exports to a vast market of 320 million people &mdash; the largest in the world.  This access in turn has been an essential factor in increasing the attractiveness of Ireland as a base for foreign industrial investment &mdash; the investment which is so vital for Ireland's economic development.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a wider and a key dimension to our membership.  It has enabled this country to pursue its interest and to have its concerns expressed and taken into account more fully and effectively than could ever have been possible outside the Community.  It has, moreover, given Ireland a role in Europe and the world which would be unthinkable for us if we were not a member.  The positive effects of this role on our national esteem and self-confidence should not, I venture to say, be underestimated.</P>
    <P>Of course, membership of the European Community for Ireland has not proved to be a panacea for our economic problems.  It could never have been so envisaged by anyone.  Our accession represented a great national challenge, certainly not an overall economic solution. By and large, successive Governments have, over the years of membership, faced that challenge successfully.  There can be no question but that we have been immeasurably better able, as was anticipated at the time of joining, to protect and pursue our interests within the Community than would ever have been possible outside.  This very much remains the case to-day; and will most certainly continue to be so for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>There have been, as we all know, disappointments in our years of membership. These disappointments have been shared by all or at least some of our Community partners.  I would mention in particular the absence still of a coherent and comprehensive regional policy for the Community as a whole.  The disparties between the economic development of the regions have really not been reduced.  There has been a failure to date <Col N="1894" /> to achieve a genuinely united and free market within the Community.  Then there are the major problems which are now confronting the Community, particularly in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy and to how the Community is going to provide the financial resources necessary for its continued operation and further development.</P>
    <P>I should like to make two points in relation to the disappointments and problems I have mentioned.  First, the most important provisions of the Single European Act are designed precisely to overcome the failures which have given rise to such disappointment up to now &mdash; in the areas of regional development and the internal market.  Secondly, it is only as a committed and constructive member of the Community in the coming years that we shall be able to defend and pursue effectively our national interests, as the Community gets to grips with the major problems I have mentioned, problems, I should say, which will require some radical rethinking and action.  The fact is that there is no alternative to our playing an active and positive role within the Community in the testing, but what should prove exciting period ahead.</P>
    <P>In order to appreciate fully the significance of the Single European Act for the future development of the Community, it has to be situated against the background of thinking and actions which gave the impetus to its eventual negotiation. It was the European Council in Milan in June of last year which decided to convene the intergovernmental conference which led to the signing of the Single Act.  That decision followed several years of debate and preparation. Over many years various attempts had been made to draw up proposals for progress towards European Union.  There had been no shortage of ideas as to how progress might be achieved.  However, the political will, so necessary to achieve a significant breakthrough, was lacking. The Community, immersed in its internal budgetary and other problems and disputes, was in no collective mood to venture an examination of where it was <Col N="1895" /> going.  In so far as the objective of real movement towards closer European integration received any attention, it was perceived as a distant vision rather than as an urgent necessity.</P>
    <P>However, the growing awareness of the need for progress in the development of the Community reflected harsh reality rather than a vague aspiration to European progress.  Two important and incontestable facts had gradually brought home to all concerned that there was an urgent need to address the state of standstill in the Community.  First and foremost of these facts was Europe's failure to keep pace with its main trading competitors, the United States and Japan &mdash; in terms of economic growth, in terms of job creation, in terms of tackling unemployment, and, in particular, in terms of competing effectively internationally in the areas of research and advanced technology.  Secondly, the decision-making mechanisms of the Community, which were originally designed for a Community of Six, were clearly in need of a significant overhaul, especially with the prospect of the admission of Spain and Portugal to make a Community of Twelve.</P>
    <P>The Solemn Declaration on European Union, adopted at the Stuttgart Summit in June 1983, committed the member states to a relaunching of the Community and represented the first very limited signs of progress.  In February 1984, the European Parliament helped to revitalise the debate on the future of the Community by adopting its Draft Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the Solemn Declaration at Stuttgart and in the spirit of the Parliament's Draft Treaty, the European Council at Fontainebleau in June 1984 decided to establish the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs with the task of making suggestions for the improvement of the operation of European co-operation in both the Community field and that of political co-operation. This committee was inaugurated during the Irish Presidency and had as its chairman Senator James Dooge.  The final report of the Dooge <Col N="1896" /> Committee constituted the principal basis for the discussion at the European Council at Milan last year on the future direction of the Community, the discussion which led to the convening of the intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>That European Council at Milan therefore had reason for both serious concern and reasonable hope.  There was the concern that the Community had not yet demonstrated a capacity to reach levels of economic growth and technological development commensurate with its size and potential.  But there was also hope that at long last the necessary political will was being engendered which would enable the Community to establish firmly the basis for its further development and to provide the improved decision making mechanisms which this substantial progress would require.</P>
    <P>There was indeed urgent and wide recognition of the need for the Community to move ahead again, but differences of view emerged at Milan on the need to convene an intergovernmental conference.  Ireland, alone of the more recent member states, joined the six original members in supporting the convening of the conference.  The Government adopted this position in the clear recognition, that, if the Community was to embark on an important relaunching, Ireland should be in the vanguard of this forward movement, and that our best interests, as well as those of the Community as a whole, would thereby be served.  In the light of the successful and unanimous outcome to the intergovernmental conference represented by the signature of the Single European Act, it really cannot be questioned that this was the right decision.  By aligning Ireland from the beginning with those who supported the convening of the conference and its proposed objectives, the Government undoubtedly generated a significant degree of goodwill, especially from some of the larger member states. These particular member states do, of course, play a key role in relation to the development of Community policies and measures which are of direct interest and importance to Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> But the generation of goodwill, however important, did not constitute the principal motivation for our support for the convening of the conference or for our pursuance of a constructive approach during the course of the conference.  Our positive approach to the conference and its work was based on three main considerations. First, the Community was confronted by the increasingly urgent challenges which I have described.  Secondly, the time was uniquely ripe, as I have indicated, for the Community to meet those challenges and thirdly, Ireland, having benefited and continuing to benefit substantially from its membership of the Community, the Comunity's well-being and further development was, therefore, very much in our interests.</P>
    <P>The contents of the Single European Act have been set out and explained on a number of occasions &mdash; most recently and comprehensively in the Government's explanatory guide.  The guide has been circulated to Deputies and I shall, therefore, limit my description of the contents of the Act to a brief analysis of its provisions.  But before doing so, I want to reiterate to this House that, as a reading of the explanatory guide makes abundantly clear, the Single Act contains no hidden snares nor concealed agendas.</P>
    <P>The Single Act is so-called because it brings together in one Treaty two elements which were negotiated separately and which are in fact distinct. There are, first, provisions amending the Treaties establishing the European Communities and, secondly, provisions on European co-operation in the Sphere of Foreign Policy.  The amendments to the Community Treaties contained in the Single Act can be summarised under nine headings.</P>
    <P>The first set of EC Treaty amendments contained in the Single Act is designed to facilitate and expedite the completion of the internal market in the Community by a target date of the end of 1992.  In order to achieve this objective, Council decisions in certain specific treaty areas <Col N="1898" /> are to be taken by qualified majority voting in future.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a country heavily dependent on exports.  Last year almost 70 per cent of our exports went to our Community partners.  Two out of every three jobs in manufacturing industry in Ireland depend, to one degree or another, on exports.  The provisions of the Single Act aimed at bringing about the early achievement of a genuine and total freetrading market within the Community are of considerable importance for this country and should be of great potential benefit to our exporters.</P>
    <P>In the Single Act provisions on the internal market, the area of fiscal harmonisation, in relation to both direct and indirect taxation, has been entirely excluded from the move to qualified majority voting, and unanimity will continue to be required.  We will thus be in a position, as heretofore, to protect our interests in this area.  The Single Act also expressly permits national measures to be taken which a member state considers are justified on grounds of major needs as referred to in Article 36 of the EC Treaty.  This takes account of Irish concerns with respect to animal and plant health in these islands and incorporates, at our insistence, the extension of the exception to the area of public morality.</P>
    <P>The second set of Treaty amendments provided for in the Single Act is the incorporation of a new Title in the EC Treaty on Economic and Social Cohesion.  These new provisions have as their objective the reduction of the disparities between the various regions in the Community and the backwardness of the least favoured regions.  These new provisions represent a renewed and strengthened commitment to reducing the differences in economic development and standards of living between the various regions of the Community. The stipulation that the cohesion objective is to be taken into account in the implementation of the internal market and in all common policies of the Community is particularly important from Ireland's point of view.  It will greatly strengthen our position when negotiations are under way on moves towards <Col N="1899" /> the realisation of the full internal market and towards the strengthening of existing Community policies and the development of new policies.  The incorporation in the EC Treaty, for the first time, of a specific basis for the Regional Fund, will serve to intensify the commitment of the individual member states and of the Community as a whole to bringing about an enhanced Regional Policy.  The recognition in the Single Act of the task of reducing regional disparities as central to a harmonious economic and social development of the Community will also help towards this end.</P>
    <P>The third set of Treaty amendments contained in the Single Act relates to the role of the European Parliament in the Community's decision-making process. This role is to be enhanced although the Council will retain the final say.  The provisions represent a modest and overdue enhancing of the role and stature of the directly-elected Parliament in the Community's decision-making process.  They will offer the Parliament scope for increasing its influence in that process. But, at the same time, the inter-institutional balance within the Community is preserved with the Council of Ministers retaining the final say.</P>
    <P>The fourth area in which the Single Act amends the EC Treaty relates to the management and implementing powers of the Commission.  Under existing Treaty provisions the Council of Ministers already confers, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, extensive powers on the Commission to implement basic decisions taken by the Council, including very significant powers in the area of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The new provisions offer scope for streamlining the Commission's implementing powers by providing a more systematic basis for conferring such powers in the future.  This, however, will be subject to continued safeguards for the interests of the member states.  These safeguards involve: first the Council's continued right to impose requirements in respect of the exercise of implementing powers by the Commission; secondly, the Council's continued right in specific cases <Col N="1900" /> to exercise certain implementing powers itself; and thirdly, the requirement that, in future, procedures for conferring powers on the Commission must conform to certain principles and rules to be agreed unanimously in advance by the Council.</P>
    <P>The fifth EC Treaty amendment effected by the Single Act is that the monetary capacity of the Community is given an enhanced profile by the insertion of a new chapter in the EC Treaty.  This chapter represents essentially a compromise between the different positions which emerged at the conference and is modest in its implications.</P>
    <P>The sixth set of EC Treaty amendments enshrined in the Single Act is the inclusion in that Treaty for the first time of specific provisions dealing with research and technological development. These provisions provide a Treaty framework for the development of a comprehensive Community-based policy in this area.  This is of crucial importance for the future economic development of the Community and for enhancing its competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United States and Japan in the area of high technology. There should be considerable potential benefit in this development for the smaller member states such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>The seventh set of EC Treaty amendments brought about by the Single Act is that a Community policy on protection of the environment is to be brought expressly within the EC Treaty.</P>
    <P>There is an eighth amendment to the Treaty contained in the Single Act which provides for the adoption by the Council of minimum requirements with a view to improvements, especially in the working environment, as regards the health and safety of workers.</P>
    <P>Finally, the ninth set of Treaty amendments, consists of provisions to ease the workload and improve the functioning of the European Court of Justice.  These are objectives which we, of course, fully share.  These then are the amendments to the Community Treaties contained in the Single Act.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Single Act on <Col N="1901" /> European Co-operation in the Sphere of Foreign Policy are contained in Title III. In essence, these provisions are largely a formalisation of the existing practices and procedures of European Political Co-operation. This is the process which has been evolving since 1970 by which the member states, operating on the basis of consensus, exchange information, consult together and, where possible, seek to adopt common positions and to take joint action on the main foreign policy issues of concern to them.</P>
    <P>The provisions on European Co-operation in the Sphere of Foreign Policy have been comprehensively set out and explained in the Government's explanatory guide to the Single Act which all Deputies will have had an opportunity to study.  I do not, therefore, propose to go exhaustively over that ground on this occasion.  In summary, the essential characteristic of European political co-operation will remain the joint endeavour of the partners to formulate and implement a European foreign policy by informing and consulting each other on foreign policy of general interest, by coordinating their positions and by taking joint action.  In adopting national positions, each partner engages itself to take full account of the positions of the others and to consider the desirability of adopting and implementing common European positions.  Furthermore, each partner will endeavour to avoid any action or position which might impair the effectiveness of the Twelve as a cohesive force in international relations and, as far as possible, to refrain from impeding the formation of a consensus.  This process has been recognised and practised by the member states since the earliest days of EPC. The core of the European political co-operation process is represented by the meetings of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, together with a member of the Commission, at least, at least four times a year.  They may also discuss foreign policy matters within the framework of EPC on the occasion of meetings of the Council of Ministers of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The principle of EPC decision-making <Col N="1902" /> remains unchanged: there is no voting, majority or otherwise, in EPC.  A consensus continues to be required for a common position to be adopted or common action taken.  The machinery of EPC remains the same as before: the political directors are to meet regularly in the Political Committee and working groups shall meet as directed by the Political Committee.  The only innovation in all of this is the establishment in Brussels of a light and compact Secretariat for the process, clearly under the authority of the Presidency, to which it will be an administrative adjunct.  The Presidency remains responsible for managing EPC business including the drawing up of working papers and for representing agreed positions of the Twelve.</P>
    <P>The scope of EPC remains limited to foreign policy matters of general interest. In so far as these refer to security, co-operation is limited to the political and economic aspects.  Military and defence matters remain outside the scope of EPC.</P>
    <P>The Single Act also contains certain common provisions which provide a formal and long overdue acknowledgement of the existence of the European Council, and provide that the European Parliament is formally to be known by that name rather than as &ldquo;The Assembly&rdquo; as stipulated in the original treaties.  This represents a formal and welcome treaty recognition of the enhanced status of the Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Final Act of the Conference, in addition to containing the Single Act itself, contains a number of declarations adopted by the conference and a number of other unilateral declarations which were noted by the conference.  These include a declaration by Ireland that we would, in certain circumstances relating to the insurance industry in Ireland, expect to be able to rely on a sympathetic attitude from the Commission and from the other member states.</P>
    <P>I have thought it well to identify, once again, and re-explain the provisions of the Single Act.  The Government's explanatory guide set out these explanations and the implications for Ireland <Col N="1903" /> of the various provisions in comprehensive fashion.  As will be clear to Deputies, there is nothing hidden in these provisions.  They are complex but not at all incomprehensible.  Their implications, taken as a whole, are significant but not momentous.  Some criticise them for going too far, others for not going far enough.  In essence, they represent a realistic and imaginative compromise, a means rather than an end, grounds for heightened expectations.</P>
    <P>There are many elements of the Single Act which are very welcome from Ireland's point of view.  On behalf of the Government, I have put forward a motion relating to two of these elements in particular, namely, the provisions in Title III relating to co-operation on the political and economic aspects of security and the provisions on economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>I have put forward this motion in order to allow the Dáil an opportunity of taking particular note of these provisions and welcoming them.  The relevant provisions of Title III, as I will make clear when I return to them shortly, do not affect Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances.  The motion will afford the Dáil the opportunity of reaffirming Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances.  The cohesion provisions of the Single Act enhance and strengthen the Community's commitment to the achievement of the objectives set out in Protocol No. 30 on Ireland appended to our treaty of accession. These objectives, with particular reference to Ireland, are the steady improvement of the living standards and working conditions of the peoples of the member states, the harmonious development of their economies, and the reduction of the differences between the various regions and the backwardness of the less-favoured regions.  It is most appropriate that the Dáil should specifically welcome the cohesion provisions.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have put down an amendment to the other motion in my name approving the terms of the Single Act.  This amendment would require the <Col N="1904" /> Government to annex a declaration, on the same questions covered in the first motion, to our Instrument of Ratification of the Single Act.  The Government cannot accept this amendment, first, because it would introduce an unacceptable element of conditionality into Ireland's ratification of the Single Act and would, therefore, appear to call into question our full commitment to the implementation of the Single Act and, secondly, because the content of the proposed declaration contained in the Fianna Fáil amendment does not reflect the fact that our concerns both on neutrality and on economic and social cohesion are fully met in the relevant provisions of the Single Act itself.</P>
    <P>I now propose to deal specifically with the main criticisms made and concerns voiced about the Single European Act and its possible implications for this country. In doing so I shall be addressing the assertions and statements made in the amendment tabled by The Workers' Party to the motion approving the terms of the Single Act.</P>
    <P>The Single Act will not involve any diminution in Ireland's sovereignty. When we joined the Community it was pointed out and accepted by the people that the powers which we would agree to share with other member states would in fact be enhanced rather than diminished by the co-operation involved.  Our experience of Community membership has borne out that fact and the Single Act does not alter it.  The quotation from the Government's 1972 White Paper on Accession included at paragraph 4.10 of the Explanatory Guide will continue to be as valid as it then was.</P>
    <P>The Government are also satisfied that ratification by this country of the Single Act does not require an amendment of the Constitution.  The amendments of the European Community treaties are limited in nature.  They do not involve major institutional changes.  They are directed to giving a new impetus in areas already comprehended by the treaties.  The Community treaties expressly envisage the possibility that the treaties may be amended, and establish procedures for <Col N="1905" /> that purpose.  Such amendments have already been made since Ireland acceded to the Community.</P>
    <P>The State is constitutionally entitled, by virtue of the Third Amendment of the Constitution, to play its full part in the operation of the Community treaties, including the provisions of those treaties which permit their amendment by common agreement of the member states.  For this purpose the Government are empowered to negotiate and agree to amendments of the kind involved in the Single Act.  Having done so, the Government are empowered to present the appropriate legislation to the Oireachtas &mdash;such as that under consideration today &mdash;and the Oireachtas is empowered to enact it.  Once this has been done, the Government are empowered on behalf of the State to ratify the amending treaty &mdash;in this case, the Single Act.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms that the change in voting in the Council of Ministers from unanimity to qualified majority voting provided for in the Single Act will severely diminish Ireland's ability to protect and promote its interests in the Community.  This is simply not so.  As the Explanatory Guide makes abundantly clear, qualified majority voting is being introduced in certain specified areas and this is designed to improve and facilitate decision-making in these areas.  This is in Ireland's interest, notably in the area of the internal market. The unanimity requirement for Council decisions is retained in certain cases. Clearly the most important such case is that of the harmonisation of either direct or indirect taxation.  Here, we and a number of other member states insisted during the negotiations on the Single Act that unanimity had to be retained.</P>
    <P>In the areas where majority voting is being applied we shall be able to protect and promote our essential interests, as we always have done, through the normal negotiating process.  Furthermore, it should be quite clearly understood&mdash; because this is a point which has been misrepresented, perhaps deliberately&mdash; that the &ldquo;Luxembourg Compromise&rdquo;, or the so-called &ldquo;veto&rdquo;, is not at all affected <Col N="1906" /> by the Single Act.  The &ldquo;veto&rdquo; is a purely political arrangement and not one covered by treaty provisions.  It is not nor could it have been affected by the treaty amendments agreed.  It was not even discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference. Member states remain free to invoke the &ldquo;veto&rdquo; where important national interests are involved.  This is so, both in cases where majority voting already applies in the Council under the existing treaties, and in cases where qualified majority voting is to be introduced for the first time by the provisions of the Single Act.</P>
    <P>The completion of the internal market is very much in this country's interest as I have already explained and as is made clear in the Government's Explanatory Guide.  However, its completion is likely to be of greater benefit to the more developed central regions of the Community than to those, such as Ireland, on the periphery.  The inclusion of a chapter in the Single Act on economic and social cohesion responds precisely to this possibility. It is specifically provided that the cohesion objective of reducing regional disparities will have to be taken into account in all common policies and in the completion of the internal market. Furthermore, by recognising that the task of reducing regional disparities is central to the harmonious development of the Community as a whole, the relevant provisions of the Single Act will clearly serve to strengthen and enhance the Community's regional policy.</P>
    <P>The management powers of the Commission will continue to be subject to safeguards for the interests of the member states.  Far from threatening our interests, the Single Act provisions in this regard are very much to our advantage and should contribute to a more efficient execution of Community business.  The Commission have a key position in the defence of the interests of the Community as a whole and, in particular, of the interests of the smaller member states.  Furthermore, adequate implementing powers for the Commission avoid the lengthy delays which would <Col N="1907" /> necessarily be involved in referring management decisions to the Council.  The Council should not be expected to and, indeed, could not as a matter of practice, adopt the countless measures implementing decisions of principle which it has itself taken.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the exercise of management powers by the Commission can be beneficial to Ireland in many ways. The Commission's power to take rapid decisions in the agriculture area, for example, is vital to the efficient functioning of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Similarly the workings of the regional fund and the social fund, which involve a significant management role for the Commission, have operated very much to our advantage.</P>
    <P>Much attention has focused on the provisions in Title III of the Single Act on co-operation in the sphere of foreign policy.  A number of criticisms and allegations have been made to the effect that they erode our sovereignty, our independence in foreign policy matters and our neutrality; and that we never contracted to join a Community with a political dimension.  The Government's Explanatory Guide has addressed these aspects in a comprehensive way.  It has, I believe, demonstrated conclusively that the fears are groundless and that the critical assertions made are false.  I propose, therefore, to address four principal points which I consider to be of special importance.</P>
    <P>First, as the Explanatory Guide has made clear, Ireland has been committed from the time it joined the Community to the political objectives which give the Community its meaning.  Indeed, the political implications of Ireland's accession to the European Community have been well understood by every Irish Government since Irish membership of the European Community first became an option. As far back as 1962, the then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, addressing the Foreign Ministers of the original six members of the Community stated:</P>
    <P>It is natural that we in Ireland should <Col N="1908" /> regard with keen and sympathetic interest every genuine attempt to bring the peoples of Europe closer together ... We were happy at the development of a strong movement towards closer European Union...I desire to emphasise that the political aims of the Community are aims to which the Irish Government and people are ready to subscribe and in the realisation of which they wish to take an active part.</P>
    <P>Ten years later, when membership of the European Community was about to become a reality, a subsequent Irish Government stated that aspiration to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the Irish people in a White Paper in terms similarly unequivocal:</P>
    <P>Ireland's application for membership of the EEC was made in full awareness of the political ideals and aims of the Treaty which inspired the founding members of the Community. We have declared our willingness to join with the other member states of the enlarged Community in working towards the achievement of the ever closer union between the European peoples which is the first aim of the Treaty of Rome.  The Europe envisaged by the member states is one composed of democratic states which, in spite of their different national characteristics, are united in their essential interests.  The Government are convinced that these are ideals and aims which will find a ready response in the Irish people.  As a member of the Community, we shall participate fully in the work of shaping its future political development.</P>
    <P>A ready response was indeed forthcoming from the Irish people &mdash; the overwhelming vote in the 1972 referendum in favour of Ireland's joining the European Community.</P>
    <P>This understanding of the Community's ultimate political goal and Ireland's commitment to that goal &mdash; the achievement of European unity &mdash; has been restated and reaffirmed by each and every Irish Government since our <Col N="1909" /> accession to the European Community. It has also been reaffirmed by the present Irish Government.  By democratic vote, we cast our lot with the European Community and it is my intention to ensure that Ireland makes the fullest possible contribution within that grouping.</P>
    <P>Second, I feel it necessary to recall that one of the specific means by which the European Community decided to make practical progress in the political as distinct from the economic sphere of European integration was through co-operation in the sphere of foreign policy &mdash;in other words European Political Co-operation (EPC), the practices and procedures of which have evolved gradually over the years with our full participation and agreement.</P>
    <P>Third, I think it important to emphasise that Ireland's involvement in EPC in general, and the formalisation of EPC in the Single Act in particular, is of substantial benefit to this country.  In the first place, our involvement in EPC has enlarged the scope and content of Irish foreign policy in promoting our essential interests.  Far from acting as a constraint on our freedom, our involvement in EPC has afforded us the opportunity to work with our European partners with whom we share basic ideals, to promote, to a greater extent than we could have done in isolation, our aims and priorities.</P>
    <P>It is evident, too, that the European Community, composed of more than 320 million people with a combined GNP greater than that of the United States is in a particularly advantageous position to contribute to the promotion of international pace, security, stability, reconciliation and the rule of law in international affairs, goals which have always been of central importance to this country.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the development, which we have always favoured, of constructive common positions of the Twelve on the major international issues has led to a situation where the Twelve are an increasingly respected and influential entity in world affairs.  This is to the benefit of the Community in general and Ireland in particular.  In areas of the world <Col N="1910" /> such as the Middle East, Africa, Central America and Asia, the constructive attitudes on international issues taken by Ireland as a member of the Community have served to heighten this country's profile in a way which is only beneficial to our essential interests at every level. political, diplomatic and economic.</P>
    <P>The incorporation of foreign policy provisions under the umbrella of the Single European Act is also very much in our interests.  We have always argued that the economic and political elements of European integration are interdependent and form part of the same dynamic of European construction.  We have argued. too, that progress towards European union, to be successful, must be realistic, balanced and coherent.</P>
    <P>The balance, in our view, consists in the realisation that progress in the area of political co-operation should be firmly based on a growing community of interests between the member states in the economic and social areas.  The Single European Act strikes that balance, in substance and in form: in substance, because Title III accurately represents the appropriate limit to political co-operation at this stage of the Community's development, and moreover, sets these limits out in a juridically clear fashion; in form, because Title III, by being brought under the umbrella of the Single Act, gives expression to the interdependent nature of political and economic progress towards European union.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of neutrality. As I have stated repeatedly and as the Explanatory Guide makes clear, the Single Act poses no threat to our neutrality. Our neutral position outside military alliances has been fully accommodated by our partners.  Article 30.6 confirms that the scope of discussions on security in EPC will remain limited to the political and economic aspects of security.  As a corollary of this provision, and for the first time ever, our position is further protected by the provision that nothing in the Single Act shall impede those states who wish to co-operate more closely on security questions, that is on military and defence <Col N="1911" /> questions, doing so within the WEU or NATO.  We are not a member of either of these organisations and we have no intention of joining them.  Ireland will, therefore, neither be involved in nor committed to any co-operation that takes place in those organisations.</P>
    <P>I believe there has been some deliberate misrepresentation about that provision which speaks of maintaining the technological and industrial conditions necessary for security.  The explanatory guide has set the record straight in this matter.  The clause in question is not shorthand for associating Ireland with the weapons procurement of its partners. The reality is much more straightforward.</P>
    <P>Security is a broad concept and the level of technological developments of Europe compared to, say, the US or Japan is a legitimate long term concern and an economic aspect of security.  The same applies to industrial conditions. Article 30.6 (b) of the Single Act reflects the growing realisation by Europeans, instanced for example in the EUREKA project in which neutral countries such as Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland also participate, that we in Europe must face up to the technological and industrial challenges we face internationally, from the United States, from Japan and from the other emerging economic powers of the Pacific area.</P>
    <P>Contrary to claims that have been made, the Single Act, in Article 30.6 (b) or in any other provision of Title III for that matter, cannot commit Ireland to co-operation in the production of weapons, nor can it constrain our ability to speak out on issues of concern to us.  We shall continue to make decisions nationally in relation to our security.  Measures that we take in co-operation with our partners will be situated entirely within the framework of the Community, and hence within the economic aspects of security. Our neutral position, therefore, is totally unaffected by the terms of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>So much then for the criticisms which have been made of the Single Act.  It is <Col N="1912" /> most interesting and instructive that not one of the main sources and inspirers of these criticisms has attempted to refute or answer the clear and detailed explanations of the provisions of the Single Act contained in the Government's Explanatory Guide and the inevitable conclusions drawn in the guide that the Single Act, far from threatening this country's interests, will serve to promote them.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by The Workers' Party to the motion approving the terms of the Single Act calls for the renegotiating of its terms, so also does that party's proposed amendment on Second Stage of the Bill.  Let me make it quite clear that there is no question whatsoever of renegotiating the terms of the Single Act.  It is neither possible, nor is it necessary.  Ireland participated fully in the Intergovernmental Conference which resulted in the signing of the Single Act.  Indeed, as I have pointed out earlier in my speech, we took a forward position in calling for the convening of the conference. During the negotiations we participated fully.  We put forward ideas and proposals of our own, we supported as appropriate proposals put forward by others and we also, again as appropriate, suggested amendments to proposals tabled.  At all times the Government were concerned, not only that the outcome to the negotitions would be beneficial for the strengthening and further development of the Community, but also, of course, that our interests were fully protected. The Single Act very much represents what we wished to see achieved.</P>
    <P>We have, since we acceded to the Community, joined with our partners on the path towards closer integration, a path which is very much in our interests and which the Irish people have chosen overwhelmingly to be on.  The question today is whether to make further prudent progress along that path or whether we turn around and go back.  The Irish people, reflecting both common sense and imagination, have chosen Europe.  There have always been those who questioned that choice but, I have no doubt, <Col N="1913" /> however, that the broad consensus in favour of our commitment to the Community remains.</P>
    <P>Claims have been made that the question of whether we join our partners in the Community in ratifying the Single European Act is somehow of little importance.  It is suggested that if we did not ratify the Single Act things would continue more or less as before.  This is quite simply not true.  The fact of the matter is that the Single Act cannot take effect until it has been ratified by all of the member states.  If Ireland were to prevent or to delay the coming into effect of the Single Act it would have a long term and probably irretrievably damaging effect on our position, our standing and our influence in the European Community. The Government are determined that Ireland should, in common with all of its Community partners, honour the commitment to ratify the Single Act by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, asking today for the support of the House for ratification of the Single Act.  I do so in the certainty that the Single Act not only protects our interests but will serve to promote them. I do so in the belief that it will enable the Community better to overcome the challenges which confront it and I do so in the confidence that the contributions made by Deputies in this debate and the vote which concludes it will reflect both the aspirations and the fundamental interests of the Irish people.  There is nothing to fear from the Single Act. There is much to lose by rejecting it, there is much to gain by associating ourselves fully and wholeheartedly with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dishonest and misleading for the Taoiseach, Government Ministers or anyone else to attempt to put the ratification of this Single European Act across as something of great benefit to the people of this country because that is not, in fact, the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the Single European Act, Dáil Éireann and the Irish people are faced with a very troublesome and difficult decision.  There are clearly from <Col N="1914" /> Ireland's point of view many things involved that are not for our benefit or that will not be advantageous to us as a small member state on the periphery of the community.  If we had any great freedom of choice I do not think that we would opt for this particular instrument as a means of developing and improving the Community.  It weakens our position and it contains inherent dangers and only time will show whether they materialise or not.  The alternative, however, of not ratifying the treaty and not accepting the changes is one which would have even more serious implications for us.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, now that we have arrived at the ratification stage, to reverse what was agreed during the negotiations. What we must try and do now is preserve what we can in the new situation into which this Government have walked us. Again and again in the last few years this Government have taken the easy way out, deciding not to be difficult but to go along with the popular view.  In the cosy diplomatic club of which they are grateful and accommodating members, they adopt a low profile and permit our national interests to be submerged, rather than be seen to be awkward or difficult.</P>
    <P>That we are now faced with this agonising dilemma is entirely the responsibility of this present Coalition Government.  They cannot resort to their favourite trick of trying to blame somebody else.  The damage was actually done by their neglect and ineffectiveness some way back along the line, though we are only facing the consequences now.  Our position should have been defined and protected during the proceedings of the Dooge Committee and in the negotiations that took place subsequent to the publication of that report.  It was at that stage that Ireland lost out because of the unwillingness and the failure of this Government to stand firm and reserve our position in the areas of vital concern to us.  They failed to do that and have thereby been guilty of a grave dereliction of their duty to the people of this nation.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to membership of the European Community cannot be questioned by anyone.  Fianna Fáil <Col N="1915" /> brought Ireland into the Community after a long period of preparation and negotiation.  Both in Opposition and in Government Fianna Fáil have been totally committed to and active in developing Ireland's membership.  We went into Europe with a massive majority of the Irish voters &mdash; 83 per cent &mdash; as clear a majority as it is possible to obtain in a democratic society.</P>
    <P>At no stage since has membership itself ever been placed in question.  Our situation contrasts favourably with other member countries, where major parties have at one time or another been committed to withdrawal.</P>
    <P>Britain has renegotiated her membership twice, Greece once and France absented herself from the Council table for a long period.  The debate on this Act, therefore, must be seen in the context of our complete commitment to the principle of community membership.</P>
    <P>It was particularly inappropriate and irresponsible for the Taoiseach and Government Ministers to attempt to downgrade our membership and denigrate the quality of our commitment to the community.  They sought to reduce our membership to the lowest possible begging-bowl level.  The Taoiseach tried bogeyman tactics; tried to silence debate and tried to frighten us into believing that we dare not raise legitimate questions about the impact or the implications for Ireland of the Single European Act. There is deep resentment in many quarters at the attempts made by the Taoiseach and by members of this Government to bulldoze the Single European Act through in this way and to suggest that if we did not accept it immediately and without question all sorts of benefits would be withdrawn.  Let it be clearly understood that any benefits and indeed disadvantages that accrue to this country from membership of the Community arise from the operation of Community policy and not on the basis of gratuitous handouts.  Questions have been raised about the Act in other member states without any question <Col N="1916" /> being made that their membership was somehow in question.</P>
    <P>Are the Government really saying that if the Germans or the French have some genuine political difficulty with some aspect of this Act, questions would arise about withholding of Community benefits from them or from the Danes whose Parliament actually rejected this Act?  Is the Government in effect saying that there is a two-tier Community already &mdash; those who have the right to do and say as they please, and smaller states like Ireland that just have to take what they are given and keep quiet?</P>
    <P>The Community, as we have sometimes discovered to our cost, is a tough place, where every member state must argue its corner if it is not to be ignored or brushed aside.  Bargaining and negotiation are basic to the Community and the way it conducts its business.  Let us recall that other member states have adopted positions that we have scarcely even contemplated. Britain held up Community business for about three years over her budget contributions.  Italy has imposed temporary import charges on goods coming from other Community countries. Germany has employed the veto while arguing for its abolition.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach tried to treat the Irish people and Dáil Éireann in a very offhand manner by adopting the attitude that our only function was to ratify mechanically whatever it is the Government have agreed to.  Why does the Constitution demand that all international agreements must be ratified by Dáil Éireann if the ratification procedure is to be a mere automatic rubber stamp and if Dáil Éireann is not allowed to debate meaningfully this and other important international agreements?  We are quite entitled to debate this issue and to demand any additional safeguards or reservations that may be required.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have already compelled the Government to produce, if very reluctantly, the equivalent to a White Paper on the Single European Act.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs claimed that such a document was unnecessary, pointing by way of excuse, to a few pages in the twice <Col N="1917" /> yearly Report on Developments in the European Communities which provided only a list of contents of the Single European Act.  The booklet produced under pressure from us does not answer all the questions but at least its publication made the Government attempt to face up to some of the doubts and arguments.</P>
    <P>The Government have now belatedly decided to put down a motion which asks the Dáil to reaffirm our neutrality.  But surely that is precisely what Fianna Fáil are seeking in our declaration?  The Government should now have no difficulty acceding to our proposal.  If Dáil Éireann explicitly declares that we adhere to our policy of neutrality, as requested by the Government, then it is a natural and logical extension of the process to attach that declaration to the Single European Act and bring it specifically to the attention of the other signatories. It is not sensible for Dáil Éireann to make such a declaration and not let the other signatories of the Single European Act know about it.</P>
    <P>We have doubts and fears about aspects of this Act.  They arise in the context of our commitment to Europe and they are legitimate.  It is foolish to ignore the disadvantages for Ireland that will arise from the changes that the Single European Act will bring.  The days of starry-eyed enthusiasm are long gone. For some time now it has been a question of realistically measuring the balance of advantages and disadvantages of membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>I would like, at the outset, to deal with the constitutional issue because in a sense it hangs over the entire ratification process like a cloud and introduces a major element of uncertainty to the whole procedure. It is very likely to lead to serious difficulties in the future.  It will immediately, in a number of areas, give rise to doubt and uncertainty.  The Dáil must look very carefully into this issue and satisfy itself, if it can, that the assurances it is being offered by the Government are satisfactory.  It is however, the Government's responsibility to decide whether a referendum is necessary.  It is they who must accept the outcome of that decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> This Bill proposes to incorporate into Irish domestic law those parts of the Single European Act which change in a major way the original Treaties which established the Community.  That was the procedure incorporated in our domestic law followed in the case of the original Treaties when we joined.  But the 1972 referendum and the Article it inserted in the Constitution ensured that as part of our domestic law, the treaties could not even be challenged as being unconstitutional. The question we now have to face is whether this new Treaty, when it is incorporated into our law, will also be above constitutional challenge.  If it is not, then it is only a matter of time until some person or corporation affected by its provisions will challenge it in our courts.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to confer new law-making powers on the Council of Ministers. The Council would be empowered to establish a new court with jurisdiction to hear and determine in the first instance certain classes of action and proceedings in Community law.</P>
    <P>Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution vests the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State in the Oireachtas. Article 34.1 of the Constitution provides that justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by the Constitution.  If there were nothing else involved then this legislation would clearly be repugnant to both those Articles.  But of course there is the other factor, which is the change made in our Constitution by the referendum of 1972. That referendum inserted a new provision in the Constitution, namely Article 29.4.3 which authorises our membership of the Communities and goes on to declare:</P>
    <P>...No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or <Col N="1919" /> measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions, thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>The terms of that paragraph are wide but the question is: are they wide enough to cover what is actually a new Treaty?  Is ratifying this new Treaty something which is &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of membership&rdquo;?  In the explanatory guide the Government express the opinion that the incorporation of this new Treaty into our law by this legislation, comes within the terms of Article 29.4.3 because this new Treaty is an obligation of membership of the Communities as it contains limited amendments of the Treaties by the common agreement of members states.  In this regard the explanatory guide refers to Article 236 of the EC Treaty and the corresponding Articles of the other Community Treaties which expressly envisage the possibility that the Treaties may be amended and establish procedures for that purpose. However, unlike previous amending Treaties, the Single European Act before us, in its text does not refer at all to Article 236 of the EC Treaty or the corresponding Articles of the other Community Treaties.</P>
    <P>In the absence of an authoritative interpretation by the Supreme Court of Article 29.4.3 it is difficult to assess whether the opinion of the Government is correct.  Given that this Article may infringe the citizen's right to invoke the fundamental rights guaranteed by other provisions of the Constitution the courts may take a strict view of what is meant by &ldquo;obligations necessitated by membership of the Communities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A finding of unconstitutionality after the enactment of this legislation would have serious consequences for this State. The State would be in breach of international obligations.  An embarrassing conflict would arise between the Irish courts and the European Court of Justice which is obliged to ensure the uniformity of Community law in all the member states.  In these circumstances the question must be very seriously posed if it is <Col N="1920" /> wise for the Government to proceed with this Bill without putting the matter beyond doubt by way of referendum.  The Government are apparently prepared to take that chance.  That is their decision, but it is a very casual attitude to adopt on a matter of very great importance and significance.  Surely a far better and wiser course would have been to hold a referendum earlier this year and put the matter beyond doubt or challenge.</P>
    <P>Many people are deeply concerned about the implications of the Single European Act for the protection of the fundamental rights recognised in the Irish Constitution.  A clear case has been made, and the Government have not answered it.</P>
    <P>These fundamental rights are enunciated in Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution. These articles cover personal rights, the family, education, property and religion.  The common preamble to the Single European Act refers for the first time to the fundamental rights recognised in the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms under the auspices of the Council of Europe.  It is argued that the Single European Act can, therefore, be taken to authorise the European Court of Justice to regard the Human Rights Convention as providing that court with the principles to which it should adhere in the field of fundamental rights.  While Community law overrides not merely domestic law but the Constitution as well and has the force of law, the Human Rights Convention does not have direct force of law in Ireland at present.</P>
    <P>The argument is that the fundamental rights set out in the Convention where they are in conflict with the fundamental rights laid down in Articles 40-44 of the Irish Constitution may well prevail.  This would mean in theory at least that the European Court of Justice could overturn fundamental rights as enshrined in the Irish Constitution in favour of principles set out in the European Convention.  The Government fail to deal definitely or satisfactorily with that issue in the explanatory guide.  There is a case to be <Col N="1921" /> answered so that the Oireachtas can decide whether an appropriate amendment is needed to the Bill or to the instrument of ratification.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are concerned, and this concern is widely shared, about the changes in the institutions of the Community proposed by the Single Act.  The influence which we can exert as a member state depends on a proper balance being maintained between the various Community institutions.  It would be in the interests of Ireland, as a member state, to maintain the central position of a unanimous Council of Ministers in Community decision-making.  In that Council, Ireland has the same representation as any other member state.  Our Minister as a member of the Council of Minister is responsible to Dáil Éireann &mdash; our member of the Commission is not.  Political and legal requirements of unanimity on the Council of Minister permit small member states like us to protect their essential interests in the Community through that Council.  The proposed changes in the procedures of the Council of Ministers which permit voting by qualified majority rather than by unanimity of certain matter covered by the Treaty, without doubt are to our disadvantage and put us in a position where we will certainly not be able to defend our interests from as strong a base as we can now do.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to establish a new co-operation procedure between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  The explanatory guide concedes that this co-operation procedure offers scope to the Parliament to increase its influence.  One may question whether this rather cumbersome co-operation procedure will contribute to the efficient disposal of Community business.  Again this must diminish our position.  No matter how able our parliamentary representatives may be in the European Parliament, their relatively small number will militate against their having a very significant role to play in what has become a consumer-interest parliament.</P>
    <P>The Single Act proposes to permit a more extensive delegation of power by <Col N="1922" /> the Council of Ministers to the Commission. Article Ten of the Single European Act states that the Council shall confer on the Commission powers for the implementation of the rules which the Council lays down.</P>
    <P>It is clearly the intention, particularly in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy, to delegate increased management powers to the Commission.  This is an important shift in the power mechanisms of the Community which can hardly be to our advantage especially where our agricultural interests are concerned. The Commission has a wide range of responsibilities and priorities which are totally different from the very special function of the Council of Agricultural Ministers.  The Commission is increasingly concerned about the budget and its preoccupation is with monetary budgetary constraints and constrictions. Agricultural Ministers meeting in Council on the other hand have clear responsibility to their national parliaments to secure and protect the interests of their farming sectors.  The change here is significant and must be fully appreciated and understood.</P>
    <P>Given the vital part agriculture plays in the Irish economy, we must be concerned that increased powers to the Commission may be exercised to cut off essential supports to farmers with no debate or even notice.  The 14th report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on the Spinelli Draft Treaty which established a European Union stated that increased powers for the European Parliament and the phasing out of the national veto were areas of particular difficulty for Ireland.</P>
    <P>We signalled well in advance our serious concern about the wording of Title III of the Single European Act in relation to political co-operation.  That concern was expressed before the draft took final shape in a series of debates going back to the summer of 1985.  It will be recalled that I directed the attention of this House to the implications of the Dooge report, the Franco-German drafts and then the Single European Act.  The Government, as usual, paid no attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1923" /> The first sentences of Articles 6 (a) and 6 (b) of Title III can certainly be interpreted as posing a challenge to our neutrality.  These state first that &ldquo;The High Contracting Parties consider that closer co-operation on question of European Security would contribute in an essential way to the development of a European identity in external policy matters&rdquo;, &ldquo;The High Contracting Parties are determined to maintain the technological and industrial conditions necessary for their security&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government's claim that the Single European Act protects and recognises Irish neutrality for the first time cannot be sustained.  On the contrary, it commits us to a position of closer co-operation on questions of European Security, and that term &ldquo;Security&rdquo; is unqualified in any way and presumably is used in the same manner as in Clause 6c where there is reference to closer co-operation in the field of security within the WEU and NATO.  It seems likely that there will be increased pressure on us in the future to co-ordinate on all aspects of security including the military ones.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the European Council in London last weekend is a vivid illustration of the pressures that are likely to arise in future.  That European Council attempted to draft a statement on behalf of the Community referring explicitly to the Western Alliance and no matter what the Taoiseach may have said or done, it was nonetheless incorporated into the Presidency notes.</P>
    <P>Of course, European leaders assembled at the European Council can informally discuss any matter they choose.  There are, for example, bilateral Anglo-Irish meetings on matters in which the Community does not have competence. The crucial requirement however is that they should not involve Ireland in any statements they may wish to make about NATO matters.  Unfortunately, there is a persistent and worrying tendency to try to blur the distinction between the Community and the Western Alliance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1924" /> Thus, last weekend once again there was an attempt to include a statement covering military aspects of security. What in fact was involved was a hybrid statement, the first three paragraphs were on behalf of the European Council as a whole and the last paragraph was to be on behalf of the Heads of State and Governments who are members of the Western Alliance.  The whole statement was to have been presented as a European Council statement, even though the last paragraph only committed the eleven.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has repeatedly claimed that military aspects of security are excluded from the practice of European political co-operation.  How can that be reconciled with the proposed statement of the European Council which deals explicitly with arms control and nuclear weapons, and solidarity within the Alliance?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Fine Gael and Labour Minister have misled the public, and misrepresented the Single European Act by claiming that military aspects of security are specifically or categorically excluded.  They are not and all that can be said is that they are not specifically included.  It should be noted that a British spokesman was able to argue last weekend that it is &ldquo;just not possible to distinguish the military from the political aspects of security&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Article 6c says that &ldquo;Nothing in this Title shall impede closer co-operation in the field of security between certain of the High Contracting Parties within the framework of the Western European Union or the Atlantic Alliance&rdquo;.  The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office interpret this in a manner that is not reassuring either.  The British Foreign Office states: &ldquo;The third paragraph establishes clearly that close co-ordination among the Twelve is not intended to cut across the work of either the Atlantic Alliance or of WEU&rdquo;.  In other words, in the British view, the Twelve are precluded from taking any position through the Community that cuts across NATO. If this interpretation were correct it <Col N="1925" /> would introduce an entirely new and unacceptable principle into European political co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that once this Act is ratified Ireland will be under acute pressure to go some further distance.  Our partners, many of them unconcerned with the minutiae of the Single European Act, will take the view that they can now discuss and issue statements on all aspects of security, including defence if they so wish, on behalf of the Community, whether or not Ireland subscribes to them.</P>
    <P>On each occasion there is an inching forward, and the stage reached is used as a springboard to go further.  We have now reached the situation where we can and must go no further.  We have reached, perhaps gone beyond, what is strictly compatible with Irish neutrality.  It is absolutely incumbent on us to make clear to our partners at this stage that Irish neutrality is going to be maintained, and that we will not allow any further erosion of it.</P>
    <P>The declaration that Fianna Fáil have proposed is a statement of position, a statement of intent that Title III does not and cannot affect our long-established policy of neutrality.  The declaration makes it explicit that the co-ordination of positions does not include as far as we are concerned the military aspects of security or procurement for such purposes, and does not affect Ireland's capacity to act or refrain from acting in any way affecting our status of neutrality. That is how we propose to interpret the ambiguous language of Article 6.</P>
    <P>Let me point out that the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee adopted the same position as Fianna Fáil, when they called on the Government to append a formal reiteration of our position of military neutrality to the act of ratification. The Government should respect and respond to the view of that all-party committee and agree to our motion, which exactly expresses the wishes of the committee.</P>
    <P>The insertion of our declaration is not an issue of confidence in the Government, but it is in the national interest, <Col N="1926" /> that Ireland's position be clearly understood. We should avail of this process of ratification to signal that we are prepared to make a stand on the matter, and are not going to be pushed further and further along the road that leads directly into membership of NATO.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed nor would any Member of the House be terribly impressed with the reason the Minister has just given for not adopting our declaration. The Government are doing no more than saying that if we put in this declaration it would introduce an element of conditionality into our ratification of the Act.  Surely that does not stand up. A multitude of declarations have already been made by other signatories.  Does the Minister for Foreign Affairs suggest that those other declarations by other signatories introduce an element of conditionality? The Danes put in a very specific political declaration about their ability to engage in Nordic co-operation. Does the Minister's argument apply to that declaration?  The Minister cannot legitimately maintain that because we wish to add another declaration to the many declarations that are already there we are introducing any possible element of conditionality into our ratification.  The other point the Minister seemed to be making in his speech was that the insertion of this declaration would not take note of what was already in the Act in satisfaction of our wishes in regard to neutrality.  That is not a persuasive argument either.  What may or may not be in the Act about neutrality is certainly open to different interpretation but surely that should not inhibit us or prevent us from making it absolutely crystal clear by way of the declaration which we propose to introduce.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are satisfied that the declaration which we are seeking to have annexed to the instrument of ratification is in accordance with the established principles of international law.  Customary international law permits a State to make an interpretative declaration on one or more of the provisions of a treaty at the time of ratification.  An authority in international law for this practice may be <Col N="1927" /> found in the advisory opinion in the International Court of Justice on the Reservations to Genocide Convention, ICJ Reports (1951) 15.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the International Court of Justice such declarations are admissible where the declaration is compatible with the object and purpose of the treaty in question.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Government will not attempt to argue that the declaration of our position either on the economy or in respect of military neutrality is not compatible with the terms of the Single Act.  Many instances can be cited in recent State practice where such declarations have been made on the ratification of a treaty.  In 1972 the Republic of Austria included a declaration with the instrument of ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the Republic of Italy made a declaration on the deposit on the instrument of ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</P>
    <P>Although Ireland has not ratified the Vienna Convention and the law of Treaties, jurists have cited the provisions of this convention as evidence of international law.  Article 19 of the Vienna Convention permits a state in signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty to formulate a reservation unless the reservation is prohibited by the treaty or the treaty provides that only specified reservations which do not include the reservation in question may be made or the reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.</P>
    <P>The Single Act does not prohibit reservations or permit only specified reservations. The declaration we propose, therefore, is clearly compatible with the object and purposes of the Single Act. The declaration deals, first, with our economic development needs and recites the terms of Protocol 30 of the Act of Accession of Ireland to the European Communities.  Our declaration simply reiterates the existing principles which govern our economic relationship with <Col N="1928" /> the Community and our special situation which was recognised at the time of our accession and which is enshrined in Protocol 30 attaching to the Treaties.  As such, it is of course compatible with the object and purposes of the Single Act.</P>
    <P>The declaration goes on to state that the provisions of Title III do not affect Ireland's long established policy of military neutrality and that co-ordination of positions on the political and economic aspects of security does not include the military aspects of security or procurement for such purposes and does not affect Ireland's capacity to act or refrain from acting in a way which might affect Ireland's international status of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>I argue that the inclusion or annexation of this declaration to our instrument of ratification is absolutely in accordance with normal practice of international law. I mention that because the Department of Foreign Affairs, apparently in an excess of zeal when we first published our declaration, rushed out hurriedly with a statement that such a declaration would not be in accordance with good international practice.  There is absolutely no reason, as we understand it and as we are advised, in international law why this Dáil should not annex this declaration to the instrument of ratification.  I do not think the Minister in his speech attempted to suggest that we would in any way be in breach of normal practice by inserting or annexing this declaration to our instrument of ratification.</P>
    <P>Government spokesmen have argued that there is an implicit recognition of Irish neutrality in the provisions of Title III of the Single Act.  I do not think there is but whether there is or not it is clearly necessary and desirable in view of the fundamental importance of this policy issue from our point of view, to have an explicit reiteration of our long established policy of military neutrality included by way of declaration as other countries have done in regard to matters of special importance to them.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Danish Government annexed a declaration to the final Act which stated that conclusion of Title <Col N="1929" /> III and European political co-operation in this sphere of foreign policy would not affect Denmark's participation in Nordic co-operation.  That is a very clear political declaration and it is also clear that it is not incompatible with the objects and purposes of Title III of the Single Act.</P>
    <P>We reject any suggestion that other member states might refuse to accept our declaration.  There are no grounds for such doubts.  Article 20 of the Vienna Convention states that when it appears from the limited number of the negotiating states and the object and purpose of a treaty that the application of the treaty in its entirety between all the parties is an essential condition of the consent of each one to be bound by the treaty, a reservation requires acceptance by all the parties.  It is difficult to understand how the other member states could refuse to accept this declaration when a substantial number of similar declarations were made by the Governments of member states on the signature of the Single Act.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I cannot see from any direction what objection the Government have to our amendment and to the annexation of the declaration we have proposed to the instrument of ratification.  As I have said, it is entirely in accordance with international law to annex a declaration of this kind which is compatible with the purposes of the treaty, with the instrument of ratification.  Our declaration is not incompatible with the terms and objectives of the Treaties.  The Government are asking Dáil Éireann to confirm what in effect are the essential elements of our declaration.  Therefore, I cannot understand why the Government will not accept our amendment and our declaration. If their only remaining argument is that it is not necessary to make this declaration, surely that is not valid? Whether it is necessary or not, can there be any objection to inserting a declaration for the benefit of those who may think something of this kind is necessary?</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to the House that Fianna Fáil are fully conscious of the many benefits that membership of the Community has brought.  The Minister <Col N="1930" /> has elaborated on a number of them.  At political level membership of the Community brought a valuable new dimension to our national life making us more outward looking, conscious of our European heritage and establishing a whole range of new relationships, contacts and experiences.  A new confidence became part of our political and economic life when we joined.  It is quite reasonable to argue that while in a strictly legal sense we sacrificed some element of national sovereignty on becoming a member it is also true that politically we have enhanced our independence and sovereignty through our active membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>Community membership has also had a major impact on the structure of our economy.  During the late seventies and early eighties particularly, the pace of industrialisation was quickened.  New high technology industries have been established in all parts of Ireland and for two or three years our growth rate and level of investment were the highest in Europe.  The exports from these industries have done something towards sustaining the economy through the long recession we have been experiencing.</P>
    <P>Our agriculture has been transformed by Community membership.  The standard of living of farmers has steadily improved, at least until recently.  Even though the CAP is now coming under severe pressure the basic support systems it provides are indispensable to our agricultural industry.  For instance, we have had the headage payments scheme, a common policy for sheep, and a western package to assist farmers in some of the least developed parts of the country.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it can be argued that insufficient attention was paid to the fisheries question during the negotiations. A major programme for the development of our marine resources is now an urgent national priority and an initiative scheme could be undertaken to secure full Community backing for such a programme.</P>
    <P>In the past 13 years Ireland has undertaken major infrastructural investment, some of it funded by the EC.  The EC has <Col N="1931" /> acted also as a spur to improve our range and telecommunications system.  The Social Fund, from which we have substantially benefited, has helped greatly with the training of our young people. The research policy of the Community has given valuable contracts to scientists working in our universities and other research bodies.</P>
    <P>The European Community has undeniably had also a positive impact on raising both our industrial standards while on the whole the pressure to improve our environmental standards has been helpful as has been the full impact of the EC on social legislation, for example, in the area of the protection of workers.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in this debate for me to explore the complexities of the monetary area and the relative merits of membership of the EMS and a fixed link with sterling.  It is, however, necessary to say that for whatever reason we have not fully availed of the opportunity in the financial area that membership of the EMS at least in theory opened up for us.</P>
    <P>Let us, therefore, acknowledge the positive aspects but admit the existence of negative ones as well.  After 13 years of EC membership we have massive unemployment and a resumption of emigration on the scale of the 1950s.  Unemployment is now four times what it was when we entered the EC.  Membership may not be, probably is not, the cause of the present level of unemployment and emigration, but what we can say is that membership did not prevent it happening.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, many traditional industries and even industries that came here in the fifties and sixties have closed down, as a result both of competition from within the EC and the constant pressure of the liberalisation policies pursued by the EC with third countries.  It is, I believe, an indictment of the EC that unemployment has been allowed to rise to such a devastating level, not merely in Ireland but in other countries as well, without any serious effort being made to combat it.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, monetarist objectives <Col N="1932" /> have been given clear precedence over jobs.  Partly as a result, about 16 million people are now unemployed throughout the Community.  Here in Ireland we have an unemployment rate of close to 240,000, with emigration at over 30,000 a year.  This was certainly not a situation that we expected to find ourselves in, 13 years after joining the Community.</P>
    <P>Our farmer's <i>per capita</i> incomes have fallen below the 1983 level in real terms. Whatever is happening to the hundreds of millions of receipts from the CAP, they are not even succeeding in sustaining a steady level of farm income.</P>
    <P>The latest census figures show an increasing flight from the land.  There are 100,000 or one-third fewer people working on the land than there were when we joined the EC.  This accelerating flight from the land, despite conditions of high unemployment, is contrary to one of the main principles of the CAP; a fair standard of living is not being ensured for Irish farmers, and their individual real earnings are decreasing, not increasing. It is important to make that point when Government Ministers and commentators tell us about all the great benefits we have received from the Community and keep repeating the figures of the transfers of money from the Community to this country.  There are two sides to the whole process of our developing membership.</P>
    <P>A study carried out by the NESC in 1981 showed that in the first seven years of Community membership when, in comparison with the present depression Ireland was actually progressing, no progress of any kind had really been made in closing the gap between the poorer and the richer member states.</P>
    <P>It is time another study was carried out now, several years further on.  It would very likely show a marked widening of the gap rather than any catching up.  This represents a failure of the Community to achieve one of its stated aims, which to quote the preamble of the Treaty of Rome was &ldquo;to strengthen the unity of their economies and to ensure their harmonious development by reducing the <Col N="1933" /> differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is either some flaw in the basic concept or the instruments to achieve it are inadequate or there is a plain refusal by the Community, or at least by the richer members, to take it seriously and implement the necessary policies.  What we must do is examine this Single European Act on the basis of whether it purports or is likely to make any worthwhile difference to this major defect in the economic and social life of the Community. That defect is, of course, the continuing growth in disparity between the more favoured and the less favoured regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>No one, of course, can exclude some share of responsibility by ourselves for failing to make as good use as we might have of the opportunities of membership, and I include in that the social partners, Governments, industry, trade unions and farmers.  Some of the gains of membership, especially the windfalls in the years following 1973, were frittered away on immediate consumption rather than trying to build a solid and lasting base for future progress.</P>
    <P>I have long called for the drawing up of a balance sheet of the positive and negative impact of EC policies, so that we can get away once and for all from simplistic slogans about £900 million transfers or begging bowls.  We should also compare our performance with that of other member states.  It is essential that we should have a comprehensive basis from which to argue our case in Brussels.  I regret we do not have such a balance sheet for the purposes of this debate.  Every time we exaggerate the positive effects of EC policies we artificially play down our case in Brussels. The Government should have used this opportunity to conduct a fundamental renegotiation of our position within the Community.  They have not done so, preferring apparently as much for personal kudos as anything else to posture as good Europeans while Ireland's legitimate and urgent case went by default.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1934" /> The background to the Single European Act is well-known.  On the other hand it represented a final effort by the political forces that brought the European Community into being 30 years ago to fulfil the promise of European union. Altiero Spinelli before he died was the moving spirit in the European Parliament. Converging with this, but with very different ideological motivations, were the free marketeers who wanted to complete the internal market without barriers by the early 1990s.  This seems to be the mission of the British member of the Commission, Lord Cockfield.  There are also, generally, but not exclusively, right-wing forces who would dearly wish to see the Community become totally and completely involved in defence matters.</P>
    <P>There is always a difficulty when confronting European agreements and declarations of knowing how literally they are to be taken.  Very far-reaching language in the past has often led to very little, for example the commitment in 1972 to political, economic and monetary union by 1990.  If one were to have believed all one read about the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy or cohesion, convergence and reducing regional disparities, one would have to be very disappointed at the lack of progress.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to note that some of the very committed Europeans are extremely disappointed with the Single European Act and regard it as likely to be largely ineffective.  Judge Pescatore, formerly of the European Court, wrote a scathing analysis of the Act earlier this year, pointing out that there were a large number of loopholes in the clauses concerning the realisaton of the internal market, allowing an increased resort to national protectionism. The judge pointed out that in the monetary area progress is effectively blocked.  In the foreign policy area he noted that &ldquo;for the first time in such a context European security is mentioned, without, however, outlining any commitment whatsoever.  All these erratic formulations only serve unfortunately to demonstrate the political incoherency of Western Europe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1935" /> He said the type of the Act is characterised by grandiloquence and ambiguity, and considered that Governments and the European Parliament were imprudent in the extreme to launch the whole process leading to the Act, as he felt that elements of regression outweighs those of progress.</P>
    <P>A German Professor, Professor Weidenfeld, writing in the semi-official German bulletin <i>Foreign Affairs</i> is of a similar opinion.  He points out that the increase in qualified majority voting is balanced out by a wide range of exceptions and concludes: &ldquo;It would thus be wrong to speak of a far-reaching correction of the decision-making procedure. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether the onus of completing the internal market by 1992 should be taken more seriously than previous commitments and deadlines, which the European Community set itself &mdash; and rarely abided by: and, as a matter of piquancy this includes the internal market itself&rdquo;.  He points out that Britain and Greece went along with the Intergovernmental Conference but acted as brakes, and that &ldquo;Denmark formulated its rejection of the prospect of a political union with downright brutality&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this country debate was concentrated more on possible far-reaching effects of the Act rather than fears about its inadequacies, but it is as well to be aware of those other views to help put the Single European Act in perspective, particularly as the Minister seems to wax quite lyrical about it, its potential and its benefits.  We, too, are concerned about inadequacies in the Act in some areas and I would now like to outline in some detail what our principal concerns are.</P>
    <P>One of the stated purposes of this new Act is to enable the Community to perform more effectively.  There is general concern that the Community's economic performance is falling behind not only that of the United States and Japan, but even of smaller European countries outside the EC, such as Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden.  The prescription for this, as contained in the <Col N="1936" /> Single European Act, is nothing more than the completion of the internal markets, in other words, the removal of all the various barriers to trade which still remain.  I think something more than that is required to re-launch the economy of the Community.</P>
    <P>Theoretically, we should be in a position to benefit from the removal of non-tariff barriers to trade.  Whether we will in practice benefit more than we will lose from these changes depends on many factors, including our own ability to cope with the greatly intensified competition which we can anticipate from partners much more favourably situated than we are.</P>
    <P>We must have misgivings about the completion of the Common Market.  Our economy in its present weakened and depressed state is vulnerable to competition, especially unrestricted competition from powerful cartels in Europe. The Single European Act offers no special safeguards, even of a transitional kind.  Many supporters of the completion of the internal market forces foresee difficulties for some countries and regions. The Act itself speaks of &ldquo;the extent of the effort that certain economies showing differences in development will have to sustain during the period of the establishment of the internal market&rdquo;.  That is as clear an admission as any that the process will be easier for the more developed central economies than for the less developed ones.  A starker way of putting it is that on its own, completion of the internal market could actually aggravate or accentuate disparities between different regions of the Community, making, in fact, the rich richer, and the poor poorer.</P>
    <P>This is spelt out somewhat more clearly in Lord Cockfield's Commission Paper on completion of the internal market. This report states that one of the three main objectives is of &ldquo;ensuring that the market is flexible so that resources, both of people and materials, and of capital and investment flow into the areas of greatest economic advantage&rdquo;.  This can hardly be reconciled with the objective of promoting harmonious development <Col N="1937" /> in the Community.  The scenario presented is that economic activity and industry would concentrate in the central areas of the Community &mdash; south east England, northern France, the Benelux countries, Germany and northern Italy. Lord Cockfield goes on to say: &ldquo;We recognise that many of the changes we propose will present considerable difficulties for Member States but the benefits... are so great that they should not be denied to its citizens because of difficulties faced by individual Member States&rdquo;.  Adam Smith could hardly have put it better.</P>
    <P>One of the more disturbing features of the Government's explanatory guide to the Single European Act is that it hardly refers to any difficulties that may be faced by Ireland.  The Government, with the exception of a reference to the insurance industry and some comments about indirect taxation, did not admit to there being any difficulties.  Some of the foreign advocates of the Act are being more realistic about this matter than the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>At a seminar in the summer at the European University in Florence a German professor stated that the realisation of the single market would sometimes imply heavy economic and social costs, with the elimination of weaker firms and a temporary increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>Our question is whether the burden of realising the internal market is going to be borne disproportionately by the least developed countries on the periphery of Europe, such as Ireland.  This Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs are scarcely prepared even to recognise that there may be a potential problem.  If doubts are genuinely expressed from any quarter they are met with supercilious and irrelevant references to our need for all the benefits the Community is supposed to have conferred upon us.</P>
    <P>In one particular area, the harmonisation of indirect taxes, even though it will require unanimity must inevitably give rise to difficulties, and present &ldquo;acutely difficult problems for Ireland&rdquo;. <Col N="1938" /> Article 17 states that &lsquo;The Council shall, acting unanimously... adopt the harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation&rsquo;.  The Government's attitude, quite different from the Commission's again, is that this poses no problem at all for Ireland, as unanimous voting is required.  I must say this shows an astonishingly superficial attitude to a serious commitment that we are supposed to be making.  Having accepted harmonisation in principle, we are hardly going to be allowed to block it indefinitely in practice.  Not only would the harmonisation of indirect taxation involve an estimated loss of £1 billion pounds from our budget, it would make it very difficult to sustain our current tax policies.  Rates on houses and VAT on food and drink would be involved and it would make the maintenance of the 10 per cent rate of corportion tax virtually impossible to sustain.  Nobody doubts, of course, that our indirect taxes are too high and that they ought to be reduced, but the drastic reduction envisaged would leave a huge hole of about £1 billion in the public finances.</P>
    <P>The Ministers of this Government, before their gross mismanagement of the public finances brought us to the present state of deep crisis, were in the habit of preaching about financial and economic independence.  That, of course, was before they sent for the IMF.  It all sounds very hollow now as we contemplate the implications of the completion of the internal market of the Community and harmonisation of taxes.</P>
    <P>The Government do acknowledge that harmonisation would create serious difficulties and could only be envisaged in a situation where there was much greater harmonisation of the level of economic development and transfers of resources on a scale several times larger than at present.  Unfortunately, the Single European Act does not contain any comment of that kind.  A future Irish Government may well find themselves in some considerable difficulty and under a lot of pressure in this area.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely vital and imperative <Col N="1939" /> that Ireland be in a position to retain flexibility in regard to tax incentives, particularly where investment is concerned. The Community recognised that at the time of our accession to the EC, and I think it important politically that member states whenever they open the Single European Act should be reminded of their commitment to support Ireland's industrial development policy as set out in Protocol 30.  For this reason Fianna Fáil have proposed that this vital national interest be put forward now by way of a declaration so that our position and approach are absolutely clear to our partners. Our position on this has also been endorsed by the all-party Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The Government have set great store by Article 23 which relates to economic and social cohesion, pointing out that it writes the Regional Policy into the Treaties. The only commitment under this section is that the Commission shall submit a comprehensive proposal to the Council to clarify and rationalise the tasks of the structural funds so as to increase their efficiency.  There is absolutely no commitment, however, to increase the funds on the part of the Commission, still less of the Council.  No amount of clarification or rationalisation will make all that much difference, if the fund remains strictly limited in size.  Unfortunately, words come cheap and we have had many declarations and communique's all on much the same lines as this part of the Single European Act. Indeed, there is virtually nothing new about it.</P>
    <P>I note moreover that precedence is given in this section to the co-ordination of economic policies, and the belief expressed that this of itself should strengthen cohesion and reduce regional disparities. There is no suggestion anywhere that the Regional Fund is inadequate.  The Government have negotiated badly and ineffectively.  The Taoiseach in London last weekend made empty noises, for <Col N="1940" /> home consumption of course, about the Single European Act having to be balanced with strong measures to help peripheral regions of the EC, like Ireland, cope with the challenge of the removal of all barriers to trade in goods and services. He is too late saying that in London.  That should have been negotiated when the Treaty was being formulated and specific undertakings included in it.</P>
    <P>The strategy behind the Single European Act misses out completely what could be the biggest factor in stimulating European recovery, a concerted effort by EC Governments to tackle unemployment. Instead, what has been experienced over the last few years has been more like a concerted deflation with a correspondingly magnified impact.  An official in the European Investment Bank writing in <i>The Guardian</i> last week explains the state the EC has got itself into &mdash; I quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is in the national interest of each Member State to rein back expenditure while hoping that other Member States will reflate and in this way to achieve export-led growth.  But if every Member State acts in this way trade would not grow, the EEC region would stagnate and all Member States would be left worse off.  This is precisely what has happened.</P>
    <P>He goes on to argue that the EC should reflate led by France, West Germany, Britain and Italy.  I argued that as far back as 1981-82, and I believe the present Taoiseach has on occasion done the same.  I think the Government should point out to their partners that the Act itself does not really indicate any solution to the economic problems of the Community particularly the problem of unemployment, and that it does not diminish in any way the need for a concerted policy approach to this central failure in the economic life of the Community.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Single European Act will naturally concentrate on Ireland's national interests and whether its adoption will contribute to the advancement <Col N="1941" /> or otherwise of those interests in the European Community.  But there is another dimension which should also be kept in mind and that is our international standing and our relationships in the world outside the European Community.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the fact that we do stand very well in that outside world. Over a period of decades we have done a great deal to enhance that status.  In particular, we are respected as a neutral nation and, accordingly, we have been in a position to play an important part in the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations.  By and large, we have taken stands of principle on the important world issues, particularly where human rights are concerned.  All over Africa, and indeed in other parts of the Third World, there is a tradition stretching back for over a century of service given to education and medical care in even the remotest parts of Africa, Asia and South America.</P>
    <P>This is something far flung, widespread and important.  It may not be exactly measurable in economic terms, but that does not detract from its ultimate value. We should be conscious of it and proud of it.  In particular, it is a contribution that we make to a better perception of the European Community in the world, a Community which consists largely of nations with a colonial past.  Our presence can do nothing but good in so far as the relationships of that Community with the outside, and particular the Third World, are concerned.</P>
    <P>The question that must be asked is whether our international status in this regard can be maintained and made consistent with our membership of the new Community that will emerge if and when this Single Act is ratified by all the member states.  There is very good reason to doubt it.  In the new situation all the member states will be required to coordinate their foreign policy to a very considerable extent.  This is not something vague or indefinite.  Looking ahead we can see that it will only be a matter of time until some important issue will arise in some troubled spot around the world about which a majority of the members <Col N="1942" /> of the Community will wish to take a particular attitude.  This attitude may or may not be inspired by their membership of NATO.  At that point our position will come very sharply and clearly into focus. We will have no alternative, whatever our feelings may be, our neutrality may suggest or public opinion may favour, but to act upon the decision of the Community acting through the political co-operation machinery.</P>
    <P>This Single European Act originated and grew out of a mood which had become prevalent throughout the Community in recent years.  There was considerable disappointment about the failure of the Community to develop and to be more successful, to have a greater influence internationally and to become a more powerful economic entity.  As a result of this general air of disillusionment, a commitee was established. During the Irish Presidency the Taoiseach designated Senator Dooge to chair that committee.  It duly reported and the report gave rise to this new treaty, this Single European Act with which we are now confronted.  It is because of the Dooge Committee report that we are now faced with the dilemma of whether to ratify this treaty with all its unfavourable aspects or to choose not to do so with the correspondingly difficult implications that course would involve.</P>
    <P>I think the report of the Dooge Committee was a most unwelcome development from this country's point of view. It was an exercise in escapism.  The European Community is essentially an economic one and should concentrate on its economic and social objectives, seeking to improve the economic situation of all the citizens of the member states, those who live in the peripheral regions as well as those in the prosperous centre.  It has failed to do that.  Any disillusionment or disenchantment with the Community that exists among the people of the Community is because of the simple fact that the Community, as an economic Community, has done badly.  It has not succeeded in keeping up with the rest of the world.  Other small European countries who are not members, like Sweden, <Col N="1943" /> Norway, Austria and Switzerland, have fared far better and survived the ravages of the world recession with much less damage than the member states of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Government propose that Dáil Éireann leave the issue of constitutionality hanging in the air and that we proceed to ratify the Single European Act without reservation of any kind.  We cannot see that in the situation this Government have created there is any alternative to ratifying, even though we fully appreciate all the detrimental implications involved for Ireland in the future. What we are doing however, and we can do no more at this stage, is to ask Dáil Éireann to build into the instrument of ratification a declaration which will seek to have our neutral status internationally and clearly acknowledged in the Community and preserve our original right to the recognition of our special economic needs which is an integral element of our membership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the agitation which this Single European Act has generated, and which was reflected in a large part of Deputy Haughey's speech, relates to its supposed threat to our so-called traditional policy of neutrality.  This phrase has by now acquired a sort of sanctity.  It ranks with what used to be called piously &ldquo;our twin national objectives&rdquo;, although there has never, I think, been a proper objective public debate on this subject. Whenever the phrase is used, although we are not allowed to inspect its credentials, it is usually simply for the purpose of embarrassing political opponents. I am not saying that is the reason Deputy Haughey dwelt so long on it.  I can see there are people who genuinely believe in a policy of neutrality, but I deny that this State can be described as having a traditional policy of neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no traditional policy of neutrality if the English language is to mean anything.  This phrase, in any country but ours, would imply a steady course of conduct over a long period in which the State had consciously abstained from a whole <Col N="1944" /> series of conflicts in which it might very well be become involved.  The truth is quite different.  There was only one moment in the history of the world when it mattered a damn to ourselves, or to anybody else, whether we were going to be neutral, and that was the period of the Second World War, and in particular the years 1940 and 1941.  The decision taken in 1939 by Mr. de Valera's Government, and which was then concurred with by Fine Gael and Labour, was taken by men all of whom could remember very well the First World War which they rightly considered to have been no concern of ours.  They could also remember, because only 17 years had elapsed since the British walked out of Portobello, the Black and Tan period and many of them could remember further back.  That must naturally have heightened their disinclination to become involved in the Second World War on the Allied side.  I understand those things.  I also understand why my party, with the distinguished and the honourable exception of James Dillon, unanimously agreed with the then Fianna Fáil Government that the best interests of the State would be served by remaining neutral.</P>
    <P>In hindsight I am not so sure we can be proud of having stood aside from that struggle.  Many excuses can be made for the parties of those days.  I have just given one or two of them.  Another is that the true dimensions of the Nazi menance in Europe were not understood in 1939 and had not unfolded to their full size and horror at that time.  The exterminations, the nightmares which make one wonder whether they could have happened in Europe at all, date mostly from the middle of the war to the end of the war. When they were spoken of here, although I was only a very small boy as far as I remember they were written off as Allied propaganda.  While there was every excuse and justification for people to say that the Government's policy in those days and the Opposition's policy in supporting them was, in the light of their own time, a correct one, if the Dáil of 1939 could have foreseen that the stand it took then on a particular war which <Col N="1945" /> had then just begun to rage would be interpreted as committing the State for good to a miserable form of neutrality which 50 years later would be taken as forbidding us to enter even a purely defensive alliance with other European democracies, democracies which not only share our values but contribute through the European Community very substantially to our material welfare, Mr. de Valera, Mr. Cosgrave, and other leaders of those days, would have regarded such a development with amazement and contempt. I do not remember Mr. de Valera enunciating a traditional policy of neutrality. That was not his style.  I say that, although my evaluation of his contribution to Ireland is different from that of the gentlemen opposite.  That was not his style, nor was it the style of Willie Cosgrave.  They dealt with problems as and when they arose.  They abstained from the early commitment of the State to policies which had never been discussed or debated in the abstract and could not have been debated in the abstract because every new day represents a new set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>The people nowadays who shout the loudest about our traditional policy of neutrality &mdash; the Irish Left &mdash; are the very people in whose vocabulary the word &ldquo;fascist&rdquo; is the worst term of reproach they can think of.  Nonetheless, by committing themselves to what they call a policy of Irish neutrality &mdash; perhaps they do not realise it &mdash; they are involving themselves in the avowal that if they had been alive and in this House and had any influence on the course of affairs in the period 1939-45 they would not have lifted one finger, even with the benefit of hindsight, to put down the horrors which the Nazi version of fascism wished upon Europe or to rescue our cousins from what they had to endure in those days.  I hope the people who talk and who send circulars to this House about the traditional policy of neutrality are willing to live with that interpretation which logic enforces on us.  If they are not willing to accept that, in other words if they are willing to say that the Second World War was different, then there were the <Col N="1946" /> fascist beasts to deal with and naturally we would have been anxious to play our part in putting down the Nazis, then it means we have not got a traditional policy of neutrality.  It means, and this is a far more rational position to take, that every constellation of political external circumstances in the world we have to face changes like the sky every day or every month.  Everyone is different.  The consideration which seemed valid, and I do not deny that by all appearances they were valid in 1939-45 for our neutrality, do not necessarily apply now.  If the converse is true, then that must be true.</P>
    <P>I would have imagined that the attitude of a State which talks about its traditional policy of neutrality, where the logic of that position requires us to suppose that even with the hindsight of 45 years we would not have lifted a finger to put down the Nazis in central Europe in 1939-45, disqualifies us from being associated with free European peoples at any level.  I would have supposed that kind of attitude must justify them in regarding us as lepers.  But no, we are supposed to be valued members of that Community. How can we be valued members of a Community of free peoples when we proclaimed a traditional policy of neutrality which involves us, even with hindsight, abstaining from the conflict I have just described?</P>
    <P>I consider our neutrality to be an unworthy sham, lacking in generousity towards our friends, towards the people we would be first to call on in the event of aggression or of some national catastrophe overtaking us.  It is ungenerous towards them and, what is more serious, it is lacking in self-respect towards ourselves. Unhappily, it is part of the posturing which comes so easily to us.  It is a very cheap indulgence because we do not spend on our defence forces as the Minister for Defence pointed out a couple of weeks ago although the Left fell on him naturally like a lot of hyenas assuming that he was selling out our neutrality.  He was merely pointing out in the sober way which is native to him that neutrality demands the capacity to protect it.</P>
    <P>I am not an international lawyer but I <Col N="1947" /> believe I am right in saying that the old and traditional rule of international law is that a State can only expect its neutrality to be respected if it is in a position to defend it.  The reason for that is obvious. If there are two belligerents, X and Y, and if it might be an advantage to either of them to possess our territory, the only conditions on which these people who are fighting for their lives can be expected to abstain from standing in our territory is if they can be convinced that we are in a position to deny possession of it to the other belligerent.  It is not a rule of morality; it is a rule of common sense.  It is a rule arising from the consideration that you either kill or be killed in warfare.  You cannot be expected to abstain from making use of somebody else's territory if that person, in a pious posture on his knees, says, we are too holy to get into a defensive alliance but neither will we spend 6p on fitting ourselves to deny access to our territory to all comers.  It may be that in conditions of the late 20th century it is unreasonable to expect the application of that principle in full.  I do not suppose even the Swedes who spend three or four times in terms of proportion of GNP on defence as we do are in a position to be certain of denying their territory to all comers.  That certainly is the traditional rule and our respect for and observance of that rule is only a token one.</P>
    <P>I do not enjoy seeing articles in international journals describing our defence forces as no better than a gendarmerie or a militia.  If that is the objective judgment of people who measure an army not by the standard of training or morale or the quality of the men but by the amount invested in its equipment, I do not enjoy it but I have to accept it.  In other words, we want to have it, as usual, both ways.</P>
    <P>That is another dimension of the lack of self respect which is less serious than the first one, the unwillingness to defend our friends, but it is not a negligible one. Although I dissent radically from the idea that we have a traditional policy of neutrality, and even if we had such a thing I would still dissent from it, I realise that I <Col N="1948" /> am in a small minority in the House.  I am not entirely alone.  I know there are some not only in this party but one or two others who agree, or half agree, with what I am saying.  They have said it themselves from time to time.  Seán Lemass when he was Taoiseach 20 years ago and who was not a man to conceal his thoughts all that carefully &mdash; I respected him for that &mdash; said things that were not too far away from what I am saying now. He did not lacerate his fellow citizens for lack of self respect but he did on occasions say things which implied an inner willingness on his part to take up his part and play his part and, so far as his influence would go, to encourage the country to play its part in defensive arrangements with other states.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that I am not arguing for any particular format in that regard.  I am not arguing for membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, I do not know enough about that group, and I am not a military expert or any other type of expert in that field.  I am not arguing for membership of the Western European Union but I am arguing for us dumping at least this small item of cant and shame and saying, &ldquo;that is a lot of the old foolishness, the old junk, let us get rid of it and be willing in principle in whatever format is financially and militarily possible for us and is reasonable to expect us to accept, to share the defence of this part of the globe of which we get all the benefits&rdquo;.  I am long past military age but I have sons of military age.  I hope I will not be accused of being blood thirsty but I am not trying to encourage the State into a condition where people are going to be involved in war.  I hope I do not need to labour that point.  I need only say that I do not expect that the people of Denmark, Holland or Belgium are any more blood thirsty either.  I do not believe that the average Danish or Dutch socialist is a blood thirsty creature any more than Deputy Quinn or Deputy Mervyn Taylor, or one of the gentlemen on the far side who believe in our traditional policy of neutrality is.  I do not suppose that the Danes or the Dutch are anxious to see their sons march <Col N="1949" /> off to war, to see devastated families and weeping mothers.  They are not anxious to do that.  Yet, in 1939 they thought they could avoid it all by being neutral.  Like ourselves they thought that by declaring neutrality after France and Britain declared war they could avoid involvement in the war.  Bitter experience showed them otherwise.</P>
    <P>All those small countries started off neutral and it was only the big guys who got into the Second World War voluntarily. The Danes, the Dutch, the Belgians, the Norwegians, the Yugoslavs and the Greeks were neutral but they were not able to get away with it because their geographical position denied them the possibility of staying neutral during the war.  The Spaniards and the Portuguese were a bit luckier.  The Swedes were a bit luckier although the Swedes did collaborate in a way that the wretched Irish never would have been forgiven by the British for doing.  We have to put up with enough old nonsense from them as it is about our neutrality in any shape or form.  Those unlucky countries learned their lesson and when the war was over, even though they were no more blood thirsty in 1945, 1946, or 1950 than they had been in 1939, they saw that the days of isolation and neutrality for small countries which everybody else would respect were over.  They voluntarily collaborated in a defensive alliance and so, naturally, did the French and Italians and the West Germans.  I put emphasis on the smaller countries, the ones that are not able to defend themselves because they too wanted to stay neutral but had learned their lesson.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey a short time ago &mdash; apart from his general thesis in this regard I must contest this point particularly &mdash; advanced our neutrality, perhaps inadvertently, as the basis for our participation in peacekeeping operations under the aegis of the United Nations. That is one of the more pitiable of the corollary myths attached to our policy of neutrality, the idea that it gives us a standing in the world which otherwise we would not have.  Does anybody seriously think that a message or a note or a posture <Col N="1950" /> struck by the Irish Government is going to deflect the bigger powers in the world by one inch from what they intend doing? They are people who are not blood thirsty either and I make the same assumption I made about the Danes and the Dutch about the British, the Russians, the Americans and the French.  They do not want their homes and their countries devastated but they most certainly do not pay any attention to a leprechaun sitting on a fence bleating about how his knowledge of the world is superior to theirs and how he has an insight into the value of peace and values of a transcendent kind which if given two minutes to explain will make them climb down from their projects of nuclear expansion or rearmament. That is a shaming illusion.  They do not take a blind bit of notice of what this country says.</P>
    <P>With regard to the peacekeeping force Deputy Haughey spoke of I should like to know how it is, if it is a condition of being a member of a peacekeeping force that one's State be neutral, that in the peacekeeping force in the Lebanon there have been very substantial French, Italian and Dutch contingents.  Undoubtedly, the Canadians, the Danes and the Norwegians have been in other countries as part of peacekeeping contingents. Those states are either members of NATO or, as in the case of France, while not being members of it are for practical purposes a part of a Western defencive alliance.  I cannot see that there is anything in this policy for us except contempt from others.  We can play our part in trying to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons and in trying to encourage a peaceful solution of disputes and earn more respect from the outside world by being ready in the first place also to defend the people we would be expecting to defend or help us.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, as an opponent of what is called our traditional policy of neutrality that I approach this Single European Act.  Since I have certified myself as being as an opponent of this so-called traditional policy of neutrality I hope I will be believed when I say that although I wish the Act did commit us to some kind of defensive co-operation with the <Col N="1951" /> other free nations of western Europe I cannot see one line of the Act which does.  I cannot see one line of it which tends one inch in that direction.  One can split hairs and go in for political theology until one is black in the face about how it is hard to separate political co-operation or military co-operation and how one thing leads to another, we know that as part of life, but so far as my reading of this goes there is not one line which commits us to any military dimension of co-operation.  I wish there was but there is not.</P>
    <P>The reference to political co-operation seems to me to be without military dimension.  That comes through explicitly in the provision which allows what it calls, certain of the high contracting parties, i.e. the European Community member states, but not the Community as a collectivity, or all the member states together, to have closer co-operation on security matters within the framework of the Western European Union or the Atlantic Alliance.  That perfectly plain provision &mdash; it seems plain to me &mdash; was misrepresented, and I hope not deliberately so, in a document from the Irish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which sights this provision leaving out, however, the vital words, &ldquo;certain of the high contracting parties&rdquo;.  Here is the passage from the tract I got from the Irish CND in October:</P>
    <P>Finally, the fact that the Single European Act states specifically that nothing in it shall inhibit closer co-operation within the framework of the Western European Union or the Atlantic Alliance, gives implicit recognition to the validity of the NATO block by the European Communities...</P>
    <P>There is no word about the recognition of the permission for this to happen only as between certain of the five contracting parties, which clearly is intended to exclude those who are not members of those two organisations.  Perhaps I should not say this about a piece of paper but if it had come from some source in here I would say it was the arrogance of people <Col N="1952" /> who are not members of NATO and who do not want to be members of NATO. They must be anxious to keep this country friendless, so far as they can do so on the military level.  Those people do not want to give recognition to the validity of the NATO bloc.  Is it not there whether we recognise it or not?  Is it not a fact of life?  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>Effectively, this means that nothing done within the European political co-operation can be directed towards the dismantling of NATO, a course of action which an Irish Government may very well wish to follow in the future.</P>
    <P>What Irish Government in the future would want to dismantle NATO?  Who would take a blind bit of notice of us if we said we were anxious to dismantle NATO?  Would we cop ourselves on, and that goes as much for Fianna Fáil as for the CND?  Would we get a measure of our status in the world and have self-respect for ourselves in the process?</P>
    <P>A few days ago CND organised some sort of seminar or meeting and they wheeled on a well known English controversialist on this subject.  He was introduced as Professor E.P. Thompson, an English historian.  I saw him on television news and he got coverage in the newspapers: perhaps one should not complain about that, we all depend on coverage.  I wonder how much coverage would be given in Britain to an Irish professor of history who went over there bleating about how they should get out of NATO, about how their stance on some policy issue was being endangered.  We had this man coming over here to interpret our foreign policy for us.  He was asked by an RTE reporter, &ldquo;Do you think that the Single European Act endangers Irish neutrality?&rdquo;  I would like to have asked that reporter if he had read the Single European Act &mdash; it would have been a question worth hearing the answer to. This man said: &ldquo;You can answer it one way or the other, but when the chips are down I say it would endanger Irish neutrality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the level of investigative journalism that is applied to CND and others <Col N="1953" /> who for whatever reason &mdash; there may be sincere and respectable reasons &mdash; would like to see this country militarily &mdash; possibly in other respects as well &mdash; isolated. Even if there was a military dimension to this thing, what in the name of God has it got to do with nuclear disarmament? It is possible to have a whole range of understanding of a defensive kind with one's neighbours without being committed to any form of nuclear undertaking.</P>
    <P>The second scare which has been generated by the Single European Act is an idea which I will refer to by summarising a letter sent to me by a group called The Christian Conservative Council &mdash; I cannot lay my hand on the letter.  It stated that &ldquo;the adoption of this Act means among other things the introduction of abortion and divorce, already rejected by our electorate, into our country&rdquo;.  I cannot imagine other European countries having the faintest interest in forcing upon us their patterns of behaviour in these or similar areas.  Apart from the fact that European integration will always have to leave room for national differences based on cultural diversity, such powers will still be preserved in cases of a country's vital interests being involved, and I presume that that power would be employed by an Irish Government if an attempt were made, which I think highly unlikely, to trespass on our rights and our own line in such matters.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to deal with &mdash; Deputy Haughey gave it much prominence when he began &mdash; is the relationship of the Single European Act with the Constitution.  This is the only area about which I would raise a question.  I am not being positive about this, not just out of tenderness towards colleagues but because it is a very complex matter.  It is something about which lawyers could very well disagree, and I could imagine the Supreme Court dividing three-two on it.  It is not about the wisdom of our adopting the Single European Act but about the procedure we are using to do so.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to reassure the Dáil specifically on this <Col N="1954" /> matter.  In view of the fact that Deputy Haughey made such a meal of it, it would be no harm if the Minister were to incorporate a section on this in his reply to the debate to set at rest any misgivings that may exist here about it.  It is well to voice these doubts because we should not skate over a point, no matter how unmeritorious it turns out to be in the end, which relates to the power of this House to do what it is setting out to do.</P>
    <P>The amendment to Article 29 of the Constitution which was adopted by the people in 1972 in order to enable us to join the EC gives a sort of blanket cover of immunity from attacks on constitutional grounds to &ldquo;laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities.&rdquo;  I would remind the House that the expression &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; was inserted by a Fine Gale amendment: the original phrase used in the Fianna Fáil draft was a much looser, weaker expression, &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo;.  The Government of the day accepted the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    <P>In a legal document such as the Constitution, and above all in a context so important as the conferring of immunity from constitutional attack on a certain category of laws, it would be reasonable to read the phrase &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; as meaning legally necessitated, and to read the word &ldquo;obligations&rdquo; as meaning legal obligations.  I imagine it would be true to say that the expression &ldquo;obligations of membership of the Communities&rdquo; should be taken to mean obligations which legally arose from the treaties to which we at that time were committing ourselves and to which we were permitted by the 1972 referendum to commit ourselves.  If that were not so, if the obligations of membership of the Communities meant obligations of any kind whatever that might arise in the future and of which then we had no idea, the voters in the 1972 referendum would have been taken to have consented to an open-ended process, the future shape and details of which were not naturally then visible, and were resigning all control in future over the obligations even though they might make <Col N="1955" /> the most drastic inroads on the traditional sovereignty of the State.  I do not think that can be argued.  I doubt if we can argue now that because the political objective of progressive integration was then understood and accepted at a political level, that this sufficed to carry an indefinite extension of strictly legal dimensions of community membership so that any such extension of legal dimensions would be immune from scrutiny whether compatible with the Constitution or not.</P>
    <P>I have not gone back and read through the library full of speeches and scripts of the time, but my recollecton is that both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil reassured the voters at that time that they were not being asked to buy more than they could see in black and white in the treaties as they existed in 1972.  If I am right in that, and I may not be, the question must arise whether the passage of the Bill now before us is legally necessitated by the obligations of membership which we took on in 1972.  If it is, no problem arises.  In that event the House ought to be instructed in what way exactly our 1972 commitments could have been then foreseen to involve this new set of commitments. If the passage of the Bill this evening before the House is not legally necessitated by what we did in 1972 &mdash; and that I think is the more likely answer &mdash; if we are not literally and legally obliged to pass this Bill, however desirable its passage is, and I agree that it is, then the Act which will result from this Bill does not fall under Article 29.4.3 at all and does not get the constitutional protection or immunity for which that subsection of Article 29 provides.</P>
    <P>Let me just take one example, and I may be quite astray in taking this example because neither the Single European Act itself or the Government's explanatory guide makes it clear.  Let us take the provision of Article 11 of the Single European Act which empowers the House to create a new court with jurisdiction in &ldquo;certain classes of action or proceeding brought by natural or legal persons&rdquo;.  I do not know whether the action or proceeding <Col N="1956" /> envisaged there &mdash; and neither the Act itself nor the Government's guide makes it clear &mdash; is an Act or proceeding only of the kind which now falls within the jurisdiction of the European Court to which we consented back in 1972, or whether it is envisaged that causes of action which are not now compulsorily cognizable by the European Court should be cognizable compulsorily before this new court, and thus remove from the cognizance of the High Court here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have no problem about the substance of the thing.  I am willing to make a certain act of faith about it.  I would like to be told what exactly is envisaged in the expression &ldquo;certain classes of action or proceeding&rdquo;.  I raise this now and I may be wasting the House's time, but I feel I should do it.  If by any chance it is envisaged that certain classes of action will go now to this new court, subordinate only on points of law to the main European Court, if that means that a person who is now within the jurisdiction of our own High Court can be sued before this new European Court and if it means that the Irish High Court's jurisdiction is thereby ousted in that case, this seems to me to conflict with Article 34.3.1. of the Constitution, and always on the hypothesis that the passage of this Act is not legally necessitated by community membership as of now it would not be protected by the immunity of Article 34.4.3.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me.  He could do so in a very simple way if he says the only action or proceeding here envisaged &mdash; and if he can produce documents to make this plain &mdash; are actions or proceedings which are already in Europe; then the matter I have raised is irrelevant.  But if by any chance it is envisaged that a person who now will not be amenable for a particular course of action to any court except the High Court in Dublin, may tomorrow find himself compulsorily amenable to the jurisdiction of the European Court in a course of action which up to now was cognizant only here, then that is not consistent with Article 34 as it stands and it <Col N="1957" /> is not covered, for the reasons I have explained, by the immunity of the special section in Article 29.</P>
    <P>The explanatory guide to the Single European Act argues &mdash; and again I think there could be several views about this and I do not at all put mine forward with a certainty, but I feel it should be raised &mdash; that Article 236 of the Treaty of Rome permits the member states to agree to amend the Treaty itself and that this provision should cover the changes provided for in the Single European Act.  I imagine most treaties provide for their amendment by mutual agreement of the people who are party to them.  There is nothing strange about that, nor does any problem arise where the change envisaged does not impinge on the clear rules of our Constitution.  Note that Article 236, the amendment article in the Treaty of Rome, itself gives effect to amendments only after they have been ratified by all the member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. But if any such amendment, to which obviously when it is first proposed no member state is legally obliged to agree, &mdash; we are not under any obligation to agree to an amendment proposed by even every one of the other members &mdash; if such an amendment is proposed and if it does conflict actually or potentially with any part of the Constitution however harmlessly or indeed however benefically, I doubt that that article in the Treaty of Rome will dispense us from the laborious necessity of amending the Constitution yet again.</P>
    <P>It was not I that invented a rigid Constitution, although I think a rigid Constitution such as we have has a lot of advantages.  Some countries do not have Constitutions quite as rigid as ours and I think it is a pest to be faced as often as we have been faced with the need to go to the country with constitutional amendments. But we have got a rigid Constitution and it has been fairly rigidly and no doubt properly interpreted by our courts, particularly in the last 20 years &mdash; it used not to be taken so seriously in the fifties.  I would like to be assured by the Minister &mdash; and again I am willing to be <Col N="1958" /> assured by him if he would go through these clauses &mdash; that there is nothing in them that substantially goes beyond, in terms of infringing on the structure of the State set out in the Constitution, what was agreed to be acceptable in 1972.</P>
    <P>My problem about the Minister's argument in this guide is that although he talks about limited amendments, he says that for this purpose the Government are empowered to negotiate and agree to limited amendments of the kind involved in the Single European Act.  I cannot find the word &lsquo;limited&rsquo; anywhere in Article 236.  Article 236 just says &ldquo;amendments&rdquo;.  I say this with diffidence and I am willing to be proved wrong about it, but it seems to me that the argument advanced on page 34 of the Government's explanatory guide would equally cover a far more drastic set of amendments, equally ones to which I might have no objection in substance.  I am just anxious that we would not trip ourselves up over this.</P>
    <P>I know I have heard it suggested that this Bill, if enacted, should go to the Supreme Court under the Article 26 procedure. Even that would be a nuisance and very time-consuming.  The Supreme Court have to give a decision under that procedure within 60 days.  But 60 days is two months, and if a Supreme Court were to say at the end &ldquo;we do not take alarm at the Single European Act but it is potentially outside what was meant by the amending power of Article 236 of the Treaty of Rome, and there are things in it which potentially are not compatible with this or that Article in the Constitution&rdquo;, we would be back here where we started.  We would first of all have to draft an amendment to the Constitution &mdash; presumably we are not ging to incorporate the entire Single European Act in the Constitution &mdash; and we would have to go to the people, and that takes time also; then we would have to come back here to this House to re-enact this whole thing or something like it all over again. I do not want to raise hares.  I am most certainly not looking for a headline about how I have doubts or misgivings about this thing.  I just feel that the arguments here are complex and there are two sides <Col N="1959" /> to the argument.  I accept that.  I am not at all as sure about it as I have been about other things that were done here in years gone by.  But I think it would be right to mention these points so that it will not be said that this House overlooked them. I heartily support the further European integration which the Bill implies, and I sincerely hope the Minister and his advisers will be able to set at rest definitively the few legal questions I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Single European Act, first of all, alters the whole institutional balance of the Comunity.  It is important to remember that.  Articles 6 to 9 of the Single European Act provide for a new co-operation procedure involving the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers. This procedure will effectively reduce the present powers of the Council of Ministers. There is no question about that. We must look at where Ireland's national advantage lies in considering that alteration of the balance of the institutions in the Community where, from now on, under the Single European Act the Council of Ministers on which we were equally represented with every other member state would be effectively reduced in its powers and there will be increased and more effective powers residing with both the Parliament and the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this procedure, called the co-operation procedure, the Parliament may approve, reject or propose amendments for a common position to be adopted by the Council of Ministers.  Where the Parliament amends this common position, already adopted by the Council of Ministers &mdash; where they now proceed to amend that position which will have been achieved by Ireland as part of a consensus with the other member state Governments &mdash; the Commission is required, under the Act, to submit a re-examined proposal to the Council &mdash; taking into account the amendments proposed by the Parliament.  Now there will be going from the Parliament to the Commission a <Col N="1960" /> common position reached by the Council of Ministers, by all the member countries, which will now have to be re-examined on a proposal by the Parliament, looked at by the Commission and resubmitted to the Council.</P>
    <P>The Council can then adopt the re-examined proposal by a qualified majority.  The serious aspect is that unanimity is required of the Council to amend the re-examined proposal of the Commission which comes from the Parliament in that manner.  If the Parliament re-examines a consensus decision in which Ireland has participated, submits it to the Commission and it comes back in that amended form to the Council of Ministers, it means that the Council of Ministers can only reject that proposal amending their common position by unanimity rule.  On the other hand, they can adopt an amendment coming up in that manner by a qualified majority.  But, in order to reject the amendment, amending their decision, which comes up via the Parliament and the Commission, they must do so unanimously.</P>
    <P>That means that the co-operation procedure I have just outlined represents a very significant change in the institutional balance that existed in the Community heretofore.  While the new co-operation procedure leaves the final decision-making power with the Council of Ministers it is obvious, in the type of situation I have outlined &mdash; in which the Parliament and the Commission act in concert on the re-examined proposal &mdash; it would be very difficult for the Council of Ministers to adopt a different position. Obviously this procedure will diminish the influence that Ireland has always exercised in the direction and development of the Communities, particularly on the Council of Ministers.  In the Council of Ministers we can exercise substantial power as an equal State with other member countries.  As Deputy McCartin knows, in the European Parliament and Commission our national interests, as a small State, can be effectively buried by reason of the small numbers involved. For example, we have 15 Members in a European Parliament that must now be <Col N="1961" /> comprised of over 600.  Similarly within the Commission, our interests can be equally and effectively buried.  The Council of Ministers, now being diminished in stature and status, has always represented the main thrust of benefit to small countries, such as ours, that can exercise a power there as an equal member Government.</P>
    <P>That position is aggravated considerably by the new voting procedures on the Council of Ministers which will now permit a qualified majority voting instead of unanimity over a whole range of areas.  It is proposed to introduce voting on a qualified majority basis on decisions concerning the internal market, economic and social cohesion, research and technological development.  A whole range of areas will now be the subject matter of qualified majority voting.  The only subject now specifically retained for unanimity voting henceforth is that of tax harmonisation.  But over the whole range of areas of economic and social interest to Ireland we will now have qualified majority voting.  Not alone is the power of the Council of Ministers diminished but it is further diluted by the introduction of qualified majority voting over a very wide range of areas.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out by some members of the Government and other people who have argued in an uncritical manner in favour of the Single European Act that what is called the Luxembourg compromise remains unaffected by the Act and that member states will be free to invoke what is called a vital national interest in exceptional circumstances.  I would suggest to people who argue in that manner that there is a certain lack of political realism in that argument, as the ability of member states to invoke the Luxembourg compromise is now being diminished substantially by the proposed agreement under this Act to extend the whole area of majority voting by the Council of Ministers.  Therefore, the area within which the Luxembourg compromise can be invoked is narrowed by the increased area in which qualified majority voting will obtain.  That is the political reality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1962" /> These factors represent very disturbing trends in the Single European Act as regards future institutional balance within the Communities and undoubtedly will be detrimental to the national interests of small States such as ours. Our main interest lies in maintaining the pivotal role which has always existed of the Council of Ministers acting unanimously. That is our main national interest in the week to week voting process of the Communities.  There is no doubt that this new co-operative procedure, as it is called &mdash; set out in Articles 6 to 9 &mdash; does provide the Parliament and the Commission with increased powers, increased influence, an increased power of initiative, all at the expense of the Council.  This has very serious implications for an area such as the transfer of resources in which we have vital interest, which we require under the FEOGA Social and Regional Funds and the very effective transfer of resources we receive from the CAP generally.  This new type of increased power for what is now largely a consumer-orientated Parliament and a Commission that will be in discussion with them &mdash; to take the initiatives &mdash; will place a qualified majority Council of Ministers in an invidious position as far as our interests are concerned in regard to the transfer of funds under the headings I have mentioned such as the CAP, FEOGA and the Social and Regional Funds.  It is clear from reading the Single European Act that once the funds are established the amount of the funds and the nature of the allocation will be entirely a matter for qualified majority decision.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, aware of the current lack of progress in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, condemns the Government's failure to implement the scheme in an effective manner and calls for urgent action to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always try to avoid excessive language and emotion when I speak in this House. I try, and I think I usually succeed, to be temperate in my remarks here.  However, I find it difficult to be temperate when I speak about the failure, the neglect so clearly shown by this Government in their handling of the agricultural industry and in particular their handling of the scheme for the eradication of bovine TB.  Any Government with a sense of responsibility towards agriculture, the main industry of this country, and their responsibility through agriculture to the whole economy could not have acted as this current administration have acted as regards the BTE scheme.  Government neglect over the past four years of this scheme is, unfortunately, typical of their general attitude towards agriculture.  A Government made up of many dissenting elements, as this Government clearly are, cannot give to agriculture the kind of coherent leadership and encouragement that it needs if that industry is to play its part in our economic development.  The Government have shown no recognition of the importance of agriculture.  There was a token recognition in their plan, <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>&mdash; a pipe dream one might say &mdash; but that recognition died a very sudden death.  There was no quick advance to give effect to the beliefs and intentions of that document. Instead, once again under this Government <Col N="1964" /> agriculture has been subjected to a series of swingeing cutbacks in a whole range of important schemes necessary for the development of that industry.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the farmers have lost confidence in this Government.  Farmers are fast losing confidence in their own industry. Nowhere is there better evidence of Government neglect of agriculture than in the scheme for the eradication of bovine TB.  The Government are showing farmers they do not intend to do anything for that industry that they can avoid doing.  One might say that avoiding doing anything avoids dissension within the two parties in Government on spending money and the allocation of money.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister of State that farmers at present are keeping a very close watch on developments in the BTE scheme and have every reason to do so. It has cost them a great deal of money in levies, in the eradication of reactors in their herds and in loss of income.  Every farmer knows, therefore, what the consequences will be for him if reactors turn up in his herd.  His normal business will be brought to a sharp stop and a receiver of sorts will be effectively put in charge of his livestock business.  Of course, farmers are well aware of the lack of progress with the BTE scheme.  They know there are hold-ups because of inconsistent Government funding and, at the same time, they are well aware of the levies they themselves are required to pay.  How can any farmer who is waiting 12 months or more to have a normal ground test carried out on his herd have any confidence in a Government who put him in such a difficult and uncertain position?</P>
    <P>As an example of the worries which farmers have about the scheme, I should like to mention a very large meeting held in Cavan last week at which the Minister's Department were not represented either by their political head or by an official. The meeting was attended by 600 concerned farmers, including farmers from neighbouring counties as well as from Cavan.  All these men were particularly worried about the risks to their herds now <Col N="1965" /> being increased because of excessive and uncontrolled movement of cattle across the Border.  Farmers' meeting of the same kind are being arranged in other parts of the country.  Everybody knows that the uncontrolled movement of animals carries a serious risk of spreading the infection of bovine TB.  I take this example of a County Cavan meeting to show the wide farmer interest and concern. I could quote many other examples to the Minister, including many from my area and county.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I posed in the Dáil a question to the Minister for Agriculture about the position of a herdowner who had not had a test in the previous 12 months and who applied to the Department to have a test carried out because of his concern for the state of his herd. The Minister's reply was that such a request would be favourably considered by his Department provided &mdash; I draw attention to this &mdash; the test fitted in with the Department's programme of testing for the area or if the herd was considered to be particularly at risk.  What a way to run a BTE eradication scheme which is of such importance.  In other words, the normal answer to such a request would be to refuse it.  That, I am sorry to say, was a very unsatisfactory answer but of course it fits in with the general neglect by the Government of this scheme.  The result of this neglect is quite evident from the figures revealing the percentage of herds which show to be reactor herds. The figure for reactor herds compares unfavourably with those of the early years of this decade.  The carrying out of testing has simply not been frequent enough, consistent enough, or extensive enough. Consequently residues of the disease still remaining in various parts of the country are not being tackled in a way that will eradicate the disease once and for all. There is a risk that things will get worse if effective action is not taken quickly.  I would not like to give the kind of wrong impression that was given recently in the report by the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure about the BTE scheme. That report gave a dangerously wrong impression to anyone who was not aware <Col N="1966" /> of the facts.  Since 1954 we have been endeavouring to get rid of TB.  Since then expenditure by the State in current terms would amount to about £1 billion.  The scheme has dragged on and on although by now it should have been well finished. However, compared with the high level of the disease in the fifties very good progress has been made.  The only way to deal effectively with the disease at this stage is to make sufficient money available to have a complete round of testing carried out without delay.  The problem areas will need special attention.</P>
    <P>Early in 1985 I as spokesman for Fianna Fáil in agriculture published a ten point plan which clearly showed how bovine TB could be dealt with once and for all.  A few weeks ago the Taoiseach expressed regret that the sum of £4,500,000 would be cut off from this year's BTE programme.  Regrets will not undo the damage which will be caused by this serious cutback.  I can reassure the House that Fianna Fáil in office will provide sufficient funds to enable the scheme to be fully implemented and finished. Fianna Fáil will in Government, as in the past, have a proper realisation of the importance of agriculture to the economy. Agriculture depends on the soil, the climate, the people farming the land and to a large extent on our livestock.  Our livestock is one of our greatest national assets.  We must always be prepared to do all we can to improve its quality.  No effort must be spared in carrying out the work necessary to maintain the health of our livestock to the best standards throughout the world.  We have a proud record of maintaining our country free from many serious diseases such as foot and mouth disease which affects livestock in other countries.  We also have a proud name for producing food in a clean and wholesome environment.  We should use our good reputation to encourage our trade in agricultural products to expand so as to enhance our economy.  Fianna Fáil have always indicated that when they return to Government they will enable agriculture and its industries to be properly developed.  A final clearance of bovine TB is part of this policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1967" /> Farmers are becoming more aware of the need for everybody connected with agriculture to look towards the final consumer. Nowadays farmers are anxious and fully aware of the need to deal with bovine TB.  They pay a very heavy tax in the form of levies and that goes towards the cost of disease eradication.  Now, as never before there is a farmer awareness and farmers are prepared to participate fully in a determined effort by Government to declare us free of bovine TB just as in the past year we have been able to declare ourselves free of brucellosis.</P>
    <P>The report of the Committee on Public Expenditure also drew attention to the need for Government action to tackle the BTE scheme in a final way and I applaud the committee for this.  The report however gave a wrong impression by implying that the BTE scheme was simply thought up to give the impression to countries importing Irish livestock products that we have such a scheme while at the same time giving the impression that a scheme did not exist at all.  I am especially concerned that such reports might appear in trade journals of countries connected with meat and livestock industries here. Equally damaging in the report is the suggestion that at times reactor cattle are not taken up and slaughtered even when they proved to be reactors.  This is not true.  There are other mis-statements in the same report including the over hopeful suggestion about the blood test to decide whether an animal has TB.  My understanding is that the prospects for such a test, currently being tested in Australia, are not as good as the report suggests.  There may be some merit in it but we will have to await developments in that area.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that a new executive be set up to take over the work of eradicating bovine TB.  I do not agree with that suggestion.  Equally, I do not agree with the suggestion attributed in the report to a farmer leader, that the operation of the scheme should be taken away from the Department of Agriculture. When something is wrong we tend to take the easy way out by saying <Col N="1968" /> that those operating the scheme are not capable and by setting up another body to do the work.  Implied is the suggestion that this new body will be successful. We should not fool ourselves about such things.  Setting up an executive unit or some similar new body would be like having a dog and barking oneself.  The BTE scheme to be successful must be operated by Government.  This means keeping it within the control of the Department of Agriculture.  To be successful there must be full co-operation between all those connected with the scheme.  Fianna Fáil in Government will direct and finish the scheme effectively for the benefit of the country.</P>
    <P>The ten point plan which I published last year is as follows: the process of bringing to court those who fail to comply with the disease eradication scheme should be speeded up because at the moment it takes too long.  Severe penalties should be applied to all who infringe the BTE regulations.  Veterinary surgeons identifying reactors should issue reactor permits on the spot and the animals should be sent for slaughter as soon as possible afterwards.  Greater amounts of money should be spent in research to find the root cause of the disease, the type of germ, if it lives in the soil and how it spreads and there should be a more thorough follow up to research findings. Grants should be at realistic levels.  There should be a movement permit for all off-farm movement with pre-movement testing to reduce the likelihood of transmission of disease in the movement of cattle.  Annual testing is imperative and this is where the Government are falling down badly.  All hauliers of cattle should be licensed and their vehicles should be subject to hygiene tests.  There should be immediate testing of herds of farmers adjacent to affected herds as soon as reactors are identified and there should be statutory provision for the reporting of all incidents or suspected incidents of disease at time of slaughter.</P>
    <P>At this stage, the following points need to be specifically emphasised.  Reactor herds are not being retested because of inadequate funding.  Adjacent herds to <Col N="1969" /> reactor herds are not being tested, again, because of inadequate funding.  Herds are not being depopulated even when recommended by technical experts in the field, again, due to a lack of funding. Farmers strongly feel that the official attitude to the scheme lacks urgency &mdash; what a pity &mdash; because of a lack of leadership and guidance by the Government.</P>
    <P>Farmers came up with increased contributions towards the cost of this scheme but farmer increases were met by a reduction in Government funding.  As I said at the outset, I am rather temperate in my remarks.  What I have said with regard to herds not being retested is factual, I have seen it on the ground.  The reports I am receiving from the various local offices indicate very clearly that what I am saying is correct.  Therefore, I want to say to the Minister that the results of what has been happening during the past year is because of the stop-go policy, inadequate funding, inconsistent testing and all that goes with it.  The money which was spent in 1985 may not as well have been spent at all because it was money largely wasted.</P>
    <P>The only means of eradicating this disease once and for all is to have adequate funding, consistent testing, removal of reactors and the depopulation of herds, if necessary, provided that the farmers concerned are provided with adequate funding.  Our motion calls for urgent action to remedy this situation caused by the Government's failure to implement the BTE scheme effectively.  The only possible action which the country can now see is the urgent removal from office of the Government so that a party can take over Government which will deal not only with the BTE scheme but with the many other difficulties which are currently besetting the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on the TB eradication scheme.  I note that the Minister for Agriculture has put down an amendment to our motion which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann notes that, notwithstanding the constraints imposed <Col N="1970" /> by the budgetary situation, the Government's programme for the eradication of bovine diseases is achieving satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes two points in the amendment, the first being the constraints on finance and the second that he is quite satisfied that his Department are achieving satisfactory results.  I wish to take these two points and debate them in the limited time I have at my disposal.</P>
    <P>My advice to the Minister and his Department would be to prepare properly the agricultural Estimates in advance each year.  There is no sense over-estimating in certain areas and leaving money unspent at the end of the year in other areas.  A clear example of this is where the Government provided in the 1986 Estimates the sum of £9.7 million under the heading of M1, section 1, farm improvement programme, aid for young farmers and the farm modernisation scheme.  I put down a parliamentary question on 5 November asking the Minister the amount which had been paid out to date and I was informed in his reply that £4.578 million was the amount paid or owed at that time under this heading. I assume that all 1986 applications were processed at that time which means that £5.122 million had been unspent.  This is a clear indication that the Minister's Department officials had seriously miscalculated the finance needed under this heading.</P>
    <P>It is also obvious that the present critical financial farming situation, the lack of confidence by farmers in the future agricultural development due to reduced EC quotas and the complete lack of confidence of the farmers in the present Government were the main reasons why £5.122 million was not taken up by farmers in 1986.  The Minister and his officials at the commencement of 1986 completely misread this situation.  This £5.122 million could have been used to carry out a full national herd test in 1986 if the Minister and his officials had not misread the situation.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday 12 November, I put down another parliamentary question <Col N="1971" /> asking the Minister, dut to the failure of his Department to pay veterinary fees due to TB testing if he thought a Supplementary Estimate for 1986 would be necessary and if he would make a statement on the matter.  The reply I received was that there had been no failure by his Department to pay veterinary fees for testing and it was not anticipated that a Supplementary Estimate would be required for such payments in the coming year.  I am aware of some veterinary surgeons who had to wait for payment of fees due even though the Minister is of a different opinion.</P>
    <P>In his reply, I would like the Minister to explain why he sought a Supplementary Estimate in this House on Friday last, 5 December, for the sum of £1.3 million under the heading C.2, bovine TB scheme, because I assume that this sum is for extra expenses other than veterinary fees.  If this is so, it is very strange to me. I hope the Minister and his officials are of the opinion that veterinary fees are only a small portion of the total TB eradication scheme each year.  I cannot understand why there should be cutbacks in this area and no cutbacks in the administrative areas.  To me, that is ridiculous. There are 800 veterinary surgeons and 1,300 administrative staff.  What I would like to know from the Minister is whether all the administrative staff are engaged in the TB eradication scheme.  Surely, the Minister is aware that any cutbacks in veterinary fees for testing means a huge reduction in the number of livestock tested?  It is said that a 10 per cent cutback in funds could mean a cutback of up to 50 per cent in testing.  It is strange that this is the area where cutbacks are being made.  At the same time, the total cost of the administrative staff is withheld.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the farmers contributed £7 million in 1985 and £14 million in 1986 through levies on the sale of beef, milk and so on towards the TB eradication scheme, yet the Minister decided to give less Exchequer revenue to the scheme.  The first part of the Minister's amendment is inaccurate.  There was ample money to hold a full herd test in <Col N="1972" /> 1986 if the Estimates had been properly drawn up at the beginning of the year. The second part of the amendment refers to the Minister's satisfaction with achievements to date.  That I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious situation in Longford and Westmeath.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, said in the Seanad on 23 October last that at the end of the round 206 herds or 5.29 per cent of the herds in County Longford were locked up.  The corresponding figures in County Westmeath were 194 herds restricted, or 4.25 per cent.  Surely the Minister for Agriculture cannot state he is satisfied with the scheme in view of these statistics?  The Minister of State also said that the highest allocation of funds in the country as a whole went to the Longford-Westmeath area.  Other counties had to suffer as a result.  In Meath there are 6,000 herds but only 3,000 herds were tested in 1986.  This means that the Minister is prepared to allow reactors to move around on farms in County Meath, spreading the disease until they are tested next year.  This is crazy and I hope County Meath will not end up with the same results next year as Westmeath and Longford.</P>
    <P>The TB eradication scheme must be a national priority.  There is no sense in spending taxpayers' moneys administering half schemes.  There must be a long-term plan of full testing over a period of years with proper follow-up and research; otherwise in 30 years' time we will be in the same position as we are today.  If we as a country do not reach the standards required under EC regulations, there is a great danger that our agricultural exports will be seriously curtailed, causing further unemployment. Even now the EC consumer is becoming cautious of buying our dairy food products.</P>
    <P>It appears the Minister's officials are of the opinion that the scheme for the slaughtering of reactors is satisfactory. My information is otherwise.  There are delays of two or three weeks from the time an animal is identified as a reactor to the issue of the movement permit and <Col N="1973" /> slaughtering.  That is not acceptable. Surely seven days is a reasonable time within which a reactor could be slaughtered. The Minister and his officials should fully investigate the matter.  There is no sense in allowing reactor animals to remain on farms spreading disease.  In many cases there are unnecessary delays. The compensation payments need updating. This would certainly improve the administration of the scheme and ease the anxiety of the farmers who find themselves in this position.  I suggest that a computerised register of the national herd be compiled and that all livestock be moved by permit.  This would certainly reduce the costs of administration.</P>
    <P>An executive unit to deal with bovine TB should be set up immediately with an advisory committee combining farmer and veterinary interests, to be co-funded properly by levies and the Exchequer.  It is time the Department sought the advice and assistance of others to help to improve the administration of the scheme.  I am sad to say that it seems at present as if the doors are locked.  One thing is certain &mdash; the TB eradication scheme should have been more successful over the past 30 years.  There must be a rethink.  The report of the Committee on Public Expenditure on the TB eradication scheme recognises the good work done by all concerned but it recommends on the basis of debate with many people involved that the TB eradication scheme should have been more successful. Nobody in this House would disagree. There is no sense in carrying out a 1.3 national herd test in 1985 and then carrying out a half test in 1986.  This is a complete waste of taxpayers' money and it is not fair to the 80 per cent of farmers who have been clear for over a decade.</P>
    <P>The TB eradication scheme operates on a year to year basis and it is not known until the beginning of the year what the scheme will comprise in that year.  On 12 November 1986 I asked the Minister for Agriculture if extra finance would be made available to carry out a full test in 1987.  He stated in his reply that the 1987 TB eradication scheme was currently <Col N="1974" /> under consideration and it was not possible at that stage to indicate the scope of the scheme.  It is a sad situation that veterinary surgeons, Department officials and the farming community still do not know today what the scheme will be for 1987.  This is ridiculous and it is quite clear there must be a long-term plan of full herd testing so that everybody will know what is happening.  Otherwise the scheme will continue with the results it has had to date.  The scheme must be changed.  It is not good enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that, notwithstanding the constraints imposed by the Budgetary situation, the Government's programme for the eradication of bovine diseases is achieving satisfactory results.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In considering the Government's performance on bovine eradication any balanced assessment must consider not alone the TB situation but also what has happened in relation to brucellosis in recent years.  At the beginning of the 1980s about 9,000 herds were restricted due to brucellosis and in 1980 alone 75,000 brucellosis reactors were removed.  Today, only about 70 herds are infected and the progress made has enabled us to declare the national herd officially brucellosis free, thereby removing longstanding restrictions on exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a natural tendency for problems, however serious, to be quickly forgotten once success is in sight and it is remarkable how little we hear nowadays about brucellosis.  Nevertheless, there are many farmers throughout this country who will not easily forget the ravages caused by brucellosis and will sleep easier with the thought that we have managed to bring the eradication process to its final stage and that the risk of the dreaded abortion signalling imminent ruin is now <Col N="1975" /> much diminished.  The progress made is directly attributable to the Government's commitment to disease eradication and the particular achievements this year are due in no small part to our decisions, once we attained OBF status, to remove the limit on grant payments from the depopulation fund.  This enabled many farmers with infected herds to accept the veterinary advice to depopulate.  It is also a particular cause of satisfaction that, following our conclusion of a three year contract with the dairy co-operatives, we have had the fullest co-operation in reorganising the arrangements for the milk ring test which is an essential mechanism for the early and accurate identification of brucellosis.  This will enable us to press ahead with our brucellosis campaign in 1987 and, while there can be no complacency in relation to the disease, it is our aim to reduce the number of infected herds by a further 50 per cent next year. So in discussing disease eradication let us acknowledge a resounding success on brucellosis.</P>
    <P>Turning now to bovine TB, let me say, first, that I understand the concern of many people, particularly of farmers and taxpayers, at what they see as a failure to eradicate the disease despite a huge level of spending.  It appears on the face of it that little progress has been made over the last ten years and the frustration that is generally felt at this situation is shared by the Minister and the Department. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to see the TB scheme in stark terms of either success or failure.  The situation, however, is much more complex in reality.  The TB scheme has brought about immense benefits to animals and human health and has been instrumental in safeguarding our valuable export trade in live animals and livestock products. An indication of how far we have come is that when the scheme started 30 years ago one in six animals was considered to be infected.  Over the 1986 programme about one in 300 animals reacted to the test in a situation where the programme was concentrated on the herds at highest risk.  We have a situation also where the <Col N="1976" /> level of TB lesions in clean animals, which is a very good indication of the TB situation taking a long term perspective, is, at 0.19 per cent, at its lowest level ever.</P>
    <P>Many of the recent criticisms have been founded in the cutbacks in the scheme in 1986.  I want to sketch out the background to the situation in order to put the issue in perspective.  In the national plan, the Government identified the eradication of bovine disease, especially tuberculosis, as an urgent priority.  A comprehensive programme was to operate over the three years 1985 to 1987 and important changes in procedure were introduced, namely farmer nomination to be replaced by direct Department of Agriculture nomination of veterinary practitioners to test; fees to be paid direct to the practitioner who carried out the test; reactor animals to be removed for slaughter within ten days.</P>
    <P>The 1985 round of testing, which began in June 1985 and finished in April 1986, was the most comprehensive since the TB scheme began in the fifties.  In addition to a full round of testing, special programmes were operated in areas with the most serious disease problems.  The net effect was that the national herd was tested to the equivalent of one and a half times over a nine month period.  At the end of the round in April 1986, 4,629 herds or 2.49 per cent of the national herd were restricted.  The serious disease situation experienced in countries such as Clare, Cork south west, Longford, Offaly, Tipperary north and Westmeath was taken into account fully in the 1986 programme.  The 1985 round was highly successful in that for the first time in several years, perhaps ever, the extent of bovine TB throughout the country was accurately identified.</P>
    <P>The severe budgetary difficulties in 1986 only allowed for the allocation of £24.5 million for disease eradication and, despite the difficult financial situation we supplemented the allocation by a further £1.7 million, bringing in total expenditure on the schemes in 1986 to £26.2 million. In order to get the best return from the reduced funds available, resources were <Col N="1977" /> allocated among counties on a basis related to the disease situation and the worst affected counties got the greatest allocation of funds.  In badly affected counties almost all herds were tested, while coverage was less in counties where the disease level is low.  Nevertheless, over the calendar years 1985 and 1986, two full rounds of testing, at least, were carried out on the national herd and expenditure in those years was at an all-time high level.  At the end of November 1986, 5,280 herds, that is a prevalence level of 2.8 per cent were restricted due to TB, at the same time in 1985, 6,917 herds that is, a prevalence level of 3.7 per cent were restricted.  When account is taken of the fact that these results are based on a selective programme concentrated on the herds at highest risk, any suggestion that TB is not under control is misplaced, to say the least.  The results are based on a substantial amount of testing, in other words over 90,000 herd tests have been carried out since April and a corresponding number of private tests have taken place &mdash; and on that point I should like to say that we are maintaining that position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This relatively optimistic assessment does not mean that particular areas, e.g. parts of the Midlands, are not a cause of serious concern.  A special intensive programme is currently in operation in County Longford and all possible measures are being taken to limit disease spread there.  There will be no let up in our activities in the county and I am hopeful that we will shortly see a reversal of disease trends there.  All in all, therefore, I feel we will look back on 1985 and 1986 as years in which the final breakthrough was made against brucellosis and, hopefully, which saw the beginning of the decisive phase in TB eradication.</P>
      <P>We had a similar problem in my own area in Cork and in Cork south-west, but something happened there which I would like to see happening elsewhere.  Everybody admits that a great deal of money has gone into this scheme, but money alone will not solve the problem.  If we are to get results it will mean a partnership between a number of people &mdash; farmers, veterinary surgeons, the Department, the marts and the co-operative societies. In Cork we decided to initiate such a programme.  We had a number of meetings and identified problems but there are areas where we are not making progress. For instance, it is difficult to get farmers to openly admit they have a disease problem on their farms and to get them to advise their neighbours with animals to keep away.  It is also very difficult to get farmers to have disinfectant foot baths and to take proper precautions when strangers approach their farms.  This is a normal precaution in the United Kingdom and in other countries, and it is a measure which will have to be implemented here if we are serious about eradicating this disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not doing that, I am making a recommendation.  In places like Longford I would like to see people getting together to work out a system where reactors would be transported directly to the factories.  As I said, we have initiated <Col N="1979" /> such a programme in my county and I would like to see it tried out in other areas.</P>
      <P>The recent report of the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure on the TB scheme is under consideration in my Department.  The central recommendation of the report, that a new scheme should be drawn up with guaranteed funding over five years and implemented by an executive agency, has many implications which will require very careful consideration.  While some interests may feel that TB eradication should be removed from the sphere of central Government, the implications of any such development must be carefully assessed as any organisational changes in the scheme could have the gravest repercussions not alone from the point of view of the level of disease in the future but also of the guarantees to our trading partners.  Unfortunately, some important errors appear in the report.  For example, there is no basis whatsoever for the suggestion, underpinning important conclusions in the report, that my Department adjust the interpretation of tests to reflect the financial situation at any particular time.  On the test itself, I would again assure herdowners that the test when properly done is fully capable of identifying reactor animals.</P>
      <P>Despite my reservations on a number of aspects of the report which does not appear to have taken full account of the complexities of the scheme and of the initiatives being taken, for example, on the research side and on the reactor collection service, we will examine the recommendations in a constructive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course we would have liked to have spent more money on disease eradication, but it is quite easy to call for greater expenditure without having the responsibility to find the resources.  We did not, of course, stand aside bemoaning our lot when we found that the financial situation would not allow us to carry out a further full round from April to December.  Instead, we redoubled our efforts in the form of researching carefully where the resources could be put to <Col N="1980" /> best use in the form of a strategic testing programme and we set about having the maximum possible testing carried out by our veterinary inspectors.  As a result of this we have been able to carry out over 5 million animal tests under the 1986 programme, and when you consider that there are about 6.4 million animals to be tested over a full round you get an idea of the considerable amount of testing activity that has taken place in recent months.</P>
    <P>We have not of course been idle on other points either.  We have overseen the introduction of a pilot reactor collection service in County Cork.  I feel that this type of initiative, apart from being essential from the point of view of cutting down on the risk of disease spread, is a good illustration of how co-operative societies supported by farmer interests can play an active role in the eradication effort.  I hope that the example of the Cork Co-operatives will be followed by others throughout the country, especially as eradication involves much more than expenditure.  In the last analysis our efforts will stand or fall by the interest taken by farmers and their organisations both at the individual level and collectively.</P>
    <P>The criticism that tends to be levelled at us on the research side stems I feel from a strong conviction especially on the part of farmers who become victims of bovine TB, that there should always be an immediate explanation for outbreaks and that secure remedial measures can be put in hands immediately to rid them of the disease.  Unfortunately, as other countries have found, the eradication process is a hard struggle with no short cuts and there is no substitution for secure fencing, minimal contact with other herds and good nutrition.  This will not, of course, guarantee against the introduction of disease but it will certainly cut down the risk.  On the research side my Department, working through the TB Research Group which consists of expert veterinarians from both inside and outside the Department, are continually in touch with developments at home and abroad and have initiated and supported <Col N="1981" /> a number of studies on a wide range of subjects including ways of improving the detection rate in slaughtered cattle, detailed research on post-mortem findings in chronic herds, detailed studies of chronic herds, disinfectants, and the possibility of establishing an economic model for bovine TB control.  The group have also looked into the possible connection between bovine TB and wildlife. As regards wildlife the investigations are only undertaken by my Department where all other possible explanations for the persistence of TB have to be ruled out.  The operations are carried out with scrupulous attention to animal welfare considerations and we actively discourage any initiatives undertaken without the full approval of the Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Tourism.  It is too early yet to draw any definitive conclusion from our investigations which are on a modest scale.</P>
    <P>Another important development that took place during the course of the year was the installation of a computer system at all the district veterinary offices.  While the system, which is arguably the most ambitious in the entire public sector, is still in a fledgling state it has got off the ground remarkably smoothly and I have great hopes that it will ultimately prove to be a powerful instrument in the eradication process, not least because it will enable us to introduce much tighter movement control.  For the moment we are gradually building up on computer details of every animal in the national herd and our aim is to put in place a movement control permit, instead of the present identity card, in 1988.  Apart from providing immediate data to management on the operational aspects of the scheme the computer will also play an essential part in enabling the district veterinary offices to put into place at short notice a strategy to cope with outbreaks of TB in their counties.  Notwithstanding the cost of the new system which was well in excess of £1 million we see the move to computers as an essential investment that will pay worthwhile dividends in the years to come.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1982" /> Nothing will convince some commentators but that the TB scheme is an industry for the benefit of officials and veterinary practitioners, and indeed this is a sentiment that finds an echo in the report of the Committee on Public Expenditure.  It is not true, however, that over 1,300 people are employed on the scheme at a cost of £14.7 million.  The real figures are of 923 people engaged full time on the scheme at a cost in salaries of about £9 million.  This does not mean that we should not be constantly in search of economies and getting value for money.  This is an ongoing task that will continue to be carried out.  Nobody should be under any misapprehension that my Department's continued involvement in disease eradication is motivated by self-interest.  On the contrary the primary consideration has been and will be the efficient discharge of a disease eradication programme that will get results.  I believe that an enormous amount of good work has been done.</P>

      <P>It is my pleasure to support the amendment.  While the Minister has outlined the progress which has been made in the last number of years with regard to the bovine TB eradication scheme, all of us, including the Minister, have noted with regret that the success has not been greater.  We would all like to be satisfied that the TB eradication programme is practically coming to an end but unfortunately that is not so.  The reverse is the case so far as the brucellosis eradication scheme is concerned.  The Minister and his Department can be proud of the success rate under that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and other speakers referred to the comments of the Committee on Public Expenditure with regard to this scheme.  All of us must note those comments.  Very often one got the impression from the report that the people involved in its drafting did not fully realise the drastic implications for farmers when faced with an outbreak of TB or very often did not realise the financial commitment made by farmers <Col N="1983" /> who contribute to the eradication of bovine TB.  One could have got the impression from the report that farmers are benefitting directly from the huge expenditure down through the years.  It is only fair to put on record that farmers receive only a very small percentage of the money allocated under the Vote for Agriculture for TB eradication and that is by way of compensation for reactors.  It is a nominal sum by any standards but it is important to put that point on the record.</P>
    <P>Every farmer dreads the day he will have an outbreak of TB.  When that happens he is faced with tremendous financial loss.  He can no longer buy and sell as he wishes, he may have to remove his breeding herd and there is a tremendous loss of milk production and of calf production. All of this has a tremendous effect on family farm income.  We must consider all of those things and we must work together to try to bring about a bovine TB-free herd.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of carrying out greater research. The Department and successive Governments have failed to carry out sufficient research into the cause of TB and how best it can be controlled.  That whole area should be examined urgently.  The type of outbreak today is different from the type of outbreak of five or ten years ago. If there is an outbreak of TB in a herd today in 12 months the entire herd may be gone.  That was not the case some years back.  I would like to ask the Minister to have his Department carry out more research on the spread of TB and on how it crops up in a herd into which very few cattle are bought and only on the basis of a 30 day test.  This area needs a lot of research and examination.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to learn of the success with regard to testing between 1985 and 1986 and to hear that every herd had two rounds of TB testing.  Very often the impression is conveyed that much of the herds have not been tested.  From the Minister's speech I note the reduction in the number of restricted herds.  That is a very welcome step when one considers that the testing that has taken place was <Col N="1984" /> in areas of high risk.  It is welcome news that the percentage of herds restricted has dropped from 3.7 to 2.84.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred at length to the partnership between the co-operative movement and the farmers in the south with regard to the brucellosis eradication programme.  I assure the Minister that the farmers in the west and, I hope, the co-operative movement, will not be found wanting.  He should put his total weight behind a comprehensive programme to achieve the same goal as has been achieved with regard to the brucellosis scheme.  It is in our vital national interest to ensure that we reduce the level of bovine TB in our national herd.</P>
    <P>I agree with some other points in the Minister's statement.  He referred to areas with a very high incidence of TB, namely, Offaly, Westmeath and Longford. As I pointed out to the Minister for Agriculture on Thursday when speaking on the Supplementary Estimate, all of those counties border my own county. The only thing dividing us is the lordly River Shannon which, God knows, at times creates many headaches for us.  On this occasion it is probably creating a barrier against the spread of disease. Nevertheless, the level of outbreak of TB in these three adjacent counties is extremely worrying for Roscommon farmers.  I ask the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that the outbreaks of TB which are extremely alarming, in Longford particularly, are brought under control as speedily as possible. There is a lot of mixing of stock between the two counties.  I appeal to the Minister to see what he can do in that regard.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have regard to farmers whose herds are restricted. When testing a number of cattle for sale only one beast may be found to have TB. This is an extremely difficult problem in the west as it is mostly a store cattle area. Farmers may have store cattle to sell on 1 January and they have a 30 day test to prepare those cattle for sale.  If one animal fails the test, the farmer automatically faces financial ruin.  He would not have the feed to keep the cattle until <Col N="1985" /> May or June and very often he has not the financial resources to do so.  If one animal is restricted the whole herd is restricted and therefore the farmer cannot sell any of the cattle.  There is compensation for reactors and there is a hardship fund but it is of no use to this farmer who finds all his assets locked up overnight through no fault of his own. There is a grave injustice being done to those farmers.  It is one aspect of the disease eradication scheme that the State has not faced up to.  It has a moral and a legal duty to do so.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this urgently.  I know farmers who face bankruptcy as a result of it.  They cannot sell their cattle and they do not have any money to buy feed for them.  The Minister should do something to alleviate the plight of those farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the motion tabled by my party which states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, aware of the current lack of progress in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, condemns the Government's failure to implement the scheme in an effective manner and calls for urgent action to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the terms of the amendment tabled by the Government which reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that, notwithstanding the constraints imposed by the Budgetary situation, the Government's programme for the eradication of bovine disease is achieving satisfactory results.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not fool ourselves or try to justify the very high levels of bovine TB. The number of outbreaks according to the report of the Committee of Public Accounts, had doubled in the last five years.  It is time we adopted a positive approach to this problem and tackled this scourge aggressively.  It is foolish to try <Col N="1986" /> to pretend that we have eradicated the disease.  There has been a lot of criticism of State and semi-State bodies that have been baled out by the Government, and rightly so, but the cost of the animal disease eradication is greater than them all put together.  A huge amount of money and time has been spent on the scheme but little progress has been made.</P>
    <P>We should have personnel qualified to draw up a programme to eradicate the disease.  We must accept that after a huge expenditure on the scheme we are still at the bottom of the EC league as far as bovine TB is concerned.  Our national herd is our greatest asset and it has great potential for the creation of wealth. When we joined the European Community it was the one area we were confident of developing but many herds have been wiped out by TB down the years and milk production has dropped.  Many farmers have a low milk quota because of the damage done to their herds by TB. I accept there is a need for co-operation but at the end of the day the person who suffers is the farmer who has diseased cattle removed from his land.  His income is slashed when those animals are carted away on the back of a lorry.  It is almost impossible for those farmers to recover.</P>
    <P>We must agree that after 32 years little has been achieved.  It is not an eradication scheme but an effort to contain the disease. We are all critical of the movement of cattle by farmers whose herds have been found to be contaminated.  I can recall a meeting of farmers in my area to discuss bovine TB.  They were frustrated because they could not discover the reason why it was spreading from one farm to another.  We were told about contact with animals, bad fencing and water supplies but no official ever clearly identified the cause of the spread of the disease.  We have heard of executive agencies or others being responsible for the administration of the scheme but I do not care who administers it if at the end of the day the results are achieved.  I am not concerned if this scheme is administered by 1,300 officials or 900 officials: irrespective of the figure it is twice too <Col N="1987" /> many, but we need results.  We have to tackle this disease immediately.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of farmers in Lavey Inn last Tuesday to discuss the spread of the disease.  There was a huge attendance at the meeting and many of the farmers had travelled up to 70 miles. Farmers do not travel that distance on treacherous roads in December unless they are concerned about something.  I was asked at that meeting why officials of the Department who had been invited did not attend.  Today I asked the Minister for Agriculture to give the reason why senior Department officials failed to attend the meeting on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in County Cavan on Tuesday 2 December and in the course of his reply, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Those officials at headquarters who received invitations to the meeting were precluded from attending because of prior commitments and each of them so informed the organisers well in advance of the meeting.</P>
    <P>While senior officials of my Department are available regularly to the farming organisations to discuss the disease eradication schemes, in the case of the many regional meetings that take place from time to time the normal practice is for my Department's local veterinary officer to attend where possible.  The Superintending Veterinary Inspector for County Cavan was present at the meeting in question.</P>
    <P>If we have 1,300 or 900 officials involved in that scheme it should have been possible to send one official to the meeting. An attendance by an official from the Department would have indicated to those present that the Department were concerned about the spread of the disease. Those present were entitled to be addressed by a Department official or to have had a statement sent to them outlining the position in the county.</P>
    <P>In the past 32 years £1,000 million has been spent on this scheme.  There is no doubt that bovine TB is the greatest drawback to agricultural development <Col N="1988" /> and is the cause of frustration in the farming community.</P>
    <P>The Minister implied tonight that there is no scarcity of money.  I will quote from <i>Building on Reality</i> covering the subject we are discussing.  Section 2.51 states:</P>
    <P>The final clearance of bovine TB from the national herd remains one of the most urgent problems facing agriculture. It is evident despite substantial cost to the Exchequer, little progress towards complete eradication has been achieved over the last few years.  Faced with a situation where it is essential to get rid of the disease in order to safeguard our exports of livestock and livestock products, the Government must be satisfied that funds committed to the eradication programme in future are spent effectively.  Since the present arrangements for tackling the disease have not proved effective, the Government believe that there must be radical changes in those arrangements.</P>
    <P>According to that, the reply we got tonight is not justified.  Each Deputy will go back to his own bailiwick, and I will examine returns during the past five years for the five counties in my region and compare the incidence of bovine TB in 1980-81 with the 1985-86 figures.  In Cavan, the incidence was 1.73 in 1981 and it is 4.03 now, an increase of 133 per cent.  In Leitrim the percentage rose from a very low figure of less than 0.50 per cent to 5.28 per cent; in Longford the percentage has risen frm 3.04 in 1984 to 5.66 per cent in 1985-86; Meath had an increase from 2.60 per cent to 3.16 per cent; Monaghan is the only county of the five which had a reduced incidence, from 2.30 per cent to 2.17 per cent, a reduction of 6 per cent; Westmeath had an incidence of 3.49 per cent in 1981 and it has increased by 86 per cent to 6.49 per cent.</P>
    <P>I take it that the data prepared for the Minister was done on a national basis. When we go down to the regional areas we find that the picture is completely different and this is a cause of major concern.  If we are thinking of national legislation we must get down to the regions to select where is the high incidence <Col N="1989" /> of the disease.  We cannot fool ourselves by taking one area with a low incidence and saying it represents the entire country.</P>
    <P>In Border counties there are particular difficulties in relation to bovine TB. Everybody knows there has been excessive uncontrolled movement of animals in the region, particularly in the past few months.  This poses a serious risk of the spread of the infection.  We can relate our incidence of the disease with that across the Border.  Northern farmers are great feeders of animals, much more than we are.  They have great movements of animals in the North, yet their incidence of TB was less than 1 per cent in 1969.  In 1977 it rose to 2.57 per cent but it is now down to 1.6 per cent.  Northern farmers are coming south to bring cattle north, but they are still able to control the disease. In the EC league we are bottom of the table &mdash; Italy and Greece are near the bottom with us.  We have 17 times the incidence of Portugal and 130 times that of West Germany.  Such figures bring home forcefully to us that something has to be done here urgently.</P>
    <P>We must examine particularly the system of ear tagging.  We have had examples of the switching of ear tags particularly in the past couple of months. I addressed a question to the Minister for Agriculture asking him what action he proposed to take to eliminate the possibility of false ear tags and false identification of cattle accepted at meat plants. The evidence is there to show that the system is unsatisfactory or is being worked very unsatisfactorily.  In 1978, Members of the Oireachtas were invited to the IIRS who were developing a new type of tag which was supposed to be foolproof and tamper-proof.  The official present was a native of my area and I said to him that if he could have a tamper-proof tag a great job would be done.  Two years went by but that tag did not come on the market.  I wrote to the IIRS and they said there was a flaw in that tag. Apparently that flaw is still there.  They were supposed to perfect that tag but they have not done so.  In the past couple of months we have had allegations of <Col N="1990" /> unauthorised people manufacturing tags, which are freely available.  The Department must come to grips with this in a very tough way very quickly.</P>
    <P>Another matter which caused grave concern to those at the meeting in Cavan is the levy farmers are being asked to pay, amounting to £13.7 million.  The cost of veterinary fees last year was £11.2 million.  Why not give the product of the levy to the veterinary officers?  Let them do the job and forget the £24 million or £25 million spent on administration by 1,300 civil servants.  In 1985-86 testing was at 137 per cent and cost about £4.50 per animal.  This year we are spending almost the same amount of money but with the cutback of £4.5 million testing is at only 60 per cent.  We cannot have reliable results when testing is down by half.  A week ago I put down a question asking if a herdowner wishing to have his herd tested could be facilitated.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances, and notes with satisfaction that the provisions in Title III of the Single European Act relating to the co-operation of the High Contracting Parties (that is, the Twelve member states of the European Community) on the political and economic aspects of security and the closer coordination of their positions in this area do not affect Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the Adjournment I was concerned very much with the whole aspect of the balance of the institutions in the Community that has now been changed by the Single European Act.  Now, the European Parliament and the Commission, by reason of the new initiatives available to them, have acquired greater and more effective powers of initiative and greater powers of amendment, and weakened the authority of the Council of Ministers as a consequence. It is quite clear from a reading of the Single European Act itself and from a reading of the Government guide, that this is the case.  It is undoubtedly detrimental to the national interests of small countries such as Ireland where, in the Council of Ministers having the voice of a member Government on that Council has meant a stronger voice than the voice we have as a very small Irish representation in the European Parliament, and in the Commission as well where we are similarly very much in a minority. Taken in conjunction with the introduction of the qualified majority in a wide range of areas such as the CAP, FEOGA, the social and regional funds and other areas of research and technology, it means a substantial diminution in the power, authority and effectiveness of the institution on which we always could rely most for effective action.  In addition any proposal arrived at by the Council of Ministers on a consensus basis can under the Act be referred to the Parliament.  It can be re-examined again by the Commission and put to the Council of Ministers. If the Commission and the Parliament act in concert and agree on a re-examined proposal, that can only be rejected by a unanimous vote of the Council of Ministers so the Council of <Col N="1992" /> Ministers in effect, can be eased out of their decision.  If they arrive at a consensus decision in which we have participated they can be eased out of that decision and their decision can be beaten by the new co-operation procedure which is envisaged in the Act involving the Commission and the Parliament, two institutions in which we, as a small State, will not have the same clout or the same authority.</P>
      <P>That is a serious matter.  I am not saying anything more than that.  It is a serious matter to which we should give our attention.  I appreciate that we are in the Community at this stage and we must stay with the Community.  I realise fully the advantages and the benefits the Community has brought to us but we must recognise that this Act is not favourable, to put it mildly, to our interests as a small State.  In fact, it is decidely detrimental to our position and one of the main reasons for that is the dilution of the power and authority of the Council of Ministers, particularly in regard to the ultimate allocation of the various funds involving a practical transfer of resources and investments to this country.</P>
      <P>To bring it down to practicalities, the following sequence of events is likely to become the regular scenario in regard to administration by the three institutions working in conjunction.  Parliament can amend the common decision of the Council of Ministers on some aspect which may be favourable to Ireland.  The Commission takes into account the amendment proposed by the Parliament and submits the re-examined proposal to the Council of Ministers.  The Council can adopt the re-examined proposal by a qualified majority and if they have to reject the re-examined proposal they can only do so on the basis of an unanimous decision.  It is obviously that type of scenario which will be the common method of procedure.  In fact, it is the method of procedure envisaged by what is called the co-operation procedure.  It is obvious that essential Irish interests could be easily disregarded in that type of decision-making process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> I move now to one of the main purposes of the Act which is the completion of the internal market.  This is one of the positive aspects in that taken on its own it will provide an opportunity to increase trade.  There are consequent opportunities to increase investment and employment and diversify markets so that in the overall economic development of the Community and in providing an organised market in which there will be no barriers in regard to trade and investment, opportunities will be created not just for us but for everybody else in the Community.  However, because of our location we are at a real disadvantage in such an internal market.  It provides the opportunities but there is a problem in regard to our location on the periphery of the market.  There is an obvious need for an adequate <i>quid pro quo</i> for peripheral States like ourselves, so that on the completion of the internal market by 1992 there will be recognition of the particular peripheral problems created for countries such as Ireland by reason of our location on the fringe of that market, with consequent increased transport costs.</P>
    <P>This of course brings me to the real nub of my criticism.  I have no objection to the completion of the internal market &mdash; there is a commitment that that market be completed by 1992 &mdash; but there is no similar commitment in regard to the economic and social cohesion necessary to bring all areas of the Community together in a rising level of prosperity rather than have one area, the central area in particular, becoming more advantaged and the outer areas becoming more disadvantaged.  If the concept of economic and social cohesion, which is the phrase used in Article 23 of the Single European Act, means anything it means the very substantial transfer of resources to countries on the periphery of Europe, to bring up their standard of living, to enable them to overcome their regional disadvantages, and to ensure generally a transfer of resources to those peripheral areas and other disadvantaged areas. Apart from throwing out the rhetorical or cosmetic concept of economic and social <Col N="1994" /> cohesion, there is nowhere in the Act that I can see any adequate undertaking in regard to a proper and fully-geared regional development policy.</P>
    <P>We have a commitment to the completion of the internal market by 1992. There is no equivalent commitment to stepping up towards a meaningful regional development policy to take care of the more disadvantaged areas of the Community.</P>
    <P>An analysis of Article 23 of the Single European Act reveals no improvements in the structure and purposes of the present regional policy that was written into the original Treaties on which we agreed back in 1972, apart from the invention of this new phrase, which is meaningless, unless there is a positive follow-up in regard to timetable and the mechanics of implementation in regard to such a regional policy.  I would contend that the Preamble to the existing Treaties establishing the European Economic Communities &mdash; that is the Preamble to the 1972 Treaty &mdash; has a more specific commitment in that it referred to the need to ensure the harmonious development of the member states by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured.  In so far as words mean anything, they mean a lot more than just the cosmetic rhetoric of economic and social cohesion which is introduced here as a new concept, particularly when it is seen that that concept was quite clearly written into the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>As this Act stands, there is undoubtedly no practical commitment to increasing in a real way the economic and social cohesion of the Communities to which lip service is paid.  As it stands, it is just a vague concept with no real meaning.  We can contrast that attitude with the very definite commitment to complete the internal market by 1992, a definite time limit established in the Act in that regard. There is no concomitant obligation to step up the Regional Fund, the levels of expenditure and the appropriate allocation <Col N="1995" /> criteria needed to benefit the less-favoured regions.  In the case of the internal market there is a specific commitment. There is only a generalised obeisance to a concept in regard to social and economic cohesion.</P>
    <P>As far as Ireland is concerned this whole area of transfers and investments for regional and social purposes is essential. We cannot continue to rely on mere rhetoric as satisfying our essential requirements in this respect.  There has been very real failure on the part of the Government in their negotiations on the Single European Act in this area.  Important concessions have been made to complete the internal market but no practical concessions have been obtained by us in regard to our vital interests in the social and economic areas.  That is the reason we want incorporated in the declaration we want annexed to the Treaty, to the implementing instrument of the Act, the specific commitment in regard to the special social and economic problems basic to our requirements and which were written into the 1972 Treaty of Accession we signed.  It was written into the Treaty, as a protocol, that there would be ongoing recognition of our special position because of the need for a transfer of resources under the various headings I have mentioned such as the CAP, FEOGA, and the Social and Regional Funds.  This declaration should really incorporate the 1972 protocol as an annex to this Act.  We want nothing more and nothing less than that.  It appears to be a very reasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Haughey said earlier, there is no reason, in international law, that that cannot be annexed to the Treaty as a declaration, as the Government have already done in regard to a technical aspect of insurance law.  There is no reason a similar declaration restating the position in regard to Ireland's special requirements to secure the transfers I have mentioned &mdash; thereby removing the inbalances caused by our regional position &mdash; should not be agreed to by the Government and be annexed to the Act. It may be said here that such a declaration <Col N="1996" /> is not meaningful but, as two Deputies present who have European experience know, the fact of the matter is that it is very important for a country to put down its marker.  The value of inserting a declaration of that kind is that at some future date &mdash; hopefully sooner rather than later &mdash; in discussion, in negotiations, in the sort of bargaining that goes on in Europe, we can always return to that marker and say: &ldquo;there is our declaration, we went along with this improvement in European union incorporated in the Act on the basis of a declaration of this kind to do something meaningful in the way of transfers of resources under all of these headings so as to ensure that the less developed areas, such as ours and those on the peripheral fringe could benefit; that is our position, we made that quite clear and it is written in as a declaration annexed to the Single European Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Protocol 30 was negotiated in 1972 on our accession to the Community.  We should reiterate its terms.  That whole principle is incorporated in the first half of the declaration amendment we propose. The other half of the declaration, reservation or amendment &mdash; call it what you will &mdash; deals with the question of foreign policy co-operation.  Again we want to see our position emphasised here in regard to our approach to military neutrality. There is a real distinction there between military neutrality and neutrality generally.  We always had a stance in regard to military neutrality, initiated by us as a Government and observed by subsequent Governments and we feel that, again as a declaration, it is necessary to put down a statement of that kind as a marker.  There is nothing awkward in European terms about doing that. Denmark's attitude in this area is very similar to our own.  There is nothing that makes us bad Europeans in this respect; in fact, we are being very good Europeans by ensuring that declarations are incorporated in the Single European Act which quite clearly make our position plain to the other member states. Regarding the transfer of resources we are implementing stated European policy in <Col N="1997" /> regard to our attitude on military neutrality and as regards an independent foreign policy, which is the larger aspect of it, we are reiterating what has been there as far as we and Denmark are concerned over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>The notion of formalising foreign policy co-operation raises the question of an independent foreign policy on the part of Ireland and the implementation of our policy on neutrality which is part of that independent foreign policy.  We have had that foreign policy and as part of it we have implemented a policy of neutrality which has served us well in these terms. I have always found that it suited the larger European powers to have a country like Ireland within the EC which they knew had the appropriate contacts outside the Community and had a certain <i>entree</i> into other countries outside the Community within the UN framework, and thereby we were often spoken to and our advice was often taken as regards what the approach should be to countries outside the Community with which Ireland had friendly UN contact by reason of our essentially neutral position within the UN and the essential record of having an independent foreign policy. That role is particularly appropriate to a small country which is not likely to have the muscle to engage in military adventures. There was a recognition of that within the Community.  It was a certain foreign policy strength that we had and it should not in any way be jeopardised. It is a foreign policy bonus that has served us well in practical terms, for instance in dealing commercially and in trade with north Africa and the Middle East.  It has helped us to deal commercially and in trade with many African countries.  It has helped us in practical terms and it has been the proper moral and sensible attitude for a small country that has no armaments clout but has a chance to use its independent foreign policy position and its policy of neutrality in a practical way to help out and co-operate with its friends, to do the right thing and act as an honest broker both between fellow member states within the EC and the outside world and within the whole world <Col N="1998" /> at the UN.  Deputy John Kelly sought to denigrate our UNIFIL contribution.  I feel very strongly that our UNIFIL contribution has been part of that approach. The fact that we have in the Lebanon, Cyprus, the Congo and all over the world over a number of years now made a very positive contribution to world peace under the aegis of the UN has resulted largely from the fact that we have had this approach to our foreign policy and in regard to military neutrality.</P>
    <P>Here we are seeking as the second part of the declaration to have written in as a positive marker our commitment to an independent foreign policy and to military neutrality.  Here again there is nothing whatever to be defensive about in regard to our European friends.  In my experience as Minister for Foreign Affairs they have always understood our position fully in this respect, and I see no reason why that marker should not be put down in the declaration along with another marker concerning the transfer of resources.  It takes not one whit from the Single European Act; it adds to by stating quite clearly what our position is and makes that position quite clear for future negotiators who will be discussing and bargaining and maintaining our position. We can always refer back here and say that we went along with the Single European Act subject to these two reservations being incorporated in this declaration. In the light of the history of this matter I cannot see why the Government are not accepting this declaration which does not in any way take from the Single European Act but enhances and amplifies that Act, makes quite plain where we stand and is there to stand as a marker so that in any subsequent discussions or negotiations our position is understood clearly.</P>
    <P>We have very serious reservations about various aspects, particularly the one I referred to first, in regard to institutional changes and the diminution of the Council of Ministers which are not helpful to us.  We feel strongly that, along with the creation of the single internal market, there should be a positive improvement in regard to the various <Col N="1999" /> funds which are involved in the transfer of resources to this country, particularly in regard to the Regional Fund.  A reservation should go in on that aspect and our traditional attitude with regard to independent foreign policy and military neutrality should be incorporated in that declaration.  I hope that these remarks will be regarded in the spirit in which they are meant, as a constructive attempt to improve the Single European Act in the knowledge that our future lies within the Community but that it is important that we make our position quite plain and apparent to our friends in the Community so that they know where we stand.  That is without any respect to our capacity to get along with them in creating a better Europe in the future.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Deputy Lenihan very carefully.  He made a sane and sensible contribution on the whole subject.  Three points about which he is concerned are relevant and what he said about them requires to be thought about.  I regret, however, that only this evening are we getting the benefit of the wisdom of the Fianna Fáil organisation on this subject, a subject which did not start today or yesterday.  It has been going on quite a long time.  We had the Genscher-Colombo proposals which were discussed in the capitals of Europe and every place where people who were interested in the development of the Community met.  After that we had the Spinelli document which was a child of the Christian Democratic Group, which was the only group which voted unanimously for it. Obviously, Mr. Spinelli, representing the Italian Communist Party, would not have been in a position to deliver to Europe a draft treaty agreed by the Parliament if it were not for the fact that he got the complete unstinted support of the Christian Democrats in the European Parliament, while others absented themselves, others were divided and some got lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On every occasion when this subject was discussed in the European Parliament my colleagues from the Fianna <Col N="2000" /> Fáil Party who normally are conscious of the things that are important to Ireland and who normally play their part, chose in this instance not to utter one single word to give any indication as to what they thought about any of the proposals made, the Genscher-Colombo proposals, the Spinelli proposals or of the opinion of the Parliament on the preliminary discussions within the Council, or about the final agreement which was made in Luxembourg. On one occasion one member opted to register an abstention.  That was a pity.  The Government and the country deserved to know the thinking of the major Opposition Party on this whole subject.  Recently I heard somebody relate how when the subject was raised by a minority party at a county council meeting the Fianna Fáil county councillors contributed from scripts which were very carefully written so as not to give any indication of the thinking of their party.  From all of this I got the impression that here was something which was being held up the sleeve, here was a possibility to create a difficulty for the Government and not a possibility to make progress in Europe and to make a contribution towards an Act which could have been better had we had the benefit of opposition thinking and advice.  It is regrettable that only here this evening has the thinking of Fianna Fáil come to light.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey made a very long and eloquent speech upon the subject.  It sounded more like counsel's opinion than the opinion of a politician who had seriously thought about the subject.  It sounded like something that a legal practitioner would have prepared from a negative viewpoint and without much feeling for the subject.  It was a very careful and thorough analysis.  Deputy Haughey quoted Dr. Pescatore who is an ex-judge of the European Court.  Having said that he regarded this subject as being of sufficient importance to have a referendum, and having referred on at least one occasion to the new situation in Europe after the ratification of the Act, Deputy Haughey proceeded to quote selectively from Dr. Pescatore on the <Col N="2001" /> subject.  I expect that the legal minds who may have advised the Opposition on the subject were not more familiar with the original treaty than was this ex-judge of the European Court.  I will give the House the benefit of what he thought about this whole exercise.  It is rather disturbing for enthusiastic Europeans to hear what this man had to say.  Obviously the Leader of the Opposition thought that this was an important opinion.</P>
    <P>Speaking to the group of the European Democratic Christian Party last year in Greece, this is what the doctor had to say in a general way.  He said that:</P>
    <P>Critical scrutiny of the Act of 17 February 1986 demonstrates that the European public, including the legal world, has been the victim of a huge political disinformation operation, as the concessions demanded in return for the extension of the Community system to a number of new areas had never been mentioned in the political declarations accompanying those negotiations.</P>
    <P>The ex-judge is saying that we made many concessions on European union and more concessions in the interests of moving into some new areas.  That is a fair comment.  He said:</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;Final Act&rdquo; is appended to the Single Act and consists of 20 declarations, some joint, some unilateral, of a widely varying nature; a hotch-potch of interpretations, statements of intent, amplifications and reservations.</P>
    <P>That is generally what this man thought about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan spoke about the completion of the internal market.  Many who have been interested in the Community for a long time thought that the question of the internal market had already been resolved.  I am not very familiar with the entire Treaty of Rome.  I made a contribution when we originally joined and I had a general belief and a fairly detailed knowledge of how the system worked but I am not familiar with every word of the <Col N="2002" /> Treaty of Rome.  Again, from the same source:</P>
    <P>Article 8A promises an internal market &ldquo;without internal frontiers&rdquo; by 31 December 1992.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan is slightly worried about the consequences of this but the doctor says:</P>
    <P>This is curious, as the EEC Treaty already provides for a common market to be completed by 1 January 1970, and all the more so as to a large extent this common market has already been completed.</P>
    <P>That is true to an extent.  The common market has already been completed apart from the 300 or so decisions of Council, of Commission and of Parliament which are outstanding.  As to the question of the new alias into which the Community proposes to move, he has this to say:</P>
    <P>Trying to sum up these new provisions we find that only those on research and technology are genuinely innovatory.  All the other new chapters are in fact variations on themes familiar in Community practice.</P>
    <P>This is so.  We have the regional policy, the environmental policy, social affairs and all these things.  Already there are many social directives, some already agreed and some before the Council of Ministers.  The same goes for environmental directives.  As has been pointed out, there is not very much new there except in relation to research and technology. From a strictly legal point of view there is not an awful lot to worry about in the Single Act.  The ex-judge of the court is certainly justified in making the case that in a strictly legal sense this Act means nothing at all and it may in fact be going backwards rather than forward.</P>
    <P>In relation to the whole question of European political co-operation I will give the House a long quotation because it is important to hear a legal definition by a person who has been fully familiar with the treaty and with the Act and who had the responsibility of interpreting the treaty over the years.  He says:</P>
    <P>The third part of the European Act, <Col N="2003" /> comprising one article divided up into 12 paragraphs, is designed to formalise co-operation in the sphere of foreign policy, which has taken place in practice over a certain number of years. However, the object in incorporating this system in an international treaty is not to establish any commitments binding on what are referred to here as the &ldquo;High Contracting Parties&rdquo;. Nowhere does the wording of Article 30 go beyond declarations of intent culminating in formulate to the effect that for example, the determination of common positions shall constitute a point of reference for the policies of the &ldquo;HCP&rdquo;, that the HCP shall, as far as possible, refrain from impeding the formation of a consensus and the joint action which this could produce.</P>
    <P>The desire is expressed in paragraph 5 that the policies pursued by the Community and the high contracting parties must be consistent.  Deputy Haughey mentioned European security but he mentioned it out of context.  Dr. Pescatore said that this is the first time European security has been mentioned in such a context but not the slightest commitment is established.  Unfortunately, the only effect of these ramblings is to highlight the lack of political consistency in Western Europe.  Did we need to conclude a solemn treaty to do just that?</P>
    <P>So much for the demands for a referendum. So much for the concerns of those who believe that this is a sell out of our neutrality.  If indeed anybody believes it.  So much for those who believe that what we have done is a diminution of our sovereign position as a State.  In practical terms the entry to the Community of Spain and Portugal was far more ominous for Ireland than was the signing of the Single European Act. When the Community brought in another 45 million people who on average were a little bit worse off than ourselves it created a situation that we either had to take less from structural funds or we had to demand that we receive a much extended budget.  The accession of Spain and Portugal posed far bigger questions to be <Col N="2004" /> answered and a greater threat to our welfare within the Community.  I was in favour of their accession but at the same time we should recognise that that was a far more important decision than the decision we are being asked to make this evening.</P>
    <P>I would not be as pessimistic as Dr. Pescatore.  He is probably right in so far as a legal definition of what actually happened concerned.  I think he is quite accurate in what he said.  One of the problems was that we did not complete the internal market by 1970.  When we joined the Community the market had not been completed.  Decisions had to be taken but as there was now a larger number of member states the decision-making process would naturally be slowed down. The community had to ask themselves whether they would show the new member states and all concerned another copy of the Rome Treaty or whether they would sit down together to try to renew their basis for agreement.  That is what they did.  Deputy Haughey was not correct when he said the Danes have not ratified the Single European Act.  They have.  They held a referendum.  The Single European Act was discussed in every Parliament in the Community. Because of the discussion the Single European Act generated and the problems it underlined I believe that there will be a new commitment to the completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>The environment was discussed in Europe and some decisions were taken. The placing of these decisions in the treaty along with the commitment to a strong regional policy and a co-ordination of the structural funds will stimulate the countries of Europe into dedicating themselves to the job that was undertaken by the original member states many years ago.  There is nothing new about political co-operation.  I do not think we need to have an addition to the treaty. The objectives of political co-operation were laid down in 1971 and agreed to by the Council.  We joined the Community on the understanding that that was the way the Community worked.  At that time the Community had committed <Col N="2005" /> themselves to completing monetary and economic union.</P>
    <P>I cannot see anything that we are being asked to agree to in the Single European Act that we had not agreed to 12 years ago.  I hope the new secretariat will create consistency and give a direction to European political co-operation.  That is extremely important.  When the new American ambassador was appointed to Ireland some time ago she was asked in a radio interview if she thought being appointed as ambassador to Ireland was, perhaps, beneath the experience she already had and was not the sort of promotion one who has had a successful political career would expect to receive.  She replied that she did not think that being appointed ambassador to Ireland was a demotion after having held the post of Secretary of State in Washington.  She regarded the position as important since Ireland was an important member of the EC.  That underlines for us where we are seen in the world.  Sitting down in political co-operation with the other 11 member states we have a voice in the world which is far more important than anything we could ever have achieved on our own.</P>
    <P>I do not take very seriously Deputy Lenihan's claim that the European Community like to have a neutral member whom they can send out to talk to people who are not on speaking terms with the other 11.  After all, Ireland is a member of a family of European states.  Whatever secrets we will be taken in on as a member of the Community represent about as far as we will go in international affairs. Occasionally, a nation may throw up a leader of international status whose ability and personality shine forth but this happens only very rarely.  Generally speaking, our international status would be related to our economic and military might.  Our political power in the world today is a great deal less than most of us would like it to be.  Our capacity to influence world affairs sitting in political co-operation where decisions are arrived at and where we are an equal partner can be considerable.  As the cohesion of the Community and their ability to make decisions grow so too will the status of <Col N="2006" /> their member states.  It is quite obvious that the countries in the EC do not have the power they used to have.</P>
    <P>I read today in a newspaper that Taiwan has the equivalent of $40 billion of foreign exchange stored up in its bank vaults.  That is the kind of successful trading which gives countries power.  There is only one outstanding successful economy in Europe, which is, the Federal Republic of Germany.  Our place in the world becomes ever more diminished as America looks more towards the Pacific Basin, as the countries of the Far East grow and develop and as we become an ever-reducing percentage of the world's population.  It is true that Europe is still a very important region economically but our ability to influence our own affairs as individual states is very limited by comparison with what we can achieve if we work together in complete economic and political harmony.  There is nothing to worry about there.  I will come later to the question of neutrality and the arguments on that point.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the question of sovereignty arises on this occasion.  It certainly arose when we made our original decision to join the European Economic Community.  Sovereignty assumes the capacity of a country to make all the decisions which affect its own people, without the fear of outside interference or the exercise of a superior power.  Even if we were extremely competitive economically, even if some of our young people would like temporarily or permanently to move into other economies to gain other opportunities, even if we did not have as many people living in Britain who are entitled to be Irish citizens as we have living at home, even if our country was not divided, I still do not believe a small economy like ours could ever claim to be anything like sovereign, in the modern world.  I often hold up as an example our fishing grounds where we claim we have 25 per cent of the fish of Europe but, on the other hand, we did not have the capacity to conserve them, to catch them and process them or to protect them from foreign poaching and exploitation.  This is one area where we <Col N="2007" /> can talk about sovereignty but in reality it does not exist.</P>
    <P>We have already conceded our sovereignty. When the Fianna Fáil Government decided to take us into the European Monetary System there was a considerably bigger concession made on sovereignty than anything we are proposing in the Single European Act.  When we joined the EMS it could be argued that we were conceding a lot of economic power to the Bundesbank, the institution which controls the strongest currency in the Community.  Agreeing to align ourselves to that currency within a limited margin of manoeuvre was certainly imposing economic disciplines on us which would be decided upon and agreed in other places, away from the Oireachtas and the Government.  It is notable that while the British Prime Minister is very anxious to complete the internal market she is not prepared to concede on the question of the EMS.  She sees this as a very important power which they must reserve to themselves.  They do not want to come to any extent under the control of the German monetary system.  We had no hesitation about joining that system and we were right, but I would contend that it was a bigger concession on sovereignty than anything we are proposing to decide upon today.</P>
    <P>My political view is that what we are doing is right.  The Community is recognising the failure in past years to realise all its objectives and is seeking to make a new start.  The start is not very different but it contains new elements because of the needs of the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>On the question of the internal market the view is held by too many people that the completion of the internal market is good for the larger, economically more powerful States and bad for the peripheral regions with weaker economies. That could be so but I do not agree. I would remind people who are cynical about our efforts that Seán Lemass concluded a free trade agreement with Britain at a time when the Irish economy was considerably weaker than at present <Col N="2008" /> and Britain was probably the most powerful industrial country in western Europe. Its place in the world was considerably higher on the scale than it is today and ours was considerably lower.  We were linked to their currency, which demanded from us a lot of concessions on sovereignty. We decided to join with them in a free trade agreement but we did not get the benefit of any common agricultural policy, regional or social fund or any willingness to transfer resources from one economy to the other.  The agreement was supported by the then Opposition, unlike what was been happening during the past four years.  We had a more constructive approach at that time rather than the kind of &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; attitude in case there might be any way to bring down the Government, regardless of the common good.  Mr. Lemass and his Government took a chance.  They made concessions because they recognised that there is no possibility that a weak economy can become strong through a policy of withdrawal and protectionism.</P>
    <P>There are many people who believe that all we have to do is put up a placard stating &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;, the implication being that we should discriminate against imports and resolve our problems.  Of course it will not resolve our problems. We belong to a large trading block.  The secret in any trading arrangement is not to persuade three million people to buy Irish.  That will not resolve the problems of a small economy.  Even if we were to achieve that objective, it would result in lowering standards of living rather than resolving social and economic problems. It would be a licence to people to sell inferior goods because there would be no need to complete.  There is an assumption that two countries cannot play that game and that we would be allowed to discriminate against somebody else's goods while at the same time demanding free access of Irish goods to their markets.  Of course it is good if Irish goods are sold on the Irish market, but the trick is to sell Irish goods to 300 million people in one of the richest areas of the world which, although professing to believe in <Col N="2009" /> free trade, does discriminate against goods and products from other areas.</P>
    <P>I do not want to play down the role of the Irish State or the Irish people.  We are as important as any other three million people in the world.  At the GATT negotiations in Central America some months ago, picture Ireland trying to roll back the tide of demands for free trade in agricultural products, trying to answer the case from countries like the Argentine, Australia and New Zealand, trying to tell 600 million people of India about the importance of dairy produce to the Irish economy.  Imagine how important our voice would be outside the European Economic Community, having to find world markets for our surpluses of dairy products and meat, particularly beef and sheepmeat, where nobody wants to buy those products.  I can imagine the sort of boast our people would make of Irish sovereignty and the extent to which our voice would be heard around the table where the nations of the world were discussing difficult questions about freeing international trade.</P>
    <P>I would much prefer to be one of the Twelve, with all the experience and power that go with the combination of people who between them control 40 per cent of world trade.  That is the place where we have most power.  If we want to achieve the closest we will ever get to control over our own destinies, it is in sitting down, making either economic or political decisions, seeking social assurances or, indeed, looking for protection in cases of aggression or violence in the world.  In fairness to Fianna Fáil speakers, the whole question of sovereignty has not arisen so far.  It has not been highlighted this evening, but outside this House I have heard the question raised very often.</P>
    <P>We made a concession on sovereignty when we signed the original Treaty of Rome, but not too many realised that at that time within the institutions of the Community, in the Commission, the Council or the Parliament &mdash; while I would argue that we are as important as any other three million people in the European Economic Community &mdash; we <Col N="2010" /> were not entitled to veto the will of the other 300 million.  In the European Parliament we have the same voting strength as 50 million Germans and the same applies in the Council of Ministers, we have the same voting strength as 50 million Italians, 50 million British or 50 million West Germans.  Rather than giving way in the sharing arrangements we have made, our share in important decision making in Europe has given us a voice far superior to what one would regard as our entitlement, based on our economic situation and our population. That is something we do not realise.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of majority voting, Deputy Lenihan devoted a large part of his contribution to his concern that the balance of power within the Community is changing.  In the European Parliament there is much concern that progress in Europe will not be made until the people of Europe's directly elected representatives achieve a real say.  Mostly they have been pessimistic about the outcome of the conference in Luxembourg and they are mostly disappointed about the new Single European Act.  I was a little happier than most.  The final compromise as proposed by the Commission which eventually was agreed to improved the decision making capacity of the Community and made it more democratic.  I do not know why Deputy Lenihan is so concerned about this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to the European Parliament as the representative of consumers in Europe, as did Deputy Lenihan.  That is being very lightly said; I have said it myself about local authorities who have been divested of their powers and about health boards who also have no power, but simply have a voice on behalf of consumers, with no responsibility. However, the European Parliament has this responsibility.  It deals with the resources of the Community and when it votes to spend a particular amount of money this money has to be raised by the European taxpayer.  It is far too simplistic to say that this is some sort of rag-bag of people who represent various interest groups and pressure groups; it is far from that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2011" /> If anybody chooses to study the decisions and opinions of the European Parliament over the years, he or she will find that there are two sorts of decisions that are taken.  One is similar to the passing of motions on the Adjournment here and does not have any legal effect.  The European Parliament spend much time passing such motions, many well intentioned but many impractical.  When it comes to the business of legislating, the individual elected representatives of the people of Europe are not all perfect but if you watch the decisions they have made they have been concerned about Third World development.  Generally speaking, the Parliament of the European Communities has voted more money on each occasion in its budgetary arrangement for the relief of hunger and distress in Third World countries than the Council, in which Deputy Lenihan has so much confidence, were prepared to concede.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament has held the view that regional funds should be expanded and extended and has been very consistent in its concern over peripheral regions and the people who live in the weaker economic states of the Community.  As a person coming, not only from a peripheral State but from a peripheral region in that State, I certainly can say that I have recognised considerably more commitment to cies in the European Parliament and considerably more commitment to resolving regional disparities than ever I recognised in this Parliament.  I find considerably more willingness on the part of people from the richer parts of the European Economic Community to share &mdash; and I am talking about the directly elected representatives.  They have demonstrated this by their voting on numerous occasions.  There is considerably more willingness to share than I find in a little country like ours and in a Parliament like ours, of which I have been a member for a number of years.  I am not in the least concerned that the European Parliament in its improved position of contributing to decision <Col N="2012" /> making will in any way lead to a neglect of the problems of the peripheral areas. Similarly, with regard to social problems, if anything the European Parliament is almost too socially concerned, perhaps without having full regard to the economic consequences of all the social legislation that it proposes.</P>
    <P>In future, the Council will have the last word, but it is a unanimous council, as Deputy Lenihan has pointed out.  That is an improvement.  We did not realise that we gave to the institutions of the European Community legislative powers, we altered our Constitution to concede those powers to the Community and in practically all situations, except to a small extent in the making of budgetary decisions, these decisions were taken by the Council of Ministers for many years, without much reference to the opinion of Parliament.  Eventually, Parliament found an instrument by which it could at least put a brake on the progress and force the Council to negotiate and enter into conciliation proceedings.  That was after the ISO-Glucose decision when it was found that the European Council could not legally make a decision without first having got the opinion of Parliament. Parliament, at that stage, found itself in possession of a weapon which it used sparingly but effectively in recent times.  It could withhold or withdraw its opinion and if it could not alter the Council's decisions or force them to make a decision, it could stop the process until conciliation and agreement had been reached.  The new situation provides Parliament with greater power.  The Italian Government which included Socialists and Christian Democrats, felt this power was not sufficient and were prepared to refuse to ratify the treaty on that ground.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament is wise in that it accepts that as much progress as possible has been made and that the decision making process has been improved.  Imagine Ministers from 12 member states arriving in Brussels, meeting their aides and advisers to find out what was on the agenda for the next meeting.  The majority of these representatives will have instructions from <Col N="2013" /> the national Parliaments and each will be looking to his own interests.  Since 12 members are involved, the chances are that elections will be pending in at least one State at any one time.  These members meet behind closed doors, horse trading, under the influence of public servants and arrive at conclusions under a system which is far from being democratic.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Parliament will have a fixed period of office.  This means that no one country will be facing an election during that period and this will enable the members to set out a programme for their five years in office. Deputy Wilson appears to like the idea of five years in office, and so do I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe five years is a suitable period during which a strategy can be laid down.  This will be the business of the members of the Parliament.  I believe that eventually we will see a Parliament of full time professional European politicians taking the broader European view.  I have been a member of a county council in County Leitrim and like most other local authority representatives in this House, we come into this assembly, work in the national interest, and forget what the whip in the local authority might think of a decision we take here.  The same will apply in the European Parliament.  It may be difficult to get an unanimous decision in a Council of 12 but a unanimous decision of the Council will still have a final say.  A Parliament amending legislation cannot be overthrown by a minority on the Council who say they cannot vote for an item because it is against their national interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The veto never existed.  It was a compromise introduced out of a fear that the Community was about to disintegrate. <Col N="2014" /> I cannot recall an instance when it succeeded.  The British tried to impose their veto on this Act but they were told by the Community that that would not work.  The Danes tried the same thing, with the same results.  I do not believe there was any instance when a state imposed the veto and so prevented a decision being taken.  To say the veto protects our interests is saying that 11 other states also have the veto, that the British will forever have the right to say that the Community budget may not be extended, or that another rich member state may say the Regional Fund cannot be increased.  It became more obvious as we brought more members into the Community that if there was such a thing as a veto there would be no democracy. It is impossible to do anything which will not be against the interest of some region in the Community.  I recognise that a unanimous decision will be required in some instances, such as enlarging the Community, but nevertheless, the commitment to proceed by majority voting gives us the same voting rights as 50 million Germans.  This is the best we can hope for.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any member state needs the internal market more than the small member states.  That was recognised by Mr. Lemass many years ago.  He said if we were to grow up in the world we must learn to compete.  The structural fund can help us do this.  People who like easy options think we can introduce trade barriers and protect our manufacturers and that this will lead to economic progress, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Human nature being what it is, if we had trade barriers people would get lazy and inefficient.  We all recall the thirties where world trade shrank and countries began to protect their interests and boundaries.  We then had the war and 50 million were killed.  I am not saying that was the reason war broke out, but international tensions and protective barriers go together.  We need free trade because we are a small economy.  The Japanese sell approximately 14 per cent of what they produce.</P>
    <Col N="2015" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are cagey enough about buying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, but they bought 20 air buses at a cost of a few billion pounds in the last couple of days. This is the result of pressure from the 12 European states who up to now had not exerted enough pressure.  We have to recognise that the Japanese have their problems too, and that they are not as guilty as some other Eastern countries. In the last 12 months their currency revalued to the extent of 60 per cent against the American dollar and trade is suffering as a result.  Nevertheless, I take the Deputy's point that they have been guilty of unfair practices but they paid the price for their economic success.</P>
      <P>We cannot resolve our problems by resisting free trade.  If Europe were to tell us in the morning that there would no longer be a Regional Fund, Social Fund or Common Agricultural Policy, we would still have to ask them to allow us to trade freely with them because there is no other basis on which we could survive and if they maintained their Community preference in the area of agriculture, then we would face a real debacle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the co-operatives who claim that because we are in the periphery of Europe we cannot get as high a price for our milk as the other member states.  If we translate the cost of transporting a tonne of milk which has been reduced to skim milk powder from my constituency to London or to Brussels the transport costs are marginal.  Thanks to the pressure being exerted by Commissioner Sutherland on the airlines to reduce the cost of travel, I believe there will be an even further reduction in transport costs.  This is something the people with the soft options should think about again.  They think we can have an environment policy in Europe where we can make everybody clean up the environment. They think we can have social legislation which imposes minimum standards of living and that the people will <Col N="2016" /> still stay here.  That is where the danger lies.  We do not need a strong regional policy because we are developing the internal market; we need a strong regional policy because people will not make the sacrifices necessary to build up our economy when they can migrate to the cities of Europe and enjoy double the standard of living they would have in County Leitrim.  Why will anyone establish an industry in County Leitrim if the wages are the same as they are in Frankfurt and if environmental controls and so on are the same?  If we agree to have imposed on ourselves those standards which the people in Europe now accept but did not and would not have when they were at our stage of development, there is a risk that we will be prevented from working the long hours that people work in Taiwan and Japan.  We will be prevented from driving the long distances in trucks because of the tachograph.  Our fishermen will not be allowed to stay at sea for so many hours because of social legislation.  Our industries will be forced to invest in environmental protection. We can be prevented from living the hard life and making the sacrifices to catch up with the people who are obviously well ahead of us.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that the rich in Europe have been getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  The poor have been getting richer and the rich have been getting richer.  It is quite obvious that the gap has been widening but we have not been getting poorer as a result.  We have immense benefits.  We must demand strong regional policies.  It is quite obvious that we have to retain some advantages. We must be allowed, within the meaning of fair competition, to give aid and assistance.  Aid and assistance given to industries, particularly in the manufacturing and export areas, must be carefuly monitored.  The full rigours of the European system of justice must be brought to bear.  It would pay us more to develop our own strategy than it would to be seeking excuses to walk out of meetings about issues such as neutrality or sovereignty.</P>
    <P>Parliament got itself a bad name in <Col N="2017" /> Ireland because it tended to object to the Common Agricultural Policy as it is today.  When the milk quota system was introduced Parliament was the first institution in the Community to have special concern for the position of countries like Ireland.  Parliament does not like isolating individual states.  It referred to regions and economies that were highly dependent and that needed special consideration. Parliament held the same opinion in so far as the co-responsibility levy was concerned.  They recognised, while many observers in Europe did not, that the money being devoted to the Common Agricultural Policy was not going mainly to poor farmers in peripheral regions but to rich farmers with greater resources in more central and better developed regions.</P>
    <P>I am on record as saying quite a number of times in this House that the idea that our vocation in Europe is to protect the Common Agricultural Policy as it is is badly mistaken.  I represent, in my constituency of Connacht-Ulster, half the farmers of Ireland.  They are the poor farmers, the people whose figures made Ireland's case look good when we asked for concessions in Europe.  We did not present the farmers of the Golden Vale as being typical Irish or average Irish because if we did they would be shown to be better off than average among the dairy farmers in Europe.  We made our case for the Common Agricultural Policy because of the social problem of the large numbers of small farmers on the land of Europe but the money goes to the people in the Golden Vale and the more wealthy areas. Half the farmers of Ireland, in the Connacht-Ulster area, receive between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of the total aid whereas the other half receive the other 75 per cent.  That is the justice of the Common Agricultural Policy that many of us have been supporting.  The Parliament have seen through that.  Even the most rabid socialists in the European Parliament pointed out people who are hated because they are thought to be against agriculture, which they are not. They said that they would concede more money for the small farmer in the peripheral <Col N="2018" /> regions.  I heard that many times. In Parliament there is a will to share out money with the peripheral regions.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has to be re-examined because we have already run out of money.  Those who believe in the veto must recognise that other countries are in the same position. Some countries believe that the Common Agricultural Policy cannot and should not be further financed.  We must face up to that reality.  There is no use in our pointing out what countries are spending on nuclear weapons or armaments.  If they do not give the money we will not get it. While the Common Agricultural Policy as it is at present remains unchanged there will be a case to be made to the taxpayer of Europe against it.  It is not a regional or a social policy.  It is a policy that protects the interests of those who are well established and who produce a lot of goods.  It has been the victim of its own success.  It worked well in the days when the Community was scarce in food and when there was a market for that food.  Today the position is entirely different. From an agricultural point of view we get £900 million from the part of FEOGA that guarantees prices, buys milk into intervention and pays the export refunds.  We get a further £80 million from the guidance section which aids farmers in the development of their farm yards, buying of equipment, machinery and so on.  We devote £240 million in our own budget to agriculture. That all adds up to more than £1 billion. Total agricultural incomes are only £1,100 million.  If you take all this money together you could pay all the farmers of Ireland as much as they are earning without them having to produce anything. The farmers do not get the money.</P>
    <P>If we succeed in reducing the over-production in a limited number of areas in Europe by 7 per cent or 8 per cent &mdash; in Ireland it only applies to beef and milk &mdash; the farmer will get 80p for a gallon of milk but it costs more than that to dispose of it.  The farmer only makes 20p profit. Therefore, the Community is spending 80p to give the farmer 20p.  Obviously that does not make much sense.  If we <Col N="2019" /> had a reduction in output we could also reduce our costs and therefore we would not have to take the full reduction in income.  If the food processing industry was significantly competitive and if we sold our dairy and beef products on the European market then we would not need any subsidies and we would not have to go into intervention.  If our food processing industry buys the cheapest products in Europe, which it does, why can it not sell those products on the European market?  It is a very lucrative market and the only market in the world where we can sell these products.  We could then come in here and say, &ldquo;we are not getting any money from Europe for agriculture, we are simply selling in the European markets competitively and it is the Germans who are more inefficient in their agriculture than we are, or it is the British, the people of Luxembourg or the French who are selling to the Middle East, who are dumping their surpluses into intervention or on Third World markets and not us.&rdquo;  In those circumstances, we could say that we are not getting any money from Europe.  In fact, we would be talking about a European surplus, not an Irish surplus.  I do not see this entirely as a net transfer from Europe to Ireland and that this is exactly the size of the benefit we get.  The size of the benefit we get is the size of the market that is there to be exploited.  I do not think it serves Ireland's long-term interests to refuse to re-organise the CAP or to refuse to co-operate in the reduction of surpluses.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that that £900 million that comes to us is aid to Irish agriculture and that by eliminating the surpluses we can get that money delivered to Ireland in the form of aid under the Regional Fund or the Social Fund.  We must bear in mind that any transfer from the guarantee side of agriculture to the Regional or Social Funds will give Ireland more money because a higher percentage of funds come to Ireland from those funds than from the guarantee fund.  That change would benefit the Irish economy, if not the individual farmers.  The interests of <Col N="2020" /> farmers have to be catered for in another way, by a better marketing system for our food and by bringing agriculture in the Community into balance.  If we had the £900 million, we could have the equivalent of 30 western packages running concurrently and fully financed instead of financed to the extent of 50 per cent by the EC.  I ask Members to try to imagine what that would do for the agricultural structure and the general infrastructure of our country over a short period.</P>
    <P>We should be prepared to look at this and at trade changes in agriculture for increased Regional Fund and Social Fund spending.  At the same time, we should take the interests of our farmers into consideration by ensuring a better marketing system and seeking to reduce costs in our economy.  I do not think it must necessarily result in any reduced income for Irish farmers.  Since the introduction of the levy on the Continent, the experience has been that costs have been reduced and efficiency in agriculture has improved to the extent that incomes have gone up.  Increased money is being made on a reduced amount and we could achieve the same success here.  However, while their incomes are going up with reduced output, our incomes are declining with increased output which they conceded to us.  I have to say that that is a reflection on the performance of our own economy and the way we handled our own affairs.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the main areas involved and pointed out that there is nothing startling or serious in what we are doing.  The important significance of the Single European Act is a political one, the recognition of failure over the years and the will to resume again with slightly changed roles and a slightly extended agenda.  I do not think a referendum is required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey quoted Mr. Pescatore selectively.  He should have read the full text of what that former judge of the European Court of Justice said.  I should like to quote what he said about what happened in Denmark.</P>
    <P>However, the fact is that the Danish <Col N="2021" /> electorate voted on an Act whose terms it did not know since it did not exist at the time when the referendum was held.  If the Danish public had been correctly informed, the opponents of the Common Market&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I offer this by way of consolation to the extreme elements of some parties who do not want progress in the EC &mdash; the Irish Sovereignty Movement, CND, the Friends of Marxism and those who have combined to create the impression that there is a strong body of opinion in Ireland against European Union and development in the Community.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash; would have had to approve the European Act because it is the surest means of undermining the basis of the Community.  The outcome of the referendum will gratify them despite themselves.</P>
    <P>That is a strictly legal interpretation.  The judge was not so specific on the power between Parliament and the Council.  He regretted the three months' delay in Parliament and the one month's delay in Council stating that it slowed up the procedures. However, I agree with his interpretation, like Deputy Lenihan, that Parliament will have an enhanced role. Deputy Lenihan is afraid of that but I welcome it.  My experience in Europe has led me to believe that that institution is much more democratic and more concerned about weaker regions than the Council of Ministers.  The Parliament puts forward its own views rather than being the voice of public servants who do their job well but are not representatives of the public like politicians.</P>
    <P>Many speakers devoted a good deal of time to the question of neutrality and I have no doubt that others will comment on it.  My view on that subject is well known.  I believe that Irish neutrality does not exist in the first place, that we are not really neutral and that we ought not to be neutral, that it is not a practical strategy for us as a member of a Community whose objective is full political and economic union and is not morally right, as Deputy Kelly said.  Deputy Kelly asked <Col N="2022" /> if it was a credit to us to be neutral when six million innocent people were herded into the gas chambers and concentration camps.  He asked if we were proud of ourselves that we stood by and said it was none of our business.  However, today we are prepared to enter into an association with the survivors of that war.  We are prepared to tell those people that we will sit at their table, share their food and everything else available, that we will demand more from the Regional and Social Funds but if their house is attacked, it will not be any concern of ours and we will run away.  People would have Ireland lie like a lazy dog under the European table and refuse to bark if robbers attacked the house.  I do not think that is what the majority of Irish people want. In my view, the majority do not see themselves as having no care or concern for their neighbour in the European Community.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that we are not talking about a bunch of quarrelsome belligerant nations who have developed aggressive systems, have policies to impede the progress of others or prevent others from making their own decisions. We have a group of European nations who came together more out of fear of war than anything else.  It is worth noting that Britain, France and Italy came together to form the Western European Union because they recognised the re-growth of German influence in the world. They thought that the Federal Republic of Germany could within a short period constitute a threat to peace in the world. Therefore, they said, &ldquo;They are growing again, they are getting strong, their economy is coming forward, so we had better get together&rdquo;.  Today, West Germany is a member of the Western European Union.  That organisation was founded to prevent its expansion and aggression.</P>
    <P>Things have changed rapidly in the world.  NATO has been there for a number of years and has survived many difficulties.  I do not know how long it will survive.  I associate with the Christian Democrats in Europe who are very security conscious.  The socialist side in the European Parliament was not so concerned <Col N="2023" /> about security and did not seem to be concerned about the possibility of international conflict, and did not put the same emphasis on rearmament.</P>
    <P>I do not notice any concern in Europe to force Ireland into any sort of alliance. They are proud to have us there as a neutral member state, as some sort of an in-between with a negotiating capacity, though Deputy Lenihan seems to disagree. I do not think the other member states are very concerned to get us into NATO or the Western European Union. They rightly judge it would not make the slightest difference whether we were a member of that organisation or not. Deep down in their minds I can detect a reaction, a disappointment from time to time.  For instance, they support a motion, for increased money for Ireland from the Regional or Social Funds or aid for farmers in the west of Ireland who were affected by bad weather and then something comes up about the security of Europe and I can sense disappointment, a failure to understand what gives us the right to expect benefits as a member of the family without any responsibility.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the House to be reasonable about this.  What interest does neutrality serve?  I tend to think that the danger of world conflict is receding.  I am happier about it than I was when America was deploying armaments a couple of years ago.  In China, the giant of the East, we have seen slow liberalisation, what appears to be a realisation that the western system is not all bad.  We have seen economic progress in Asia when people have become more comfortable.  There are better prospects that they will trade and travel and communicate and understand peoples better.</P>
    <P>However, if there is a threat there, what sort of people are we who will say that we will enjoy all the good things that EC membership has to offer but if there is danger we will have no part of it?  What service do we think we are doing to the Irish people?  We have learned from recent events that it does not make much difference whether we are neutral or not. If a conventional war is fought and if <Col N="2024" /> anybody wants part of our territory they can have it; our little Army, good and all as they may be, are badly equipped and badly financed.  Obviously, this democracy is not prepared to devote the resources that we need to give to our Army.  Nevertheless, if we were to say to our European colleagues that we have not much to offer as a participant in the Western European Union by way of defence but that we recognise the way of life in western Europe is good, that nobody in that area wants to perpetrate aggression against anybody else, and that in the event of attack we in Ireland would participate as best we could to defend the interests of everybody, we would be serving Ireland better.</P>
    <P>That is what we were saying when we became a member of the EC in the first place.  To say anything else now is to sell the Irish people short.  What is happening is that a small minority of people who are good at writing to the newspapers, at making noise, at getting scare headlines in the media, have imposed this sort of policy on the Irish people.  Deputy Kelly earlier said he did not believe that former Taoiseach and President, Mr. de Valera, was the sort of man who would say that Ireland is a neutral country and will be. Recently I read what Mr. de Valera said about this in 1918.  He said that in the event of our interests being threatened this nation may take part in a conflict on one side or on the other side, or it may be neutral.  He was being pragmatic, he was saying that a situation might develop in which it would be in our interests to be on one side or the other or that we might decide we ought not to be involved. I can imagine that Mr. de Valera, Mr. Lemass, Mr. Costello or our other leaders would say to the Irish people that if this club is worth joining it is worth defending.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this to rub people's noses in it.  People have a right to change their policies if they want to.  Policies have changed.  When we first applied for EC membership the message that Mr. Lemass gave to the Irish people and those in Europe was that this is not just a free <Col N="2025" /> trade agreement.  He said we were entering into a relationship with countries who had decided that the final objective was economic and political union and that that imposed obligations on us.  Mr. Lemass had begun to say to the Irish people that they would have to face up to their responsibilities.  I will quote from a document, <i>Journal of Common Market Studies,</i> under the heading &ldquo;Ireland: A Neutral in the Community&rdquo;.  It refers to our former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass:</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, then, in this atmosphere, Mr. Lemass began to desanctify neutrality, emphasising the circumstantial nature.  In 1960 he announced, &ldquo;There is no neutrality and we are not neutral.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are references which are a bit difficult &mdash; I would need a magnifying glass. It goes on:</P>
    <P>In 1962 he seemed impelled to try to defuse the Irish opposition to NATO, emphasising that Ireland must not give the impression that it regarded membership of NATO as something discreditable. &ldquo;We must rethink the existence of NATO is necessary for the preservation of peace and for the defence of the countries of western Europe, including this country. Although we are not members of NATO we are in full agreement with its aims.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In an interview with the <i>New York Times</i> he went even further: &ldquo;We recognise that limited commitment will be an inevitable consequence of our joining the Common Market and ultimately we would be prepared to yield even the technical nature of neutrality. We are prepared to go into an integrated Europe without any reservation as to how far this would take us in the field of foreign policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In his opening statement to the Council of Ministers in January 1962, Mr. Lemass made clear Irish agreement with the general aims of NATO, the acceptance of the idea of European unity and of the &ldquo;deconception&rdquo; embodied in the Treaty of Rome and <Col N="2026" /> the Bonn Declaration on the duties, obligations and responsibilities which European unity would impose.</P>
    <P>That makes it clear that Mr. Lemass then recognised that EC membership would impose obligations on us.  He was saying that as this Community developed, those obligations would have to be honoured. It is more surprising to find also in this same document the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey (at that time Minister for Finance) saying, on the occasion of a motion he put before this Parliament, that he recognised that it was important for countries to come together to make common arrangements for their own defence, and he taunted the Labour opposition by asking what was wrong with that.  Mr. Lynch, who was Taoiseach at that time, declared that we had no traditional policy of neutrality in this country.  Unlike countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Austria who have declared themselves as having permanent policies of neutrality, Ireland's Constitution ensures that we can make up our minds on our neutrality in the light of circumstances prevailing; moreover, if there was a war between atheistic communism and freedom and Christianity then Parliament or people would not be neutral.  The Foreign Minister, Mr. Hillery, declared that we had never adopted a permanent policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>I quote this to indicate that the views I hold were the views that were held by leaders of Fianna Fáil in the years when they thought it was important for us to join the Community.  I would say that there is something dishonourable in the approach being adopted today.  At that stage we were prepared to say we recognised the importance of the defence of western Europe; that we recognised that the development of the political and economic union would require us to meet our obligations and that we would be quite prepared to do this as the Community developed.  Today, having secured a seat at the table, having had the benefit of the Common Agricultural Policy, having had what I regard as a lift <Col N="2027" /> in our own national status in the world as a result of being a member of this Community, having enjoyed higher standards of living as a result, we act as if we have no obligations.  If we have emigration &mdash; and we have &mdash; the three million people in Britain who left here and became aliens in another land now have a stamped deed from the European Community for their right to a job, property and business any place they want to go in any part of the 12 member states of the European Community &mdash; and of course others have the same rights here. All these benefits we have taken, and now we say we are neutral, we always have been and, regardless of the situation or the circumstances, we have no obligation to defend our neighbours' or our own interests, that we will take a free ride, live in the shelter of this Community.</P>
    <P>I have said from the beginning I do not see any pressure.  In Europe we have the Green Movement demanding the removal of missiles, demanding that missiles must not be replaced, and we had extreme socialists and strong opinion in Europe.  But when President Reagan went to Reykjavik and almost made his agreement, I could detect a paling of faces throughout Europe at the thought that an American President could suddenly, without consultation and without agreement, decide to lift this umbrella under which the people of Europe had lived in security for many years, so that suddenly the countries of western Europe would be faced with the use of their own conventional forces and the reappraisal of the opposition as far as security was concerned.  Suddenly they began to realise that this is not a permanent union involving the United States.  I certainly hope that east and west will not be any sort of permanent enemies, but we have no guarantee that the Atlantic Alliance will hold up.  Consider the American budget deficit and consider the demands being made in the United States itself for a reduction of spending.  We in western Europe above all places in the world know, having developed a pattern of <Col N="2028" /> social spending, how hard it is to reduce it.  From a political point of view in the United States it might be easier for an American President to cut something of the £100 billion that they spend annually on protecting the people of Europe because, honestly, they are doing that to a certain extent.  If they decide, in certain economic circumstances, to withdraw that sort of spending, and, if the countries of Europe feel the need &mdash; and I hope that will not happen &mdash; at least to close some part of the gap left either by the withdrawal of American support or a reduction in it by increased spending on defence, there would not at that stage be a lot of sympathy for the social and regional problems of a country like Ireland if the European taxpayers had to dip deep into their own pockets to finance their own defence which has been financed for them by the United States for many years.</P>
    <P>I can also see another situation developing. As the strong opposition in Britain says, if they achieve a position of power they will require the Americans to remove their nuclear weapons.  In that event the Americans, on hearing that from one of their oldest allies, might wonder what point is there in the United States continuing with the defence of Europe indefinitely and might decide on a phased, slow or sudden withdrawal. Anything can happen and in those circumstances Ireland had better be prepared to look at its position.</P>
    <P>We had better tell the people of Ireland the truth, that we cannot really divorce, in any serious way, the security of any people from their economic and social wellbeing.  It simply is not possible to say we can enjoy a standard of living, we can build factories and have all these good things and that there will never come a day when these will be threatened by outside influences or effects of what happens outside.  It is absolute nonsense to believe that a country can indefinitely participate in the development of what was agreed to when we joined the EC, the full economic and political development of this union, while at the same time saying this does not carry any obligations. <Col N="2029" /> At least we can look back to wiser statesmen like Mr. Lemass, Mr. Lynch, and Mr. Haughey before he became obsessed with winning votes at any price so that he no longer feels an obligation to live up to the commitments that he made in the past.</P>
    <P>It is shame for us to try to mislead our people into believing that in the end we are not going in a direction which will involve us in a union with our neighbours for better or worse.  But this Act has nothing to do with that.  In spite of all that has been said it brings us closer only to the extent that it brings European union closer, and to the extent that European union comes closer &mdash; and most politicians in this House want that &mdash; then the day will come when some sort of involvement by the Irish people in the defence of our own heritage, our own standards of living and our own homes will oblige us to participate.</P>
    <P>When we first proposed that Ireland should become a member of the EC we sold this idea to the Irish people on the basis of a common agricultural policy, on the basis of a regional fund, on the basis of transfers of wealth and butter going into intervention.  In spite of what I quoted Mr. Lemass as saying, we oversold that idea.  We told the people that membership of the EC brought us nothing but benefits and no obligations. After 12 years I can see that we have got a lot of benefits and discharged very few obligations.  I cannot see what contribution we have made.  We have been speaking mostly in broad terms about progress in the Community, but we were quite prepared, in the interests of a small section and a small group and of short term benefit to the Irish economy to hold up the decision-making process.  I hope that no country will be able to hold up the decision-making process in the future.  We could have said to the people that this imposes obligations on us as well as conferring benefits.  I do not believe that the people would reject a leadership that told them the truth about their obligations. I recently heard somebody who represented interests in Israel quoting an old Jewish philosopher who said, &ldquo;If I am <Col N="2030" /> not working for myself, who will do so; but if I am only working for myself, what am I at all?&rdquo;  I might refer that question to Ireland's position in Europe.  Of course we have to mind our own interests, of course we must design policies to accommodate the needs of our people, but if that is all we are concerned about, then we must pose the question: what are we at all and where are our leaders taking us?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I heard Deputy McCartin say &mdash; pointing his hand out in front of him: &ldquo;your Community needs you&rdquo; and he indulged in a very strong militaristic plea for the involvement of this country in the military affairs of Europe. The logic of saying that because we get something from the Common Agricultural Policy, because we get something from the social policy, because we get something from the regional policy, we should join a military alliance in Europe escapes me completely seeing that the Europeans themselves, at any level, have never claimed any direct link between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment on the inadequate provision for discussion of the Single European Act and to castigate the Government for not making such provision. It was only after a long period of aggression from the Opposition benches that we succeeded finally in having a document produced outlining what the Single European Act was about.  Very many important groupings in the State were anxious to have that debate, to have the issues outlined, clarified and discussed; that was only what those various groupings were entitled to.  We did have documentation emanating from various groupings.  There were letters, pamphlets, roneoed sheets from various people who had a special interest in the matter.  For example, there was the Irish Council for the European Movement who were in defence of the Single European Act.  There were the Irish Sovereignty Movement who keep an eye on the sovereignty part of the issue.  Then there were ACOT and An Foras Talún-tais <Col N="2031" /> highly concerned about the Common Agricultural Policy, about which Deputy McCartin spoke a great deal, and about the change in decision-making and how that might affect the Common Agricultural Policy.  There was Conradh na Gaeilge with their philosophy, beliefs and outlook.  Then there was the CND. Indeed more people listened to the CND on this issue than had been the case before.  I believe that change was brought about mainly by the horrific result of the accident at Chernobyl in the USSR recently.  Many people are beginning to say that those people who were regarded as crackpots had an awful lot more going for them and made a lot more sense than we ever gave them credit for.  This was a result &mdash; and Deputy McCartin alluded to this as well &mdash; of seeing the meat of lambs in North Wales affected when the accident occurred in the southern part of the USSR.  Then there was Pax Christi &mdash; I and all other Deputies received communications from them &mdash; applying their Christian beliefs to problems raised by the Single European Act.  All of these groupings had this legitimate concern. For that reason I cannot understand how there was such a hugger-mugger approach by the Government in this House to an open discussion of what was at issue.  We on this side of the House, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, kept harping on the necessity to get more information and have more discussion. The House will remember that the Taoiseach promised a leabhrán &mdash; lá na Gaeilge a bhí ann &mdash; to indicate what were the issues and what was Government policy on them.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Single European Act is not an Act in the strict Oireachtas sense of the word, that it is really a Treaty.  I shall go over some of the issues in the Treaty as well as reading Deputy V. Brady's suggestion for a declaration by the Government of Ireland under Article 13 and on Title III.</P>
    <P>The Milan European Council meeting of 1985 expressed a desire for concrete progress towards European union.  An atmosphere developed over a number of <Col N="2032" /> years to the effect that &mdash; leaving out the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo;&mdash; the whole European Community mystique was faltering, that all of the efforts to develop the Community in the way in which its founding fathers had envisaged was weakening.  I believe it was.  I believe also that the Community itself and its institutions are responsible for that happening.  I remember when the whole idea was mooted. We had the original Six and then we had the effort to spread the area of the Community over a greater part of Europe.  We had a basic idealism at that time, a Monnet idealism.  When it was mooted in this country there were a number of organisations, particularly in the cultural field, established with a view to progressing the idea of European union.  They based their philosophy on a shared European culture with a Judeo/ Greco/Roman/Christian basis or substratum in the thinking and philosophy of Western Europe.  That was forgotten very quickly.  I remember the European Association of Teachers was established here.  That association represented the teaching profession over all the countries of the EC and of the prospective countries of the EC at that time.  I am convinced that that was the right place to begin and to sustain interest in the Community. But we developed the idea that man did live on bread alone or on bread and butter, or butter and milk or milk and beef.  We have been totally preoccupied with economics.  I do not want to be ultra-idealistic or lacking in realism in this context but it is no wonder the whole idea faltered when the philosophic base was forgotten and when concentration was heavy on pure economics.  The Europeans themselves were conscious of this at one time and advocated the dropping of the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; and of giving more substance to the idea of a Community.</P>
    <P>We walked away from what was the whole motivation of the original founders. As a result the faltering took place and the leaders in the various countries that constitute the EC were conscious of that.  The Milan meeting was conscious of it and said they would have to do <Col N="2033" /> something about it.  Realpolitik had not achieved what the founding fathers of the Community envisaged and ambitioned. There was nothing to fructify, nurture or fertilise the Euro ideal that we talked about at the foundation.  There was nothing but stagnation and it was inevitable that that should happen.</P>
    <P>I remember as Minister for Education how difficult it was to get any movement in that field.  Countries were looking at the Treaty and saying that there was nothing in the Treaty specifically which helped them to make an initiative in the area of education.  That is not true because by implication the Treaty which gave the freedom of establishment in the various countries must have meant also that there would be a movement in education, for example, which would enable people to establish in the various countries of the EC.  I remember taking an initiative and trying to advance the idea because I had the view that in our schools at second level and third level and in the research field we were negligent in so far as European studies were concerned.  In consultation with European Ministers for Education at that time I was convinced that that was true of other countries as well and that there was great ignorance in individual countries about the history, culture and economics of the various other members of the EC.  Denmark in particular were &mdash; and I think still are &mdash; exceptionally cautious about any movement that would give a status to education under the Treaty.  France was not quite so strong but exceptionally cautious about it and Britain always maintained that in this field they had localised educational structures and that they could not fit them into any kind of European setting.  Now the local structures are to be dispensed with and there is to be more centralisation.  Whether that will bring about any change I do not know.  We would not have that faltering in Europe had the proper educational initiative been taken.</P>
    <P>What third level institution in Ireland has specialised in European studies? There are in the new NIHE some faculties <Col N="2034" /> or departments who deal with this area but one cannot say that European studies have impacted very heavily on our universities.  On the eve of our joining the EC I discovered that in one important department of one of our major universities no congnisance whatsoever had been taken of European commerce, European economics or European law at that time.  Therefore, if the idea faltered it faltered because it was not nurtured or sustained.  The economics of the Parliament, the Commission, the Council of Ministers and so on became paramount and as a result people developed the idea, &ldquo;What can I grab out of this?  I must get the most I can whatever happens with regard to the European ideal.&rdquo;  I am talking here and there are people who would say: &ldquo;That man has not his feet on the ground at all.&rdquo;  I suppose it would be a legitimate accusation to level at me but anybody who examines what has happened will have to concede that we need something more than disputes about butter, beef, olive oil, wine and all the other subjects that are paramount in European discussion and debate at present.</P>
    <P>On page 7 of the leabhrán we have the statement:</P>
    <P>The Single European Act represents the culmination of a process of debate and negotiation within the European Community in recent years on how the impetus towards progress on European integration could be restored and strengthened.</P>
    <P>The very words chosen there are an indication of the truth of what I am saying, that there is a necessity for restoration and strengthening of what had become a very weak motivation on the part of the participating countries.</P>
    <P>I will take the first point here about the European Parliament.  The Single European Act in so far as it gives a stronger role to the European Parliament should be welcomed by this House.  I quote now from page 14:</P>
    <P>Articles 8 and 9 also provide in relation to Article 237 ... and <Col N="2035" /> Article 238 ..... of the existing EEC Treaty, that such agreements will henceforth require the assent of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament is in a rather strange kind of position.  We understand a Parliament to be effective in making laws.  The European Parliament is directly elected now but has not got the power to make laws.  Indeed, when you consider the ideological mix in the Parliament now, it might be a very hazardous thing to advocate that it should have, at this stage at any rate, direct law making powers but the fact that this Single European Act gives it more status than it had previously, that it has to assent to certain agreements, is bound to enhance its position in the Community.  According to this paper it is a modest enhancing of the role and stature of the European Parliament and the Community's decision making process and offers the Parliament scope for increasing its influence.  Everybody in this House would agree that that is desirable as far as the democratic process is concerned.</P>
    <P>Another area which should command our support is the high technology provision in the Single European Act.  At the period that I have mentioned the people who were advocating on a philosophic basis that we should have a European Community as such advocated, even at that early stage in the early sixties when the late Seán Lemass first put the idea forward of joining the Community, that this would be an important area in the future.  That is almost a generation ago now.  It shows the wisdom of the original thinkers who were responsible for this. Unfortunately, what has spurred them on now to do this &mdash; and again it shows a philosophic weakness &mdash; is the effect of Japanese and US developments in this field.  The development has been so great and the competition in the manufactured goods area has been so keen that the Community is impelled now to do something about it because if they do not they will end up as a technological backwater. It is an area in which we should be <Col N="2036" /> interested.  It is not merely an industrial area but an educational area.  We have made considerable strides in this area since we joined the Community and since the early sixties.  It is consoling to know that the products of our education system have, against European competition, on a number of occasions succeeded in taking the European prize in open competition, when we enter the winner of the Aer Lingus Young Scientist of the Year Competitions.</P>
    <P>The completion of the market by 1992 has drawn a good deal of interest and has excited quite a number of fears.  I make no apology for harking back to the origin of the idea that we should join the Community. At that time there was strong emphasis on the fact that there was a quadrangle of heavily developed industry in the heart of Europe and it was stressed that the Regional Fund, more so than the Social Fund which assumed more significance as time went on, would be utilised to counteract the magnet in the centre of Europe drawing everything towards itself.  Nobody could say that that is an urgent part of the European philosophy at the moment.  I do not believe in Ireland being the baksheesh candidate in Europe on all occasions, and we should not develop a reputation for having the begging bowl out all the time but we should take a cold look at economic development.  We should take a cold hard look at the areas that are being left behind and hard decisions should be taken to deploy the Regional Fund in these areas.</P>
    <P>The already established practice of the heads of State or heads of Government meetings gets formal recognition in the Single European Act.  The people who complain that these meetings, not having any root in the Treaty of Rome, have assumed too much significance, are now answered, in that a decision is being taken to incorporate formally into the treaty these meetings of the heads of State and heads of Government.  Sometimes they are more damaging than helpful in the European context in that on occasion they have aroused hopes and encouraged speculation as to what they could achieve and then when the bland communiques <Col N="2037" /> were issued people were disappointed to discover &mdash; and the one in London recently was an example &mdash; that nothing very much had been achieved despite the fact that there were very high powered representatives of the various nations meeting, with the expertise of these nations at their disposal.  That can have a damaging effect in much the same way as the concentration on the economic matters exclusively over the past number of years has damaged the whole idea of a united Europe.</P>
    <P>The co-operation envisaged between the Council of Ministers and the Parliament in articles 6 and 7 is part of enhancing the role of the European Parliament which is directly elected now and must be allowed to develop its muscle in the structures of the EC.</P>
    <P>I would not like to talk for too long about the new provisions for the qualified majority but there is certainly a new danger to small countries in having the qualified majority provisions applied over a certain range of decisions in Europe.  Perhaps we may be a little too timid but we should be careful and not give away a weapon which we can use.  It has been said during the course of this debate that there is an awful lot of talk about the veto but that it is seldom if ever applied.  That is true but it is also true that the veto is there and this must impact on decision makers in such a way as to lead them to seek out every possible avenue to a solution to a problem, to travel down every road to seek a compromise so that they can get a Community decision which will command the support of everybody in a given situation.</P>
    <P>I would be very careful about giving extra powers to the Commission.  The Taoiseach visited my constituency and in answer to a question quoted in the local paper he said that the Commission has power and competence in that regard and that there is nothing we can do about it.  The Commission is being given extra powers on implementation and management. I would like a little further teasing out of the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; in those circumstances.  Originally the Commission <Col N="2038" /> was regarded as the power house of ideas in the Community.  The ideas were presented to Parliament, political decisions were made and they came back to the Commission for implementation. Perhaps, at times the political process frustrated the best efforts of the Commission in presenting ideas and policies for the benefit of Europe but I would be more than cautious about giving the Commission any new powers.  I would like to get the views of the people who have expertise in this area as to what exactly is meant by &ldquo;management&rdquo; and &ldquo;implementation&rdquo; powers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Calleary has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the unease and dissatisfaction felt by members of the staff of the drainage section of the Office of Public Works in relation to the rumours which continue to persist about the disbandment of that section.  He has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Chomhairle, first of all, I would like to thank you for the opportunity of raising on the Adjournment this very important and far reaching matter and I have with your permission agreed to allocate five minutes to Deputy O'Kennedy who also has an interest in this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried for the last few weeks to seek information from the Dáil, where I attempted some time ago to raise this matter on the Adjournment but I was unsuccessful, and from the office of the Minister of State.  While I suspected that there were changes in the offing I must admit that I was not prepared for the very far reaching decisions &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;decisions&rdquo; because that is the word which was used in the reply which was given today to Deputy De Rossa &mdash; which had been taken and which were conveyed <Col N="2039" /> in the reply to Deputy De Rossa's written question which he put down today.</P>
    <P>Four years ago the Government promised us open government.  They promised a Government of consultation and discussion. What has happened since?  We have a Government by stealth and a Government prepared to make major changes in three or four Government Departments without any consultation with the staff or with the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is only three weeks since the Supplementary Estimate for the Office of Public Works was discussed in this House.  At that time the Minister of State did not see fit to indicate that there were major changes in the offing and in all probability that this was the last Estimate which would be introduced for the Office of Public Works even though I see another Supplementary Estimate passing through.  In effect, he was announcing the wake of the Office of Public Works. One could pose the question whether the marine works section will now be transferred to the Department of Fisheries. Already, the education section, the section which was concerned with school building, of the Office of Public Works has been transferred to the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that I was not given the information that I sought.  It appears that Fianna Fáil Deputies, Government backbench Deputies, Ministers and Ministers of State made calls but they received the same answer, that no changes were envisaged in the various sections of the Office of Public Works, particularly the section concerned with maintenance.  The implications of the Government's decision are in essence the abolition of the Office of Public Works. If one takes the answer which was given today at face value it means that local authorities will be asked in future to contribute towards new drainage schemes in addition to paying for maintenance afterwards.  It means also that farmers will have to contribute to new schemes and their maintenance.</P>
    <P>Again, the Government have created another revenue collector but this time <Col N="2040" /> they are asking committees who in many areas have been set up to help monitor drainage schemes to be the new revenue collectors.  These committees are now going to have the task of collecting revenue for the new drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>The good news in the reply which was given to Deputy De Rossa today was that responsibility for paying for arterial drainage maintenance will be transferred from the local authorities to the Department of Agriculture.  Just in case the local authorities thought they were going to receive a rebate from the Government one has only to read paragraph 16 of the reply which says the proposals mean a transfer of responsibility for arterial drainage maintenance from the local authorities to the Department of Agriculture and that the annual amount required by the Department of Agriculture for maintenance &mdash; here is the rub &mdash; will be deducted from the rates support grant of the Department of the Environment Vote.  Arrears payable by local authorities to the Office of Public Works &mdash; here is an even greater rub &mdash; for maintenance works carried out in the past will also be deducted from the rates support grant.  The period over which the arrears will be payable will be settled in consultation with the Department of the Environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position with regard to the Owenmore in County Sligo. One might ask what about the Mulcair in County Tipperary and County Limerick? Once the new criteria are put into operation will all the work which has been carried out on both these rivers have to be redone?  The reply stated that future arterial drainage schemes will be undertaken on the basis of the revised criteria agreed with the Department of Finance and following formal consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry.  What will happen to the staff <Col N="2041" /> in the various offices while this work is going on?</P>
      <P>There are also suggestions that the merits of carrying out works by contract rather than by direct labour will be assessed to ensure that works are carried out as cheaply as possible.  That is a very good suggestion but the reality is, and I am sure the Minister of State who has been involved in drainge for many years would agree, that in this area there is no way contract work can be cheaper than direct labour.  My information is that cross-sections on the main channels in particular are done only every 100 yards. From my limited experience in this matter if work such as this was to be prepared so that it could go out on contract these cross-sections would have to be taken at approximately 25ft. so as to give the contractor a picture of the river bottom.  It is easy to see why the staff in the various offices are becoming extremely worried about the situation now existing.</P>
      <P>What will be the cost of supervision of these schemes?  One can imagine the cartels which will be set up because there are very few contractors who have the necessary equipment to carry out the main drainage schemes.  There are only one or two contractors who can carry out schemes on the Shannon, on the Mulcair or on the Owenmore.  Can the Minister of State now explain the position of the existing staff on maintenance work?  The only reference to the staff and their future in the reply is that the necessary action in regard to staffing in the Office of Public Works and in the Department of Agriculture as a result of these decisions will be examined immediately by an interdepartmental committee.  I understand that that committee met today.  The reply at paragraph 17 also states that it is intended that the staffing consequences of these decisions &mdash; I note the word &ldquo;decisions&rdquo;&mdash; will be examined by an inter-departmental committee in which the Departments of the Public Service, Finance and Agriculture and the Office of Public Works will be represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an indication of the Government's contempt for the consultative process <Col N="2042" /> that major and far reaching decisions such as these can be taken without any consultation with the unions involved or with those who are directly involved in this skilled work.  From reading the reply one would think that no studies or cost analysis benefit has been carried out up to now.  I ask once again what will be the position of the staff?</P>
    <P>Long before this answer was given, the staff had an idea of what was involved. What will be their position in relation to maintenance work under these new criteria?  It will take months for each channel to be examined on the basis of these criteria.  What will be the situation in an area which badly needs drainage but where small farmers will not be able to contribute?  The Minister of State is well aware than many farmers have no money to contribute towards maintenance work or new drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 13 of the reply, dealing with contract work, is nothing but a slander on the engineering and professional staff of the Office of Public Works.  It is, to say the least, a stretching of the truth.  It states:</P>
    <P>The carrying out of arterial drainage works by direct labour makes cost control difficult as variations in the duration of projects can be made too easily.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State has been involved in trying to get extra channels done and he must know the difficulty of adding extra work to any drainage scheme.  Very strict criteria already exist and the final decision is a political one made by the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works or by the Minister for Finance.  It was always a political decision, made after a cost-benefit analysis.</P>
    <P>One of the most deplorable suggestions in the reply is that schemes might be abandoned.  This is typical of a Government whose inaction, bad judgment and cowardice on the European scene has brought agriculture to its knees.  These proposals will penalise further farmers who are in many cases heavily in debt. The whole exercise is an indication of <Col N="2043" /> the Government's move towards a new alliance, further away from their companions in Coalition towards new bed-fellows. It is another indication that what Senator Flor O'Mahony said this morning was correct.  Fine Gael are preparing an election platform that will take them far away from their Labour partners.</P>
    <P>The implications for local authorities are unbelievable.  The proposals will mean a transfer of responsibility for arterial drainage maintenance from local authorities to the Department of Agriculture. In effect, the Department of Agriculture will get the money from the Department of the Environment, who will deduct if from the grants to local authorities, who are already completely under-financed.  Local authorities will be relieved of the statutory demand from the Office of Public Works but will have the cost deducted from grants paid to them by the Department of the Environment. When will legislation be introduced to make the necessary changes in the Act covering arterial drainage or changes in the statutory demands on local authorities?</P>
    <P>The rumour that maintenance is being reduced next year to £2 million from approximately £6.5 million this year must now be given credence in view of the accuracy with which various offices were able to anticipate the reply to this question. There will be a drastic reduction in maintenance staff and it means that offices like Ballina and Headford will have their personnel greatly reduced. There is grave dissatisfation and unease along the western seaboard regarding what is to happen.  It is little wonder that the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants are calling an extraordinary general meeting in Dublin on 17 December.  People in the arterial drainage offices feel unwanted and cast aside after years of loyal service in a job for which they have a special expertise.  How can the Minister of State explain away lack of consultation with the unions in this case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very complimentary to the Chair.  In my years in this House I have never experienced a Government proposal of such far reaching and drastic consequences coming in a written reply to a Parliamentary Question. The rest of us would not have been aware of the contents of this reply were it not for the diligence of my colleague, Deputy Calleary, and also Deputy Treacy, who has been following this matter for so long.  In effect, the Office of Public Works is being abolished as far as arterial drainage is concerned.  It is outrageous that this &ldquo;open&rdquo; Government should attempt to pass this through a written reply.  Reaction among the public will demonstrate how they feel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the conseqences is that existing arterial drainage schemes on the priority list of the Office of Public Works will be abandoned.  The first project on the priority list happens to be the Mulcair River in my constituency and the constituency of East Limerick.  Just when this project has reached top priority we are told that the schemes at planning stage or on the OPW priority list, and the Shannon, will be for reassessment by the Minister for Agriculture in the objective manner proposed in the review; but existing schemes, will, of course, be continued to completion.  Are we supposed to say &ldquo;thanks&rdquo;?  That is the end of the Mulcair River drainage programme. What will replace it?  When a new programme is set up under the Minister for Agriculture the farmers will be allowed to make a contribution themselves &mdash; farmers benefit from drainage, so from now on farmers pay for drainage.  That is the thanks they get for all their representations and efforts.  I want to give the Minister some idea of the ability of these farmers to pay.  In Newport, which has been devastated by flooding, milk production is down 16 per cent this year, <Col N="2045" /> while feed costs are up 40 per cent.  In Cappaghmore milk production is down 11.3 per cent and feed costs are up 31 per cent.  Yet these are the farmers who are to be asked to contribute to the cost of drainage.  It is an outrageous decision.</P>
    <P>We know about the Department of Agriculture and the drainage problems in Tipperary.  We have the Ballyfinboy river in North Tipperary.  Because the Minister has totally and utterly failed to pay adequate sums for the drainage of that river and the Suir, what will happen when one adds the Mulcair river to the list?  This is a sad day.  It is a outrageous breach of parliamentary democracy that this announcement should be made in that fashion.  The Government will hear an awful lot more about it.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance to-day in a written reply to question from Deputy De Rossa informed the House that the Government had made a number of decisions affecting arterial drainage.  The main thrust of the decisions is to assign reponsibility for arterial drainage to the Minister for Agriculture as, in the Government's view, he is in the best position to judge the efficacy of drainage in the context of overall agricultural policy. One of the decisions taken is that an interdepartmental committee will consider the staffing conseqences of the transfer and, in fact, this committee held its first meeting to-day.</P>

    <P>I expect that generally speaking our quotas will be fully taken up this year with the exception of cod and whiting. Under exchange arrangements possible under the Common Fisheries Policy it is open to us to exchange some of our <Col N="1797" /> unused quotas for species in which our own quotas fall short of our requirements as was done last year and this year for mackerel.</P>
    <P>Cod is taken by our vessels as a by-catch and so the catches are unpredictable. The recent exchange in area VII was initiated by the UK authorites whose own quota had run out and who offered in exchange a quantity of a species for which our quota had run out.  Exchanges are not done on a strict weight basis but rather on the relative commercial value of the various species involved.</P>

    <P>On the basis of preliminary statistics regarding the level of British traffic to <Col N="1799" /> Ireland this year, it is estimated that visitor numbers will be about 1.1 million, which in essence is the same as last year. However, revenue from Britain is estimated to show an increase of 4 per cent on the 1985 performance to £178.7 million.</P>
    <P>For 1987, Bord Fáilte will be intensifying its promotional campaign in the British market.  In particular, a major sales drive involving the bord representatives of the tourist industry and the carriers will be launched in February next to ensure that the recent new lower air and sea fares from this market are fully exploited.  The campaign will also emphasise the competitive range of inclusive holiday packages that are available for visitors.  I am confident that more competitive sea access fares should result in an increase in the number of motoring visitors from Britain next year.</P>

    <P>It is not proposed to repeal those sections of the Fisheries Consolidation Act.  With regard to the proposal that in the context of the reform of local government local authorities be given sole responsibility for water pollution control in their areas, as promised, this has been considered further by the Government in the light of representations made by various interests and following discussions on the matter which I had with the Central Fisheries Board, and it has been decided that sole responsibility for water pollution control will not be among the matters to be devolved to local authorities.  Thus while local authorities will continue to have primary responsibility for the control of water pollution, the fisheries boards will continue to retain their existing powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy his views on the adequacies of recently announced EC checks on the Sellafield plant which have significant effects for this country and which apparently relate to auditing plutonium quantities and do not involve monitoring or regulating safety standards in the actual operations of the plant; and whether such proposals fall far short of the Irish Government's inspectorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC checks on the Sellafield plant, to which the Deputy refers, are provided for under Chapter VII (Safeguards) of the Euratom Treaty.  Chapter VII enables inspection of nuclear material intended for civil purposes to ensure that it is not diverted for military purposes. Euratom safeguards apply to installations handling civil nuclear material.  While in the past Euratom inspectors have always had access to civil areas at the Sellafield site, this was not the case for the mixed <Col N="1807" /> areas dealing with both military and civil materials.  In June 1986 the EC Commission announced that agreement was reached between them and the United Kingdom Government to enable Euratom inspectors to check all the civil nuclear material in these mixed areas at Sellafield.  The Minister for Energy has no function in relation to the inspection system under Chapter VII of Euratom. Such provisions are different from Chapter III of Euratom which deals with health and safety.  The purpose of the health and safety inspectorate which the Government wishes to have established under Chapter III is to ascertain whether nuclear installations such as Sellafield can be operated safely.  In the circumstances it is meaningless to imply that the existing Euratom inspection provisions under Chapter VII fall short of what the Government is currently seeking under Chapter III.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1808" /> The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, requires that foreign military aircraft may not fly over the State unless at my express invitation or with my express permission.  In addition military aircraft flying over Ireland must comply with such stipulations as I may make.</P>
    <P>Civilian flights are not covered by the order.  Under the Chicago Convention of 1944 all civil aircraft of countries which have ratified the convention may overfly the territory of other countries parties to the convention without the need to obtain prior permission.</P>
    <P>The embassies in Dublin of all countries whose military aircraft overfly Ireland apply in advance for permission for each overflight.  No overflights have taken place without my express prior permission since June 1986 when I instituted procedures designed to ensure that no such flights would take place.</P>
    <P>The numbers of overflights by military aircraft which took place without specific advance permission over the last three years were: Year to 30 November 1984, 2,300; Year to 30 November 1985, 2,304; Year to 30 November 1986, 1,210.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Communications has no record of any illegal overflights by civil aircraft in that period.</P>
    <P>Embassies seeking permission for overflights must provide technical information such as identification numbers, places of origin, expected times of traversal of Irish airspace and destination. They must also declare, in respect of each flight, that it is not carrying arms, explosives, ammunition or intelligencegathering equipment.  Clearance is given only to flights meeting these conditions and which do not form an integral part of a military exercise or operation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, on the basis of the assurances given through their embassies by the countries concerned, that armed aircraft, nuclear or otherwise, do not enter Irish airspace.</P>

      <P>By law, all mechanically propelled vehicles must be equipped with lights which are in working order and when lit cannot mislead or dazzle oncoming traffic.  Enforcement of the law is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  In 1985, there were about 21,000 prosecutions for lighting offences.</P>
      <P>Between 1976 and 1980, the National Road Safety Association operated a voluntary car testing scheme at various locations throughout the country to make motorists more aware of potential defects in their vehicles, including faulty and misaligned headlights.  The Association has since continued to stress the importance of vehicle fitness, including the necessity for proper vehicle lighting, through television and radio publicity.  At local level, interested groups have also been involved on an ongoing basis in promoting voluntary car testing schemes.  I understand that a number of such schemes have been a feature of local community projects undertaken this year in the context of European Road Safety Year.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together.  The Corporation Tax Act 1976, provided broadly that, where a company ceased to be within the charge to income tax and commenced to be within the charge to corporation tax, the company would at that time, not being a date later than 5 April 1976 also cease to be within the charge of corporation profits tax.  The latter tax continued to be charged and collected in respect of profits arising on or before that date to the extent that those profits did not come within the charge to corporation tax.</P>
      <P>The information available in response to Question No. 138 relates to the corporation profits tax outstanding for all years which amounted to £6 million as at 31 May 1985.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>1.  The Government have decided on a major reorganisation of policy on arterial drainage.  The reorganisation is designed to improve efficiency in carrying out arterial drainage schemes and thus achieve better value for money spent on these schemes by the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>2.  Under the reorganisation:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture will be given responsibility for arterial drainage projects and for the maintenance of completed arterial drainage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;responsibility for paying for arterial <Col N="1838" /> drainage maintenance will be transferred from local authorities to the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>&mdash;future arterial drainage schemes will be undertaken on the basis of revised criteria agreed with the Department of Finance and following formal consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>&mdash;funding of projects and maintenance will be primarily through the Department of Agriculture Vote.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the merits of carrying out works by contract rather than by direct labour will be assessed to ensure works are carried out as cheaply as possible.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the necessary action with regard to staffing in OPW and Department of Agriculture as a result of these decisions will be examined immediately by an inter-departmental committee.</P>
    <P>Background to the Government decision:</P>
    <P>3.  These changes are in line with the Government's overall approach to public spending in preparing the 1987 budget. The guiding principles will be the viability of all future projects and value-for-money.</P>
    <P>4.  Arterial drainage is primarily the concern of farmers and the agricultural community generally.  Responsibility for this important aspect of agricultural activity will now, for the first time, lie where it belongs &mdash; with the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>5.  The Minister for Agriculture and his Department are in the best position to decide if particular drainage schemes provide an adequate return on investment and whether they justify the allocation of funds from his Vote.</P>
    <P>6.  Cost-benefit studies may have been unduly optimistic about returns on investment in drainage schemes.  Future schemes will be evaluated on revised criteria to be applied before work is undertaken. These criteria will be agreed between the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1839" /> and the Department of Finance before the planning of new works is started.</P>
    <P>7.  The new criteria will include the improved cost benefit approach detailed in the <i>Review of Arterial Drainage</i> (prepared by the Office of Public Works and to be published shortly), satisfactory minimum rates of return on investment, low maintenance costs, rigid control of expenditure on works, etc.</P>
    <P>Beneficiaries:</P>
    <P>8.  Those whose land is being drained are not, at present, sufficiently involved in decision making, even though return on investment depends on the beneficiaries being willing and able to exploit fully the effects of drainage.  In future they will be involved in prior consultation on the scope of projects, monitoring of progress and overcoming difficulties.</P>
    <P>9.  Their active commitment to derive benefit from schemes in future could be secured by requiring beneficiaries of arterial drainage schemes to form local committees through which contact with the Department of Agriculture on drainage schemes would be maintained.</P>
    <P>10.  One of the functions of the committees will be to collect modest local prior contribution towards the cost of future arterial drainage projects.  This will acknowledge the enhanced use and value of the land following drainage.  The manner of collection would be for the committee to decide and would not involve the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>11.  What has been achieved to date through arterial drainage has benefited not only farmers but also other groups such as local authorities, which have gained through the bridge building, road improvement and relief of flooding in urban areas associated with drainage schemes.  The possibility of funding aspects of any future drainage schemes in part by such bodies will also be explored.</P>
    <P>Maintenance Work</P>
    <P>12.  At present no on-going assessment is made of the benefits to farmers in carrying out maintenance work.  The criteria for maintenance in future will be no <Col N="1840" /> different from the criteria to be applied to new schemes, that is, that money should be spent on maintenance where it is shown to be cost effective in maintaining the original estimated rate of return and that beneficiaries should make a realistic contribution towards the cost.</P>
    <P>Contract Work:</P>
    <P>13.  The carrying out of arterial drainage works by direct labour makes cost control difficult as variations in the duration of projects can be made too easily. Contract work with its requirements of tendering and stated periods for completion may be more effective in controlling expenditure.  Contracts will therefore be used on a trial basis on the schemes at present in progress so that a yard stick exists against which the cost effectiveness of carrying out drainage work by contract could be measured.</P>
    <P>Role of the Minister for Agriculture:</P>
    <P>14.  The schemes at planning stage or in the OPW priority list, and the Shannon will be for reassessment by the Minister for Agriculture in the objective manner proposed in the review.  Existing schemes will, of course, be continued to completion.</P>
    <P>15.  The assessment of the need for continuing maintenance on existing schemes and the initiation of any legislation found necessary to allow for abandonment of schemes not providing an adequate return on maintenance would be the priority areas for the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Implications for Local Authorities:</P>
    <P>16.  The proposals above mean a transfer of responsibility for arterial drainage maintenance from local authorities to the Department of Agriculture.  The annual amounts required by the Department of Agriculture for maintenance will be deducted from the rate support grant in the Department of the Environment Vote.  Arrears payable by local authorities to OPW for maintenance works carried out in the past will also be <Col N="1841" /> deducted from the rate support grant. The period over which the arrears will be cleared will be settled in consultation with the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Staffing Implications:</P>
    <P>17.  It is intended that the staffing consequences of these decisions will be examined by an inter-departmental committee on which the Departments of the Public Service, Finance and Agriculture and OPW would be represented.</P>

      <P>There are many persons receiving unemployment assistance who do not <Col N="1846" /> have permanent addresses.  The statement made in the Seanad by the Minister of State on 22 October 1986 outlined clearly the signing and payment arrangements for such persons.</P>
      <P>The general practice in administering the unemployment assistance scheme is that applicants are visited at their home address by a social welfare officer to verify the authenticity of the claim and the applicant's circumstances.  Where a person, for one reason or another, cannot immediately supply an address at which he or she can be interviewed there may be some delay in having the claim processed. In these circumstances he or she would normally be invited to apply to the community welfare officer for assistance, including the necessary cost of obtaining shelter.  However on completion of the usual inquiries into the unemployment assistance claim, payments would be made in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>Persons of no fixed abode include all those with no permanent address, for example, persons who reside at halting sites or who temporarily reside in hostels or other institutions for the homeless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 160 and 161 together</P>
      <P>As part of the arrangements for introducing equality of treatment in the social welfare system the Government has provided a number of alleviating measures of an extensive nature designed to cushion the effects of the arrangements. These measures are at present being implemented and largely replace measures announced earlier in relation to persons with financial commitments such as rent and mortgage payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the particular case referred to by the Deputy the person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit and pay-related benefit and his wife is in receipt of disability benefit in her own right.  Under the first phase of the equal treatment provisions, the rate of disability benefit to married women was increased by £5.  Under the second phase of these provisions a wife who is in receipt of a social welfare payment is no longer regarded as a dependant and the husband no longer qualifies for an adult dependant allowance previously payable in respect of her. However, he qualifies for a transitional payment of £20 per week under the alleviating provisions.  The overall reduction in <Col N="1848" /> social welfare payments to the couple under the equal treatment provisions is £1.60 per week.</P>
    <P>The loss of income in certain other situations where both spouses are in receipt of social welfare payments may be somewhat greater.  A scheme is being devised to provide additional assistance by the Department on the lines approved by the Government in those cases where there are financial commitments such as rent or mortgage payments.  The persons concerned will be contacted individually in those cases and will be given information about the details of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The alleviating measures taken as a whole are extensive in nature and scope and lessen substantially the impact of the equal treatment provisions.</P>

      <P>A condition for the receipt of invalidity pension is that the claimant must be permanently incapable of work. <Col N="1849" /> When the person concerned applied for invalidity pension in February 1986 he was informed that the medical referee who had examined him on 22 October 1985 did not consider him to be permanently incapable of work and that the deciding officer had accordingly decided that he was not entitled to invalidity pension and he was given the right to appeal.</P>
      <P>He appealed this decision and he was examined by a different medical referee on 19 August 1986.  The conditions for the receipt of invalidity pension were satisfied following this examination and a form on which to claim the pension was forwarded to him.  On receipt of completed claim form this pension was awarded from 20 February 1986, the date of first application and was put into payment from 13 November 1986.  Arrears in respect of the period from 20 February 1986 to 12 November 1986 less the amount of disability benefit paid during that period will be paid by payable order on 10 December 1986.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, provides for equal treatment for men and women in matters of social welfare. It includes a revised definition of the term &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; and gives men and women an equal right to claim increases for child dependants.  Under the Act a claimant's spouse who is in receipt of disability benefit may not be admitted as a dependant of the claimant and the increase in respect of child dependants is payable at half the appropriate rate to each of the couple.</P>
      <P>The Act also provides, at section 12 (4), that where a spouse is entitled to one of a number of contributory social welfare benefits (including disability benefit) and the other spouse is entitled to unemployment assistance, the total amount payable to them by way of benefit and assistance shall not exceed the total amount which would be payable to the family if the spouse on disability benefit were receiving an increase of that benefit in respect of the other spouse.  The section provides that where this limit is exceeded, the rate of unemployment assistance is to be reduced accordingly.</P>
      <P>The wife of the person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit of £51.05 weekly, which includes half the appropriate rate for two child dependants.  The flat-rate amount to which his wife would be entitled if the person concerned were her adult dependant is £87.60.  Therefore the maximum amount of unemployment assistance payable is £36.55 weekly, being the difference between £87.60 and £51.05.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her husband is currently in receipt of this amount, plus the special transitional payment of £10 which was awarded to alleviate the loss of an increase in respect of his wife brought about by the equal treatment provisions.  In accordance with the recent Government decision to provide additional relief in cases such as this, the person concerned will now qualify for <Col N="1851" /> a further transitional payment of £10 with effect from 19 November 1986, thus increasing his weekly rate to £56.55. Arrangements have been made to pay all arrears due to him this week.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 5 March 1985 and was paid at the maximum weekly rate of £105 up to 15 November 1986.  Under an EC directive the Department is required to provide for the implementation of equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security.</P>
      <P>As a result of the above directive, the Social Welfare (No.2) Act, 1985, was passed, giving men and women the same entitlement when claiming social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>The first phase was introduced in May 1986.  This ensured that married women were entitled to the same personal rate as other claimants.  The second phase was implemented on 17 November 1986. From this date men and women have similar entitlement when claiming increases of benefit in respect of an adult and/or child dependants.</P>
      <P>The weekly rate of the person concerned was reduced to £69.75 from 17 November 1986, as he informed the Department that his wife was in receipt of a social welfare benefit in her own right.  This meant that he was no longer entitled to an increase in benefit in respect of her, and was only entitled to half the increase payable in respect of his children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it has now been established that his wife is not currently in receipt of any social welfare benefit, and is not <Col N="1852" /> employed.  Accordingly his weekly rate has been restored to £105.  An adjustment cheque of £82.25 paying him arrears from 17 November 1986 to 2 December 1986, has now issued.  All benefit payable has been issued up to 2 December 1986, the date of the latest medical certificate received.</P>

      <P>The payment has been reduced under the equal treatment provisions as his wife's circumstances were unknown on 17 November when the provisions came into effect.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Testing for brucellosis involves the monitoring of all herds containing eligible animals, i.e. females of 12 months and over and bulls for breeding.  In addition, a 30 day pre-movement test is necessary.  The monitor is carried out through blood sampling and-or milk ring testing in the case of dairy herds.</P>
      <P>Approximately 95,000 eligible animals in some 3,800 herds in County Meath were tested in the course of the 1985-86 round.  Dairy herds have again been monitored since the end of that round and some 580 non-dairy herds remain to be tested.  The number of brucellosis reactors identified in County Meath in 1985 and 1986 was nine and ten respectively.</P>
      <P>For the country as a whole the brucellosis eradication scheme cost £5 million in 1985 and anticipated expenditure in 1986 is £4.25 million.</P>

    <P>Note:</P>
    <P>These figures do not include a total of 15 recruit gardai who resigned during the period, on being informed that their conduct or performance did not reach the required standard.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána (Appointments) Regulations, 1945, provide that the Commissioner may at any time dispense with the services of any member of the Force who is on probation, if the Commissioner considers that the member is not fitted, physically or mentally, to perform his duties or is not likely to become an efficient and well-conducted Garda.</P>
    <P>The decision to dispense with the services of a recruit Garda is one for the Commissioner and I am not, therefore, <Col N="1864" /> in a position to say whether in certain cases the unsuitability of the recruit was recognisable at an earlier stage.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a decision to dispense with the services of a recruit is taken by the Commissioner following detailed consideration of the comprehensive reports and assessments furnished by the recruits' superior officers, during his or her training and probation periods.  I am also informed that in all cases in which the Commissioner decides to dispense with the services of a recruit, a formal order or notice under the Appointments Regulations is signed by the Commissioner. The original order is shown to the recruit and he or she receives a copy of the order when being informed of the Commissioner's decision.  The format of that document has been approved by the law officers.</P>
    <P>I am informed that it is the Commissioner's policy that recruits who may be showing signs of unsuitability should be advised of the position as early as possible with a view to securing an improvement where this is possible and, secondly, that if it is apparent that a recruit should not be retained his services should be dispensed with without avoidable delay, in his interests as well as in the interests of the Force.</P>

      <P>The Prison Officers' Association is quite free at any stage to raise problems of concern to it with my Department and, in fact, regular discussions take place between the two sides both informally and through the conciliation and arbitration scheme. The issues raised by the Deputy have been the subject of such discussions and further discussions can be expected to take place in relation to a number of <Col N="1867" /> them.  In general, the content of discussions of this kind must be regarded as confidential to both parties and it would be inappropriate, especially in the context of good industrial relations, to give details of such discussions on a wide range of issues by way of response to a parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that the attitude of the Prison Officers' Association is only one of many factors which have to be taken into account in dealing with the kind of issues referred to by the Deputy.  For example, any action to be taken in response to the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System is by no means simply a matter to be resolved between my Department and the Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 to 233, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Under the Erasmus Smith Schools Act Scheme 1941, which was adopted on 2 July 1942, under the Erasmus Smith Schools Act, 1938 (No. 1 (Private) of 1938), a charity was established, of which the Minister for Education is trustee, to be used, <i>inter alia,</i> for the benefit of the Abbey School, Tipperary.</P>
      <P>The property of the charity, at its inception on 2 July 1942, comprised the Abbey School and lands attached thereto or used therewith, and securities and cash amounting to £72,340.  The accumulated balance on 30 November, 1986 was £312,934, comprised of securities amounting to £305,927 and cash for investment of £7,007.</P>
      <P>Moneys are available, therefore, to be applied within the terms of the trusts of the charity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £21,000 was paid in the financial year 1953-54 towards the cost of the reconstruction of the Abbey School. In addition, certain supplementary payments totalling £10,183 were made by the Minister from unexpended balances towards building and other costs incurred by the authorities of the Abbey School over the years 1953-54.  The Minister is also empowered to pay an annual subsidy, not exceeding £580, towards the cost and expenses of carrying on and maintaining special agricultural teaching and training in the school and this has been paid each year since the school year 1942-43 through 1985-86.  The subsidy for the current year has not yet been paid. Arrangements are in train for the revision of the scheme to take account of changed circumstances.  It is not possible to say, <Col N="1882" /> at this stage, when the legal formalities will be completed.</P>
    <P>The scholarships payable under the terms of the existing scheme were tenable only at schools providing secondary education. With the introduction of free post-primary education and various schemes of grants for higher education students, the provision in the scheme for the award of certain scholarships is no longer considered necessary.  Neither is it considered that provision in the amended scheme for the establishment of higher education scholarships for pupils in the Abbey School, who do not otherwise qualify for grants would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>The problem is that the company concerned appears to have ceased trading but has not been formally put into liquidation or receivership.  Consequently, the employer cannot be regarded as insolvent under section 1 of the 1984 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is provision in the Act whereby the Minister for Labour may, by regulations, provide that employers <Col N="1883" /> may in certain circumstances be deemed to be insolvent for the purpose of the Act so that payments may be made to the employees of such employers.  The making of such regulations is under active consideration but this has given rise to substantial legal and administrative problems. I hope that these can soon be resolved but, in advance of the making of regulations, it would not be possible for me to say that they would apply in the circumstances of the case referred to in the question.  The case has, however, been noted in my Department and it will be considered as quickly as possible when the proposed regulations are made.</P>

Some time ago, however, it was estimated that savings to the Exchequer in respect of social welfare payments together with receipts from income tax and PRSI amount to about £2.3 million annually per 1,000 participants compared with a gross cost of about £5.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net cost of the scheme would also be reduced by the amount of any assistance received from the European Social Fund which will amount to a total of £4.2 million in 1986.  Receipts from indirect <Col N="1885" /> taxation, calculated at 17.5 per cent of increased income, arising from the operation of the scheme would reduce the net cost of the social employment scheme further.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme provides for up to 52 weeks of employment for each participant.  Allowing persons who have completed their term of employment on the scheme to continue participating would be unfair to others who are anxious to participate and are awaiting vacancies. Priority is, therefore, given to persons who have not previously participated in the scheme.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that consideration may be given to the re-employment of a limited number of participants where there are no other eligible persons available.</P>

      <P>A proposal from Monaghan County Council under the social employment scheme was approved by my Department in August 1985 and a maximum grant of £3.34 million was allocated.  The allocation of funding was based on the numbers of workers applied for &mdash; 600. Payment to sponsors is of course based on the numbers actually employed.</P>
      <P>The project commenced operation in October 1985 with a workforce of 123 persons, and the NMS continued to recruit participants over the following months.  Participation reached a maximum of 267 persons following an intensive recruitment drive by the local NMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1886" /> To date the county council has been paid £1.1 million in respect of SES operations. The project has also been temporarily extended beyond the normal 52 weeks duration, to allow participants who have not completed their period of employment to do so.</P>
    <P>Provided that the normal conditions of the scheme are met I will be prepared to consider further proposals from Monaghan County Council for work to be carried out under the scheme.</P>
