      <P>No, a Cheann Comhairle.  It comes as a great surprise to us that a fundamental change is to be made to the 1967 Income Tax Act and rushed through in an hour.  It seems to me that there are important issues to be <Col N="3720" /> debated in relation to this.  I see no reason why more time cannot be given to do so. On the basis of a one hour debate it is unlikely that many Deputies will get in to express their views.  I would oppose the Order of Business on that basis.  We were not consulted about this in any way. It is too important an issue to so many people to have it rushed through in one hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak this morning to trace out the very real and worthwhile progress that the Government have made in the social welfare area since we came into office and my plans for the future.</P>
      <P>Social Welfare is not just a State welfare system &mdash; it is a commitment by the whole community to people who are in need of income and other support during their lives.  Everyone in the community should understand the extent both of poverty and real need and of the response required from everybody to deal with it in the common good.  I would like to take this opportunity to highlight just some of the areas where significant progress and new initiatives have resulted, so that the House will be aware of the achievements of this Government in the social welfare area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of this Government since taking office is commendable and, indeed, remarkable when account is taken of the state of the public finances which was inherited from the previous Fianna Fáil Government.  This is something that most people are aware of at this stage so I do not propose to go over that ground again.  Suffice it to say that this severely limited the scope for improvements that we all realise are necessary.  Two other basic considerations must also be taken into account in any discussion of the social <Col N="3722" /> welfare area.  The first is the enormous size now of the existing social welfare budget.  The second is that the demographic and economic pressures, which have driven that budget up dramatically over the past five years, will remain with us for the foreseeable future.  The total number of people and their dependants receiving social welfare payments of one kind or another each week is now over 1.3 million, or 37 per cent of the total population of the country.</P>
    <P>With these financial considerations in mind we established our priorities.  One of these, as stated in our Programme for Government, was to maintain the real level of social welfare payments.  In fact, we have gone further than this.  Levels of payment have been increased in real terms, which, I think, must be acknowledged, even by our most ardent critics, as a significant achievement.  After all, social welfare increases from June 1983 to date represent an increase of 30 per cent for those receiving short term payments, 33 per cent for those receiving long term payments and an even higher 40 per cent for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The increase in the CPI for the same period was of the order of 22 per cent. Specially disadvantaged groups, such as the long term unemployed, have been given repeated higher than normal increases in social welfare rates.  While I am on the subject of increases in the consumer price index I would like to refer to the very significant success this Government have had through their determined and concerted efforts in overcoming the great evil of inflation which has been at the root of this country's uncompetitiveness and resultant job losses.  This Government have succeeded in their period in office in reducing inflation from a figure of over 23 per cent which we inherited to a projected level of 3 per cent in 1987.  This of itself has been a major achievement.</P>
    <P>Despite the recession the Government have made substantial reforms in social welfare, with the overall aim of making services more effective and of making the most of the resources available for <Col N="3723" /> income support.  In 1986, taking account of the new rates of benefits, total expenditure on social welfare will amount to approximately £2.5 billion, of which the Exchequer will provide £1.55 billion. Expenditure on social welfare is the largest single block of all Government expenditure and is now running at almost 27 per cent of total gross current expenditure. It should be recalled that social welfare expenditure ten years ago was about 10 per cent of GNP but in 1986 it will approach 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of course, I would not for one moment suggest that the present levels of payment are adequate.  I am well aware of the main recommendations of the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare which said that the level of payments should be increased.  Who would not like to be in a position to do this?  What I am saying is that given the current economic climate significant achievements have been made, achievements which another Government opting for a more draconian approach would not have made in the same circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another decision which went against the tide of current economic wisdom was to pay a Christmas bonus this year. Despite the financial burden, the Government made available £18 million to meet the cost of a Christmas bonus. This is no inconsiderable sum.  This bonus benefited an estimated 503,000 recipients and their 330,000 dependants.  It included for the second year in succession the long term unemployed who are among the most hard-pressed members of our community. Of course, I would have liked to have given a greater bonus in the same way that I would like to increase social welfare payments generally, but the facts are that the money is simply not there, and these are facts that people have to be prepared to face up to.  It was the lack of such realism on the part of the last Government and their inability to face hard facts which put this country on its financial tightrope.  As any household knows, you cannot live beyond your means indefinitely, because finally the bubble bursts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3724" /> I have referred to the high numbers of people who are now depending on the social welfare system.  One of the main planks of the Government's strategy is to try to reduce dependence on the social welfare system by encouraging and facilitating in every way possible the creation or retention of jobs where there is scope for such jobs.</P>
    <P>The three new measures in the area of employment incentives which I announced on Wednesday are further evidence of the Government's resolve to create the right climate to encourage employment and to reduce dependence on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The new PRSI exemption scheme will allow employers who take on additional employees between 17 December 1986 and 31 January 1987 an exemption from their portion of the PRSI for those extra workers for the 1987-88 tax year.  Deputies will know that a PRSI exemption scheme is already in operation this year. This has proved to be very successful; 3,200 extra employees were taken on between 23 October 1985 and 5 April 1986 and some 2,000 employers are benefiting from the exemption in the current year in respect of those employees.  Some preliminary analysis of survey results on the original scheme has shown that it was particularly attractive to small employers, 76 per cent of whom had 20 or fewer employees.  These employers were mostly in the manufacturing industries where 36 per cent of employees were taken on.</P>
    <P>Other sectors which benefited most were the building and construction sector and the personal services sector.  We all know that small employers in these sectors are amongst the most hard-pressed of the business community and face very real problems in deciding to take on extra employees.  I am hopeful that the new exemption scheme will be a welcome boost to their confidence and give them the stimulus needed to expand their workforce.</P>
    <P>The part time job allowance was one of three new initiatives for the long term unemployed which I introduced on a pilot basis last July.  The other programmes <Col N="3725" /> are the Jobsearch programme and the educational opportunities scheme.  The part time job allowance scheme is an attempt to make it more attractive for persons who have been unemployed for more than one year to take up part time work by allowing them much greater flexibility in retaining a basic income maintenance payment than is possible under the unemployment payments system.  Under the part time allowance scheme an unemployed person who can secure regular part time work of up to 24 hours a week may take up that job and receive a basic flat rate allowance of £25 a week if he or she is single or £40 if he or she is married.  Earnings from the employment do not affect payment of the allowance.  The introduction of this scheme was a recognition of the fact that part time work has become a significant feature in our society and that for many it may hold out the only realistic opportunity to re-enter the labour force in the short term.</P>
    <P>The scheme is at present operating for a six month period in Letterkenny, Limerick, Tallaght and the catchment areas of Gardiner Street and Cork employment exchanges.  As with the other pilot programmes it is currently being professionally evaluated.  So far the results have been very encouraging.  After a slow start there are now 38 participants in the scheme.  I think that the success of the scheme can already be judged from the fact that the majority of participants in the scheme are receiving less by way of the allowance than they were receiving in unemployment payments.  This, I believe, shows that people can help themselves if our systems are more flexible and this is something that I have always been very conscious of.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the scheme opens up the possibilities of part time working by removing barriers and is of very real benefit to the participants.  I also think that the results are sufficiently encouraging to warrant its extension to a number of other areas and I am confident that as knowledge of the scheme grows it will prove attractive to a greater number of people. I have arranged for the scheme to be <Col N="3726" /> extended to the following 12 further locations: Arklow, Athlone, Bray, Carlow, Dún Laoghaire, Drogheda, Galway, Kilkenny, Navan, Sligo, Tralee and Waterford.  This will bring the total number of locations to 17 and I consider that this will be a reasonable nation-wide spread and quite a significant achievement in such a short period.</P>
    <P>I have also been looking at the family income supplement scheme which, as Deputies know, was introduced in 1984 as a measure of additional income support for people on low earnings with family responsibilities.  The scheme applies to families whose income from employment is no higher or only marginally higher than what they would receive in social welfare benefit if the breadwinner was unemployed.  The primary objective of the scheme is to maintain the incentive to work for workers bringing up families on low wages and the criteria for determining eligibility for the FIS are based on the weekly rates of benefit for such families.</P>
    <P>In order to be eligible for the scheme, the breadwinner had to have a full time job, that is, be working for at least 30 hours a week. Experience has shown that a number of families were not eligible because the breadwinner was working for fewer than 30 hours a week and earnings and family circumstances were such that the family were in need of additional income.  Following consideration of this matter I considered that there was no justification for the continued exclusion of such families from the scope of the scheme.  Accordingly, I was happy to announce on Wednesday last that the Government had approved a reduction in the number of hours of work to 24.  At present, under the existing scheme, there are about 5,000 families receiving the FIS at an average weekly payment of over £10 a week.  It is estimated that up to 1,500 extra families will now be eligible for a family income supplement.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the subject of equality in social welfare.  The implementation of the EC Directive on Equal Treatment is an area that received a great deal of <Col N="3727" /> attention recently.  It is an area with which I have been particularly concerned. It is important and, indeed, essential, that when we look at the whole question of the equal treatment legislation the whole picture is examined. Each person is naturally concerned only with the effect on him or herself, and judges any changes in personal terms. Governments must look at things in an overall context and must try to pursue equitable approaches subject to financial considerations.</P>
    <P>There has been a general tendency to lose sight of the fact that women, for a long number of years, have been blatantly discriminated against in the social welfare system, and, despite all the adverse criticism and controversy that has arisen, I am proud that this Government grasped the nettle and that I, personally, have been able to see to it that this discrimination is ended once and for all.</P>
    <P>The most obvious area of discrimination was the fact that married women got a lower rate of certain benefits and for a shorter duration than other claimants.  Up to 46,000 people were treated as second class citizens in this way up to May this year.  They were treated in a totally different way from married men, single men and single women.  This was because of our old long out of date idea that all married women were dependent on their husbands irrespective of their economic circumstances.  Because of that, they got less money from the social welfare system if they were unemployed or sick and they got those smaller amounts of money for a shorter time than anyone else.</P>
    <P>Another area of discrimination was that married women were effectively debarred from applying for unemployment assistance.  This was again based on the outmoded concept of dependency. This whole approach of the social welfare system was to treat married women as dependants even where this was manifestly not the case.  We had the ludicrous situation where, so long as a married woman was living with her husband, <Col N="3728" /> he was entitled to increases of social welfare payments for her, even though she might have substantial earnings of her own or might herself be getting a social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>It was obvious that the whole system had to be changed as the entire approach was indefensible in a modern world and was bitterly resented by many people who were not lucky enough to have two sources of income coming into the house. In time people will, I have no doubt, realise that the new approach is the only rational and justifiable one.  It is interesting to note that prior to the introduction of legislation on equal pay a number of years ago all sorts of arguments were being put forward in defence of that most unfair system.  Basically, we cannot defend the indefensible, and I believe it is better to tackle the problem sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The equal treatment Directive was implemented in two phases, and I feel sight has been lost of the improvements introduced in the first phase where the reduced rates of benefit paid to married women were replaced by the standard rates which were higher and the duration of entitlement to unemployment benefit for married women was increased to the normal rate.  About 46,000 married women benefited from these changes. For example, married women on disability benefit or unemployment benefit got an extra £5 per week.  The second phase which I introduced last month brought in the new dependency conditions and extended entitlement to unemployment assistance to married women.</P>
    <P>The changes which have now been implemented have introduced a rational approach to the question of dependency in our system.  It has been a major change, and this has been at a cost to some people.  I am not happy that this is the case but it was inevitable.  We recognised from the outset that losses would arise for some families and this is why enabling powers were built into the legislation to permit alleviating measures to be made.  Those alleviating measures <Col N="3729" /> have now been introduced and they will considerably ease the application of the equality legislation for these families.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that we have succeeded in having the equality legislation implemented and that we have, not without some difficulty and despite the serious Exchequer financial position, put in place a system of cushioning payments which will make the loss of income to over 20,000 married men less burdensome than if there had been full and immediate implementation of the directive.</P>
    <P>Another significant development in the social welfare area has been the establishment of the Combat Poverty Agency. The Government are committed to drawing up an anti-poverty plan within the context of a national economic and social plan which concentrates on a just distribution of wealth, income and power. Towards this end the Combat Poverty Agency were launched in September last.</P>
    <P>Combating poverty involves practically all aspects of public policy in one way or another.  Despite all the advances which we have made in recent decades and the enormous amounts of money being spent in areas like social welfare, housing, education, training and job creation, poverty still persists.  It is essential for those of us in positions of responsibility to ensure that the elimination of poverty becomes and remains a priority issue and one which will not be ignored. The new agency are to seek and identify radical and innovative ways in which to tackle this problem at its roots.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, up to now there has been no institutional mechanism specifically charged with the task of advising on and developing an anti-poverty policy.  The agency now fill this gap.  The primary input of the agency is through my Department but they will also be establishing and maintaining contact with other Government Departments, statutory or other bodies and voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>The agency have not been slow in getting to grips with their task.  Last week I was able to announce the allocation of £515,000 from the Combat Poverty Agency to 55 voluntary organisations. The organisations represented the broad <Col N="3730" /> spectrum of work related to poverty and the projects for which grants are to be used include employment projects, youth activities, transport, renovations and so on.  It was fortunate that we were able to respond so quickly to the agency's proposals in the special circumstances of this year and I look forward to developing with the agency a well planned and structured approach to this important aspect of their work.</P>
    <P>This year has been a very important year for State support of voluntary activity.  I already allocated £750,000 to voluntary organisations under my Department's grant scheme and this, coupled with the allocation of over £500,000 from the Combat Poverty Agency brings State support for voluntary organisations to its highest level ever.  This, to my mind, is a major achievement and one which I am particularly proud of.  At this point I would like to pay my own, and I am sure, the House's tribute to all those voluntary groups who, without seeking personal glory, work quietly and unassumingly on behalf of poor people.  Since being appointed Minister for Social Welfare last February it has been my privilege to come in close contact with many of these groups.  They have my sincerest admiration.</P>
    <P>We also attach considerable importance to developing effective programmes in this field at European Community level.  A four-year programme of specific Community action to combat poverty was adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 1984 and nine Irish projects have been included in the programme which are financed jointly by the EC and by the Government.  The Board of the Combat Poverty Agency have now assumed responsibility for overseeing the implementation of those projects.  Funding of the projects, which will cost £270,000 in 1986, is additional to the funds made available to the Combat Poverty Agency and the grants to voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>One of the most important developments in 1986 was the publication of the <Col N="3731" /> report of the Commission on Social Welfare. The report, together with its three background papers, comprises the first ever comprehensive review of the social welfare system.  The task the commission had was extremely difficult because of the sheer complexity of the system and because of its interaction with other areas of public policy.  The approach adopted by the commission was to examine the system fully, recognising the system we had and taking all viewpoints into consideration by making recommendations for rational change.</P>
    <P>The commission were aware that any review had to be based on a realistic appreciation of the complex environment within which the system operates.  They concluded that the reform and development of social welfare must be achieved against a background of economic constraints. Therefore, they advocated an evolutionary approach, and they envisage that their recommendations &mdash; in view of the additional expenditure involved &mdash; would be implemented over a period of time.</P>
    <P>The commission's report represents a significant development and has made a valuable contribution to public debate in this area.  I am convinced that the debate, which is already under way, will help and is already helping to create the climate in which the provision of services for those in need is seen to be a priority and in which the merit of the fundamental changes which have been put forward by the commission can be assessed in a realistic way.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the report, I sought the views of the various agencies and groups nationwide who have an involvement, directly or indirectly, in the whole social welfare area.  We had a deadline which was not met by some of the groups and submissions are still coming in.  We are studying these, and the views put forward are being taken into account in formulating proposals for the future. I was slightly surprised at some of the statements which were made recently about my response to the commission's <Col N="3732" /> report and the work we are doing on combating fraud and abuse.  One suggestion was made, with some publicity, that we were paying £1 million on fraud consultancy. I have no idea where that figure came from.  I explained to the House the other day that the cost so far is in the region of £50,000.  It is important to make that clear.</P>
    <P>The commission did not opt for a radically different social welfare system but the implementation of their recommendations would entail some fundamental changes in the present system. I am working with the Department on ways to respond to the commission and improve the quality of service made available to clients and on the action we can take to further develop our computer system which would improve the service to the general public.  I envisage an approach which will direct our resources towards providing a more fair, equitable, speedy, caring and cost-effective service to social welfare recipients.  There is no question of this report gathering dust on the shelves.</P>

      <P>We took a number of initiatives in order to reduce the incidence of fraud and abuse in the system and ensure that taxpayers' money is spent in the right way.  One has to deal with a reluctant public if they feel someone is ripping them off.  Any Minister who administers such a massive budget and who fails to devote energy and attention to making sure that as far as is reasonable and equitable taxpayers' money is being spent in the way intended would not be doing his or her job.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years I have presided over the two Departments that spend most taxpayers' money &mdash; Education and Social Welfare.  Unfortunately they are areas which take the centre of the political stage only when measures to control abuses in spending are taken.  Yet they are crucial policy areas affecting nearly every family in the State.  This Government have a proud record in education, of fundamental and far-reaching reform and development, and in social welfare they have had the courage to undertake a massive review of the system while, at the same time, giving a real boost over the four years to social welfare recipients.</P>

I also look forward to our budgetary provisions being debated in this House and outside and on election <Col N="3734" /> platforms if necessary.  The sooner we all admit that jobs, interest rates, tax levels and public expenditure are inextricably bound up with each other, the sooner we will begin to solve our problems.  We have to ease interest rates, help increase employment and lower tax levels.  There are no more political three-card tricks to be played.</P>

It is above all for the sake of the young in education and the needy in social welfare that we must have the courage to tackle the problems.

      <P>The economy and the finances have been deteriorating steadily particularly over the last two years and the immediate prospect is of things continuing to get worse.  The country needs a change of direction and control.  The continuing instability and uncertainty is doing deadly damage, especially to the financial situation.  The present deep economic crisis cannot be handled by a divided, discredited and dispirited administration.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to unemployment, emigration, taxation and the public finances, the collapse of key sectors of the economy show that this Coalition Government have failed on virtually every front.  Four years of this Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour have left the economy devastated and the people demoralised.  The longer the Government cling ineffectively to power, the worse the situation becomes.</P>
      <P>With this Government, forecasts, projections, targets no longer have any meaning or validity.  It is a constant process of twisting and turning, bargaining and compromising.  Public moneys have been used shamelessly to buy time and secure support.  Staying in office for as long as possible is all that matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last four years have seen the high hopes that emerged in the sixties dashed. Up until the early eighties there was every indication that this country had at last turned a historical corner.  Emigration had ended and for ten years there was a welcome flow of Irish people back into the country.  There were 20 years of tremendous activity, investment and modernisation in every sphere.  That dynamic was substained until the end of 1982, despite the severe and damaging jolt to confidence inflicted by the first FitzGerald Coalition.  In 1983 this Coalition started its high taxation, deflationary <Col N="3737" /> regime with the most regressive budget of all time.</P>
    <P>The official forecasts for the economy in 1986 have been far too optimistic and remained optimistic long after it became clear that they were not going to be realised.  In fact, on this side of the House we have proved to be better economic forecasters than either the Department of Finance or the Central Bank.  How could the Central Bank, in the statement at the opening of their <i>Summer Bulletin</i>, claim that &ldquo;prospects for the Irish economy in 1986 remain buoyant&rdquo;, given the facts known at that time?  We parliamentarians are entitled to better advice than that from such an authoritative institution.</P>
    <P>The ESRI confess to have been taken by surprise by the sheer scale of emigration, the failure of interest rates to fall and the fall in the value of exports. Perhaps they should have read the Dáil debates and listened to what we were saying.  There has been a fair amount of criticism of politicians from these quarters and perhaps a little humility on their part now would not be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in an address to the IMI on 13 May 1986 claimed: &ldquo;We are moving into a period of rapid growth which will be led by domestic consumption and by exports ... the growth rate of consumption in the latter part of the year will be even faster&rdquo;.  He even worried that &ldquo;it may be difficult to reattune to relatively rapid growth&rdquo; and that &ldquo;we may now be in danger of under-estimating the upward movement, for whatever period it goes on &mdash; and I think it is extremely secure through 1987 ... Consumption will rise dramatically&rdquo;.  To cap it all he went on to say &ldquo;The one thing we are determined to do is to adhere to our budgetary discipline&rdquo;.  It is now obvious to everyone that the Taoiseach got it totally wrong, that he totally misread the situation and that he misled the public about the Government's intentions. Indeed, every single year of the last three years he has got it wrong.  In 1984 he claimed we were the healthiest economy in Europe.  In 1985 he claimed employment was about to rise.  In 1986 <Col N="3738" /> he predicted a consumer boom.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance claimed the budget would have a positive impact on economic growth which was then projected slightly less than 3 per cent.  Instead of slightly less than 3 per cent growth in GNP, the ESRI are now predicting ¾ of 1 per cent and private forecasters, such as DKM, are now actually predicting a massive fall in GNP of over 2 per cent in 1986.  The budget had no positive impact on economic growth.  The Minister promised to reduce the current budget deficit this year to 7.4 per cent of GNP.  The likely outturn is at last 8.8 per cent of GNP and it could possibly be as high as 9 per cent if GNP is as low as we think it is likely to be.  In spite of all this.  Deputy Bruton still has the audacity to come into this House and bluster about fiscal rectitude and attack Fianna Fáil with completely unfounded and unsustainable allegations.  Of course, he must attack somebody because he cannot attempt to defend his own appalling performance.</P>
    <P>Why should anyone attach credibility to this Coalition's budgetary parameters for next year, 1987, when we see their abject failure to keep to the very generous limits they allowed themselves for 1986?  For two years now, despite crushing levels of taxation, the Government have run a record of current budget deficits of between 8.5 per cent and 9 per cent of GNP.  The national debt has escalated to £23.3 billion or 144 per cent of GNP, practically twice what it was when the Coalition took office.</P>
    <P>The foreign debt at the end of this year will be over £10 billion, again almost double of what it was at the end of 1982. One of the stated principal aims of the Government was to stabilise the national debt as a percentage of GNP at about 133 per cent.  That target has been completely overshot.  One of the reasons for this is a substantial overrun on Government expenditure.  The current budget target which already exceeded the <i>Building on Reality</i> projection by £122 million is likely to be exceeded by a further £50 million, making a total expenditure overrun of around £170 million this year.  That is on top of an already generous budget deficit. <Col N="3739" /> Let me remind Deputy Bruton that when Fianna Fáil were last in office both current and capital expenditure were kept within target without any overrun whatever.</P>
    <P>The Government are directly responsible for the high rates of interest we have to endure at present.  It is their failure to meet their budget targets, particularly the size of the current deficit and the political instability they have brought about, that are keeping rates so high. Rates are marginally higher, even in nominal terms, in December 1986 than they were in December 1982, even though inflation is less than a quarter of what it was then.  The Taoiseach asserted in May: &ldquo;Interest rates are also falling. Last time it took four months for interest rates to come down after the realignment, and it is taking a little longer than we thought this time also, but they are coming down and that again is creating a different environment altogether.&rdquo; That was another inaccurate forecast.</P>
    <P>Foreign investment in Irish industry has been reduced to an insignificant level since 1982.  The fall-off in investment has led, as it was bound to, to a drop in exports, so that export growth is no longer a sustaining force in the economy. Exports have dropped by over 5 per cent in value in the last year, while imports have dropped even further by 10 per cent. These figures reflect the catastrophic falling off in economic activity that has taken place.  The biggest fall has been in the imports of intermediate goods and capital goods, a bad omen for future trends in industrial production.  Value is not the same as volume, but most analysts agree that exports have now stopped growing. Exports, of course are the key to economic growth and to be in a situation of no growth in exports is the worst possible scenario for this country.</P>
    <P>If we turn to the construction industry, the Coalition years have been an unmitigated disaster for that sector, with continuous sharp decline in employment. Employment in firms with over five <Col N="3740" /> employees is well under half the mid-1981 level.  Housing output is down to below 23,000.  With increased emigration and, lately, a fall in population the housing demand no longer exists.</P>
    <P>Continuous cuts in the volume of the Public Capital Programme, even on roads so that it is now only two-thirds of its 1982 level, and falling, have also aggravated the problems of the construction industry.  Cement sales are down 7½ per cent in the first nine months of 1986 compared with the previous year. Who remembers that silly boast by the Taoiseach at the Fine Gael Árd Fheis in 1984 that he would get the JCBs moving again?</P>
    <P>The private services sector, which the Minister for Finance decided should be the main area for employment creation, have not been able to perform in the generally adverse economic conditions that have prevailed.  The growth which took place in this sector up to 1984 was reversed and actually fell by 4,000 in the year up to April 1985, the latest date for which we have firm figures.</P>
    <P>But there is really no need for me to dwell on the Government's failures.  They are fully apparent to everyone.  Everything this Coalition touch turns sour.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building on Reality</i> stated Government policies would prevent taxation from rising as a percentage of GNP.  This year that will be breached.  Nothing significant has been done to alleviate this crushing burden of taxation on the family with an average income, or on the goods they have to buy.  Housing, footwear, clothing, basic food items since the reduction in food subsidies, electricity, domestic fuel, insurance, motor taxation, public transport, educational costs have all risen in cost by more than the rate of inflation. Social welfare increases, despite ridiculous claims to the contrary, have not kept place with inflation since the Coalition came to office.  Since the last increase given by Fianna Fáil in 1982 the value of social welfare payments measured against the rate of inflation has fallen by 5 per cent in real terms in the case of short term benefits and 2½ per cent in the case of the long term benefits.  Cuts in <Col N="3741" /> food subsidies, increased VAT on domestic fuel, have disproportionately hit the poorer sections of our community.</P>
    <P>The reduction of income for 20,000 families this month and the cutting of the Christmas bonus have not been equalled in brutality since Fine Gael reduced the old age pension by a shilling in the twenties. The treatment of social welfare by this Coalition shows that, whatever else matters to them, people on low incomes and their problems do not rank very high in their scale of priorities.</P>
    <P>Nineteen hundred and eighty-six will long be remembered as the year in which Fine Gael went back to their right wing roots.  In the Government's handling of social welfare we saw the veneer of social concern, which that party had tacked on to itself in recent times, discarded.  With the acquiescence of Labour the poorest and weakest section of the community had their already inadequate incomes further reduced.</P>
    <P>Because it is clear that the Coalition propose to continue blatantly to distort the history of the public finances over the last decade I would like to remind the Dáil of the facts; of what actually happened and not what the handlers say happened. First of all let me point out that in the last 14 years, Coalition Governments have been in office for ten of those years.</P>
    <P>I have on many occasions set out the Coalition record on borrowing.  Today we have a total national debt of £23 billion and a foreign debt of £10 billion.  Two-thirds of both these amounts have been incurred by Coalition Governments.  I defy the Minister, Deputy Bruton, or any other Minister to deny that simple fact.</P>
    <P>In the last four years under this Coalition the national debt and the foreign debt have almost doubled.  When this Coalition came into office in 1982, the total national debt for 60 years was £12 billion.  In four years they increased it to £23 billion.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit in 1986 will be at its highest level, between 8.7 per cent and 9 per cent of GNP, for the second year running.  Taxation has increased from 32½ per cent of GNP in 1982 to 37½ per cent in 1986.  Real interest <Col N="3742" /> rates are at an all time high, being four times the rate of inflation.  Both unemployment and emigration are at record levels and our population is now falling.</P>
    <P>The mishandling of major situations by this Government has in one form or another saddled the people with losses or liabilities of many millions of pounds. The final cost of liquidating Irish Shipping is likely to come to about £170 million. Taxpayers paid £124 million for Dublin Gas now in receivership.  The take-over of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland is likely to cost the financial institutions and their clients anywhere from £200 million to £400 million.  All told, the liabilities and losses made by this Government reach into billions.  Financial setbacks can occur under any Government, but no Government in modern times have presided over so many liquidations, bankruptcies, collapsed deals and such huge losses to the Exchequer. We are determined that this Coalition cannot and will not be allowed blame anyone else for their four years of disastrous mismanagement of the public finances.</P>
    <P>A high level of personal taxation has greatly reduced the incomes of families in every class in society.  Poverty and deprivation are no longer confined to any one section.  Individuals and families right through the community find it impossible to make ends meet.  Our farmers face a bleak future of production quotas and falling real prices.  Our industry and service sectors face a position of stagnant or falling demand.  High interest rates discourage all investment.  How removed from reality were the Government and the commentators who in this situation could predict a consumer boom in 1986. The policies at present being pursued do not even pretend to address, still less correct these problems.</P>
    <P>My sympathy goes especially to families with teenagers or with young adults who are unemployed and see no prospect but emigration.  In their case, particularly, unemployment has a heartbreak dimension.</P>
    <P>The official number of registered unemployed does not, on its own, reveal <Col N="3743" /> the full extent of the economic and social disasters that have taken place.  When we add the number, probably about 100,000, who have emigrated and another 30,000 to 40,000 in training schemes, it is clear that about 400,000 people have been taken out of the productive process.  If those 400,000 persons were at work and contributing to the national output of goods and services they would, at a modest estimate, be adding at least £4 billion to GNP.</P>
    <P>The seasonal rise last month, November, was the highest for four years and if present policies continue the future outlook is very grim.  The latest ESRI quarterly predicts a fall in the numbers at work of some 17,000 in 1986 even though <i>Building on Reality</i> projected a net growth in employment in 1987 of 33,000.  The industrial policy announced in 1984 by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, which predicted the creation of between 3,000 and 6,000 net new jobs per annum in manufacturing industry has been a total failure.  The increase in net employment of 12,000-14,000 in manufacturing industry by 1987 projected in <i>Building on Reality</i> is totally off target.  The latest ESRI quarterly predicts on the contrary, that by next year there will be a fall of 27,000 on the 1984 level.  We can all recall many speeches by the Taoiseach over the last four years when he claimed that the fall in employment was about to be reversed.  It is only on the basis of an assumption that net emigration will continue to run at a high level that the ESRI are able to keep their predicted rise in the unemployment figures down to a modest level.</P>
    <P>In 1985-86, for the first time in 25 years, Ireland's population actually fell, with emigration exceeding the natural increase.  This reversal of a trend of increase for over a quarter of a century threatens a return to the spectre of a falling population, with all that that entails.  The Government's failure to provide employment prospects for young people is the principal reason.  The Department of Labour survey published at the beginning of this week showed that <Col N="3744" /> two out of five school leavers, not going on to further education, had failed to find jobs.  It is hardly necessary to point out the grievous loss that results to the productive sector when large numbers of our bright young graduates emigrate and do not return.</P>
    <P>Essentially, this Coalition Government have given up, if they ever really tried.  They have stood aside from the economy in accordance with the best monetarist doctrine and watched the economy collapse.  In many cases they actually precipitated closure such as the liquidation of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>The nature and shape of the budget for 1987 is the most important economic issue facing the nation, but the Taoiseach and the Ministers of this Government are playing barefaced party politics with this key issue.  Budgetary prospects for next year are intimidating.  It would be very difficult for any Government to frame a budget which will meet the requirements of the public finances and the economy. The political situation which this Government are creating will add very greatly to the problem of the budget.  Putting back the general election will inevitably postpone the adoption of a budget and create its own problems.  It will have adverse repercussions on revenue receipts for 1987, a year in which there will be very little scope for any such laxities.</P>
    <P>The manoeuvrings of the two Coalition parties over the budget are quite scandalous. They are, in fact, playing a party political game with the public finances at a time when the public finances are already in a critical situation.</P>
    <P>It is now a matter of public knowledge that whether this Coalition will bring in a budget will be decided, not on the basis of the needs of the economy or the public finances, but on the basis of what the Coalition parties believe to be in their best electoral interest.  Incredible though it may seem, we have actually arrived at a situation where the budget is being treated like a card in a political poker game.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions during the past year it was made obvious that everything in this Government's parliamentary <Col N="3745" /> programme was subservient to the Coalition's need to avoid a general election. But this playacting over the budget is going too far.  The public finances are in an appalling state; uncertainty about the future is causing serious disruption and instability in the money markets and keeping interest rates much higher than they should be.  The preparation of the budget should take precedence over everything else.</P>
    <P>Public attention is currently focused on the level of Government expenditure. There is a serious public debate taking place on the crucial issue of whether Government expenditure should be reduced and, if so, in what areas.  To give any sort of reality or substance to this debate, it should be based on the published Book of Estimates for 1987.  But there is no Book of Estimates.  The Government cannot or will not publish the Estimates for 1987.  This is reducing the whole budgetary process to a farce. It is grossly irresponsible for a Government to carry on in this way.</P>
    <P>Will Deputy Bruton explain how he justifies this behaviour to the Dáil?  Does he recall the great flourish he made about organising the financial business of the nation better and all the pious platitudes he went on with, when he published that parliamentary museum piece <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances?</i></P>
    <P>The new agricultural package agreed by the Minister for Agriculture will have a major detrimental effect on the Irish economy.  The compensation arrangements offered to individual dairy farmers which have been set by mainland European standards, are attractive for those farmers who wish to avail of them in the short term but in national terms the real outcome will be a devastating blow to the milk industry and the whole economy.</P>
    <P>This reduction in the period of intervention for butter and milk powder has, at one stroke, removed the system which has underpinned the milk industry since 1957.  In so far as the dairying industry is concerned, it knocks the heart out of the CAP and in effect means that there is no longer any guaranteed milk price.</P>
    <P>The reduction of 9 per cent in milk <Col N="3746" /> output will cost this country a reduction of £300 million in exports.  It will reduce the milk pool by 110 million gallons.  It will eliminate about 2,500 jobs in the milk processing industry.  It is calculated that this reduction of 9 per cent in output will directly reduce dairy product exports by £150 million.  As it will take 140,000 cows out of milk production, the knock-on effect will be a corresponding reduction of £150 million in beef exports.  This is additional to the 10 per cent reduction in the value of our beef exports.  We calculate that the ultimate effect of these arrangements for milk and beef will be to reduce the value of Ireland's agricultural exports by at least one-sixth.  This is a major setback to the Irish economy.  To send messages of congratulations on such a development is a joke in very bad taste.</P>
    <P>It is not being alarmist to suggest that the entire structure of the Common Agricultural Policy as a basis of support for Irish farming is under major threat.  One major plank of the structure has just been removed.  It is clear that agricultural surpluses in the Community are to be eliminated. It will require determined and skilful negotiation on our part to ensure that the achievement of a balance between production and consumption in the Community is not achieved at the expense of the domestic producers, but that imports must also be curtailed.</P>
    <P>The Community is supposed to be committed to reducing regional disparities. We heard a lot of pious platitudes about cohesion here in the Dáil when the Government were bulldozing the Single European Act through the Oireachtas, the principal policy instrument for this being the Common Agricultural Policy, but the CAP is now being reorganised so as to freeze production patterns as between member states.  This allows this country no possibility of catching up.  It is deluding ourselves if we do not see these decisions resulting in thousands of Irish farmers being forced out of production and large tracts of land becoming semi-derelict.</P>
    <P>The present Minister has presided over the liquidation of most of the benefits that EC entry had brought to Ireland. <Col N="3747" /> The problem all along was that this Government have never been forceful or difficult or awkward about our case and have allowed themselves to be constantly out-manoeuvred and intimidated by more single-minded partners.  I accept the Minister tried to salvage what he could, but the overall effect on the Irish economy represents a serious setback and to indulge in the charade of sending messages of congratulations is pathetic politics.</P>
    <P>One of the major neglects by this Government is that they have not used our membership of the EMS to secure credit for farmers at reasonable rates of interest.  High interest rates are a major impediment to economic development generally, but particularly in agriculture. Irish farmers have had to endure the detrimental effects of poor negotiating performances on their behalf in Brussels; severe reductions in domestic Government support for agriculture; high interest rates and two seasons of unprecedentedly severe weather.  As a result, farm incomes fell by 12 per cent in 1985 and will probably fall by about 15 per cent in 1986.  There is no sign of any major Government review of agriculture in the light of these dramatic developments or any intention to take action or to work out a new plan of survival for Irish farmers.  What are we doing about the £2 billion now available in the Community budget as a result of this new package?  Between April 1983 and April 1985 the numbers engaged in agriculture in Ireland fell by 20,000, from 189,000 to 169,000.  This was after a relatively good year in 1984.  Such a drop would be serious enough in times of progress in the rest of the economy, but at this time to have tens of thousands of farmers forced out of farming and on to the dole queues is disastrous.</P>
    <P>Many people have been disturbed about the development of our foreign policy under this Coalition and the present Taoiseach.  There has been a major change in outlook and emphasis. We have moved perceptibly from an <Col N="3748" /> independent, principled stance in international affairs, to one of unqualified acceptance of the British-American policy line.  This change has been brought about cleverly and gradually over a period.  It can be seen most clearly in Ireland's attitude on a number of important international issues, such as South Africa, Nicaragua and the bombing of Tripoli.  The end result is that some of the stances which had earned us respect internationally are being fudged and blurred and we now implement a foreign policy which differs radically from that which was, by and large, followed by all previous Governments, Fianna Fáil and Coalition, since the war.  We now clearly accommodate, and adapt to the western alliance priorities.  From time to time, this leads us into peculiar stances and finds us taking strange courses of action.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the last two pieces of legislation to go through this Dáil were the Single European Act and the Extradition Bill.  Family legislation and other items of importance to our own people are discarded in favour of rushing these two Bills through.  Were we under orders?  I think it is alarming that the Dáil was pressured in this way in order, either to enhance the standing of the Taoiseach with his foreign friends or to meet commitments entered into.  One way or another, it was not the interests of the Irish people that were paramount.</P>
    <P>At the insistence of the Coalition, we have spent the last days of this session discussing a piece of legislation, the main purpose of which is to facilitate the handing over of Irish citizens to be tried for alleged offences either in Britain or Northern Ireland.  This is another example of the confused order of priorities of this Coalition Government.  What we should be talking about is the economy; about the collapse of the Irish economy, the appalling levels of unemployment and emigration, the continuing rise in Government borrowing, the crucifying burden of personal taxation. What the overwhelming majority of the Irish people would wish their Government to be doing at present would <Col N="3749" /> be putting forward proposals for economic recovery; proposals for the creation of employment.  The Government have lost their sense of proportion.  Of course we should play our part as good citizens of the international community of nations in combating the modern menace of international terrorism.  If the countries which are members of the Council of Europe are prepared to co-operate on a new regime of extraditing those guilty of terrorism, Ireland must play her part.</P>
    <P>But extradition and handing over the citizens of one country to a foreign system of justice is a complex and sensitive matter.  It is something that should have been processed through the Oireachtas in the normal way over a reasonable period of time, giving ample opportunity for full debate and discussion and providing all interested and concerned groups with plenty of time to make submissions. We have had instead this highpressured debate crammed into a few days.  Oireachtas Éireann has been compelled to jettison important and useful legislation and has been compelled to put to one side the urgent economic and social problems confronting the country in order to rush through this doubtful legislation which is causing widespread unease and dissatisfaction.  It has been given this absurd priority over far more important issues which deeply affect the welfare of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The people of this country should understand that Dáil Éireann did not have the opportunity to fully debate and examine this legislation or change or amend it for their better protection. There are 14 sections in the Bill but the Dáil had only got as far as the first section when the debate was brought to an end. There has been an unfortunate history of legal upsets in regard to extradition in this country.  I want to put the Government on notice that they must accept full responsibility for any consequences which may arise from their handling of this legislation.  For their own political and perhaps, even personal reasons, this legislation which deals with something as fundamental as the liberty of the citizen has been bulldozed through Parliament <Col N="3750" /> on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle. The blame for any mistakes made as a result of these unworthy parliamentary tactics will rest firmly on the shoulders of this Coalition.</P>
    <P>The next Government will have to undertake an urgent review of the manner in which the law is operating in different areas.  Recently, a number of court judgements have given rise to difficulties and to understandable astonishment among the public.  The present situation in regard to the Derrynaflan chalice, for instance, is most unsatisfactory and has given rise to a general concern about the protection of our archaeological heritage as a whole.  The award of compensation of almost £2½ million to persons wishing to develop a site in Dún Laoghaire and the striking out of a large number of summonses for motor offences are cases in point.  To the general public the law often seems to disregard commonsense and the realities of life.  Very often taxpayers and ratepayers have large arbitrary burdens placed upon them.</P>
    <P>It would seem that there is either continuing inefficiency and carelessness in some areas of the administration or alternatively the courts have become excessively legalistic in interpretation. Whatever else they may do, these instances underline the need there is for a continuing programme of law reform by the Oireachtas in order to keep up with changing conditions and circumstances of our time.</P>
    <P>I believe the people would wish the next Government to take a much clearer and more determined line internationally on the nuclear menace represented by both civil nuclear power and nuclear armaments.  We have at last got agreement about the closure of Sellafield. Despite well documented evidence of bad management and an appalling catalogue of almost 300 accidents and growing international concern and criticism about the operation of Sellafield, the Government here refused to face the reality that this installation is fundamentally <Col N="3751" /> unsafe and a threat to health and life on both sides of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, has finally been converted and has recognised that the call Fianna Fáil made for the closure of Sellafield has been right all along.  Now that the Government has officially acknowledged the danger of the nuclear menace at Sellafield, we must all combine to ensure that this monstrosity is closed down as soon as possible.  We should also replace the Nuclear Energy Board with a radiological protection institute which would have the statutory duty of taking all possible measures to protect our population against the menace of radiation and nuclear fall-out, monitor developments, publish full and reliable statistics and speak out straight-forwardly and independently when this is called for.</P>
    <P>Mentioning the Tánaiste directs my attention to something he said in his speech yesterday morning which must be answered.  I quote from what he said when referring to Fianna Fáil:</P>
    <P>I know that these decent men are only puppets and that behind them are the property speculators, the oil barons, and the gaming machine operators whose creed is the quick buck and whose coinage is the quality of life of the ordinary person.</P>
    <P>That represents the most blatant rubbish I ever heard in this House.  I am deeply disappointed that the Tánaiste of this Government should indulge in that sort of thing.  First of all, nobody knows better than the Tánaiste that the oil barons have the closest possible association with the Fine Gael Party.  These facts were published in our newspapers.  Secondly, when it came to the gaming machine operators, their friends were in Fine Gael.  It was a Fine Gael Minister who tried to put through legislation to protect them and it was Fianna Fáil who stopped that from happening last year.  The Tánaiste, if he wants to criticise Fianna Fáil, should try to find some valid grounds for doing so and should not resort to these untrue and tatty accusations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3752" /> This nation is compelled once again to do battle with two traditional foes. Unemployment and emigration have now reached a level that is undermining the viability of Irish society.  The challenge must be faced.  There is hardly a family in the land left untouched.  Once again, Irish men and women, boys and girls, are going out to all parts of the world anxiously seeking out a new opportunity in life.  In many cases, the whole family has gone.  It is this flood of emigration that really reflects the failure of the last four years.  Do this Government know, for instance, that there are many thousands of young Irish people making out as illegal emigrants in the United States, who cannot come home to be with their families this Christmas?  Do they know?  Do they care?</P>
    <P>Irish political leadership today must recognise a new dimension of responsibility, a duty to represent all the people &mdash; those who have been forced to emigrate, as well as those who have stayed at home.  Our political message is clear &mdash; there is a better way of running our affairs; there is an alternative to negative Coalition.  There is work to be done which this Coalition are incapable of doing.  The last four ghastly years have taken their toll, but 1987 lies ahead and offers the chance of a new beginning.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are ready to go before the people; united and disciplined; the only party capable of handling the deep crisis of morale that confronts the Irish people today.  The scale of problems we face does not deter us because we are confident that we can revive the national spirit and generate a great resurgence of confidence that will make recovery possible.</P>
    <P>The next Government must go for growth.  This is fundamental.  It is only through growth that we can battle our way out of the present crisis.  We have the resources, human and material, but they must be marshalled and organised. Fianna Fáil Governments have done this before with dramatic success.  It can and must be done again.</P>
    <P>Our national pride is involved in halting the humiliation of the emigration of <Col N="3753" /> young people and providing the opportunities for them to work at home. Employment should be a central Government priority, but it has not been during the last four years.  We must generate the belief that as a nation we can make it, that we have the capacity to resolve our problems without calling in the IMF or anyone else.</P>
    <P>We have identified many areas where growth and development and investment are immediately possible. We have proposed the establishment of a Department of the Marine &mdash; Roinn na Mara &mdash; which will be given national responsibility for the full exploitation and development of our marine resources.  Let us make the best of the advantages there are in being an island nation.  Boat-building and ship repair can be quickly revived.  The liquidation of Irish Shipping was not just a severe blow to national pride and self-confidence, but was a major strategic mistake. There are many ways in which we can re-establish our merchant shipping fleet without any recourse to scarce Exchequer resources.  At present the outlook for sea fishing and fish processing is good.  There is enormous scope for the development of fish-farming and aquaculture and for the harvesting of non-quota species by a modernised, re-equipped shipping fleet.</P>
    <P>We have also proposed the transformation of the Department of Agriculture into a Department of Agriculture and Food.  It will have the new role of giving a major impetus to food processing and developing the scope that exists for new quality foods.  The application of biotechnology and scientific research to the agricultural industry can provide a range of new marketable products.  There must be full recognition of the fact that the primary purpose of agriculture is to produce food.  Agriculture must be replanned to supply the needs of a food processing industry.  That has now become all important in view of the quantitative restrictions which the Government have agreed to impose on our two main areas of output, beef and milk.</P>
    <P>We have proposed the establishment <Col N="3754" /> of a new board to promote and develop the horticultural industry.  We have shown that a major reduction in the import of food and vegetables can be achieved very quickly and viable employment provided in the industry.</P>
    <P>We have a considerable mineral wealth in and around this country.  A major exploration and development programme for onshore minerals with appropriate incentives must be implemented. We must make better use of our natural gas resources &mdash; in fact we could hardly make worse &mdash; and ensure that by development of the market the incentive is provided to discover more oil and gas.</P>
    <P>I have drawn attention on many occasions to the possibilities for the development here of a major financial services sector.  In this country we have many advantages which would enable us to expand and develop such a service industry and provide excellent, highquality employment.</P>
    <P>For this purpose we must streamline the financial regulatory environment. Instead of being negative and restrictive, the primary focus of the regulatory regime we impose must be to create the framework for the development of an international modern financial services sector here.</P>
    <P>A financial services industry depends more on a comprehensive sophisticated communications system than anything else.  We should develop a communications centre which would allow the development of Irish-based international trading, clearing systems and back-up systems for the major financial institutions.  We have all the basic resources.  What is required is a strategy to mobilise and organise them into a very lucrative national enterprise.</P>
    <P>We also have all the resources necessary to achieve a major expansion in high technology, science-based industries. Fianna Fáil would give a whole new emphasis to the application of science and technology to the economy, give it an important role in economic development and appoint a special Minister who would have responsibility for the development <Col N="3755" /> and application of this important resource.</P>
    <P>Tourism development is going to be of major importance to our economy in the future.  Nearly all Governments around the world now take measures to promote and support the tourist industry, and treat it as relevant to decisions on the environment, transport and the preservation of heritage.  Irish tourism had a great period of expansion during the sixties. We must re-establish it as a major source of employment, earnings and growth.  We must facilitate access to the country and develop activities and amenities.  Tourism is an international growth industry and we must ensure that we secure a worthwhile part of that growth.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for an entirely new approach to our forests.  They must be organised and development on commercial lines.  One option readily available is to combine forestry with the operations of Bord na Móna, especially as there are many similarities between these two areas.  It is evident, too, given changes in the Common Agricultural Policy that there will be greater scope for forestry development, not just by the State but by private individuals.</P>
    <P>I have already been convinced that in every area of this country there are resources and ideas for development.  If local authorities had a greater degree of autonomy it would release local enthusiasm and initiative by freeing them from the dead hand of over-centralisation.  An active policy of regional development and decentralisation would also give a great impetus to the development of local resources, human and material.  Regional policy should ensure that economic and social progress are shared equally throughout the country.  We do not want to allow the creation of economic wastelands or major areas of social deprivation.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem, however, facing the incoming Government will be to undo the damage done to the people's morale and confidence.  This nation, however, has shown great spirit and determination on many occasions in the past.  There <Col N="3756" /> have been periods of tremendous national unity and purpose in the past when difficulties as great in their own way as those we now face have been overcome.</P>
    <P>What we must do now is revive the spirit of this nation.  For this, the first requirement is a stable united Government who have the political capacity to govern effectively.  The election of such a Government by a clear-cut decision of the people will, I am certain, have an immediate impact in lifting morale and confidence.</P>
    <P>I believe the public would view with horror another post-election situation which would see parties haggling, bargaining and compromising in an effort to put together some new form of Coalition. The people do not want another Coalition in any shape or form.  They have seen that it dissipates political energy in divisive infighting and political manoeuvring. We have had three Coalitions and none of them has worked well.  This last one has been the worst of all.  The economic problems today are of such a deep-seated nature and extent that they can only be overcome if the right policies are firmly and consistently followed over a reasonably long period of time and only a single party, united Government can do that.</P>
    <P>The second requirement is that the Government should encourage a sense of pride in our country and what it has been able to achieve in the past.  We can be very proud of the contribution our people have made in every continent to the cause of liberty and human welfare and progress. There must be an end to this apologising for being what we are and trying to conform to the standards and attitudes of others.  We must be prepared to take an independent stand, when necessary, on world issues.  Let us not be afraid to defend our vital interests and make others aware of them.  The world takes any nation at its face value.</P>
    <P>We must rebuild a sense of national unity and solidarity.  This Coalition have allowed themselves to govern in a very partisan manner, listening in the main only to those they know and associate <Col N="3757" /> with.  Whole regions, classes and sections of our national community have been left outside, cut off from influence and a say in the broad process of Government.</P>
    <P>It was a fatal mistake by this Coalition to reject the concept of an understanding between the social partners and the Government, based on a consensus on the broad objectives of economic and social planning.  This was clearly a deliberate policy on their part.  Both trade unions and employers were effectively kept at arm's length.  This has brought divisiveness and confrontation. Employers, trade unions, farmers, vocational organisations and representative bodies should all be fully involved in economic and social planning if we are to succeed.  As far as possible, there must be created a shared sense of purpose based on a broad consensus.  In this connection I welcome the recent NESC report.  A reasonably long term strategic approach to the economy can be agreed in consultation with the social partners.  This kind of close relationship with the social partners is a feature of a number of those small European nations which have managed to come through this recession relatively unscathed.  It will require leadership and responsibility on the part of both trade unions and employers and I believe they are not only ready for it but are anxious to bring it about.</P>
    <P>What we have here at present is a Government under siege, a Government paralysed by forces they are unable to confront.  Their inability to govern derives mainly from their failure to secure the loyalty and support of their own backbenchers.  In behaving the way they are, however, those backbenchers are doing nothing more than trying to save their seats and fend off public anger. They are trying to sidestep the odium and ignominy of Government policies.</P>
    <P>The deep-seated problems which confront our economy demand brave and decisive action.  Time and again we have seen this disoriented administration blackmailed by a succession of individuals. Policies have been enunciated and Bills promulgated by Ministers only <Col N="3758" /> to have them diluted and rewritten to the point where they become meaningless.</P>
    <P>As one Fine Gael and Labour backbencher after another seeks to distance himself or herself from this failed, intensely disliked Coalition administration, the Government are reduced to an exercise in fire fighting.</P>
    <P>That is no way to run a country at the best of times.  It is catastrophic in a country which confronts an economic crisis of unparalleled severity as we do at present.</P>
    <P>There is an almost universal demand among the general public for a change of Government; for an end to this nightmare of business failures, close-downs, mass unemployment, emigration, reduction in social welfare and cut-backs in health and other vital services.</P>
    <P>The people of this country want a Government who will put their interests ahead of all other political and personal preferences.  They want a Government who will devote themselves totally to their economic welfare and not chase after some sort of international approval which is bought at their, the people's, expense.</P>
    <P>A national programme of economic recovery is a vital necessity.  It is only through economic growth that we can secure a solution to the deep-seated economic and social problems which confront us at present.  Our approach to economic planning will be practical, realistic and based on what is feasible.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believe that this nation has the human and the material resources which are needed for a major programme of economic recovery and we have experience in formulating and implementing successful policies for growth.</P>
    <P>We are also convinced that an essential ingredient for economic recovery is a revival of the spirit and the self-confidence of the nation in order to get economic activity started up again.  Only coherent sustained political leadership by a united Government can bring this about.</P>
    <P>Every major newspaper in this country has called for an election.  Can the Taoiseach be so insensitive, so immune to <Col N="3759" /> what the whole country is saying?  Is just being in office more important than what parliamentary tradition calls for; what the economic and the public finances urgently require; what the people want?</P>
    <P>This sorry Coalition chapter should now be closed and the Irish people given the opportunity to make a new start in 1987.</P>
    <P>There is the general view around this House that the Taoiseach is not sure whether he is coming or going.  In that case would he not for Heaven's sake do the right thing and go &mdash; now?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inform the House of the outcome of the recent Council of Agriculture Ministers' discussion in Brussels, held over the past two weeks and which dealt with beef and milk in particular. Those discussions undoubtedly constituted one of the longest and most difficult debates in the history of the Community, involving some 90 hours of tough and complex negotiations on two highly important products.</P>
      <P>There were a number of major considerations in the background.  In particular, the Community's intervention stocks of butter had reached alarming levels, and were continuing to rise steadily. Beef intervention stocks too were being replaced almost as fast as they could be sold.  The persistence and size of stocks were having an adverse influence on world market prices.  The financial burden for the Community was becoming intolerable.  Those were factors which could have endangered the whole future of the Common Agricultural Policy if action had not been taken, and taken fast.  The longer these problems were ignored the worse they got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Council had not acted decisively at this stage, the Commission would have had to take measures under its own powers &mdash; indeed it clearly indicated its intention to do so &mdash; and those measures would have had an extremely unfavourable impact on this country.  So it was neither in the interest of the CAP nor <Col N="3760" /> in our national interest for us to block Council decisions on these matters, provided adequate account was taken of Ireland's special needs.  We did take measures of that nature.  I let it be known at a very early stage in our discussions on the set of milk proposals that if butter intervention for Ireland was not continued I would veto that particular issue. The very threat of vetoing that proposal was sufficient for us to get a commitment that our intervention for butter would continue.  A number of other countries wanted the same concession but did not succeed in getting it.</P>
    <P>Eventually on the beef proposal, which I did not think was beneficial to us &mdash; which I thought could have been quite damaging in fact &mdash; I did veto the proposal. I think there is some confusion about that, with some people saying we threatened to veto but did not actually veto.  We actually did veto.  I quoted &ldquo;a vital national interest&rdquo;.  The Commission's proposal was withdrawn and was substituted by a new proposal which I found to be sufficiently satisfactory, not entirely to our liking but sufficiently modified to enable us to agree to it.  That exercise of the veto involved our getting a premium for all male cattle in the country and, in 1987, should mean an additional £22 million for this country.  Therefore there was an invocation of the veto.</P>
    <P>The original Commission's proposals definitely did not make sufficient allowance for our needs.  For instance, a 15 per cent cut in beef intervention prices was proposed and a free hand was proposed for the Commission in suspending butter intervention, both of which were totally unacceptable to us.  Neither did I judge the early compromise proposals adequate for this country and I acted accordingly in the Council.  But, bearing in mind the consequences for the Common Agricultural Policy of a failure of the Council, the final outcome was satisfactory and the package the best that could be obtained. Indeed, I succeeded in having a number of changes made which represented a considerable gain to Ireland over the Commission's original proposals and, in some cases, over the position obtaining. <Col N="3761" /> I shall be giving details of these shortly.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention another background factor &mdash; the current round of GATT negotiations which is now getting under way.  Agriculture is involved in these negotiations.  It is important that anti-surplus action taken by the Community internally should be matched by the major third country suppliers so that all would contribute equitably to an improvement in the world market for dairy products in particular.  I am glad to say that the recent decisions in Brussels include an undertaking by the Council that the Community will ensure it gets full credit in GATT for its actions on milk surpluses.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of loose talk about stopping imports into the Community from third countries, that it is quite a simple matter to do so.  Many of the imports into the Community from third countries and which are causing problems are bound up in GATT arrangements.  As we all know, GATT is the international forum for making trade arrangements and those arrangements are extremely legally binding.  They cannot be terminated on a unilateral basis, it must be a bilateral arrangement between the countries involved, whether that be the EC bloc and an individual country or another group of countries.  It is simplistic and untrue to say that we could stop those imports merely by a wave of the hand. That is not the case.  It is also true that these GATT arrangements were drawn up mainly in the early and mid-sixties prior to our entry into the Community. They cannot be easily dismantled.</P>
    <P>I hope that the talks which commenced in Uruguay about two to three months ago will lead to a reduction in these imports, particularly of cereal substitutes into the Community, because that is what these talks are all about.  I think they are due to continue for three to four years: at least that is the time span that has been mentioned.  But I hope that some of the agreements made in the early sixties are terminated, even at a cost to the Community. I believe that if they are terminated considerable compensation will have to be paid, but certainly it would be an <Col N="3762" /> advantage if they were terminated or if their impact was reduced.</P>
    <P>Everyone is conscious that, as well as restraining the build-up of surpluses, the Community must act to dispose of the stocks already there.  Their disposal with all possible speed is essential to restore world market balance and strengthen world prices which, as I have indicated, have been weakened by the very fact that such large stocks are held in the Community.  Therefore, I am particularly pleased that the Council were able to note with approval the Commission's disposal programme with special reference to butter but with indications of further disposal action for beef also.  The programme is to apply in 1987-88 and aims at bringing down butter intervention stocks, in particular, to normal levels by the end of that period.</P>
    <P>The Commission put forward a paper earlier this week, or maybe late last week &mdash; one begins to lose track of time, but it was within the past week or ten days &mdash; which would result in the spending of a considerable amount of money to get rid of the bulk of the butter at present in intervention.  There are 1.3 million tonnes of butter in intervention stores at the moment, and the Commission are proposing that one million tonnes of this butter be disposed of over the next three years.  The cost of that disposal is estimated at 3.2 billion ECUs or approximately IR£2.5 billion.  The methods of disposal are quite varied.  One is that we proceed with aggressive marketing on Third World markets to sell off a good deal of it.  Secondly, quite a quantity of it would be converted into animal feed and also quite a deal of it would be distributed to social welfare recipients throughout the Community.  A rather ingenious proposal, which I gather has been made to operate commercially in New Zealand in the recent past, is to convert butter into motor fuel or fuel oils. Another conversion would be into butter oil which then could be used to compete against vegetable oils and fats which have been displacing considerable amounts of butter output within the Community.  We would be extremely interested in seeing <Col N="3763" /> a policy like that carried out because the sooner those stocks are got rid of the better for the Irish dairy industry.  Unless the stocks are got rid of we will be under severe pressure from the Commission to have prices reduced or to have support mechanisms dismantled, and by support mechanisms I mean intervention.</P>
    <P>I will now set out briefly what was put forward by the Commission in their original price proposals and outline what was agreed in the milk and beef sectors. The Commission's milk proposals were made against the background of a serious imbalance in the market, unacceptably high Community stock levels and the critical budgetary situation.  They included the arbitrary suspension of intervention for butter and skim milk powders, milk production cuts of 9.5 per cent, the removal of the right to operate a quota system at the level of co-operative or dairy, that is Formula B, and the continuation of the off-setting of surpluses and deficits between co-operatives.</P>
    <P>My intention in the negotiations was to protect our overall interests and to seek to negotiate an improved package. This could not be achieved simply by preventing the Council reaching agreement. Irish producers are only too well aware of the powers the Commission has to make changes in intervention arrangements resulting in substantial reductions in milk and beef prices.  This year alone milk prices have been reduced by about 6p per gallon through delays in intervention payments.  That reduction was not noticed by most people because we had two green currency devaluations this year, one in April and one in September, and together they constituted a green currency devaluation of 9 per cent, which gave us an approximate increase in the price of a gallon of milk of 8p.  Therefore, the reduction by the Community of the price of milk by 6p went unnoticed by most people.  These measures could depress prices further by extending the delay periods for payment for products going into intervention.  There is no limit to the delays which they could bring <Col N="3764" /> about.  They could increase the present limit to a year, or possibly to two years, and we could have a price reduction in the order of 10p, 15p or 20p a gallon with no legal recourse at all to take action against the Commission.  It has that power of delaying payments.  Therefore it was important that we get a settlement. Had the Council not reached agreement this week I have no doubt that the Commission would have set about introducing measures which could have and would have resulted in further reductions in milk prices.  I feel that I have achieved a much improved package and it would seem that that assessment is accepted generally.</P>
    <P>A major consideration for me in so far as the dairying sector was concerned was to protect the intervention system for butter.  Milk prices in this country would collapse without the support of butter intervention.  This year we are producing 150,000 tonnes of butter.  We are putting or have put 85,000 tonnes of that 150,000 tonnes of butter into intervention.  More than half our total production has gone into intervention.  Therefore, one can imagine the catastrophe it would be for the dairy industry if the Commission had succeeded in getting the power to stop Irish butter from going into intervention.</P>
    <P>The Commission was seeking to obtain absolute control to reduce or eliminate intervention as it saw fit.  The decision by the Council was that criteria would be agreed before the end of February to allow for the replacement of intervention at certain times by alternative measures which would safeguard the stability of the market.  When agreement was reached on these criteria Ireland, as a result of the recognition by the Council of our unique dependence on the dairy sector, has a much stronger claim to intervention than any other member state.  It is extremely important that we got that condition.</P>
    <P>At the request of the Council the Commission has agreed, with regard to the importance of intervention purchasing of butter to this country, market stability and return to producers in Ireland, to take full account of this in any decisions to <Col N="3765" /> be taken.  Furthermore, the Commission have agreed to remove the extra delays on take-over for intervention as soon as the general criteria referred to are put into effect.  This will be worth roughly between 5p and 6p per gallon to Irish milk producers.  In other words, the reduction of the delay payments should mean that milk producers in this country will get an increase in the price of milk of between 5p and 6p per gallon.</P>
    <P>In so far as the quota system is concerned, let me say that I have never concealed my view that any solution to restore the balance in the market should centre on the level of quotas, which was the method designed to restore balance in the first instance.  The alternatives of severe price reductions or allowing the serious imbalance to drift without taking remedial action, would have had much more damaging effects on our milk industry. From the outset it was made clear by the other member states that no exemptions from quota reductions would be tolerated.  That theme was running through these talks since negotiations commenced.  Other member states claimed that they had suffered too much because of our exemption in the original super-levy deal in 1984.  I emphasised strongly and continuously the special position of the milk sector in Ireland but it became quite clear as the discussion progressed that to have blocked Council agreement would not have been in Irish interests.  They could have lengthened the delay period for payment on products going into intervention, or they could have withdrawn the facility to use intravention for butter, because a majority of members of the Council were willing to give them those powers.</P>
    <P>I succeeded in obtaining substantial gains and securing a number of important objectives in relation to the quota cuts. While quotas will be reduced by 8.5 per cent overall, the reductions will be generously compensated and we will also retain the relative quota advantage of over 20 per cent more than other member states that we negotiated in 1984.  Of the 8.5 per cent reduction, 3 per cent will come from the voluntary cessation scheme for <Col N="3766" /> which applications are being invited at present but the premium payable to producers who are prepared to surrender their quotas has been increased from 15.3 pence per gallon to 23 pence a gallon for each of the seven years.  This income will apply to existing as well as new applications. Up to this week the cessation scheme had not been fully subscribed, but only to the extent of 68 per cent.  As a result of the compensation going up from 15p to 23p a gallon each year for seven years, I expect that the cessation scheme will be vastly over-subscribed within a short time.  That indicates how people welcome the considerable increase in the compensation.</P>
    <P>As a result of the increase, the scheme is almost certain to be over-subscribed and in that event no compulsory cuts in quotas will be necessary.  The new premium is attractive.  For instance, a farmer who wishes to give up milk production and has a quota of 20,000 gallons, which is roughly the average for this country, will receive a payment of £4,600 each year or a total of £32,200 over the full seven-year period.  If a farmer had a quota of 40,000 gallons, he would get £64,000 and if he had a quota of 100,000 gallons he would receive a payment of £161,000.  Deputy Noonan might think about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might think about it.  The remaining 5.5 per cent cut is to be obtained by way of temporary linear suspensions in the quotas of all producers.  I accepted the concept of temporary suspensions because the experience here has been that producers who might otherwise volunteer to join a cessation scheme are put off by the fact that they have to give up milk production on a permanent basis.  The first 4 per cent of <Col N="3767" /> the temporary cut in quotas will take effect on 1 April next and the further 1.5 per cent reduction in 1988.  The compensation of 38 pence per gallon to be paid for these cuts for each of the following two years is very generous and should more than compensate farmers for not being able to produce a small portion of their quotas in the two-year period.  The further 1.5 per cent to be taken temporarily from quotas on 1 April 1988 will similarly receive compensation. These levels of compensation are all the more attractive bearing in mind that some member states wanted linear cuts in quotas with no compensation at all. The super-levy system runs out at the end of 1988-89 and these temporary suspensions, together with all other aspects of the regime, will fall to be considered at that time.</P>
      <P>Some people will say that we did not get the temporary cessation, that the Germans or the French got it, but the fact is that we demanded it, and it is primarily there because of our insistence. It is only temporary and it will be reviewed at the end of two years, at which time people will be allowed to take back their 4 per cent, or some portion of it, or continue to be compensated.</P>
      <P>Another important aspect of the milk agreement for me was that we managed to retain the operation of the quota system at co-op or dairy level.  Its removal would have created grave distortions in the system and prevented any proper structural development.  I also succeeded in retaining the provision allowing surpluses on some co-op areas to be offset against deficits from other co-ops in the country.  The effect of this arrangement has been to reduce our national super-levy bill substantially for the first two years of the operation of the system.  Had these two measures gone through as proposed by the Commission, the total quota cut in Ireland would effectively have been 12 per cent rather than the 9.5 per cent seen by the Commission as the cut needed over the Community as a whole and at least 6 per cent of that cut would not have been compensated for at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3768" /> If the Commission's proposal for quotas on a firm basis had gone through, our milk production would quickly have been reduced by 5 per cent and we would not have got a penny compensation.  We were primarily responsible for stopping that proposal from going through.  In essence, it would have meant that if one farmer over-produced milk and another farmer under-produced it, the farmer who under-produced could not compensate the one who over-produced and so the under-production would be lost. We would have lost 5 per cent of our milk production if that proposal had gone through, without compensation.  If we were not allowed to transfer milk co-ops we would have lost about another ½ per cent to 1 per cent.  Overall we could have lost 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>We also obtained a commitment that in any voluntary cessation schemes we can ensure that the reductions in quotas will be as evenly divided as possible between all the co-ops and dairies in the country.  This will avoid disproportionate losses of quotas from some areas which might otherwise have occurred.  This is particularly important, as I said here during Question Time yesterday, for co-operatives in Connacht and Ulster.  In the cessation scheme to date a disproportionate number of applications have come from those areas and it could mean that while we are having a cut nationally of 2 per cent in milk production, there might have been a cut as high as 7 per cent or 8 per cent in those areas where the co-operatives are smaller and the age factor among the producers is such that many people are voluntarily getting out of milk production.  What I am aiming to do is to spread the 2 per cent evenly right around the country so that no co-op will have to suffer a greater cut than 2 per cent.  That should be possible with the increased compensation which should mean that we will have an avalanche of applications for the scheme.</P>
    <P>Further satisfactory developments in the milk package from our point of view were the acceptance of the Commission's plans to run down butter stocks &mdash; a vital issue for us &mdash; and an increase in the level <Col N="3769" /> of subsidy from 29p to 66p in the butter scheme which applies to all recipients of social assistance payments in Ireland. Other member states do not as yet apply the scheme.</P>
    <P>The choice for me, therefore, was to participate in a process which would ensure the continuation of an effective support mechanism allowing us to trade normally on commercial markets and ensure stability for the future of the milk industry or to refuse to participate and have more draconian measures imposed on us.  If agreement had not been achieved there is no doubt but that, as already stated, the Commission would have further extended payment periods for intervention and further reduced milk prices here.  In these circumstances it is satisfactory that a much improved package on milk has been achieved while, at the same time, decisions have been made which will result in a much better market balance for the future.  Two things are important, a sound and thriving market and high prices for farmers.  Farmers incomes will not suffer but could actually be enhanced because of the high level of compensation and because of the restoration of the normal delay for payments which will mean in April a price increase of something like 6p a gallon on milk.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to beef. Deputies will know that the beef sector in the EC has been going through a particularly difficult period.  This was due to many factors including post super-levy slaughterings of dairy cows, high stocks in private storage, imports from third countries, the recession, competition from other meats such as poultry, reduced purchasing power of the oil states and, to some extent, changing consumer preferences.  The end result of all this has been a combination of depressed market prices, low producer incomes and huge intervention stocks.  Indeed these stocks were at one stage nearly a million tonnes.  Even the present level of about 600,000 tonnes is not acceptable.  The beef is bought at high prices stored at enormous cost and eventually sold at very low prices.  In fact the German Minister continuously says he is fed up with the <Col N="3770" /> cost of intervention, that all it is doing is making millionaires out of people with cold stores and feeding the Russians for nothing.  Basically, he is right to an extent but of course intervention supports the market and it is invaluable to us.  We have got to have it retained and we will have it retained.</P>
    <P>While the intervention system is effective and essential from our point of view we have to recognise that the cost was excessive and some action had to be taken.  It was against this background that the EC Commission made their original proposals.  They suggested that intervention should apply only in so-called crisis situations.  In addition, we were to lose a valuable calf premium scheme and our entitlement to the UK variable premium scheme.  These proposals were not acceptable to us and I vigorously opposed them at the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>What we achieved earlier this week was a considerable improvement on the original proposals.  Let me say quickly that all these premia were to be done away with.  The suckler cow premium which was worth £12 million to us was to be eliminated.  Not only is it not going to be eliminated but we have received an increase and it is now going to be worth £50 million to us in 1987.  The calf premium has also been retained and this is worth £12 million to us.  We also benefit from the variable premium which is operated by the UK but all the beef which goes from this country to the UK qualifies for the variable premium which is worth between £10 million and £12 million to us each year.  That was also supposed to go.  All those three which were supposed to go and which are worth approximately £40 million to this country have been retained.</P>
    <P>In addition, by vetoing the beef proposal I got a concession that there would be an entitlement of £14.72 per head in respect of all male cattle.  That concession is worth about £22 million.  Overall, what we are going to receive from the four premia is £60 million in 1987.  The Commission's original proposal would have meant that intervention would practically <Col N="3771" /> cease.  That has been averted.  The outcome of the negotiations is that we have retained access to intervention, have retained all the premia at existing or higher rates and now have an additional premium of about £15 on the first 50 adult male cattle on each holding.  Conducted as they were on the basis of very severe proposals and against the background of a very difficult financial situation we have come out of the beef negotiations better than any other member state.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, if you interrupt me to tell me that I have less than what you stated I will not hold you to the 30 minutes.  The expansion of our export markets is the biggest challenge facing all sectors of Irish industry. Notwithstanding all the rhetoric in the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy and in <i>Building on Reality</i> the Government have failed miserably to meet the challenge.  They have flinched from the challenge and the two documents are monuments to their ineptitude and lack of coherence and resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the present Government indigenous industry has experienced a series of adverse circumstances unprecedented in the history of the State.  It has been crippled by high interest rates and ineffective exchange rate policy management. It has not enjoyed the sort of conditions at home which are necessary for expansion into the lucrative export <Col N="3772" /> markets abroad.  Fianna Fáil in Government will be stressing export led economic development which will lead to the creation of jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It might appear from an unofficial note I have got from your Whip that you may not be resuming at 2 p.m.  In other words, you could be finished at 1 p.m. but you can sort that out between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has been sorted out; 15 minutes is what I have.  Two out of every three jobs in manufacturing depend on our success in exporting to the international markets.  We export over half of our total industrial output. Exports are the life blood of the economy.</P>
      <P>This Government have damaged our exporting capacity by their failure to contain interest rates and by their refusal to pass on the full benefit of falling energy prices to industry by way of lower electricity prices.  High interest rates are depressing investment, which is vital if we are to sustain growth in export led industry.  We will not get the level of investment required if interest rates do not come down.  Government ineptitude on the trade front is underlined by their utter failure to create a climate conducive to enterprise, innovation, and investment.</P>
      <P>The inherent unreality of their approach is seen from their dogged insistence throughout this year that an impending consumer spending boom would boost economic growth.  This consumer boom failed to materialise.  Yet, the Government obstinately clung to this myth in their economic statements in the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that this Government, so preoccupied with internal wrangling, are incapable of taking a proper perspective on our export potential.  They have virtually ignored the necessity to penetrate new markets such as that of Japan.  Irish firms should be actively encouraged to respond positively to Japan's efforts to open up access to the Japanese market to foreign companies.  While Irish exports <Col N="3773" /> to Japan are doing well in highly-skilled areas, such as chemicals, semi-precious stones, optical equipment and quality knitwear, trade has remained at around the £150 million mark during the past three years.  There must be a much more concerted effort to further penetrate this lucrative market.</P>
    <P>Such an export drive would contribute to closing our trade gap with the Japanese.  While our trade with them has remained worth about £150 million, imports from Japan jumped in value from £244 million in 1983 to £299 million in 1984 and £334 million in 1985.  Irish exporters must capitalise on the fact that Japanese importers have proved receptive to high quality Irish goods.  This Government have failed to stress the potential of the Japanese market which has 120 million people and is the world's leading economy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, the Government's greatest disservice to the development of trade and commence is their abject failure to even attempt to stem the exodus of the 50,000 young people who have fled the country over the last two years.  Instead of exporting products, this Government export people and money.  These include a high percentage of graduates in the advanced high technology field who have now emigrated to help develop the economies of our competitors.  With better management on the part of the Government, these highly skilled young people could have been retained at home to help build up the native technological sector, in particular to help the small firms sector in their application of new technology developments.</P>
    <P>While one must fully acknowledge the IDA's efforts to encourage technology transfer and joint ventures, between manufacturing concerns here and abroad, it is clear that much more must be done in this area.  Indigenous firms must be encouraged to boost both their research-development capacity and their marketing capacity.  In many cases Irish firms are without the financial resources necessary to embark on research and development programmes.  It is clear that at official level, there must be a much <Col N="3774" /> more concerted effort to facilitate such firms in their efforts to gain access to the new and emerging technologies.  I am disappointed that the Government have not done more to encourage licensing arrangements and technology transfer to boost the technological capacity of our industry.  It is through concentrating on development export-oriented industrial firms that we will overcome our unemployment and fiscal problems.</P>
    <P>The trading figures for the first 10 months of 1986 underline the difficult trading conditions under which Irish companies are operating.  The value of exports has declined by 6 per cent and the value of imports by 10 per cent during the first 10 months of 1986 compared with the corresponding period in 1985.</P>
    <P>It is particularly worrying to note that in October, the main decline occurred in the machinery and transport equipment category in which office machines and computer exports fell by £61 million.  The decline in imports in October is also disturbing given the fact that Irish exports rely to a certain extent on imports for raw materials.  In October imports were down £61.3 million on the corresponding period in 1985.</P>
    <P>Only by developing the marketing strategy and exporting capacity of our firms, will we advance towards the goal of fully exploiting the advantages of the EC markets.</P>
    <P>For the past four years, we have watched the Government pay lip service to the tourist industry.  They have shunted ministerial responsibility for the industry between Departments, ensuring that policy-making for the industry remains institutionally rudderless.  Overall, they have failed in relation to tourism.  They have failed to act in the knowledge that we have unique and excellent potential as a tourist centre.</P>
    <P>They have failed to take the creative steps which are necessary to realise the potential of Irish tourism in terms of jobs and foreign exchange earnings.  The Government have clung to the outmoded assumption that tourism can continue to be treated by Government in the same haphazard fashion as heretofore.  This is <Col N="3775" /> not true.  Tourism is a growth industry, which according to the OECD is second only to banking in its contribution to the value of international trade.  Government and policy makers will have to take cognisance the fact that international tourism is no longer a secondary activity but one that is vitally important to employment and the balance of payments.  Yet this Government, ignoring the fact that tourism is our third most important industry have refused over the past four years to focus on the developmental needs of the industry.  They have ignored all the warning signs &mdash; our declining share of world tourism and US tourism expenditure in Europe and our failure to increase our share of the lucrative continental markets. They have watched these trends and refused to take corrective action.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious failures of the Government in relation to tourism lies in their refusal to take action to stem the deterioration in the environment.  This is an insidious process which has resulted in a steady and gradual erosion of the environment on which tourism depends. We are by laziness and apathy, killing the goose that lays the golden egg as far as tourist revenue returns are concerned. Despite all the well-intentioned rhetoric in the White Paper on Tourism on the need to protect the environment its fragile nature continues to be eroded.  The Government have flinched from using all the powers at their disposal to arrest the process of deterioration in the physical environment which has been evident for the past decade and a half.  Litter, graffiti, indiscriminate dumping and water pollution are all capable of control if we enforce the law.  The Government's refusal to do this is leading to a serious situation with disastrous implications for the future of the industry.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Government to overcome national carelessness in relation to the environment by carefully and strictly ensuring that the regulations on the Statute Books are implemented.  The Government have failed to capitalise on the increasing public awareness of environmental importance and initiate a <Col N="3776" /> rethink of our physical planning regulations. This apathy on the part of the Coalition is also reflected in their failure to take action to increase the co-ordination of activities in relation to tourism.</P>
    <P>It was proposed in the White Paper on Tourism that to achieve the full cooperation of all Departments in tourist affairs the Government would establish an interdepartmental policy co-ordination committee chaired by a senior civil servant.  Almost one and a half years later this committee, if it was ever activated by the Government, has failed to come up with solutions for the integration of activities at Government level in relation to tourism.  There has been no concerted attempt by the Government to review Bord Fáilte's strategy on marketing yet the need for such a review is glaringly obvious from the decline in tourism earnings and visitor numbers in the last four years.  In revenue terms the American market this year will be down by £40 million from 1985 due to a drop of 20 per cent in the number of US visitors. Overall, total overseas tourism revenue in 1986 will be down by 6 per cent on the 1985 figure.  The Government have failed to make up ground lost on the UK and European markets.  This year saw a small decline in numbers coming from west Germany, a market with tremendous potential which would reward a more concerted marketing drive.</P>
    <P>The Government have ignored the need to gear the efforts of Irish tourism to capture an increased share of the lucrative continental market.  All the strengths of tourism are God given and all the weaknesses are man made.  The Government have consistently denied the necessary resources to Bord Fáilte to enable them to meet their targets as laid down in the White Paper on Tourism.  The spend on every job by the Coalition averages £2,000 in the industrial sector and £2,150 the agricultural sector but £850 is all they can muster as far as tourism is concerned.  Out of the total spend on all these industries only 3 per cent is given to the tourism sector.  They have failed to recognise how labour intensive the tourist <Col N="3777" /> industry is and the great potential for job creation that exists in the industry.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that a new political standing will have to be given to the industry.  It can no longer be shunted about from one dependency to another.  It is appended to whatever Department is willing to take it.  It has no clout and, consequently, it is not able to meet the targets set down for it.  Our share of international tourism has collapsed over the last number of years.  The level of our competitiveness has been eroded by severe Government taxation measures. There is no profitability and the Minister for Finance who introduced the White Paper recognised that at the time.  One would have thought he would have taken his knowledge from his tourism brief with him to the Department of Finance and enabled the industry to get the profitability levels necessary to regenerate growth and investment in the industry.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is being introduced at short notice because it is felt necessary to clarify <Col N="3779" /> the position in relation to the definition of income in computing tax liability. In recent days a succession of claims have been submitted to the Revenue Commissioners to the effect that health contributions, the youth employment levy and the income levy are deductible in computing income for the purposes of determining tax liability on that income. This is not the case and never has been the case and to put the issue beyond any doubt, it is considered desirable to introduce legislation at this point.</P>
    <P>To put the matter in perspective, if the claims being made were allowed in respect of all taxpayers, the potential revenue loss to the Exchequer, to the country, could be of the order of £360 million. This, of course, is out of the question.  As I mentioned earlier, a large number of claims were submitted in recent days. Given this volume of activity and the general uncertainty that has arisen, it was considered appropriate on this occasion to remove quickly any doubts about the legal position at this point.  I do not know why the matter should have gathered such momentum in such a short period. There were rumours, apparently, that legislation was being prepared.  There was, presumably, a widespread and mistaken belief that somehow claims made in advance of the legislation might be allowable.  There is no basis whatever for this belief.</P>
    <P>The technical background to the Bill is as follows.  Section 110 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provides that duties or other sums payable or chargeable by virtue of any statute on income which is assessed to tax under Schedule E shall be deductable for income tax purposes.  The effect of this was to allow, up to 1973, the deduction for income tax purposes of contributions made under certain statutory pension schemes.  The law relating to pension schemes was comprehensively revised in the Finance Act of 1972 and by virtue of section 17 of that Act the contributions under all statutory pension schemes are deductable from income for tax purposes.  The present legislation, <Col N="3780" /> therefore, does not in any way affect the deductibility of pension contributions for tax purposes.  I want to emphasise this.</P>
    <P>The 1967 provision which I have just mentioned became redundant following the introduction of the 1972 legislation. The claims to which I have referred, however, attempt to use this 1967 legislation to support a case for allowing against income tax the health contribution and other levies introduced afterwards.  There was clearly never any such intention by previous Dála and the intention of previous Dála is what the Bill confirms by removing the relevant part of section 110, with effect from 1973, which was the understanding, in any event in 1972 of what was happening.  It has no other effect.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the health contribution and the levies, the clear and unequivocal understanding has been that these charges fall directly on income. They have been so applied in all instances and taxation policy has been framed on this basis.  I am satisfied that all sides of the House are in entire agreement about this and share my view that, in the event of doubt about such a critical issue, it is totally appropriate to confirm the position in legislation, as we are doing today. This legislation will remove any doubt or confusion that has arisen.</P>
    <P>I should mention, of course, that the income levy has been terminated in any event with effect from 5 April 1986.  The claims being submitted, however, attempt to open the issue of deductibility for income tax purposes for a number of years past.  Potentially, several hundred thousand taxpayers are involved.  The health contribution and the levies have made a big contribution to the State revenues since their introduction.  The health contribution was introduced under the Health Contributions Act of 1979, the youth employment levy is yielding revenue since 1982 and the income levy operated in the period 1983 to April 1986. Over these periods the total revenue yield from these various sources was up to £950 million.  Were deductibility to be allowed, it is clear that the revenue loss would be of such an order as to require some <Col N="3781" /> fundamental changes in taxation policy. At the end of the day, the average taxpayer would be no better off and in the meantime considerable confusion and difficulty for the continued operation of the many services that depend on the revenue from these levies would be generated.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the Government can spend only what they receive on their capacity to spend on various services such as education, youth employment and so forth, depends, among other things, on the amount received from these levies.  In this case dealing with levies collected in the past, the money has already been spent on those schemes.  There would be great difficulty for everybody if action were not taken in order to clarify the position. That is being done here this morning.  On that basis I ask the support of the House for this Bill.</P>

      <P>I have seen many reasons advanced over many years by Ministers on the necessity for legislation but I have never heard a Minister say that the reason legislation is introduced is to confound rumours that have been circulating, for which he says there is no basis.  I want to quote from what he has just said in introducing this Bill.  He said:</P>
      <P>I do not know why the matter should have gathered such momentum in such a short period.  There were rumours, apparently, that legislation was being prepared.  There was, presumably, a widespread and mistaken belief that somehow claims made in advance of the legislation might be allowable. There is no basis whatever for this belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is telling us this morning that even if this legislation were not introduced the position would still be quite clear and secure as far as the Revenue and the liability to tax on these levies are concerned.  He is introducing the legislation because of rumours that have been circulating.  It is important, of course, always to reassure public opinion whenever <Col N="3782" /> we can.  I note that the estimates as to the revenue implications vary in today's newspapers, depending on which one you read.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> puts the figure at £250 million, <i>The Cork Examiner</i> at £500 million.  <i>The Irish Press</i> at £250 million.  The Minister has put the figure at £360 million.  It is as well to be precise.  The Minister has not satisfied us as to the necessity for this legislation and the manner in which it was introduced gives rise to very considerable reservations and anxieties on our part.</P>
    <P>The trend in the House in recent times has been for emergency legislation to be introduced which has not been properly considered.  It is not surprising that at a later stage loopholes and gaps are found in it.  I have not properly considered the implications of this legislation because I only became aware of it this morning.  I was in Carrickmacross and, because of road conditions, I only had a half an hour to examine the implications of the Bill. It is evident that the consideration we will give to this in an hour is totally and utterly inadequate.  The trend in recent times has been to pass legislation quickly. The Bill ratifying the European Act did not get full consideration, the extradition Bill was not completed, the same applies to emergency legislation introduced by the Minister for Justice to cover problems in relation to summonses and to two Bills passed yesterday without debate.  It is not surprising that I cannot remember their titles since there was no debate.  This is outrageous, especially from a Minister who adopted as his fundamental priority reform of the procedures of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the Minister crowing on the radio yesterday morning about the number of Bills that had been passed but he did not say that there was no real consideration of most of them. We cannot discharge our responsibility if there is not a full debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that this legislation is necessary and we will assume this is so. However, fundamental issues remain to <Col N="3783" /> be answered.  The Minister proposes to amend the Income Tax Act, 1967, by omitting the words &ldquo;duties or other sums payable or chargeable by virtue of any statute where the same have been really and bona fide paid and borne by the party to be charged&rdquo;.  Is the Minister satisfied that in sealing off this loophole in respect of the health contributions, youth employment and income levies, he is also excluding allowances that are properly deductible under other statutes which I have not had the opportunity of considering? For example, PRSI contributions could be affected although they are properly deductible.  I should like to have clarification and assurance from the Minister that during the course of the hasty preparation of the Bill they considered that aspect.  Is this the right way to achieve the Minister's purpose?</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1979, says that in relation to the year 1979-80, or any subsequent year of assessment, subsections (3), (5) and (6) of sections 224 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall not apply or have effect.  Subsection (1) (b), says that no relief or deduction under any provisions of the Income Tax Act shall be given or allowed in respect of any contributions paid under the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1979, by a person as an employed contributor or as a voluntary contributor.  Would it not have been more appropriate for the Minister to have introduced an amendment to that section of the 1979 Act to include, within the exclusion from relief or contributions paid under the youth employment, health contributions and income levies?  It would have been a tidier and a better way to ensure that this would have been achieved.</P>
    <P>The Government have had an inclination to introduce new levies for revenue purposes, they did so in 1979, 1982 and 1983 and, on each occasion, they should have made appropriate provision under section 6 to exclude them. However, that was not done, instead we got more gobbledegook in Finance Acts over the last four years than any parliament <Col N="3784" /> has ever been subjected to.  They introduced new sections, subsections and amendments to seal off loopholes which might have been in legislation that has been introduced.  We never knew when we were addressing the issue which the Minister proposed to adopt as the amendments came fast and furiously.  It is no wonder that there are rumours, confusion and doubt.  There has also been a lot of activity in finance houses in Dublin and elsewhere and customers have incurred extra expenditure in getting professional advice from accountants in dealing with this matter which the Minister says is not a problem.  If that is so, why are we rushing this through in an hour?  I repeat that a better way would have been to amend existing legislation, particularly the Finance Act, 1979.  The Minister should have been careful when drafting the section we have before us and ensured that we will not exclude properly claimable relief under the PRSI contribution.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about these levies.  The Minister mentioned the total amount of £950 million.  Whether the sum involved is £360 million or another figure which was mentioned in this morning's papers, it is obvious that we could not cope with such a loss of revenue because of the current state of the economy and the budget deficit.</P>

      <P>The Finance Act, 1979, section 6.  I have the highest regard for the Minister's advisers but I wonder if anybody, including the Minister's advisers, had an opportunity in the short time available to consider the implications of what we are doing here this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be horrific if the sum mentioned by the Minister were lost to the Exchequer.  I am as conscious of that as the Minister, and we on this side of the House become more conscious of it every day as we face the prospect of trying to <Col N="3785" /> unravel the twisted, complex net which has been woven by this Government over the years, the extra burden of expenditure which will be passed to the next Government and the budget deficit facing the next Government.  We on this side of the House always act responsibily and we will act particularly responsibly now because we know we will have to grapple with this problem very soon.</P>
    <P>The Government collect approximately £80 million each year on each levy, particularly the income levy and the youth employment levy.  I do not believe the people who now want to reclaim their tax would have any objections to paying the youth employment levy if they saw some results in terms of youth employment, but they have not.  Despite the imposition of this levy we do not see youth employment growing, but rather youth unemployment growing at an unacceptable rate, and youth emigration adds to the problem.  This is what the taxpayers are concerned about.  They see their contributions have been to no avail.  It is not surprising that the PAYE sector, those who have borne the brunt of the burden, feel totally and utterly deceived and angered by the Government's failure to create employment, the reason why this levy was deducted from their salaries.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the justice of the issue.  Now that this has come to a head does the Minister consider it fair to have no allowances in respect of tax liability in the normal course, in other words, that these levies are being deducted from gross salary, not net salary?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as possible in order to allow other Deputies to speak, but it is not reasonable to expect that we can do our job satisfactorily in the time available to us.  Is it fair, particularly in respect of the PAYE sector who have been grossly over-burdened by this Government, that these levies should be deducted from gross income and that income tax be paid at such a high rate? It is not always easy to ascertain gross income of other sectors, professional or self-employed, but it is very easy to put a fix on the PAYE sector.  I acknowledge that the income levy has gone for this year, although £30 million has been collected from this levy this year as distinct from £80 million that would be collected in a full year.</P>
      <P>It is only right that we have a statement from the Minister about what he considers to be fair and equitable in terms of the application of these levies.  People who have already paid income tax are subjected to levies as if this were a net income on a par with that enjoyed by others.  In conclusion, it is totally unsatisfactory that we should be asked to introduce this legislation in response to what the Minister called rumours.  If these rumours are unfounded, we should not be here and if there is a foundation we should have more time to consider this legislation, even if it means coming back next week or sitting longer hours.  I cannot understand why this point was not brought to the Minister's attention last week, or the week before, when we could have adjusted our business to have a proper debate on this very important matter.  I have done the best I can in the time available and I hope the Minister will be able to give a satisfactory reply to the precise questions I raised.</P>

      <P>Nothing declares as clearly as this legislation does the stamp of this Government, of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the Progressive Democrats when we see this legislation being rushed through in one hour on the last day of this Dáil session, probably the last day of this Dáil, at a time when tax avoidance is on such a massive scale. There have been massive marches about tax avoidance as well as tax evasion for the past decade.  The Commission on Taxation addressed themselves to tax avoidance, the complexity of the taxation system and the need to reform that system to ensure that deliberate tax avoidance does not take place.</P>
      <P>There is a huge scale of tax avoidance and it is greatly in excess of the figure of £360 million that the Minister mentioned. That is an unbelievable figure which the Minister pulled out of the hat.  He said that if claims made were allowed in respect of all taxpayers it would be of the order of £360 million.  How could it be allowed in respect of all taxpayers when all taxpayers are not paying the health levy, the youth employment levy, and the income levy when it was in force?  There are only a certain number of taxpayers paying these levies week by week and they are the PAYE taxpayers.  If they were paying accountants the same as self-employed farmers and corporations they would have discovered this loophole in 1973 or 1974, whenever the first levies were introduced.  Just because they have now discovered the loophole the Minister, with the full assent of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the Progressive Democrats, can immediately introduce legislation to close this loophole.  There is no precedent for that.  Usually a Minister waits until the next Finance Bill to try to close whatever loopholes can be closed. Most of the loopholes are never closed. In this case it is not a loophole, it is plain justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister is imposing here will be found to be unconstitutional.  The Minister is preventing tax deduction on four separate taxes on a person's gross income.  If you have a gross income of £200 you pay the health levy, the youth <Col N="3788" /> employment levy and the income levy on that £200.  Income tax is also paid on that gross income, which you do not have by the time the levies are deducted.  If a PAYE taxpayer &mdash; there are few of them with sufficient money &mdash; brought these type of cases to court the whole PAYE system would be found to be unconstitutional. A person works the appropriate hours, does the appropriate job and should be paid a salary into his hand. It is up to people if they wish to evade paying tax, as it is for others.  If they are caught, they go to jail for it.  The PAYE taxpayers do not get the appropriate wage into their hands for the job they do. If that is found to be unconstitutional it would bring this Government and any future Government to a halt.  If the PAYE taxpayers did the same as farmers and others who have found the tax system unconstitutional, it would bring the whole system down around our ears.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown total discrimination in this regard.  He referred to the importance of these levies and said that the services would not be able to continue if the levies did not exist.  The levies bring in £950 million and the services depend on these levies.  The health services depend on the health levies being brought in.  Unfortunately, the health levies are not brought in.  The Minister quoted a figure of £41 million for health levies which are not collected.  Youth employment levies are also not being collected and therefore the services are being interrupted, in the Minister's words, because of the lack of payment of these levies.</P>
    <P>The income levy is now gone.  The only people who regularly pay every penny of these levies are the PAYE workers.  A number of these workers have realised that they should have been deducting the health levy, the youth employment levy and the income levy from their income before tax they began to claim, which they are quite rightly entitled to do.  It is an extraordinary indictment of all the other parties in this House that this legislation is allowed to be brought in with the consent of the Whips and rushed through within one hour.  It will prevent the <Col N="3789" /> PAYE workers from exercising their constitutional and just rights in having these amounts deductible before income tax payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>It has not been tested yet but if it was, it would be found to be unconstitutional, and a deprivation of rights.  It is amazing that the Minister does not protect his Exchequer from other tax evasion.  A week or ten days ago the Minister admitted for the first time that the amount or collectable outstanding taxes is £624 million.  Prior to this Ministers for Finance always denied that such collectable amounts of taxes existed.  Whether or not the Minister will ever be able to collect those taxes or whether he will have the guts to follow it through in Cabinet when he meets with opposition, I do not know.  There are also health levies, youth employment levies and income levies which are still not collected. Even the figure of £360 million that the Minister gave fades when faced with those figures.  There is little that can be said or done at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only two Deputies in the House objected this morning to the short time allotted for this Bill.  There was apparent agreement by Deputy O'Kennedy who asked if it is fair.  I am sure he agreed to the Minister rushing through this Bill because if there is an election in the meantime he will be the one who will have to bring in a Finance Bill.  His thinking is exactly on the same lines as that of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, as also is Deputy O'Malley's.  They say that these people should not be allowed to get away with this.  It is all right for those who have property to get away without paying property tax from which only £1 million a year has been collected, the lowest in Europe.  The Government's commitment when they came to office in 1982 was to bring in £100 million in capital taxes.  That has not been achieved.  They are taking more and more money from the same group of people.  The making of social welfare deductions from those <Col N="3790" /> on the lowest pay levels just before Christmas is an indication of the attitude of the Government; they think they can take it from people at the bottom of the pile but never from those on the top of the pile.  I do not have the 1967 Act with me but I wonder where the words the Minister proposes to delete are.  I understand from the Explanatory Memorandum that the new section re-enacts the original with certain words omitted. Where are those words in the Act?  The explanatory memorandum does not make it clear?</P>

      <P>I speak very much with tongue in cheek when I make contributions in the House on legislation like this.  One part of my brain likes to see the Revenue Commissioners being caught by some astute accountant or tax adviser who has discovered a loophole.  Such a discovery may help to justify the existence of accountants and solicitors.  One side of me, having been a poacher and on the other side of the Revenue fence for years, likes to see them being caught out but on the other hand I recognise in my role as a politician that any Minister for Finance would have to bring in amending legislation like this to rectify defects in legislation.  Otherwise the loss to the Exchequer would be enormous.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have always had one great advantage over the taxpayers in that if the rules go against them they can change them.  If a taxpayer in an avoidance case can use a loophole to minimise his tax liability and win appeals through to the High Court, the Revenue Commissioners can change the rules. They will always win.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always been accepted under an old English case, ruled by Lord Denning, that the taxpayer is entitled to use every legal means available to him to hold on to his money and other effects.  Over the years people have been successful when using loopholes in various Acts to minimise <Col N="3791" /> their tax liability.  However, another development has occurred following a decision in the UK two years ago, <i>Furnace v. Dawson</i>.  In that case the Law Lords gave a whole new interpretation regarding avoidance.  It was their ruling that a person cannot use a scheme that is artificially contrived to ensure that he gets the benefits.  They held that an artificially contrived scheme was no longer accepted.  Up to that it was the spirit of the law that was accepted but in that case it was held for the first time ever that although an applicant may be technically correct in his case he cannot use a defect in legislation to avoid paying tax.  That has caused many tax advisers many sleepless nights because it represents a major change in their laws.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have followed suit and are involved in a case before the courts at present.  They are testing a case, brought by a number of taxpayers who produced a scheme to legally avoid paying tax, on the basis of the UK decision.  It will be interesting to see how our courts rule on that.  It will be a precedent case and an interesting one if one is to go by decisions handed down in recent weeks regarding summonses and so on.  However, the Revenue set the rules and if they are caught with their pants down on a provision in legislation that should be it, if it benefits the taxpayer. The UK decision is an interesting one but I hope a similar decision does not follow here.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the views of the Minister in regard to levies and I agree with them. They are what I call &ldquo;excuse me taxes&rdquo;. They may be called residential property tax, health contribution levies or youth employment levies but they are just another name for direct taxation.  They are introduced by Governments who do not want to call them PAYE or direct taxation.  In reality the money is going into the same big bucket.  However, when such &ldquo;excuse me taxes&rdquo; are introduced the Revenue are liable to run into difficulties like this.  I am not blaming the present Minister for these taxes, many Governments have dreamed up different <Col N="3792" /> names to get more money out of the same pot, but I hope some future Government will do away with them.  The represent another form of taxation and I cannot understand why we do not call a spade a spade.  Had those levies been collected under the PRSI system rather than given another name there would not have been any difficulty.  The Act clearly states that social welfare reductions will not fall into the category of a levy.  That is another reason why we should do away with those &ldquo;excuse me taxes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to advise the punters, those in the PAYE system, that they will get a lot of money back.  They may get their money back but if the Exchequer loses so much money it will have to be collected in another way from the same group of people immediately.  If there is a repayment the money will have to be collected under another guise.  I have not studied the legislation in any great depth but it is obvious that as the Revenue Commissioners have acted with such haste they agree that there is a loophole in the legislation.  The case may be fought in the courts but it strikes me as definite that the Department of Finance, and the Revenue Commissioners, consider that they are skating on very thin ice and will not be able to defend the claim successfully. Obviously, the Revenue Commissioners agree that there is a loophole obtaining here.  The Minister has said that there is no need to worry about it at all but the reality in the higher echelons of the Revenue Commissioners must be that they recognise that somebody slipped up &mdash; I know this happens all the time in tax legislation &mdash; but there is that loophole there.</P>
    <P>I am doubtful about the retrospection principle involved, in other words, I question whether it can be made retrospective to 1973.  I question this type of retrospective tax legislation.  I am doubtful that it will withstand all claims; people have made claims in the last few days.  I am doubtful that a Bill passed today can be back-dated to override the legislation that obtained to date.  It would be a totally new principle.  In fairness to successive Ministers for Finance and the Revenue <Col N="3793" /> Commissioners, on very rare occasions only have there been tax amending Bills whose provisions were retrospective. They have always become effective from the date they were passed and closed the loophole from then on.  Very seldom have they gone back over a long period to close off such loopholes.  Indeed I do not think it can be done successfully.  There have been various other loopholes people have used which have not come to the attention of the public as has this one.  In every Finance Act coming before this House there are sections &mdash; perhaps not so obvious to the general public &mdash; closing off loopholes that some taxpayer has successfully exploited.  In every Finance Act there would be three or four such sections closing off loopholes that somebody has already exploited.</P>
    <P>But the provisions of this Bill appear to be retrospective and to say: &ldquo;from that date you cannot successfully claim&rdquo;.  That is a totally new principle being adopted by the Revenue Commissioners.  I can readily see why because, as I said earlier, if these claims were successful it would throw matters into a state of total confusion.</P>
    <P>In replying perhaps the Minister would say whether that can be done, for a start, and, second, if it is correct to do so.  I would not have thought there was any great need to panic about the introduction of this Bill but for the difficulties that might be created in the short term. If people succeeded in exploiting such loopholes I could foresee the Minister for Finance including a provision in the next Finance Act that any gains arising to any taxpayer on foot of such exploitation would be taxed at some rate, say, next year or whenever, in the next Finance Act.</P>
    <P>I should like to have a long discussion some time with Deputy Mac Giolla in regard to his attitude as outlined in the House this morning.  I have heard him speak on many occasions of tax avoidance and evasion, when he was always against. He kept saying that what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla was not consistent because he is against it when it comes this way.  The Deputy spoke about arrears of tax and so on.</P>
      <P>It is amazing to note the speed with which the Department of Finance can move when some obvious loophole appears.  I only wish that in the other areas of our economy where social legislation is needed Ministers for Finance could act as speedily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for its consideration of this Bill.  Deputy Mac Giolla raised concerns about tax evasion. I want to assure him that I share his concern and those of other Deputies about tax evasion.  It was for that reason that I made a very comprehensive statement outlining the measures already in place and a number of others under consideration by the Government to deal with the problem of tax evasion.  There is no doubt that the unacceptability of the present high levels of taxation faced by so many compliant taxpayers, both in the PAYE area and among the self-employed, is accentuated by the fact that they see other people avoiding their due responsibilities.  There should not be any partisan argument advanced in this House about the need to stamp out tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy asked whether I <Col N="3795" /> am satisfied that I am not also excluding allowances properly deductible under other Statutes.  I can give Deputy O'Kennedy the categorical assurance on this point &mdash; it has been looked into very carefully and no legitimate allowances or deductions will be affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That categorical assurance is fine from the Minister on his feet but, what about in terms of the interpretation of the law as it stands?  I think the Minister will find that people will have other views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been considered by people with a very high level of expertise in this matter.  That is the basis on which the assurance is given.</P>
      <P>Of course the point should be made in general that if these levies were to be deductible, if one was to raise the same amount of money, one would have to have a much higher rate of levy.  Therefore it is six of one and half a dozen of the other as to which way it is done. Equally, to take the matter further, if there were not to be levies at all &mdash; which would make for a simpler tax system, something I would favour in general &mdash; the rates of income tax would have to be higher if the same amount of money was to be raised from income tax.  Now, of course, if one were to raise it in some other way, if one could, that might not necessarily be the case.  There are not that many ways of raising taxation.  The problem, at this point in our history, is that, as a nation, we are spending more than we should be spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interesting point was raised by Deputy O'Kennedy, who suggested that this matter might have been dealt with by extending the items listed in section 6 of the Finance Act of 1979 rather than the approach that is being taken.  I am advised that, while that is an alternative avenue that could have been pursued, it is not one that offers any better way of dealing with the problem than the way in which it is being dealt with.  Nor am I saying that it is necessarily a worse way, it is just another way of achieving the <Col N="3796" /> same result and the one we have chosen is the one we have chosen.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy raised a question in regard to retrospection.  As I understand it, the limitation which exists in general practice on retrospection in legislation enacted by the Dáil or Parliament, and Parliaments in general, is to the effect that no change in income tax or tax legislation should be introduced which would impose a tax charge on a taxpayer for a previous year, being a charge of which he was unaware at that time or deny him a relief for an earlier year, being a relief to which he thought he had full entitlement at that time.  As we all know, it was universally believed that there was no deductibility of contributions in respect of these levies.  Therefore, there is no question of retrospectively denying anyone anything they thought they had at the time.  Therefore, the principle, if you like, against retrospective legislation does not arise in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would stress the terms of the amendment to the resolution which has been put down by the Fianna Fáil Party asking the Taoiseach to go to Úachtarán na hÉireann and have the Dáil dissolved. In putting down this amendment we are conscious that this is the wish of the majority of the people.  It is also the wish of all the organs of opinion in the country.  The combined forces of the Opposition over the last few weeks time and time again have been frustrated when they were clobbered by the Constitution. Time and time again the Ceann Comhairle stood up and invoked the terms of an Article of the Constitution and said that as there was an equality of votes, he had to vote with the Government, and thus keep them in office.  It is ironic that this side of the House should be clobbered by the Constitution, by a party who show scant respect for the Constitution and who have never tired of attacking certain Articles of that Constitution, even though the people have proved a bulwark in some instances and protected the Constitution against attack.  The people are angry with the present administration. They are anxious to get rid of <Col N="3798" /> them and are showing their anger increasingly through their actions in both the public forum and at private gatherings.</P>
      <P>Why this anger, one may ask?  Why are they angry with a Government who, after all, they foolishly trusted in 1982, when they accepted a Government who in accordance with their own statements had expertise particularly in the financial area, to run the country?  It is important that we emphasise the plank upon which this Government were elected.  In fact, they were not elected, there was a hugger-mugger deal made after the election.  What did the principal Government party put before the people in 1982?  They claimed that they would wipe out the national debt.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not interrupt.  They got a national debt of £10.2 billion in 1981, from Fianna Fáil, after the huge increases in oil prices of 1979.  Of that, £3.8 billion was foreign debt.  We should not forget that the huge increase in oil prices from about $13 a barrel when we took office in 1977, to $39 a barrel in 1981 had impacted on that national debt at that time.  I am here now to attack the Coalition mythology of 1981.  They got away with it and they are starting it again.  The two chief planks we see emerging relate to financial responsibility and political character assasination. The national debt has now risen from £10.2 billion to £23.3 billion at the latest reckoning and, of that, £9.8 billion is foreign debt.  The foreign debt increase is as great as the total national debt when the Government took over in 1982.  It is very important to realise that.  It is very important that the people should realise that, because people who were not committed <Col N="3799" /> to any political party swallowed the line that was given out to them in 1982.  That was plank one and it was disastrous.</P>
      <P>The national debt is now 145 per cent of GNP and the Government should not put their heads up to talk about national debt or fiscal rectitude again.  In order to compound the difficulties of the economy they have now cut capital borrowing &mdash; where we might have got some result and where there might have been some impact on employment and development in the economy &mdash; by about half, and capital goods imports have dropped.  In other words, nobody has any confidence in this economy because of the way in which it is being run.</P>
      <P>The second plank in 1982 was the elimination of the current budget deficit &mdash; and people believed them.  They must feel very foolish now.  The Coalition Government said they would immediately eliminate the deficit.  Then they said that they would eliminate the deficit over two years and then they increased the period during which they would eliminate the deficit.  I sat here, slightly naive, when I heard the Minister for Finance earlier this year tells us that the budget deficit for this year would be £1,250 million.  I said it is very big, coming from a party who said they would eliminate it altogether by this time, but I said perhaps they might stay with us.  Now we find that they were not even able to keep it at that. Various guesstimates were made as to how much would be added on, from £100 million to £180 million.  It may not go all the way to £180 million, but commentators believe that at least it will be £170 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were a member of a Government who had outlined that programme, and were so unsuccessful on those two major issues, I would not put up my head for the election that will take place next month or in February.  I would not be seen in public because my credibility, if not gone, should be gone.  We have between £1,400 million and £1,500 million of a current budget deficit from a Government who had charge of the <Col N="3800" /> finance for this country for nine out of 13 years, so there is no point in coming out with the old codswallop about Fianna Fáil being responsible for the state of the national finances.  Unfortunately business people and manufacturers, and unfortunate private citizens are looking at interest rates of up to 17 per cent.  What has been the result?  The record of retail sales tells its own tale.  Taking 1980 as 100, they are 10 per cent down.  Instead of a modest increase per annum from 1982 to at present of 1 per cent or 2 per cent, what do we find when we include petrol and garage sales?  a 10 per cent drop in retail sales.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the country is in the state that it is in?  Is it any wonder our young people are leaving?  Is it any wonder that the numbers of unemployed are increasing?  Last night Deputy O'Kennedy &mdash; our spokesman on finance &mdash; and I met representatives of the Chamber of Commerce in Cootehill.  I have no doubt at all in my mind that if they could get their hands on people who are talking about a consumer boom they would lynch them.  Who was talking about a consumer boom later this year? All the wise economists who were advising the Government.  Who put it on the record?  The Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, said that there would be a consumer boom.  Consumer boom my granny's grunt.  Those people are destitute.</P>
    <P>One man gave us figures from his books.  In 1982, he sold 250,000 gallons of petrol.  In the corresponding week in 1986 he sold 249 gallons.  He reckoned that the Exchequer had lost about £50,000 on that one deal alone.  You may say how can I blame the Government for that but I do blame the Government because the take off from a gallon of premium grade petrol is 72 per cent.  That is as a result of direct Government action and they are responsible.  The collection of businessmen to whom we spoke with last night are destitute.  Their family businesses are bankrupt and they have wives and families and big worries.  Furthermore, they told us that the value of their property has gone down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3801" /> If the Taoiseach would like to read an account in one of today's newspapers of a speech made by Commissioner Sutherland, whom he appointed, he would see that the Commissioner realises what is happening and what is going on.  Quite frankly, those people are very patient.  I am not claiming any monopoly of wisdom with regard to that on this side of the House because members of the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and the Progressive Democrats all know what is happening in the area of Counties Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal.  There is a crisis in that area.  I do not know why this somnolent Government are not doing anything about it.  Perhaps, we have been too decent and too respectful of the rules of this House and that is why it has not impacted on the consciousness of the Dublin establishment the way it should have.</P>
    <P>The Government should wake up to see what is happening to a large sector of the community.  Businesses are going down.  That particular man has the same number of people to sell 249 gallons as he had to sell 250,000 gallons.  It cannot go on.  He must let people go and he cannot do it unless he is a philanthropist. I am talking about the area of Blacklion, Ballyconnell, Swanlinbar, Belturbet, Cavan town, Cootehill and Clones to Dundalk on the north eastern side and right up to Moville and Bunaphobal in County Donegal.  There must be a question of diminishing returns.  The people who are responsible for assessing how far you can go without having diminishing returns must have fallen asleep.  Their calculators must be working wrongly. There must be something wrong or they would try to remedy that.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that people drawing their salaries from the Exchequer in Dublin are going to buy stuff down below.  Where are they getting their salaries from?  Are they getting them from London or the old Stormont?  They definitely are not and that is one place where we could have an example of practical patriotism.  It is hard to blame people on the dole and people who are struggling to bring up <Col N="3802" /> large families out I am darned if I can find it in my heart to forgive people who are drawing salaries from the Exchequer and who are going down putting the money into an exchequer &mdash; no fault to them, they are taking whatever they can get &mdash; from which we do not draw salaries, agricultural grants, housing grants, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit and a whole range of services.</P>
    <P>While petrol and drink are the major sales there are sales right across the board.  Our people in commerce are being deprived.  While we have an advantage in clothing and so on, no one advertises it on the radio and no one talks about it in the newspapers.  It seems the shallower the commentators on our national radio and television the more heed and influence they receive.  I do not see anybody trying to push the fact that our clothing and shoes are better value here and that there might be a spin-off purchasing campaign if people came down to make those purchases.  Last night I spoke to a woman who sells bicycles in Clones.  Normally she would have sold 21 bicycles by this time but she has not sold one bicycle this year.  That gives this House an idea of what is going on in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture spoke about the milk situation.  I do not like to see more power being given to the Commission to decide when something can be put into intervention.  It is going down a dangerous road and removes the responsibility of elected representatives. If a large number of people take part in the cessation scheme there will be a severe impact on the beef processing industry and on the veal processing industry. In my own county we provide between 30,000 gallons and 40,000 gallons of Baileys Cream which is a marvellously successful product on international markets.  If there is a cessation flood tide, that is another industry which is in danger in an area which is already deprived.</P>
    <P>There is no use in talking about compensation. Compensation be damned.  I would not have it and the Government should have a policy with regard to it.  I <Col N="3803" /> would not like to do the Minister, Deputy Deasy, wrong but he seemed to be indicating that they had a damn good bargain if they got out of milk.  For God's sake, will someone in the Department of Agriculture look at its implications all over the economy?  The Germans have complained about the cost of intervention but everyone should have a good look at what they have got out of the EC, which is a market of 320 million.  The Germans are heavily industrialised and they are able to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>It is not all one-sided and they took advantage last year of the severely disadvantaged areas scheme by extending it in West Germany.  We cannot get it extended here.  The Taoiseach in a public relations exercise, without there being any substance in what he said, told my constituents in Cavan-Monaghan that the severely disadvantaged area scheme was going to be extended to cover those two areas.</P>
    <P>You could not keep up with the decay in this economy.  I examined statistics with regard to the construction industry a very short time ago.  Today, in the post I received information which indicated that it is even worse than I thought it was. The statistic I had was that it was 47 per cent of what it was in 1980.  From the statistic I received today I find it has gone down to 46.9 per cent provisional for the month of November 1986, which is a drop of 13.5 per cent from what it was this time last year.  Would someone ask the people responsible in Government to wake up for God's sake before major industries like this collapse?</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the Government have the advantage of very sharp reductions in the price of oil.  An examination of the section in A Strategy for Development, published recently, would be worthwhile. Oil cost this country £840 million in 1985. In other words, that is what was taken out of this country and given to Iran, Iraq and so on.  There is an analysis of the benefit to our economy of these reduced oil prices.  OPEC have as their objective a price of $20 per barrel.  At present it is $14 or $15 a barrel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3804" /> In 1981 when we left office the cost of a barrel of oil was $39.25.  At present it is little more than one-third of that price. What are the Government doing with the advantage they have?  The money that would normally be in Iran, Iraq, Norway and Britain is now in this country, but the Government do not have a clue about what to do with it, no more than they have a clue about the development of agriculture.  It is because of that that £1.5 billion has gone out of the country inside the last 12 months.  There is no confidence in the economy.  Some of the £1.5 billion was taken out because of DIRT.  The Minister answered that by saying they got what they wanted out of that.  The man must be a nincompoop or he would know that if the money that was taken out of the country was still here he would have got double the amount of return from DIRT.</P>

      <P>I attach particular importance to our financial structures because of the emphasis which was laid on them in 1982.  It was financial stunting.  With clever footwork it changed as soon as the Government were in office.  All we have had with regard to the national debt, the current budget deficit, social welfare and a string of important Government activities was a twist.  As soon as the pressure was put on from the Labour Party, or people who defected from Fine Gael, the &ldquo;Let's Twist Again&rdquo; tune was played.  We have had let's twist again as we had all summer.</P>
      <P>The Constitution is brought in to clobber the will of the people.  The Ceann Comhairle had to exercise his constitutional right &mdash; I know he was becoming increasingly embarrassed &mdash; one way although I suggest to him a few times that he might have gone the other way.

      <P>What the Government say is that those are their principles.  If they find the people do not like them they will change them.  Those are their principles but if they find a group of dissident Deputies who do not like them and if they are in danger of being thrown out of office and into the Elysian fields of ease they will change them.  They changed them on the national debt, on the current budget deficit, on social welfare and on education. They shifted Ministers in order to achieve that just as they subscribe to a revisionist theory of history.  Situational ethics are the order of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people on the Government side who are people of principle. Many of them are exceptionally worried. They are loyal to their party, and that is <Col N="3806" /> not necessarily a bad thing, but they have consistently to come in behind a Government in which they have no belief whatever. One of them, it is what I would expect from him, Deputy Coveney, admitted that the type of campaign which is starting in one area, what I called political merd, does not carry any sanction from him.  He does not approve of it.  He rejects it and regrets it.</P>
    <P>What we have had is a very successful public relations exercise.  The Government employed a high-powered team to sell it to the public.  They had that high-powered team when they were selling the 1982 programme upon which they have fallen down dismally and abysmally.  The handlers words are &ldquo;put clothes on the emperor&rdquo;.  The people are looking at the emperor and they see him in all his nakedness. The emperor in this case is the Government.  The Government are naked and unashamed.  They are marching the country down to ruin in all the important areas of the economy.  The people are not amused when they see how naked the Government are nor are they amused with their antics in regard to Dublin Gas.  They are not amused with the antics we saw on social welfare.  They are not amused with the pig's dinner they made of the Single European Act.  They are not amused with what happened here as we put the Extradition Bill through the House.  They are not amused when they see the national debt increasing drastically every day.  The are not amused when they reflect that they believed that the current budget deficit would be eliminated (a) immediately; (b) in two years; (c) in four years and (d) in five years. They are not amused when each time the crunch came the band played &lsquo;Let's Twist Again&rdquo;.  All I have to say is: &ldquo;Go Garret, son of Gerald.  Go in peace, but go.&rdquo;</P>

Many of the problems graphically described by Deputy Wilson, which most politicians in this House recognise need to be solved, are ones that can be changed only by a change of attitudes.  The type of attitude change which is needed will only be inspired by real leadership from this House.  I am not talking about the Leader of the Government or the Leader of the Opposition, but about this House playing a leading role.  I am talking about an improvement in the perception of politicians and of our political institutions.</P>
      <P>One of the sad things about our country is that from time to time we have examples where the public feel that politicians or the political institutions are there merely to serve the purpose of a few.  Just as political institutions are seen in that way, sometimes Government agencies are so seen.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that every institution will be seen as existing for the common good.  It is essential that we get rid of the sectional groups in the society that have grown so much in the past decade or two.</P>
      <P>I want to highlight one example of total public disgust at something which happened recently.  It is fair to say that most people were shocked to read the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the matter of an application by a company called JS Developments Limited where that court said that this company were entitled to an award of £2 million compensation because the company were unable to develop land they purchased on Roche's Hill near Dún Laoghaire in County Dublin.  It appears that that company purchased this land, amounting to 25 acres, knowing that the land was zoned to be retained as an open space.  Nevertheless they bought it, presumably, for that reason, at very good value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company then applied to Dún Laoghaire Corporation for planning permission to build a housing development on the 25 acres and, not surprisingly, Dún Laoghaire Corporation refused the <Col N="3808" /> application for planning permission on the grounds that the development would &ldquo;seriously interfere with the visual and recreational amenities of the area&rdquo;.  That ground was given to identify the refusal with the zoning and with a reason that would not entitle the company to compensation because the land could not be developed.  Again that was entirely reasonable, given the fact that zoning of the land had been for retention of the area as an open space.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Heavens, no, not at all. I am reciting the background to this matter to give an example.  Of course, the Supreme Court is not in question at all.  In any event, the company JS Developments Limited, surprisingly in all the circumstances &mdash; or so it must have appeared at the time &mdash; decided to appeal the decision to An Bord Pleanála.  An oral hearing was held at which many local interest groups, including politicians, voiced their objections to the scheme.  In short, the appeal was rejected.  There was a slight difference, however, on this occasion.  The reason given for the refusal was not the same as had been given by Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  The reason given now was that the development &ldquo;would be seriously injurious to the overall character of the area&rdquo;.  The odd thing about this is that this reason was one which entitled JS Developments Limited to compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me quote from the comments of Mr. Justice Brian Walsh on the wording used and the reason given by An Bord Pleanála for this refusal.  He described the decision as &ldquo;having a degree of imprecision of remarkable proportions.&rdquo;  Mr. Justice Walsh asked why the board did not use the word &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;overall character&rdquo;, when they knew that the effect of not using the word &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; would be to give the applicant a clear possibility of compensation.  Mr. Justice Walsh went on to say that the decision <Col N="3809" /> could not be construed since the reasons for it were so unclear, making it difficult for the court to arrive at a judgment one way or the other &mdash; I am giving a précis now of his judgement.  He said that An Bord Pleanála should not give a ruling which could be regarded as duplicious. He went on to say that surely the board must have had in mind the consequences the terms of their refusal would have.</P>
    <P>It is widely speculated that the An Bord Pleanála inspector who sat at the oral hearing on the appeal in Dún Laoghaire recommended to the board that planning permission not be granted and also recommended to the board that the reason given be an &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; reason rather than the reason ultimately given. The fact is that there are widespread questions being asked as to what happened. The cost to the State if this goes through, as I presume it will have to, will be over £2 million.  From all we know, either an incredible mistake or, to use the words of Mr. Justice Walsh, &ldquo;imprecision of remarkable proportions&rdquo; occurred.  I wonder if that is the case.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters which have not been highlighted in this case and which should be highlighted so that the matter can be properly investigated.  The fact is that the person in An Bord Pleanála who signed this refusal is no longer with the board but was a person appointed by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Ray Burke, on his last day in office after the 1982 November elections.  This person who was appointed had no planning experience, good, bad or indifferent.  He was a person who was a political adviser and organiser in Deputy Burke's own constituency.  All the evidence that we have before us is that what happened is simply inexplicable.  Frankly, I do not believe that it was something merely by way of a mistake or misunderstanding. I honestly believe that there is a whiff of criminal activity about this.  I think that we&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have made my point.  I shall stop making it, except to say that never before in a judgement of the Supreme Court have I seen such a clear signal warning the public of something.  I do not know if the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Garda can be directed to go in and examine the matter, but I think it is something that must be examined.  I would urge that it be examined.</P>
      <P>One of the great problems facing this country at present is the apparent inability of our institutions to tackle some of the problems we are facing.  I refer to political institutions like the Dáil, trade unions and special interest groups, all of whom seem hellbent on serving their own need and ignoring the common good. This sort of thing to which I have referred, if we are to begin to tackle our problems, must be seen by the public as something that is properly investigated. If charges are to be brought, let them be brought, let an explanation be given as to what did happen.  That is all I seek and I shall say no more about it.</P>

      <P>I want to refer, if I may, to some of the comments made by Deputy Wilson.  I think that he is correct; we have a major problem in dealing with our public finances now.  I have to accept what Deputy Wilson said when he spoke about this party specifically in 1982 promising that they would eliminate the current budget deficit over four years but failing to do so.  However, they tried very <Col N="3811" /> hard to tackle the financial problems but they failed, perhaps because they did not go far enough although it is questionable whether they could or should have gone further.  At least the Government never stopped trying to tackle the problem.  I will not try to identify the root of the major financial problem but there must be a consensus in the House that there is a major problem which must be tackled. Public finances and unemployment should transcend party political differences.</P>
      <P>I was appalled last night listening to a debate on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; between the Minister for Finance and Deputy Ray Burke.  The Minister detailed the Government's problems going into next year's budget and asked Deputy Burke if he would accept that cuts in the order of £300 million were necessary.  Deputy Burke refused to answer the question on the grounds that he did not have to and said that Fianna Fáil's approach to the budget is to say nothing and that their approach to an election will be to ask the people for a blank cheque as they have developmental policies to offer them.  He tried to rerun elections in the past when it was possible for political parties to make promises designed purely for electoral purposes as was the case in 1977.</P>

      <P>The longer Deputy Wilson chooses to ignore the problem, the longer people will be deprived of an opportunity to discuss the real issues in the next election.  This party, in common with every other party, have been guilty in the past of making promises without having them properly costed.  I do not exclude the Progressive Democrats from this because, in a document published recently, they set out a series of cutbacks they would make which have been shown since to be wrongly costed.  They have been invited to submit their proposals to the Department of Finance so that they could be properly costed and indeed the same offer has been made by the Minister for Finance to Fianna Fáil.  The Progressive Democrats not only declined the offer but indicated that they could not trust the Department to do an analysis of their proposals because they know very well that the answer will not suit them. At the next election the people deserve to have the real issues set before them and not silly wild attempts by politicians to bluff and blow their way through a campaign, as Deputy Burke tried to do on television last night.</P>

I urge that a change should be brought about because of the extent of our problems.  If there is an interest in tackling the problems there must be a consensus at some level and that is not a bad level at which to start.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Adjournment Debate takes place against a background in which we have seen the Government over the past few days bringing a number of important Bills before the House and having them rushed through with the agreement of the main Opposition party without, in some cases, any debate as in the case of the Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill, 1986, yesterday and others rushed through in 60 minutes.  This happened in relation to the Courts (No. 3) Bill, 1986, last night and today in regard to the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 1986.  This is sad because over the last four years Government parties have brought measures before this Houses, some of which were forced upon them, by decisions made in Europe or in our courts.  Much of the social legislation on the Statute Book today has come, not as a result of the response by politicians in this House, but because it was forced upon us by decisions made in the Four Courts.</P>
      <P>The Government have made great strides towards bringing in social legislation and I admire their efforts, particularly earlier this year in relation to the divorce referendum.  I was very disappointed at the manner in which that debate was conducted and one hopes that whenever the measure again comes up for discussion we will be more mature in our analysis of the issue and more responsive to the needs of so many people.  Despite what has happened, the tragedy of marital breakdown remains very much with us and the sad thing for me and others is that we cannot, as legislators, do anything to help the victims of marital breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is taking place against the background of 31,000 people having left the country last year and the real tragedy is that some of our best, brightest and highly educated people have gone.  I am told by those who researched the facts that up to 40 per cent of science and engineering graduates left last year. Given that higher education is now costing almost £100 million per annum, you do not need me to point out the economic cost of sending abroad so many of our <Col N="3814" /> best people, people we need to revive the nation.  It is also a tragedy that so many people leaving are not just those who have no jobs.  Many of them have jobs but they do not think there is any point staying in this country because effort is not rewarded.  It is not worthwhile to work and those who try hardest are constantly knocked by Government policies that seek to take away from individuals what is rightly theirs.  Is it not a tragedy that 65 per cent of every pound of taxable income of single people earning over £7,500 and married people earning in excess of £15,000 is taken by the Government? It is a disgrace and it is no wonder that so many people give up very good jobs to go abroad.</P>
    <P>Irish people have achieved success everywhere and many are very successful in the United States.  Britain and many other countries in Europe.  It is sad that they have not the opportunity to achieve here what they achieved in so many other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson and others referred to the extent of the national debt.  In the past seven years we have added £16 billion to its size and in the same period unemployment has risen by 150,000.  It is a farce &mdash; but unfortunately many Government Ministers do not believe it &mdash; that as we add more to public expenditure, which seems to be the policy of The Workers' Party and the Labour Party, we add further numbers to the unemployment queues.  In the early part of this year Government expenditure increased by 9 per cent at a time when inflation stood at 3 per cent.  Unemployment increased and we are constantly being told by many politicians in this House that in order to solve the unemployment crisis and the very serious economic situation we must get public expenditure under control.  Yes, we have to do that, but this Government have failed miserably in each of the last four years to do anything realistically about the level of public expenditure.  That is why the noises being made, in particular by the Minister for Finance, are not believed by many people.  They do not believe that this Minister who presides over the worst <Col N="3815" /> current budget deficit in the history of the State is going to do anything to realistically tackle the serious economic problems that confront us.</P>
    <P>The position this country finds itself in today was not forced on us by any external factors although, as a small open economy, we suffer more from external factors than many of our neighbours.  The position we find ourselves in today has been foisted upon the people of this country because Irish Governments failed to tackle the real economic issues &mdash; Irish Governments who pretend they can solve all problems, give in to every group and say no to nobody.  The tragedy is that despite the serious economic situation in which we find ourselves today, the main Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, have failed to respond to the national crisis. We all know what Fianna Fáil are against &mdash;high taxation; they want everybody to have a job, they are against crime, they stand for all the generalities that everybody in his right mind stands for, but we do not know what Fianna Fáil would do if they were back in Government tomorrow.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme were discussing the current budget deficit and invited Fianna Fáil to send a speaker to debate this serious subject. They failed to do so.  A couple of weeks ago <i>The Irish Times</i> decided to publish a series of articles and they gave each party an opportunity to put forward their plans and proposals which the people could see and examine and compare one set of proposals against another. Again the Fianna Fáil Party declined the invitation.  Their excuse was that they were finalising their policy.  After four years in Opposition they are still finalising their policies.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that in this once great party there is nobody prepared to stand up and give real leadership; there is nobody prepared to put forward an alternative point of view; there is nobody prepared to put forward any realistic proposal that the people might be expected to examine and perhaps support. <Col N="3816" /> For that reason I make no apology for saying that I do not want to see that party under its present leadership returned to office.  The bizarre events of four years ago have not been forgotten by me.  The low standards, the politics of wheeling and dealing which were so much part and parcel of that Administration have not been forgotten by many people, and I do not think they will be easily forgotten.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy Wilson said that the Government talked about their principles but changed them if they did not suit.  A few weeks ago the Fianna Fáil spokesperson for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, sent a letter saying that the Fianna Fáil Front Bench had decided to oppose the Single European Act.  Within a matter of days following the publication of an opinion poll which indicated majority support for that Act, the Fianna Fáil Party changed their position.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have displayed nothing but disregard for the SDLP.  They have shown scant regard for the very strenuous efforts being made by that party to uphold constitutional nationalism in that part of this country.  They have been treated very badly by Fianna Fáil.  It was very sad to see the Deputy Leader of the SDLP having to call on politicians in this House to stop playing politics with the tragedy of Northern Ireland.  He should not have had to do that, but the tragedy is he had to do it because for so long so many people in this House &mdash; and unfortunately so many people in the leadership of Fianna Fáil today &mdash; like to play politics with the tragedy that is Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are some who will say that the comments I am making can be described as character assassination.  They are not in that league.  I am not going to be intimidated from exposing the myth that is the main Opposition Party in this House.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Woods huffed and puffed about the Courts Bill being rushed through yet his party agreed to do it. This may be the last sitting day of this Dáil and if it is, it is as well that the people know what the possibilities for the future are and where each party stand in <Col N="3817" /> the run-up to the next general election. It is an important election for this country because what we need most of all is good government.  Good government is not necessarily government of one party, just as bad government need not be government of two parties.  What determines if a government are good or bad is not the number of parties which compose that government but rather the policies they pursue.  What we have seen in recent days, particularly from Fianna Fáil, is a promise to spend more.  We are back on that merry-go-round again.  Recently the leader of the Opposition went to Cork and nothing was impossible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil's policy is to pander to every group, say yes to everybody, no to nobody, nothing is impossible. Nothing is impossible as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned because the be-all and end-all is getting power.  They want to get it by default, not by putting forward constructive policies that the people could examine and decide if they wanted them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We want to roll back the influence of the State and the size of Government.  That is why we support a reduction in the number of TDs in this House from 166 to about 130.  That is why we support the abolition of the Seanad.  We are too small a country to have two tiers of Parliament.  That is why we think at least eight Ministers of State could go.  They were created some years ago for all kinds of odd reasons.  We have far too many people with responsibility and too few people doing anything about their responsibilities.  These measures will help restore what Deputy Molony rightly regarded as the need to get a better perception of politics in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to change our economic policies to ensure the incentive is returned to individuals.  The greatest poverty fighter of all is employment, the right to a decent job and the right to have a decent standard of living for oneself and one's family.  That can only be done as a result of people being able to keep more of what they earn instead of the State constantly consuming more and more of people's incomes.  That is why the Progressive Democrats, of all the parties in this House, put forward &mdash; perhaps Deputy Gallagher and Deputy Wilson might read it &mdash; a realistic policy for reviving the economic affairs of this nation.  We are happy to say the only way we can revive the economy is by restoring to individuals the incentive to work, to work harder, to invest and to employ.  You will only do that by decreasing the levels of personal taxation.  Instead of public expenditure <Col N="3821" /> dictating the extent of taxation in this country, which is the way we approach our budgetary policy, an acceptable level of taxation should on the contrary dictate the level of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that tax on income should be any higher than 25 per cent as a standard rate on incomes up to £15,000 for single people and £30,000 for married couples and a further 15 per cent for those groups of individuals on incomes in excess of that.  That is the only way we can return incentive to this country; there is no other way.  Yet it has been described as daft.  Unless you match that kind of tax policy with public expenditure cuts, which again we will be happy to do, and spell out clearly where those cuts will be made, nobody will be able to achieve that level of taxation.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for saying that although we are a party that favours very radical and extensive cuts in public expenditure we are not going to do that at the expense of the weakest and most vulnerable members of our society.  That is why we did not vote with the Government when they reduced the Christmas bonus by £3 million.  There is no point in the Government making a big stand of principle on amounts of money like that against the most vulnerable and weakest section of society.  Those in need should be looked after and should get State benefits. Those who get State benefits and do not need them should not get them. That money should go to those who are in genuine need of greater assistance from this State.</P>
    <P>Many people spoke about the need for the Government to create more jobs.  The Government cannot create jobs; they can create an environment under which employment can thrive.  You do not do that by throwing money at problems or by increasing levels of public expenditure. The Danes did it by decreasing their budget deficit from 9 per cent four years ago to 3 per cent last year and at the same time they increased the level of employment in the country.  The Irish can do it too if they have new and strong political leaders who outline their policies <Col N="3822" /> and stick by them no matter what the pressures may be and no matter what the political consequenses might be.  The country needs tough leadership and it needs new leadership.  I have no doubt whethere this Dáil comes back or not: its days are numbered.  Whenever the next election comes the young people in particular will vote for a new choice.  They will vote for a party that has spelled out in the last 12 months &mdash; we did not need four years to do it &mdash; where it stands on the fundamental issues that now confront this nation.  I hope the people will respond and if that is the case the next Dáil will be a better Dáil because it will be able, once and for all, to deal realistically with the serious economic and social problems which now confront this nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate marks the completion of the fourth year of this Government's term of office.  Ever since the Government was formed the Leader of the Opposition has been forecasting its imminent downfall.  One commentator has calculated that there have been 14 such forecasts.  How consistently wrong he has been throughout these years may be seen from the fact that this Government's life will have exceeded that of any of the last five Fianna Fáil Governments in the last 25 years, only one of which lasted as long as four years. Moreover, no one can allege that this Government have survived by shying away from contentious issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our fourth year we tackled such issues as the referendum on divorce and, since last October, we legislated for the contested reorganisation of CIE, the reform of building society law and the establishment of the new Metropolitan Streets Commission.  The last two proposals have been opposed by Fianna Fáil for their own reasons.  We put through legislation on extradition which is necessary to enable us to ratify the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and we put it through in the teeth of opposition from all three parties across the House as well as from Independent Deputies.  We piloted the Single European Act through the two Houses despite <Col N="3823" /> forecasts by the Opposition and by some other observers that we would fail in this enterprise.  In none of these difficult areas have we been deterred from doing our job by opposition from across the House or by reports of problems within our own ranks, reports which were so consistently led the credulous Leader of the Opposition convincing himself for the umpteenth time that the Government were going to fall.</P>
    <P>Let me recall for the House not just our legislative performance in the last couple of months but some of the things we have achieved in the past four years. Since this Government took office, more than 130 Bills have been passed by the House and there are approximately 30 more on the Order Paper.  It would be impossible, in the relatively short time available to me, to discuss in detail the full range of this legislative business.  I will, however, touch briefly a score or so of the more important ones.</P>
    <P>In the justice area there have been many significant changes and improvements. The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, enabled the courts to take a broader perspective when imposing penalties.  They were empowered to require an offender to perform unpaid work for the benefit of the community. It is recognised that in many instances community service would be a far more fitting penalty than a custodial sentence, and a much less costly one for the State and the taxpayer.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, addressed a wide range of issues relating to Garda powers. Increased powers were given to the Garda to detain suspects in certain circumstances. Provision was made to deal with the problem of offences committed while on bail and to provide for alterations to the existing trial procedures. One of the main purposes of the Bill was to deal with the problems facing the Garda in regard to the withholding of information and to provide for stricter sentencing.  Balancing this, there were new arrangements for the investigation and adjudication of complaints against <Col N="3824" /> the conduct of members of the Garda Síochána in the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>In the social area, considerable progress has been made during our period in office.  The Age of Majority Act, 1985, resulted in the long awaited reduction of the age of majority from 21 to 18.  This considerably eases difficulties facing young persons, particularly those getting married who wished to enter into mortgage or other commitments.  The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, abolished the common law rule according to which it is generally stated the domicile of a married woman was in all cases the same as that of her husband.  It provided that her domicile would in future be determined in the same way as that of any other adult person.  This effectively meant that a divorce should be recognised if it were granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, allowed foreign husbands of Irish citizens the right to accept Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship had been reserved previously for foreign wives of Irish citizens.  In these, as in other areas, we set about to remove the discrimination against women which remained in our legislation and which Fianna Fáil had so notably failed to tackle.</P>
    <P>Talking of things which Fianna Fáil notably failed to tackle, the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985, was a significant development in the provision of a comprehensive and accessible family planning service appropriate to the social realities of a mature society.  It removed the previous restrictions on the scale of contraceptives to married couples, allowed for their sale to persons over the age of 18 years and eliminated the need for a medical certificate, a curious provision introduced by the present Leader of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>In the fight against poverty the Combat Poverty Agency Act, 1986, introduced major forms.  A new agency was established or, to be more precise, an earlier agency abolished by Fianna Fáil was put <Col N="3825" /> on a firm statutory basis, safe from their depredation should they ever return to office, to advise the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning relating to poverty in the State, to initiate measures aimed at overcoming poverty, to examine the nature, cause and extent of poverty and to promote a greater understanding of those causes.  Up to now no institutional mechanisms existed which were charged with these functions. The Combat Poverty Agency fills this gap.</P>
    <P>In another area, the National Lottery Act, 1986 provides for the holding of a national lottery the proceeds of which will be allocated to sport, to culture and the arts, including the Irish language, and health and to such other purposes as might be decided on.  The lottery is due to commence next year and it is expected that it will have a major impact on funding in those areas, starting in 1987. Another major Government initiative in this area was the National Archives Act, 1986 under the terms of which national archives have been established drawing together the existing State Papers Office and the Public Record Office providing, for the first time since the foundation of the State, for the release on a structured basis of Government and departmental records which are more than 30 years old. Arrangements for the making of regulations under this Act are at an advanced stage and I expect this new institution to be established in the coming year with the appointment of a director and a council.</P>
    <P>In the housing area, one of the earliest measures enacted by the Government was the Housing Finance (Amendment) Agency Act, 1982 which removed doubts as to the power of the Housing Finance Agency established by us under the 1981 Act which indexed-linked bonds and ministerial guarantee.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983 provided for the very necessary reconstitution of An Bord Pleanála and for amendments to planning appeals legislation.  Under the terms of the Act a new statutory mechanism was introduced for the appointment of the chairman of the board and board members to end the <Col N="3826" /> practice of political appointment, political appointments in an area of high sensitivity and for the most dubious of motives.  This Act has proved of crucial importance.  From the recent Killiney decision we can see just how important a reform of this has been.  That decision related to a decision by the earlier politically appointed Planning Board.</P>
    <P>The passing of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act, 1986 has been a major initiative towards upgrading central Dublin.  The commission have a £10 million budget in a three year term of office and will have as its sole objective the revitalisation of the heart of the city, making the best use of and enhancing its existing assets.  The Building Societies (Amendment) Bill, 1986 which has just passed, provides <i>inter alia</i> for abolishing redemption fees, getting rid of restrictive practices in relation to solicitors and prohibiting the charging of tiered rates of interest on loans.  It also gives power to the Minister for the Environment to make regulations prescribing rules in relation to certain building society practices, overdue reforms that for some curious reason seem to have been unwelcome to the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1986 provides for the registration as special voters physically ill or physically disabled persons under conditions that will ensure against abuse.  We have seen what happens when provision is not made against abuse in certain parts of the country, where particular political parties are active and strong, unfortunately.  It also provides for the registration as postal voters certain persons resident abroad.</P>
    <P>In the communications area, we enacted the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, which provided for the establishment of two State-sponsored bodies, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann, to take over the operation of the national postal and telecommunications services from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. This year we enacted the Free Ports Act which enables the establishment of free ports in any part of the State with the immediate purpose of permitting the <Col N="3827" /> establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Another measure enacted this year was the Dublin Transport Authority Act which provides for the establishment of a new statutory body, the Dublin Transport Authority, to improve radically the planning and operation of road and rail transport and the management of road traffic in the Dublin area.  The authority are now in operation.  More recently we enacted the Transportation (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Act, 1986 which provides for the retention of CIE as the parent of three new operating subsidiary companies registered under the Companies Acts.  The new companies will have full responsibility for the operation of the railways, the Dublin city bus services and provincial bus services.  This new structure for CIE will enable that board at last to operate as a transport board and not simply as a railway board running as subsidiary operations bus or freight services in different parts of the country.</P>
      <P>In the industrial development area we have seen the enactment of the National Development Corporation Act which provides for the establishment of the corporation as a state venture capital investment company.  The corporation, which was established last June, operates on a commercial basis and through the provision of equity style investment in productive and employment creating economic activity.  Investments by the corporation may be made only in enterprises that are profitable and efficient, or are capable of becoming profitable and efficient and which have reasonable prospects for profitability; development expansion, growth or providing viable employment investments may be undertaken directly by the corporation in joint ventures with the private sector or in cooperation with a State-sponsored enterprise.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="3828" /> At the moment before the Dáil and the Seanad are such Bills as the Bankruptcy Bill, now in its final Report Stage, the National Employment and Training Authority Bill that brings together in one organisation the different bodies whose functions in this area may be felt to overlap and which need to be co-ordinated. The Status of Children Bill, initiated as a result of the work of Young Fine Gael, when we were in Opposition, to deal with the problem of illegitimacy is also before the Houses.  They are only a few &mdash; in fact I have mentioned only one-seventh &mdash; of the legislative measures we have introduced.</P>
    <P>In this period we also dealt with a number of emergencies such as the PMPA collapse, the ICI disaster, which we settled without any cost to the taxpayer despite repeated allegations to the contrary, and the seizure of the IRA funds.  They were carried through decisively and effectively to deal with situations that arose out of the blue.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not reached the extracts but I will come to them in due course.  In addition to the measures I have just outlined, there are many important Bills in the course of preparation or just recently published.  Legislation is being prepared to bring about further changes in the family law area, for instance, the giving of spouses equal ownership rights to the family home and contents, to provide for the working of protection orders separate from home barring orders in the cases of domestic violence, to extend the grounds for judicial separation, to raise the age of marriage and to require three months notice of marriage, and to empower the courts to make financial and property orders for separation proceedings. <Col N="3829" /> A Bill will be brought forward in the next session to abolish the death penalty, and of course, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1986, which has just been circulated will introduce a number of much needed reforms in the liquor licensing laws to be followed by others in a second Bill dealing with matters such as under age drinking.</P>
      <P>In relation to local government and the environment, legislation is being prepared to reorganise the system of local government.  There will be a further measure early in the next session, a Bill to increase and strengthen the power of local authorities in relation to derelict sites.  A Bill will be introduced shortly to reintroduce grants under the Shipping Investment Grants Act, 1969 with a view to creating the conditions in which shipping services may be re-established and developed in this State.  A major Bill which is now being finalised is a companies Bill to tackle the problem of abuse and malpractice in the management and direction of limited companies.  Legislation to implement the White Paper proposals for the reform of the public service is also being finalised and will be circulated shortly.  In my own Department preparations are well in hand for legislation to eliminate all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status and access to goods, facilities, services, sports and other forms of recreation.  Another Bill to reorganise the National Museum by putting in place an administrative structure more appropriate to a modern cultural institution is being prepared.</P>
      <P>I submit that this record is in total contrast to those of the last two Fianna Fáil Governments, the first of which, under two different Fianna Fáil Taoisigh one of whom despite his majority of 20, shied away from every tough issue that faced him and pursued an uremitting policy of soft options; the second of which was the most ignominious, disastrous failure among all the Governments of this country during the last 65 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, as they enter their fifth year, this Government will not flinch from taking the necessary further <Col N="3830" /> decisions to control Government spending even though a combination of unforeseeable circumstances has made necessary tougher decisions in this area than any Government have had to take since the war years.  We will not run away from these problems.  We will not take refuge in a flight to the country in advance of the presentation of our budgetary proposals. No, we shall present to the Members of this House and to the people a true picture of what needs to be done to correct the imbalances in our finances which, in recent months, have helped to force up interest rates well above their natural level.  By facing this issue we shall bring down interest rates from their present unnatural level, thus stimulating enterprise and growth in 1987.</P>
    <P>I believe that that is what our people want us to do.  We owe it to our people to do just that.  I believe, too, that this House will endorse our proposals although I recognise that many think otherwise.  The reason I believe this may be simply stated.  There is one course only that can properly be taken in present circumstances, namely, to reduce our current deficit to a level no higher than was planned for the current year &mdash; 7.4 per cent of GNP &mdash; and to reduce borrowing below this year's planned level. To do less than this would be to precipitate a financial crisis of confidence involving a level of interest rates throughout 1987 that would be disastrous for our people.  I do not believe that a majority of Deputies will want to make themselves responsible for such a débacle by defeating a budget along these lines.  The consequences of doing so, of precipitating an election, by rejecting these constraints &mdash; thus proposing to the people higher level of borrowing which would force interest rates through the roof &mdash; would be gravely damaging for those who precipitated such an event.  Those who did that would be stigmatising themselves as cowards, who would not deserve and would not receive from the people a mandate to govern this country.</P>
    <P>There is in this House an unexpressed acceptance of these realities.  Deputies on all sides are aware of how critical is our <Col N="3831" /> situation.  They do not hide this from each other in the lobbies and corridors.  I believe there is also a growing acceptance within this House &mdash; as there certainly is outside it &mdash; that things are much too serious for political game-playing on this issue.  Of course, the temptation remains, and some may succumb to it but not, I feel, a majority of this House.  I want to put this issue on the table in plain language.  I want to invite the Opposition parties, several of which are not present, to make their position clear on it.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey and the others may choose to keep silent on the question I have asked, but if they do, let me tell them that this is a question I shall continue to pose, as will the media, until it is answered, whether by a straignt <Col N="3834" /> reply, which I gravely doubt, or by damning, persistent silence which will leave no room for public misinterpretation of the intentions of the party and parties opposite with regard to the level of borrowing in the year ahead.  It is not a question that is answered by saying, as Deputy Haughey has said twice already, that it is for the Government to bring in their budget.  Of course it is a matter for this Government to bring forward their budget, to say how and by what specific measures they propose to keep borrowing and the current deficit within those limits, but that is not the key question. It is not the question that those from whom we borrow are concerned with. What they want to know &mdash; and on the answer to this will depend the level of interest rates in the period immediately ahead &mdash; is whether the different parties accept the discipline of these two figures or whether they propose a higher level of deficit and a higher level of borrowing. Of course, I do not expect to receive any kind of blank cheque from any Opposition party with respect to the details of the budget.  On those details there may well be differing views although, in practice, the room for difference is very small indeed as we, who are preparing the budget at this time, know.</P>
      <P>The achievement of the current budget target cannot be sought through significant tax increases.  I do not believe any Deputy in this House suggests it should be, because taxation, both indirect and direct, is already too high and has been acknowledged as such by all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax increases in the forthcoming budget can involve minor adjustments only, yielding quite small sums.  This year taxation will yield just under 37 per cent of GNP.  That figure cannot be significantly increased in 1987.  Non-tax revenue is under 4 per cent of GNP, giving a figure for total revenue of no more than 41 per cent.  Simple addition shows that the level of current spending must, therefore, be kept down to around 48.5 per cent of GNP, that is the sum of 41 per cent and the target deficit of just under 7.5 per cent.  Deputy Haughey will have <Col N="3835" /> no difficulty in understanding and appreciating those figures.</P>
    <P>I want to know do the leaders of the Opposition parties accept this or do they not.  Do they accept that that is the limit on spending, never mind the question of how it is to be held down to that figure? We can talk about that, debate it, discuss it, disagree on it later, if necessary.  My point is simply that however we may disagree on the composition of these figures for spending, for taxation, for the deficit and for borrowing, can we, in the national interest, agree that these targets must be met?  If we can, then I believe that strong, immediate downward pressure will be exerted on interest rates by such an agreement on essentials by the parties in this House.</P>
    <P>Bank overdraft and mortgage interest rates could come down quite quickly, could come down quite far.  With lower interest rates, business and the construction industry could revive from the very start of next year.  All of this is in the hands of the Opposition parties in the House today &mdash; there are now two of them here &mdash; if they are prepared to say where they stand on this issue.</P>

      <P>If, however, the Opposition parties are unwilling to make this commitment in the national interest, if they want to keep interest rates artifically high or to keep soft options open, intending to make election promises involving higher levels of spending, deficits and borrowing, then the immediate prospect is for a rise in the already ridiculously high level of interest rates. <Col N="3836" /> These interest rates are at their present absurd level in significant measure because of the fear in financial markets that this Government may fall and be replaced by a Fianna Fáil Government who once again, as they did so spectacularly when they were previously in office, will increase spending and borrowing above the limits we propose.  I want to make it clear, however temporarily entertaining the Leader of the Opposition may find it, that if in the weeks ahead the Opposition parties refuse to accept this challenge and refuse to take seriously their responsibilities in the national interest by accepting these limits in spending and borrowing, we shall unsparingly hold them responsible before the people for the level of interest rates which they have in their power today to bring sharply down but which equally by refusing to accept their responsibility they can be responsible for keeping up or even raising.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Percentages can dull the reality of this rise of 24 per cent of GNP to 36 per cent.  Put it another way: taxes in 1975 represented three months effort from each of us.  This year they represent four months effort.  The adverse impact of high taxation on the economy is self-evident.  It acts as a disincentive to hard work, initiative and investment.  It encourages people to spend in the black economy, distorts trade and encourages smuggling. However, it would be unrealistic to expect that tax reductions are possible in the short term.  They can be achieved only through further borrowing and that is not a reasonable option because borrowing is no more than deferred taxation. Today we are paying the tax that was deferred last year and for the past ten <Col N="3838" /> years.  The higher taxes we pay today are not available to support spending programmes. Instead an increasing burden of interest on past debts is pre-empting much of our revenue.  Our PAYE receipts are now only just about sufficient to meet overall debt service costs.</P>
      <P>In the longer term with the substantial growth in the economy, more people at work and a healthier budget position there would be room to bring taxation down to more acceptable levels, but this presupposes that first we curtail public spending, that we maintain it at a level that our economy can reasonably support. Only through reduction in the overhang of debt and of the future tax levels it implies can economic activity be stimulated. In the shorter term the emphasis on tax policy must instead be on spreading the existing burden in a more equitable and economically sufficient way.</P>
      <P>In their recent report, welcomed this morning by Deputy Haughey, I was glad to see, the NESC said that the stabilisation of the debt-GNP ratio must now be a minimum objective of fiscal policy.  They emphasised that any adverse consequences of stabilising the debt burden must be set against some of the more positive effects.  The report went on to say that it was neither feasible nor desirable to effect the required degree of adjustment through the medium of higher taxation.  I agree with this view.</P>
      <P>The Council also recognise that corrections of the chronic imbalance in the public finances will require a considerable degree of sacrifice in society and they pointed to the positive effects of adjustment, saying that these would derive primarily from an easing of interest rate thresholds, a matter which brought such mirth from the Opposition a few minutes ago and whose Leader endorsed this report this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are lessons in all of this.  The policy of following a path of high expenditure part paid for by high taxation but also based on heavy borrowing has failed. Heavy borrowing with the associated high interest rates and high taxation have impeded growth.  The consequences have also evoked, understandably, adverse <Col N="3839" /> public reaction.  We must change our approach because a continuation of that policy can only lead to further and greater difficulties.</P>
    <P>If we are to create the growth needed to expand employment and sustain a reasonable level of public services we must first create the conditions for that growth.  There are those who assert that tackling the problems of the public finances and cutting unemployment cannot be done simultaneously.  Cutting the budget deficit, they argue, is adding to the dole queues.  I reject this argument, first because we no longer have the luxury of choice in the matter of effecting a remedy.  The public finances situation is not static.  It will deteriorate rapidly, even explosively, unless it is tackled soon. Second, other countries which face problems like ours have dealt with them successfully without raising unemployment; indeed the converse is true.  In recent years several countries have achieved simultaneous success in reducing budget deficits and unemployment and this pattern is quickly becoming the norm in the EC.  For example, in Denmark the position of central government has improved from a deficit of 9.3 per cent of GDP in 1982, worse even than ours, to a surplus of 2.8 per cent this year, according to Commission estimates, while unemployment has declined from 10.1 per cent to 7.7 per cent.  In Germany the Federal deficit has been scaled down successfully to just under 1 per cent this year while unemployment has also declined to 8.1 per cent and employment is currently growing there at a annual rate of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Reducing the budget deficit is a primary requirement to build confidence which is the basis on which alone growth and employment can be built up.  That is why the debate in the next general election must be on how we can cut spending in order to reduce borrowing.  As happened in Denmark, once it is clear &mdash; if we can get it clear &mdash; that the politicians on all sides intend to tackle the problem, as they do on all sides there, and have taken the initial decisions, there will be an <Col N="3840" /> immense surge in investment confidence and job creation.  We must get that surge, taking the appropriate decisions to reduce spending and borrowing.  This is what the preparations for the 1987 budget are all about.  A budget which involved substantial extra borrowing and did nothing about the underlying problems of over-expenditure would kill jobs by adding to uncertainty and interest rates. The important thing in the next general election is that all parties put all their cards on the table having verified them with the Department of Finance, as we do.</P>

      <P>Ireland has suffered from the Opposition parties offering half solutions to real problems.  The tendency for Opposition parties, including our own party in their time, is to put forward very explicitly the very good points in their programme while giving a much less full explanation of the cost involved, arguing that they did not, save in February 1982, have access to the resources of the Department of Finance to cost their programmes. As I have said, this facility is available to the Opposition parties for the forthcoming budget exercise.  We must face up to the reality of where continued high spending and consequent heavy borrowing will take us.  We can get some idea of this by looking back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the period 1977 to 1981 public service numbers rose by about 29,000. On the basis of necessarily somewhat crude assumptions but of a reasonably accurate order of magnitude, this increased the cumulative Exchequer pay bill from 1977-86 by about £2.5 billion.  But these extra public sector employees contributed to tax revenue by around £1 billion.  A measure of the net cost of this staff expansion under Fianna Fáil, which we have been cutting back ever since and <Col N="3841" /> trying to get under control, is £1.5 billion added to debt over that period.  That sum one way or another represents extra borrowing. Since these numbers were increased interest has been accumulating on this additional amount, itself accumulating £1.5 billion.  As an average of just over 14 per cent interest, which is the average for the period, this £1.5 billion net extra outlay on public service employment by Fianna Fáil over four years has already attracted £0.75 billion of interest cost to date, added on to the burden of debt.  In short, our total debt today would have been over £2 billion less than it is now had this unnecessary expansion under Fianna Fáil in the staff of the public service not occurred and our annual interest bill today would be some £200 million lower.  That £200 million would have been available now but Fianna Fáil's past actions mean that it is not.</P>

      <P>On a similar basis, the debt today would be of the order of a further £2 billion if rates had not been abolished.  As assuredly as any increase in expenditure, the abolition of rates without offsetting savings or alternative taxation has led to extra borrowing and to high interest rates and high unemployment today.  Those two decisions of Fianna Fáil alone have added £4 million to the debt and £4 million more to our current cost of remunerating that debt. That is the consequence of just two decisions which Fianna Fáil took in 1977 and in 1981.  I will not bore the House with the rest of them.  Prior to the change of Government in 1977 the public finances were being brought rapidly under control.  In 1977 foreign borrowing fell by one million dollars.</P>

      <P>The need for a measure of consensus in our politics, and in our society, is not limited to this issue.  If we are to overcome the difficulties that are dragging us down there will be a need for a concerted stand by at least the four largest parties against the demands of interest groups.  Our problems today are due in very large measure to the manner in which these interest groups &mdash; whether they be businessmen or financiers, farmers, industrial or public service workers, teachers, various groups of taxpayers with special interests, or lobbies for more spending in any of several hundred different areas &mdash; have, over the years, played each of us, the parties in this House, off against each other.  If we unite for the public good against all these forces that are tearing our poor country apart, if all of us refuse to entertain any longer their exorbitant demands which have jointly pushed spending to intolerable levels and have promoted distortions in the tax code, we can save our people as a whole from great hardships.  This does not mean that we need to agree on political or economic policies.  Far from it.  We need to keep our distinct approaches to such issues, so that the people may be offered real choices of different ways of managing our affairs.</P>
      <P>But on this issue of resistance to pressure groups we need to create and to preserve a united front.  If one party, through its leader or through a front bench representative, gives a particular group reason to believe that their claim for special benefits at the cost of the taxpayer will be met if only the group put their organised strength behind the party in question, then not alone is the public interest put in grave jeopardy, but our democracy is itself devalued.</P>
      <P>We all know this, and most of us here agree privately amongst ourselves that such a stand is vital.  We all know that it is wrong, desperately wrong, to succumb to the kind of pressures that I have referred to.</P>

      <P>We all know that we should together, in a concerted way, resist these pressures, and concentrate debate on the issues of economic and social policy that legitimately divide us. But are we willing, are we able, to do in public what in private together we agree is vitally necessary for the survival of our society?  I hope that we can come to answer this question positively.  As Leader of Fine Gael, I pledge my party to hold fast on these issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In a small Parliament like ours, elected proportionately, where majorities are normally counted in low single figures, or at times like the present may not even exist, there is more room for pressure groups to exercise muscle than there is in larger parliaments, where majorities are normally bigger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not conclude from this that we should enlarge our Parliament, which already has a high ratio of members to electors.  At the same time, I have to admit to doubts, also as to the wisdom of making it significantly smaller, despite <Col N="3845" /> pressure from some sources to do so for the reasons mentioned.  Nor do I propose that we should seek to distort the proportionality of representation in our Parliament, to which our people are rightly attached, with the objective of producing unrepresentative artificial majorities. But in retaining these characteristics, we must face the fact that their retention demands from us more restraint and a more concerted approach to those who seek to pressure us into spending more money or into maintaining or introducing into the tax system distortions that would favour particular sections of the community.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of our electoral system that we might, however, with advantage, re-examine.  I refer to the multi-seat constituency system.  We know that even before this system was introduced by those who then controlled our fortunes, politicians from another island who have notably refrained from any reform at home of their antiquated electoral system along these, or any other, lines, even then our politics was bedevilled by a measure of clientalism.</P>
    <P>But we know also that over the years since the multi-seat system was introduced here and shortly afterwards we became an independent State, clientalism has become an ever-growing feature of our system, forcing our TDs to exhaust themselves in competition with their own fellow party members in each constituency, as well as with their opponents.  In recent years these pressures have become intolerable and have greatly and dangerously weakened respect for politics and politicians in this State.  Our people have found themselves, through this system, induced at one and the same time to use their TDs as messenger boys or girls, and then to hold them in contempt for so acting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Two attempts were made in the past to change this system.  I <Col N="3846" /> opposed both of them, and would so if they were ever proposed again.  I did so, and would do so again, for the simple reason that the political geography of this country, as of most other democratic countries outside of Britain and some federal states that developed out of British colonies, is quite unsuited to the British system of marking an X opposite the name of one person in a single-seat constituency. In this State, as nearly everywhere else, such a system would lead to enormous and unsupportable distortions of representation.</P>
      <P>But because two unsuccessful attempts were made to change our system in the wrong way, we should not be discouraged from even considering how it might be modified in a manner that would remove the pressures of multi-seat constituencies while preserving both the alternative vote and also close proportionality of seats to votes.  Such a reform is possible.  I believe that for the sake of the health of our political system the time has come to look at some such reform.  Deputies would not disagree with that in principle.</P>
      <P>There is another area, too, where we need to consider change.  I believe that many of our people have been very unhappy about some recent decisions of our courts on constitutional matters. Some, like Deputy Haughey this morning, blame our judges for these decisions, apparently believing that the judges should ignore the provisions of our constitution for the sake of our convenience.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we should look rather at the underlying cause of these decisions, which lies in certain weaknesses of our Constitution, which have forced on our judges the kind of decisions which, for example, Mr. Justice McCarthy deplored as undesirable in the recent case about planning compensation in Killiney.  It is true that the immediate occasion for this particular decision was the incompetent wording &mdash; and that is the most charitable interpretation one can put on it &mdash; of a decision by an unqualified political appointee to the old. <Col N="3847" /> unreformed, Planning Board.  But this incompetent or worse administrative act would not, I believe, have had such costly and damaging consequences for our community if the constitutional provisions that governed the judicial decision in this case &mdash; as in so many other cases &mdash; were not drafted in such a manner as to force decisions against the public interest and in favour of private interests.</P>
      <P>The time has come to look at our Constitution again, as it approaches its Golden Jubilee: to re-examine its provisions in the light of our experience of how they have operated against what most of us now regard as the public interest. Legal reform, as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition this morning, is not sufficient.  The root of the problem lies in the Constitution itself, as he well knows.</P>
      <P>The truth is that our society needs renewal at every level: constitutional, political, economic and social.  We have to tackle at their roots abuses of the tax system and of the social welfare system. We have to eradicate obstacles to growth and unemployment &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We cannot go on bickering <Col N="3848" /> and point scoring here while the world passes us by.  I for one-am not prepared by failing to meet this challenge to betray the trust the people have placed in us.  I believe that in all parties there are people of like mind on these fundamental matters.  Let us, then, by continuing to offer our people alternative economic and social policies, get together for this purpose and show our people and the world outside that democracy can work in the public interest in Ireland.  May I wish Deputies a happy Christmas and a busy and prosperous New Year before we come to the general election.</P>

      <P>Seanad Éireann has passed the Courts (No. 3) Bill 1986 without amendment.  Seanad Éireann has passed the Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill, 1986, without amendment. Seanad Éireann has passed the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 1986 without amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputies would wish me to note the presence in the House of Deputy Oliver Flanagan, the father of the House, who has insisted on coming from his hospital bed to perform his public duties here as he sees them.  This is indicative of the dedication he has towards performing his public duties.  I feel Deputies would wish me to wish Oliver a complete recovery and wish him in the meantime a happy Christmas.  Deputy David Andrews has also insisted on coming from his hospital bed, in very considerable pain, to discharge his public duties as he sees them. I think Deputies would also like me to wish David a complete recovery and to wish him a happy Christmas.</P>
