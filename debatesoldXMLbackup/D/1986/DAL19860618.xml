    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thrust of my contribution in this debate is to indicate in the strongest manner my condemnation, in association with that of the people whom I represent in the Cork area and in the south-west generally, of the totally unacceptable decision by this semi-State body to withdraw their activities in the south-west via the port of Cork.  We are being asked to approve further expenditure of £38 million additional equity for the B &amp; I.  In the aftermath of withdrawing a service from the port of Cork to the United Kingdom, we in the south-west very naturally have reservations about this volume of expenditure.  The discontinued service was very valuable to the south-west and was an economical and socially needed link with the United Kingdom.  I intend to reinforce my comments by quoting from reports I mentioned the previous day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that members of this Government believe the <Col N="272" /> people of Cork do little through their public representatives but complain about what is happening in the region. They say we are doing nothing for ourselves but complaining.  We have many complaints to make and there are many indications of the lack of concern by this Government as far as the Cork region is concerned.  This is just another episode in the continuing saga of this Government's total disregard of the problems and needs in the Cork region and the south-west region as a whole.  One Minister of State said recently that when the people of Cork get off their behinds and do something the Government will respond.</P>
    <P>I intend to emphasise once again that there is an urgent need for a shipping link from the south-west to the United Kingdom and specifically from the new deep water berth at Ringaskiddy to Swansea. This link must be restored and any assistance needed must be given by the Government because they allowed the B &amp; I to pull out of Cork.</P>
    <P>The Government say the people of Cork should do something for themselves. Efforts have been made not just by the local authorities of Cork city and county but by the Kerry local authorities and various other bodies &mdash; tourist bodies, export groups, the taxi association and so on.  They came together to impress on the Government the need for this link with the United Kingdom and to prove their point they commissioned two reports which I have no doubt are with the Minister and the Department.  Hopefully they have read those reports and having analysed them, they must come to the same conclusion as the people of the south-west region, and that is, the urgent need for a ferry link with the United Kingdom.  I have described the required ferry link &mdash; a service the B &amp; I abandoned &mdash; as the emerald gateway. When we consider some of the material contained in the reports compiled at the request of the interested organisations and the local authorities in the Cork area, we must commend these bodies for their initiative and their effort to show the Government that there is need for this ferry link.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> When we consider the competitive position of the B &amp; I, it is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that that company's dash for growth in the late seventies paid inadequate regard to the cost of capital, efficient use of manpower and, above all, satisfying the customers.  Despite massive investment &mdash; £110 million since 1965 &mdash; and the reported satisfactory performance of their freight service, the overall accomplishments of the company have changed from profitability in the 1974-78 period along the following lines: the profit in 1978 was £1.35 million but in 1979 there was a dramatic loss of £1.48 million; in 1980 a loss of £2.8 million; in 1981 a loss of £7.5 million; in 1982 a loss of £8.5 million; in 1983 a loss of £10.2 million; in 1984 a loss of £12 million; and in 1985 a dramatic loss of 400 jobs and a financial loss of £6 million; and an estimated loss in 1986 of £4 million.  This eventually brought about the sale of vessels and the closure of routes, and indications are that further measures may be necessary.</P>
    <P>In the not so distant past Sealink freight manager summed up the situation by commenting that the Irish Government's policy was to run the line for the benefit of the company's exporters and to promote tourism; that the B &amp; I policy was to increase market share rather than make a profit but that financial consequences were forcing commercial realism and Ireland's severe economic problems suggested that Government support for these objectives had to be very limited in the future.  How can we in the south-west region be expected to reconcile that sort of comment with the request in this Bill to provide £38 million in additional equity for B &amp; I?  Operationally the aim now seems to be to achieve much better utilisation of assets by route concentration, but the location of terminals on the southern Irish Sea coupled with customer resistance to such location leaves them extremely vulnerable to competition from larger sectors of the market, and here we see a total disregard for satisfying the customer.</P>
    <P>We have noted that the trend in the ongoing development of B &amp; I activity <Col N="274" /> across the Irish Sea is primarily to adopt the shortest possible route for the operator. I do not see much wrong with that if the infrastructure to service those short route terminals is such as to encourage the customer in the widest sense to use a facility provided along those lines.  The whole thrust of my contribution, not argumentative but arguing the point, is that the decision to leave the south-west coast without a ferry link to the UK is absolutely unacceptable.  No doubt flows and seasonality are considerations amongst others and in considering what type of service is to be provided undoubtedly importance will be attached to the relative generation of business at either end and the seasonality of the flows.  For that purpose, to strengthen our argument in the south-west region, and to compile support for this Government we sought the assistance &mdash; which we acknowledge &mdash; of the British tourist authority's digest of tourist statistics which gave the following indications.</P>
    <P>In 1976, UK residents travelling to Ireland were 64 per cent and visitors to the UK from Ireland were 36 per cent.  In 1978 the comparative figures were 61 per cent and 39 per cent; in 1980, 60 per cent and 40 per cent, and in 1981, 60.5 per cent and 39.5 per cent respectively.  For the purpose of analysing the likely market available for a Cork-Swansea operation it is assumed, therefore, that 60 per cent of passengers and accompanying traffic are generated in Britain and the balance of 40 per cent is generated from the Irish Republic.</P>
    <P>Analysis of the sea passenger movements in 1981 gives a good indication of seasonality of the sea passengers and, by the implication, the accompanying car movements.  While 46.5 per cent of total movement takes place in the busiest months of the year, confined to about three months of high season, the peaking is not as severe as may be experienced on other routes and the levels of carryings in the spring, autumn and winter are all 20 per cent of the carryings in the peak months.  Of course, within the busiest months further peaking will occur especially at weekends.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> I have indicated in my previous contribution to this debate how important it was to have a facility like Cork-Swansea which had been used extensively for the short term visit to the UK, the weekend trip for people in this country who wished to visit their kith and kin in Britain and those from the other side who wish to pay a short visit to their homeland.  In one fell swoop B &amp; I switched from Swansea to Pembroke which meant the beginning of the end of that ferry service.</P>
    <P>The origin and destination of passengers and their cars are a vital consideration in the debate on the essential decision to have this ferry link with the UK.  Of crucial importance to the viability of a Cork-Swansea service is the size and share of the market it may reasonably hope to attain.  This in turn depends on the time and cost which customers will incur in getting to our ports as opposed to competing ports.  Another significant element I must continue to stress is the importance of our customers, our people, and the manner in which they have to get to the ferry ports on either side.  That must be borne in mind right through the debate.</P>
    <P>The transport infrastructure associated with Cork and Swansea, the roads in particular and the railways, is never inferior to that serving competitors.  On the contrary, in most cases it is very much superior to that available to competitors and it is contended, therefore, that the distance based analysis is the most useful tool of assessment and will not overstate the advantage of the Cork-Swansea route since speed and quality of the journey are generally superior compared with competing routes.  The south west region was accustomed for 160 years odd to a ferry link with the UK and it is absolutely essential for the economic life of that region that we have such a ferry link.</P>
    <P>Another relevant, point is that the Swansea-Cork catchment tends to be considerably understated since Holyhead in practice acts effectively as an alternative to Liverpool but involves a substantially longer journey for the majority of passengers and travellers on these routes. <Col N="276" /> The limited availability of sailings from and to Liverpool, with the requirement of sailing tickets for passengers via Liverpool at peak times, has the effect of forcing passengers to Holyhead; but, for purposes of our analysis, it is assumed that Liverpool is always an available option.  In practice, of course, a significant number of travellers who find Liverpool unavailable may well choose Cork-Swansea as the alternative rather than Holyhead-Dublin.  In every examination and analysis, the trend and emphasis is to divert travellers from the south, south-west and south-east to the east coast.</P>
    <P>Apart from the points which I made in regard to the non-availability of the Cork-Swansea ferry service to which we became accustomed over the years and the diversion of travellers, Swansea-Cork is the best option.  It was very difficult to understand the thinking behind the decision to allow the B &amp; I to discontinue their connection from the southern port when no alternative was provided.  As a result of the Cork-Swansea operation, there have been considerable savings in time and inland transport costs for passengers. The Minister, the Government and the B &amp; I have disregarded the passengers in their assessment.  They also disregarded the exporters in the south-west region who are faced with the transport costs of hauling container traffic right across the country.  I was going to say from the Dingle Peninsula, but that would be incorrect because no road on the Dingle Peninsula would be capable of taking the multi-wheelers and the freight which we are accustomed to seeing on the roads of north Cork having come from Tralee or Listowel on through Mallow heading for Rosslare.  I am not suggesting that Rosslare should not be a ferry port or that it should not have the availability of freight traffic through the port but it certainly does not make sense, as far as commercial life is concerned, that a link with the UK which was in Cork for 160 years, should have been discontinued.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the south-east in its own right could adequately support <Col N="277" /> the Rosslare ferry port and the adjoining counties but it does not make sense to require passenger and container traffic to do all this travelling on, for the most part, substandard roads until they reach the national primaries to take their produce across to the UK.  Just imagine the extra cost to exporters.  I sincerely hope that the decision makers have taken into account all the elements to which I referred and that they will support the initiative being taken in the south-west to provide this ferry and not to leave it too late.</P>
    <P>The savings to passengers using a Swansea-Cork service as opposed to the next nearest service was calculated at £4.9 million in 1983.  I am not suggesting that even the most sophisticated pricing structure could obtain the full benefit of that figure for the operator but it indicates that the Swansea-Cork service could operate at a significantly higher rate than competing services without losing a significant share of the available market. There is no doubt that the market exists although the operator, in conjunction with the travel trade, should determine the degree of price discrimination which can be successfully applied to the different segments of the market.  The calculations to which I referred apply to basic fares and do not take account of further revenue which may be earned by the vessels in other ways, for example, on duty free goods.  In that connection I must mention the fact that the B &amp; I in their efforts to substantiate their decision indicated by a juggling of the figures&mdash; I am not suggesting that anybody was dishonest in this regard &mdash; that duty free goods in the Cork port was such a loss-maker that it was relevant to the decision of the B &amp; I to discontinue the link from Cork.  However, gift shops, restaurants, bars and the hire of reclining seats also provided money to balance the books.</P>
    <P>I touched on the market for freight in addition to passengers and accompanying cars.  The amount of freight which may be attracted is also crucial and could be of considerable importance to profitability, particularly at off-peak times.  The peak period in the operation of the ferry is the <Col N="278" /> three months in the summer.  The market for freight through the port of Cork is available if the service is there for it. Freight traffic in the Irish Sea has been extensively reported on in the past and most operators are familiar with the basic pattern.</P>
    <P>The freight connection with Cork goes back a long way.  Apart from the monastic settlements the city of Cork and its hinterland developed around the port.  Its coats of arms, <i>Statio Bene Fida Carinis</i> means well protected harbour for ships. It is unpalatable to the people in the south west, to the people in Cork, when people in authority, like the Government, allow this long established commercial sea link with Britain to be discontinued by an Irish semi-State company for which we are asked in this Bill to provide £38 million in additional equity.  I am not saying that the B &amp; I should not be supported as a service to our people.  But this sticks in the throats of the people of Cork, the few who are still working and paying taxation.  It sticks in the throats of those suffering the ravages of unemployment and paying indirect taxation out of their social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that 1978, the last full year of operation of the Swansea to Cork service, was a very profitable year with passenger round trips in thousands, 110; accompanied cars round trips in thousands, 24; freight tonnes in thousands, 51.  With 260 round trips per annum the vessel serving that link could be fully loaded without bringing increased capacity to cater for the demand.  The schedule takes no account of dry docking and assumes that seven round trips per week can be achieved for four continuous months.  In practice such a schedule might be too demanding but capacity at peak times would clearly need to be maximised.</P>
    <P>My contribution is an attempt to cover a very wide subject in a limited timescale. I am well aware that some simplifications and assumptions have to be made but it is to be hoped that these do not distort the essential facts.  There has continually been caution in regard to the available market for a potential Swansea to Cork <Col N="279" /> service. The facts support that concept. I am attempting to make a commercial case.  I am presenting the facts as they are and no amount of propaganda will distort the facts.  But feelings and emotions should not be ignored and if at times during this debate I have shown some feeling and some emotion I think I am justified in doing so.</P>
    <P>I have shown that the link between Cork and the UK is viable particularly the route that paid its way and was a commercially proved success, that is, Cork to Swansea.  It was a B &amp; I decision which altered that link from Cork to Swansea to Cork to Pembroke, and that was the beginning of the end.  The B &amp; I must stand indicted for that mistake.  On many occasions the commercial viability of the link, the social necessity for it and the economic reasons were pointed out by many deputations and delegations to Ministers of this Government.  If one wants to throw them in, the proud feelings and the emotions we have shown clearly indicate our ongoing commitment to use every opportunity to ensure that the Government will help the initiative being taken by the local authorities and others in that region to restore a link with the United Kingdom.  There is widespread dissatisfaction on both sides of the Irish Sea with existing services and strong feelings that an obvious link is being ignored. I fail to understand why the semi-State company and then the Government have failed to acknowledge this.  Some of the dissatisfaction felt has been expressed by Deputies from other areas who have contributed to this debate.</P>
    <P>My principal theme is the need for a UK link with the port of Cork.  There is a fund of goodwill among a wide variety of organisations to support a Swansea-Cork service.  I have mentioned the three local authorities, namely, Cork Corporation, Cork County Council and Kerry County Council, the tourist boards, the chambers of commerce, the trade associations &mdash; the list is extensive.  Those which I have mentioned are just a sample of the groups who are willing to do all in their power to assist such a project and have <Col N="280" /> assisted.  Their willingness to do something for themselves has not been acknowledged by Government, with the exception of a subvention of £300,000 which I have acknowledged repeatedly. It must, however, be stated that the delay in approving that subvention operated to the detriment of the proper marketing of the service that we were endeavouring to introduce.</P>
    <P>I accept that competition must not be under-rated.  Existing operators undoubtedly will fight very hard to protect their businesses.  The little assistance of £300,000 is a pittance by comparison with the £38 million talked about in this Bill and we realise that the operator assisted by the taxpayer will go into competition with the possible link from Ringaskiddy to the UK.  They would be correct in fighting hard to protect their business all the more fiercely if they were to see that a new service is proving more viable and more attractive than their own.  Any potential operator will have to face considerable hostility from those whom he aims to displace.  One element of the competition with which a ferry link from Cork would have to contend is the provision of free transport from the city of Cork to passengers travelling through Rosslare, supported by the taxpayers' money.  The operator would have on his side two port authorities who are extremely conscious of the need to get the politics as well as the economics right.</P>
    <P>I am not so naive as to suggest that there is any profit without risk but the risk of losing this opportunity of a ferry link between Cork and the UK is much greater.  On that statement hinges the whole case for such provision.  It is unacceptable that there should be no link with the second city of the Republic, situated in the greatest tourist earning region of the country.  The Government should be not be allowed to abrogate their responsibilities in this matter.  They must respond to the initiative shown by the various groups of Cork people.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are other speakers who wish to participate in this <Col N="281" /> debate and it would be incorrect of me to take the lion's share of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>And the share of the cubs thrown in.  I have dealt with the importance of this link to the economic life of the south-west region.  The change in technology brought about the loss of traditional industries but we have at least one alternative which would create new industries founded on import substitution and provide jobs connected with tourism in the south-west region.  We must ensure that we make progress along these lines because we need to create employment in that region.  Surely, there need be no more emphasis placed on the need for a ferry link with the UK as a prerequisite? We already have a ferry link with Roscoff.  We have always exported the produce of the huge agricultural hinterland of Cork through Cork port.</P>
      <P>The possibilities are endless.  This must be evident to the Government.  If they do not provide the £38 million to the semi-state body at least they should acknowledge the efforts being made in that region to provide the ferry link.  I have a strong case to make.  I have put the emphasis on a ferry link for the port of Cork, but I have so much documentary evidence that I could quite easily use up the entire time allocated for this Bill.  I realise that Cork is not Ireland, but it is a very significant part of it.  I will not accept that attitude of the Government that Dublin is Ireland. As I indicated earlier, we persist in centralising everything, even the ferries, on the east coast.  It is an insult to the people of Cork that the Taoiseach took the initiative to retain Bewleys coffee shops but to leave Egans to their own resources.  The attitude is: what does it matter, it is in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same attitude of this Government was evident in regard to the dockyard, <Col N="282" /> the ferry and the alternative industries which were promised when Ministers went globe trotting at the closure of Fords and Dunlops.  There is need for a change of attitude from this Government towards Cork and the south-west.  It is exemplified by the need for the Government's support and commitment to the provision of a ferry link which is so essential as a life line and a means of resuscitating the Cork area which has been ravaged and damaged to an enormous degree.  The people show by their efforts that they will not tolerate this present situation.  I suggest that this Government show a response to the commitment and the desire of the people of Cork and the south-west to get up off their knees and do something for themselves. I no longer accept the attitude of the Government, which is one of absolute and total disregard for the Cork region.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Dublin is not Ireland and neither is Cork.  Some day we will have a united Ireland and then we may have Irish Shipping back on the Irish seas with the Irish Tricolour flying.  That is on a national basis.  The Government have allowed the devastation of the Cork area and this is more than depressing.   We should be excused for the emotion which we show now and then because we are in such a state of economic devastation.</P>

      <P>The longest contribution of the parliamentary year has been given by Deputy Lyons.  It lasted almost three hours.  As a Dublin Deputy who regularly visits Cork and who has a lot of Cork connections, I fully agree with him. There is no rationale or logic behind the refusal of the Government to organise a ferry into Cork.  I would be very interested to hear today the logic behind it. When I visited Cork in my capacity as spokesman for Labour and the Public Service I met workers from Dunlop, Ford and Verolme Cork Dockyard.  They always bring forward this argument.  The tourist interests in Cork suffer from a loss of revenue because of the lack of a ferry. There is an obligation on the Minister to give a comprehensive reply to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> I represent the Dublin area but I do not wish to discuss the Dublin port because our spokesman, Deputy Wilson, covered the main points at length.  It will be debated again on Committee Stage. There is a great drive to revitalise Dublin port and to make it profitable.  The workforce, whether B &amp; I, Ports and Docks or any other groups working in the area, are trying extremely hard to bring business back and to change the whole environment.  For a long time arguments have been put forward in this House regarding Dublin port and B &amp; I about the various services on boats, catering enterprises and so on.  Many agreements which were made were wrong.  The taxpayer, and rightly so, has given a fairly substantial amount of money to try to bring B &amp; I back to profitability and to maintain the jobs of the 1,400 or 1,500 workers in B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>Irish companies used bad practices in regard to catering.  It is now dominated by British companies and they are getting the money.  If people are just concerned with profitability, where they can get the cheapest deal, it can be a very short-sighted approach.  To what extent was tendering given to Irish companies and how much negotiation went on with Irish companies?  Who organised them?  What is behind some of the other companies? I have a certain amount of information which we will use later on after the Minister's reply.  We should get it up front who they are, what they are, how they got in, who negotiated with them, what is in it for them and what is in it for others.  The House is the place for the Minister to give the details of who the directors are and what connections they have.  They are questions which should be answered.  Rather than having to drag it out we should hear it from the Minister today.  I will await his reply and say no more about it now.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial amount of money to be made.  It is important that Irish companies are seen to get an opportunity. If they are not good enough, not big enough, not able to handle it, or if there is some other reason, let it be stated.  To <Col N="284" /> let it go is not acceptable.  Other points were raised about the cartel arrangements and the improvement of the ferries and the service to the public.  That remains to be seen.  I am prepared to wait and see if it is another way of saving money, getting rid of jobs, streamlining enterprises, playing the profiteering game or whether it is a real improvement in service.  That has to be proved.  Hopefully, it will prove to be effective and efficient.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to section 2 of the Bill.  Following the publication of the Government's White Paper, Towards Serving the Country Better, in the autumn of last year I noticed that in a number of Bills an attempt was made to take away the powers in the whole area of remuneration and conditions from the various semi-State companies and centralise them under the Department of the Public Service.  On each Bill I raised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>For the Deputy's information the Minister intends to withdraw section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very helpful and will shorten my contribution to a great degree.  That is a major achievement and also effectively withdraws the section from the Government's White Paper which is what I have argued for in this House on several Bills recently.  An important amendment such as this would have to be decided on by the Government. My colleagues will see this as an acceptance of the fact that the attempt to centralise conditions of pay under the Department of the Public Service or any relevant Department was entirely wrong. I accept the Minister of State's point and I will now be extremely brief because we have achieved a victory which we have endeavoured to achieve on other Bills.  If that section was not amended, all the good faith which the Minister rightly spoke about in his speech would be lost. I presume, that is why it is being withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> People want to have a system of collective bargaining, house agreements and the traditions which have been built up over the decades in various semi-State companies.  Section 2 of the Bill has been amended by the parliamentary draftsman. He is the person who is doing this rather than the Department.  He has been instructed to do so as he is using precisely the same wording with just an odd phrase turned around.  The section would wreck our system of industrial relations and make life impossible for the various personnel departments and managements of the semi-State companies concerned and Departments which are not directly involved in industrial relations, in this case, the Department of Communications and those involved in transport. Their job is not to solve industrial relations problems and neither is it the job of the Department of the Public Service. In reply to questions I put down recently to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, they said their brief is the Civil Service and they have an involvement through the Department of the Public Service with the Garda Síochána, the teachers and others, but do not interfere in semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>Under sections 2 of this Bill it would have been entirely different.  It follows what is in the Government's White Paper but that was never negotiated or agreed with the Department of the Public Service, not to mind anybody else.  I am extremely glad to see that we have forced the withdrawal of this section.  The management of B &amp; I as well as the unions will be glad of that because it was not in the interests of either, in case anyone thinks I am arguing the case of the trade unions only.  In the past year or two industrial relations have been very good.  They have come through very traumatic times. There are now house agreements which can be adhered to and followed which served B &amp; I well when they had difficulties. Many of these problems were not in the area of industrial relations.  Many of the staff left the company quietly and the existing staff have continued to try to <Col N="286" /> build up the company.  This proves the point.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government are withdrawing this section.  It will be taken by Fianna Fáil as a withdrawal of what is in the Government's White Paper.  It can only be seen in that light.  It is of real importance and I thank my colleague, Deputy Wilson, who fought it on Second Stage and put forward the arguments which I would have made today but for the Minister's announcement.  This was a victory for Fianna Fáil, for sense and logic, for the trade unions and management. Hopefully, this will now lead to its withdrawal in a number of other Bills which are before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this Bill.  the purpose of this short Bill is to enable the Minister for Finance to provide up to £38 million in additional equity for the B &amp; I company.  I would like to refer back to 1982 when it was first mooted by B &amp; I that they intended to discontinue this service.  However, they acceded to the Government's request to operate the Cork service in the summer of 1983. According to the chairman's report, which is the latest available, the total cost borne by the company for the Cork-Swanses service was approximately £1.2 million.  Included in these costs, caused by the delay in obtaining Government permission to suspend the service, was a contribution of £500,000 which left a net loss of £700,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I would like to make which has been made adequately already by previous speakers, in particular our spokesman, Deputy Wilson, and also by Deputy Lyons is that this service was the lifeline to the south west, in particular, Cork and Kerry where we have the best market for tourism.  There is no doubt that the discontinuation of this service was a tremendous loss to the region.  This has been proved.  In 1983, the last year of the service, it was responsible for 100,000 visitors plus 20,000 cars coming into the region.  This is the type of business we cannot afford to lose.  I do not accept the figures given by B &amp; I.  I believe that in <Col N="287" /> the years leading up to 1983 they ran down the service.  They indicated in 1982, when they wanted to discontinue the service, that they wanted shorter routes due to their serious financial problems.  It has been proved by various groups since&mdash; and the statistics have been provided&mdash; that it is possible to run a viable service within that region.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a group representing Kerry County Council who were set up following that decision in 1983.  They are a tremendous group made up of the Cork and Kerry local authority representatives, business people, hoteliers, etc. Much effort was put into it in order to secure an alternative ship.  I am happy also that the Government had given that committee a commitment.  Nonetheless, that group were frustrated at various times when they endeavoured to charter a ship.  I am convinced that vested interests were responsible.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the provision of an adequate service on the Cork-Swansea route&mdash;ten hours sailing&mdash;would necessitate a ship containing approximately 500 bays, with car space in excess of 200 units.  We are informed that that would be a viable proposition.  That committee has been on various deputations to Ministers over the past two years when, I must say, we were well received.  I cannot understand why the B &amp; I should be seeking extra funding while they turn the deaf ear to the efforts of this tremendous committee in the south-west to secure a ferry service into Cork.  Indeed, I should thank Government Ministers based in Cork who have given weight to this effort.</P>
    <P>It has been proved that as a result of the loss of that ferry service there has been a loss of 1,000 jobs in tourism over the last two years in that region.  I am convinced that if the B &amp; I undertook efforts to have a ferry service into Cork it would become a profitable proposition. The Government have indicated that they are prepared to subsidise such a service in view of its tremendous tourism potential for that region.  It has already been proved that the tourism potential is <Col N="288" /> tremendous not alone to the Cork and Kerry region but to the whole economy. It has been accepted by tourist interests also that transporting tourists into Rosslare, hoping to transfer them to the south-west region, is not possible because there does not exist the requisite infrastructure at present.</P>
    <P>Many other points were made by the Chairman of the B &amp; I in his statement accompanying the company's annual report of 1983.  For example, it was pointed out that they intended to restructure their organisation over a period of years.  It was obvious at that point that they intended dropping the ferry service into Cork.  If we are to make progress in the Cork and Kerry region then the ferry link must be restored and updated.  I have already said that its benefits and potential are tremendous.  It would lead to the creation of many additional jobs, bringing additional financial benefit to the region, paying the way for further tourist development in that area.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister that he make it a condition of any future funding to the B &amp; I that they restructure their programme, allowing for the provision of a ferry service into Cork.  Independent statistics can be produced to confirm that that would be a viable proposition.  I know that tourism is in a downward phase, hopefully a temporary one only. The Government have already shown their goodwill to that committee established in the south-west region.  They should make it a condition that the B &amp; I should come up with an alternative ferry service to the Cork region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided to intervene in this debate because the Irish Continental Line Limited is going to tender at present, being disposed of by the liquidator via the banks of the Irish Shipping Ltd. group.  The B &amp; I company are involved in this, which is why I chose this occasion to make these few remarks.  We should be quite clear about something&mdash; and it is very important that this point be got across within the next few days&mdash; Irish Continental Line Limited is a sound, profitable organisation linking Ireland, as <Col N="289" /> it does, directly to the Continent.  It is not a line that should be lightly tampered with.  It is not a line that should be made the object of a quick liquidator's sale. Irish Continental Line Limited deserves better than that.  One of the reasons I am speaking here this morning is to ask the Minister and his Department to consider very seriously the future of Irish Continental Line Limited, in particular, the prospect of its being purchased by the B &amp; I.</P>
      <P>There is a story in this morning's papers that B &amp; I are interested in buying Irish Continental Line Limited.  I am not enthusiastic about that prospect.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister and his departmental officials who are hopefully listening to these few remarks, that they think very carefully before permitting B &amp; I &mdash; and Government approval is necessary &mdash; to buy Irish Continental Line Limited.  I am not at all enthusiastic about that prospect for reasons which I shall lay before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The B &amp; I have their own troubles, their own difficulties.  They lost some £10,250,000 last year.  Even with the £38 million being provided under the provisions of this Bill, the B &amp; I are in no condition whatsoever to go out and buy Irish Continental Line Limited, a profitable organisation.  If they do buy that line, they will do a few things to it.  First, one could argue very strongly that, instead of sorting out their own problems, they would somehow visit those problems on the profitable line, which is ICL, and, within a couple of years, ICL could be in major difficulty.  I suggest that the B &amp; I go and sort out their own problems first before going to the marketplace with Irish taxpayers' money purchasing shipping companies making a few pounds.  I seriously suggest to the Minister, through his Minister of State present, that he think seriously within the next few days before permitting a company that is losing money and experencing difficulties to jump in, tender and buy the Irish Continental Line Limited, perhaps getting that company into difficulty.  If they want to do so, when they have their own house in order, so be it.  But, for God's <Col N="290" /> sake, do not let that happen now or it will only place the Irish Continental Line Limited in the same difficulties now being experienced by the B &amp; I.  It would be a sad day for this country if the Minister permitted that to happen.</P>
    <P>There is something more sinister &mdash; and this is the place to raise this matter, not in a newspaper or anywhere else in the country &mdash; and it is this point.  There is a story circulating in shipping circles in this city.  Rightly or wrongly, from my work on the Joint Committee on State Sponsored Bodies, particularly my involvement in the Irish Shipping Limited inquiry, and even though I represent a constituency without a coastline, I have somehow managed to become some kind of a shipping guru within a short period, although the more I learned about it the more I realised I did not know.  But I do know one thing, there has been a story circulating in this city in recent days that Sealink are behind the B and I bid to buy the Irish Continental Line Limited.  I want to say to the Minister very distinctly, and put on the record of this House: would he please check very carefully before approving any B &amp; I bid to buy the Irish Continental Line Limited?  He should be very sure that Sealink are not behind that offer.  He should be very sure that there is no deal between Sealink and B &amp; I to put B &amp; I up as a front so that the Government can tell the people that it is being bought by Irish interests when in fact it is being bought by a semi-State company, being bought by the B &amp; I.  I am putting this deliberately on the record of the House this morning.  I want the Minister to check that Sealink are not behind that bid.  The Minister should satisfy himself on that score and not tell this House a month or two hence that he was not warned about it.  I am putting it on the record now so that, if it does happen, I can say to the Minister in a month's time: &ldquo;I told you so, I warned you before it happened.&rdquo;  I do not do that with any pleasure.</P>
    <P>I shall table parliamentary questions on this in the months ahead in order to ascertain whether the Government have checked who is behind the B &amp; I bid to <Col N="291" /> buy Irish Continental Line Limited.  I put that on the record very deliberately.  The Minister can formally ask the board of B &amp; I whether they have had any talks with Sealink with regard to fronting it, so that the Government can be satisfied that it is going to Irish interests.  I know it is the Minister's hope that the ICL will be sold to Irish interests but it would thwart what he intends if the B &amp; I had some handshake deal, as opposed to a written deal, in regard to fronting for Sealink.  It would ultimately end up within 12 months in the ownership of Sealink or certainly being run and dictated to by Sealink.  I have no problem about B &amp; I owning it in the long term, if that is to be the case; but they should first put their house in order before being let near any other shipping company, particularly a company that is making money and doing well and whose personnel have a high morale.  It would be commercial nonsense to allow such a company to be sucked in by a company which has yet to put its own house in order.</P>
    <P>There are alternatives but I wonder whether they have been looked at.  I do not know who else might bid to buy the Irish Continental Line.  It is being sold because of the liquidation of Irish Shipping. ICL is owned by Oceanbank Developments in which Irish Shipping &mdash; now the liquidator &mdash; hold 75 per cent and Allied Irish Banks hold 25 per cent.  If the B &amp; I were to buy this company AIB would be bought out to the extent of 25 per cent by the Irish Government via B &amp; I.  Is it the Minister's intention to buy out Allied Irish Banks?  I would suggest that Allied Irish Banks should be kept in the arrangement.  They are a good partner and if they own 25 per cent of the company, so be it.  We should ask them to stay there.  They are a useful partner with financial banking and some expertise. Why use taxpayers' money to buy out a bank's 25 per cent shareholding in a shipping company?  It is commercial nonsense.  I would ask the Minister to consider this point before he allows any sale to go through.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> There may be other ways.  It is a profitable line which has good morale.  The National Development Corporation have £7.5 million.  Perhaps they could lead a consortium with Allied Irish Banks and other Irish shipping interests.  There could be a very solid company with a high morale, being left to run its own house without B &amp; I sitting on top of them.  Has anybody considered that alternative?  I will table some questions in a few months' time to inquire whether the Department have formally looked at this proposal.</P>
    <P>There is a statement in this morning's paper from a B &amp; I spokesman which suggests that if B &amp; I buy the line there will be a full integration.  I wonder if it is wise to have full integration between companies which are running services to different countries.  One company is trying to get itself sorted out and the other company is doing extraordinarly well.  In my view it makes more sense commercially to keep them apart for the moment and see how they get on before fully integrating them.  The small profit of ICL would be mixed in with the large loss of B &amp; I and the overall loss figure for the year would wreck morale in ICL. I would be very worried about that.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to consider who is behind the B &amp; I offer.  Is it Sealink?  I ask the Minister to consider the role of Allied Irish Banks.  Why should the State buy out a bank?  If the Minister does not accept the solid commercial reasons I have given, let me put forward a clear marketing reason to which his Department may not have given any thought.  It is not my role to attack Departments as such.  However, I was a member of the All-Party Committee and on a reading of the minutes of evidence of our inquiry into Irish Shipping I think the Department would admit that they had a lot to learn about Irish Shipping and about shipping generally.  It came out in our report that the Department of Communications did not make the necessary inquiries, did not know that charter agreements were being entered into and did not have shipping experts on their staff.  I would venture to say that they learned more about shipping in the past <Col N="293" /> six months than they had ever known before.  I do not have much confidence in the Department led by the Minister in regard to their knowledge of shipping.  It is evident in the report that, while they were interested in other forms of transport, their knowledge of shipping left a lot to be desired.  A cursory reading of our report on Irish Shipping will make this quite clear.</P>
    <P>There is one other reason why ICL and B &amp; I should be kept apart for the moment.  There is a clear conflict of interest. The job of the ICL is to ferry people to the Continent.  The job of B &amp; I is to ferry people to Britain who may be going on to the Continent.  If they are amalgamated, which side of the coin will win? Will we ferry people via England to the Continent or will we ferry people directly to the Continent?  If B &amp; I and Sealink have some pally deal, they may win out and everybody going to the Continent in the years ahead will be travelling overland across England to facilitate B &amp; I and Sealink.  That would be the death knell of ICL.  There is a strong marketing reason why such an amalgamation would be lunacy in the present context.</P>
    <P>I have intervened very specifically to ask the Government not to approve the sale of ICL to B &amp; I if the matter comes before them.  I also ask that they should investigate the allegations and the suggestions I have made this morning in regard to what is going on.  Much is going on that does not meet the eye and I suggest that the Government should get to the bottom of it in the interests of this country before they put their name to any easy deal in regard to the sale of a very fine shipping line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Tourism (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions today and last Wednesday to this debate.  A number of aspects of B &amp; I's affairs were touched on and I will respond to the various points made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson referred to the agreement between B &amp; I and Sealink and described it as a cosy arrangement tantamount to a cartel.  A number of other <Col N="294" /> Deputies also expressed concern about the agreement and its impact on competition and services on the Irish Sea.  For many year the Irish Sea has been the scene of cut-throat competition between B &amp; I and Sealink.  Both companies lost substantial sums of money and this resulted in the lowering of standards and poor service to the travelling public. Because of the price war, B &amp; I found it necessary to hold down fares although they needed to increase them in real terms to cover overheads and capital costs.  The net result of the unrestrained competition between the two shipping companies for market share was to cost the Irish taxpayer a lot of money.  This all-out competition between the two companies could not have continued much longer.  It would have resulted in continuing losses for and B &amp; I, which could have endangered the company's future.  The Exchequer and the taxpayer could not have continued to carry the substantial losses which the company were incurring.</P>
    <P>The two companies decided, therefore, to rationalise their operations in order to achieve more efficient utilisation of assets while providing a better overall service.  These arrangements are quite commonplace and, indeed, in the freight sector they are an important factor in the stability of international sea transport. While the Minister for Communications would be concerned if the companies should combine to abuse their position on the Irish Sea, I do not see this as likely.  In any event the Minister will be monitoring the situation and he will have due regard to the interests of users of the cross-Channel services.  The EC Commission are examining the implications of the agreement with Sealink but I do not expect that there will be any problem about the agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson and some other Deputies referred to the increase in B &amp; I's fares this year.  I have already referred to the fact that for several years B &amp; I's fares were kept at depressed levels because on the price war with Sealink. Inevitably fares had to rise if the company <Col N="295" /> was to be resorted to viability.  Let us look at what this year's increases represent.</P>
    <P>The overall year round fares increase is about 8 per cent; for 327 days of the year the increase is 10 per cent maximum. For the remaining 38 days, a 15 per cent increase has been applied to certain peak season sailings.  For these higher fares, which as I have said are necessary if the company is to be restored to viability, users of B &amp; I services can look forward to much improved standards of service and facilities on the company's car ferries. Moreover, fares on B &amp; I car ferries are not out of line with the rates per mile charged on a number of the most popular routes on the Channel.  Deputies cannot have it both ways.  They cannot on the one hand insist on the company operating to commercial standards and without reliance on the Exchequer beyond the support which the Government have already pledged and on the other hand say that the company must not raise its fares to a realistic level.</P>
    <P>As regards fears of lack of competition on the Irish Sea, to which many Deputies have referred, it must be borne in mind that Ireland has always operated an open ports policy and will continue to do so. Any shipping company is free to provide services to and from our ports.  One should not overlook either the real competition which exists between the sea and air transport service.</P>
    <P>Deputies have asked about B &amp; I's freight business.  The restructuring plan will improve the company's freight operations, in that the manning and other overheads cost reductions being implemented apply to all the company's operations including freight.  B &amp; I are, however, carrying out a detailed review of their freight operations, which form an important part of the company's overall business.  Freight has not been performing too well in recent years and it is management's intention to do everything possible to restore the freight business to profitability also.</P>
    <P>Deputies Wilson and Ahern referred to the facility at Pembroke and B &amp; I's obligations in this regard.  The company <Col N="296" /> has an agreement with Pembroke Docks which continues until 1993.  It is a matter for the company to decide how to deal with this situation, but I understand that for the time being they propose to retain their rights under the agreement.  Apart from other considerations, in this way the company will not have to face an immediate claim for the full sum due under the agreement.  This would amount to about £8 million.  I understand that the Pembroke authorities are seeking an alternative user of the facilities which, if successful, would reduce the financial burden of the existing agreement on B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked about a possible move of B &amp; I ferry services from Dublin Port to Dún Laoghaire.  The company has postponed a decision in this matter until after the 1986 summer season.  If the company should approach the Minister with a proposal to move to Dún Laoghaire the Minister would have to consider the matter very carefully in consultation with the various interests for whom any such move would have implications.  Because of the serious policy considerations involved, I could not anticipate what the Minister's eventual attitude might be.  The same applies to the suggestion of a joint B &amp; I-Sealink ferry terminal at Dublin Port, to which Deputy Andrews referred. A copy of the preliminary report on that question prepared for the Dublin Port and Docks Board has been furnished to the Department of Communications but I understand that no substantive proposal has been made in the matter.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies queried the use by B &amp; I of overseas contractors on the vessels.  In fact the catering concession on the company's car ferries is held by an Irish company, Campbell Catering of Swords, County Dublin.  A British firm, Allders, operate the duty free shops. B &amp; I consider that specialist contractors can perform these tasks more economically and efficently, thus providing an improved service to customers.  This is a common procedure in shipping companies. Indeed a somewhat similar arrangement was made by Aer Rianta at <Col N="297" /> Dublin Airport where the catering concession is held by SAS.</P>
    <P>The report that Allders are discriminating against Irish goods is a myth.  B &amp; I have assured the Minister that, far from harming the sales of Irish goods on board B &amp; I vessels, the new arrangements will promote such sales to a much greater degree than formerly.  There is no question of any discrimination against Irish goods.  In fact most sales on board B &amp; I vessels are Irish goods and the greatest demand is for these goods.  I understand that B &amp; I have had discussions with the main Irish manufacturers about the duty free shops concessions with a view to ensuring the optimum involvement of Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked about the duration of the agreement between B &amp; I and Sealink.  The agreement is for the years 1986 and 1987, and under the agreement B &amp; I will have a 50 per cent share of the Irish Sea car ferry revenue compared to 44 per cent in 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware, it includes Dublin-Liverpool.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson referred to the joint B &amp; I-Sealink service on the Rosslare-Fishguard route, which it is planned will be operated by a single Sealink vessel, and speculated that Sealink at some stage may decide to close down that service. Both B &amp; I and Sealink, however, consider that the operation of a suitable single vessel will ensure the viability of that joint service.  Furthermore, there is no reason why these arrangements, when fully implemented, should not continue and B &amp; I have no alternative plans at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson and other Deputies referred to complaints that B &amp; I discriminate against Irish hauliers in the interests of the company's own door-to-door <Col N="298" /> services.  The Minister has been assured by B &amp; I that no such discrimination exists.  B &amp; I have indicated that they have been working very successfully with the Irish road haulage industry over the last number of years to such an extent that the company now carry a 40 per cent share of the units shipped by Irish hauliers across the Irish Sea.  A considerable number of the largest Irish hauliers now avail themselves of B &amp; I services.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I not only provide a service across the Irish Sea with their own vessels: they also provide a very competitive rates structure across the English Channel for Irish hauliers travelling to the Continent, through their arrangements with a number of ferry operators.  These arrangements provide the Irish haulier with the maximum range of services across the Channel at rates which he could not negotiate if he were dependent on his own traffic levels.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I provide freight space for road haulier vehicles on all their sailings, even during the height of the peak tourist demand, and in fact on the company's car ferry sailings they give priority to road hauliers' vehicles.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked about B &amp; I's results for 1984 and 1985 and about the delay in the B &amp; I's presentation of the 1984 accounts in particular.  I understand that the board of B &amp; I felt it necessary to await the Government's decision on the company's restructuring proposals before holding the annual general meeting for 1984.  I also understand that B &amp; I intend to hold their 1984 and 1985 annual general meetings and to release their accounts for those years within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>The company's trading losses for 1984 were approximately £9 million and for 1985 were approximately £7 million.  The company's net losses will be larger for those years, however, because of the need to provide for the costs and write-offs associated with the restructuring of the company.  These details will be available when the Minister presents the B &amp; I's accounts to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about the level of borrowing by B &amp; I.  Details of the <Col N="299" /> company's borrowings will be revealed in the company's 1985 accounts, but I understand that they stood at approximately £44 million at the end of 1985.  The Exchequer injections in 1987, 1988 and 1989 will help to reduce this very high level of borrowing to an acceptable commercial level.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked about B &amp; I's expected 1986 performance.  The current year will be a year of transition for the company as the various elements of the restructuring plan are implemented, and the company will continue to be loss-making.  As the Minister of State indicated in his opening remarks, the company are required to produce a profit, although a small one, in 1987.  Some Deputies asked for information about the profit targets which the Minister has set for the B &amp; I.  They are as follows: 1987, £0.5 million; 1988, £1 million; and 1989, £2 million.</P>
    <P>These targets may appear small at first sight but I would remind Deputies that they must be judged against B &amp; I's losses which, between 1980 and 1984 amounted to £43 million before the costs and write-offs associated with the restructuring of the company.  In the absence of Government support and other remedial measures, B &amp; I would have been likely to incur losses of the order of £10 million per annum.  Against that background, the profit targets are difficult but achievable.</P>
    <P>In passing, I might mention that the preparation of targets is an integral part of the whole corporate planning-departmental monitoring process which was recently introduced for all semi-State bodies for which the Minister for Communications is responsible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the Irish Shipping collapse.  As Deputies are aware, the decisions which led to that collapse were taken by the company without the knowledge or consent of the Minister at the time or indeed of the Department.  Over the past two years the Department have established a monitoring system for all their semi-State bodies under which regular financial reports are <Col N="300" /> submitted and analysed.  The Department's staff resources have been strengthened, and for the past two years they have had the services of a chartered accountant.  They also have their own economists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Wilson and B. Ahern queried the adequacy of the train connections at Holyhead for B &amp; I services.  I understand that, following discussions with British Rail, progress has been made in relation to the scheduling of train connections to both B &amp; I and Sealink's services and that it is B &amp; I's intention to pursue further improvements in this area.  In this regard, it should be noted that since B &amp; I moved to Fishguard, considerable improvements in rail connections have been achieved.  There were no rail connections to Pembroke.</P>
      <P>Deputies Wilson and Ahern raised the question of the future of ICL, with particular reference to the possibility of its acquisition by B &amp; I. Deputy Wilson wanted to know whether any of the £38 million had been earmarked for this purpose. I can tell Deputy Wilson that the answer to the latter question is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, ICL is effectively owned by the liquidator of Irish Shipping Limited and Allied Irish Banks. The Minister on a recent occasion in this House indicated that he would take every step possible to ensure the continuation of the direct ferry link between Ireland and Europe, because of the importance of that link, which we would all acknowledge. The Minister is aware of B &amp; I's <Col N="301" /> interest in this matter.  If the company make a concrete proposal to him for the acquisition of ICL, then of course any such proposal will be considered on its merits.  It would, however, not be appropriate for me to speculate about what the Minister's decision might be.  I understand that B &amp; I have not expressed any interest in acquiring Belfast Car Ferries. This question was raised by Deputy Wilson.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson inquired about the position of Zeus Management Limited. The Minister for Communications explained the position about Zeus in detail in the course of a statement to this House on 3 May, 1985.  He indicated that Zeus had been engaged by him in April 1985 to carry out a review of the business and operations of B &amp; I and, taking account of the need to maintain Irish participation in cross-Channel passengers and freight services, to identify the measures necessary to restore the company to profitability.  The Zeus assignment is for a three year period and includes the provision of a management service for B &amp; I As explained by the Minister, that aspect of the arrangement devolved on Mr. Alex Spain, who took up the position of Chairman and Managing Director of B &amp; I with effect from 6 May 1985.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the restructuring of B &amp; I were worked out by Mr. Spain, in consultation with the management of B &amp; I in the light of the review work undertaken and submitted to the board of B &amp; I for approval.  The board in turn submitted proposals to the Minister in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Department of Communications pay for the services of Zeus and recover from B &amp; I an amount equivalent to the salary payable to the Chairman and Managing Director.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies, including Deputies Lyons, Allen and Wilson, referred to the absence of a Cork-Wales ferry service. The Minister has always recognised the desirability of having a commercially viable cross-channel ferry service operating from Cork.  As Deputies are aware, <Col N="302" /> repeated efforts in recent years to provide such a service have been unsuccessful, despite State financial assistance being available.  In 1984 and 1985 a subsidy of up to £500,000 from the Exchequer was available, while in 1986 a starting up grant of £300,000 was made available. In the Minister's view a Cork/Wales service remains a matter for local interests to pursue if they so wish.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat a point in reference to Deputy Bertie Ahern's contribution. Having refelected on the matter, the Minister has decided not to proceed with section 2 of the Bill and he will be proposing its deletion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an amendment down to delete section 2.  I asked about consultants employed either through or on behalf of Zeus Investment and B &amp; I, and a report as to the feasibility of desirability of the purchase of ICL by B &amp; I. I have not been given an indication of whether such consultants were employed, or what their advice was.</P>

Will he state if that is the total we can expect from him or the Government in relation to the demand we have made for Government intervention for the provision of a ferry service?  Will the Minister not request the semi-State organisation to restore the ferry link from Cork to Britain? He gave only a brief reply to the case made by me and by other speakers. Have the Government any intention of addressing this problem in a serious way? Are they considering telling the B &amp; I to restore the ferry link between Cork and the UK?</P>

      <P>I raised the question of the publication recently of a proposal by the Dublin Port and Docks Board for a unified ferry terminal in Dublin port.  I asked the Minister if he was aware of the existence of such a document and of the proposal in it to remove Sealink from Dún Laoghaire?  I further suggested that if there is to be a unified ferry terminal it should be situated in Dún Laoghaire harbour, probably one of the finest harbours in Europe.  It is a beautiful harbour to approach but unfortunately people have to leave from that harbour for reasons that are not always the happiest. I am asking the Minister if he is aware of the proposal by the Dublin Port and Docks Board and I am telling him we are resisting the proposals in the document referred to and, secondly, if there is to be a unified ferry terminal, why not have it in Dún Laoghaire?  Why must Dún Laoghaire always be treated as secondclass in the context of the greater Dublin urban area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the company come to the Minister with a proposal to move to Dún Laoighaire, the Minister would have to consider the matter very carefully in consultation with the various interests for whom any such move would have implications.  Because of the serious policy considerations involved, I cannot anticipate what might be the Minister's eventual attitude.  The same applies to the suggestion of a joint B &amp; I-Sealink ferry terminal at Dublin port to which the Deputy has referred.  A copy of a preliminary report on that question prepared for the Dublin Port and Docks Board has been furnished to the Department of Communications but I understand a substantive proposal has not yet been made on the matter.  In regard to the question asked earlier by Deputy Wilson, the B &amp; I may have engaged consultants directly to advise on certain aspects of the acquisition of ICL.</P>

The agreement was that if the Second Stage should conclude before 1.30 p.m., business would be interrupted to take the Courts Bill, with the Committee Stage of this Bill commencing at 3.45 p.m.  The Chair has the Order of Business before him, but the Minister of State can clarify the situation by making a fresh order to which we will very readily agree.</P>

      <P>This is normal procedure. When we order business we request, by agreement, that we conclude business not later than a certain time, but if it concludes earlier we follow on with all stages.  What we had decided today was that we would follow on with all stages to be concluded by 11 p.m.  The Courts Bill was put in as a &ldquo;filler&rdquo; in the sense that if the business concluded before 11 p.m. the Courts Bill would be <Col N="309" /> debated.  I am not trying to make an issue of this, nor do I wish to be awkward but I do not want anybody to feel I misled the Opposition.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I mentioned <Col N="310" /> the insurance companies' attitude when a possible change of legislation appeared to be imminent.  Everybody knows that high insurance premia have been a bone of contention with the insured public for a considerable time.  Many people, private citizens, those in the insurance business and Members of this House, have spent considerable time and effort trying to identify the causes of high premia.  Invariably they come back again and again to the possibility that high claims and high payouts were a major contributory factor.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowen mentioned that a different system prevails in the United Kingdom, not entirely what is proposed here, but that they do not have the same problem with high insurance premia.  I know there are other circumstances involved but it is my belief that, notwithstanding the claims now being made by some insurance companies, a new system would have the net result of somewhat reducing insurance premia.  That being the case, one would automatically assume that the proposed change will be of benefit to the insured public.  The case being put, and rightly so, is whether the ordinary citizen will be given his or her rights under the new system.</P>
      <P>We then must ask ourselves if the jury system or the one or three judges would eventually result in the injured person or the claimant getting his or her rights.  I have no reason to believe other than that three judges would in their wisdom arrive at an amicable and equitable resolution to the problem.  I know that the court system is somewhat archaic and that the degree of representation by counsel required under the present system and so on is extremely unwieldy and exceptionally expensive and long drawn out.  Nonetheless I see no reason to believe that anything would go wrong or that the claimants' interests would be misrepresented or ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable merit in changing the system.  The reverse side of the argument is whether it is better to have representatives selected from the general public, as jurors are, to represent the interests of members of the public who <Col N="311" /> are involved in claims of this nature.  I am always loath to refer to class distinction because it is something that we can well do without, but perhaps it can be argued that maybe jurors could more readily identify with an aggrieved person than would, say, three judges, because there are those who believe there are still class barriers in some quarters, although I do not accept that.  Judges who are appointed to the Bench do a good job and, provided that the case is presented properly and that the usual procedures are gone through, I see no reason why they would not be in a position to achieve an equitable decision.  That would have the result ultimately of reducing the cost of claims &mdash; admittedly it is only one contributory factor &mdash; and would be of benefit to the general public.</P>
    <P>Another matter which would have an effect on the reduction of the cost of claims would be a speeding up of the procedures in the courts and a rationalisation such as was pointed out here yesterday evening by Deputy Yates and by Deputy Cowen on the other side of the House.  That should be examined in far greater detail at this stage and we should not necessarily proceed merely to abolish the juries in civil cases.  The whole system should be examined and reorganised with a view to ascertaining how best the public interest could be served by a rationalisation of the court system in civil cases or personal injury cases.  In that way the benefit of this legislation to the general public would be tremendously greater than merely selecting one item as we are proposing at the moment and removing juries.</P>
    <P>Speaking again as a non legal person, I believe there should be no great difficulty in introducing an entirely new system separate from the court system as we know it for dealing with such cases, with provision for appeal to the courts if agreement could not be reached.  For instance, those of us who are members of local authorities have often come across very contentious cases in land acquisition which have been referred to arbitration. In most such cases agreement can be <Col N="312" /> and has been reached and a satisfactory settlement achieved without any of the paraphernalia of going through the expensive court system.  In those cases also there is provision for reference to the courts if all else has failed and that is found necessary.</P>
    <P>There may be good reasons why this cannot be done in the type of case we are considering, but are we serious about tackling what I see as an insurance problem?  Everybody recognises that insurance is necessary but, because of the high cost of insurance at present and the prospect of ever-escalating costs of premiums, we should take a very careful look at all the ingredients in those high costs and endeavour to find a better and more efficient system.  I put forward that suggestion as another way around the problems that have arisen in an effort to speed up and rationalise the procedures and I hope that, as a result, we will be seen to be doing something definite in this House about that insurance problem.</P>
    <P>Let me refer again to the general public and their attitude to insurance.  At present everybody recognises readily that the cost of insurance is exorbitant.  One can refer to costs down through the years and compare them with costs in other similar countries, and in all cases that I am aware of we seem to reflect very poorly any attempt to keep those costs in check.  For that reason, keeping in mind that quite a large section of the public who should be insured at present find it more profitable and even necessary in some cases&mdash;and highly illegal&mdash;to go without insurance, our duty as legislators is to try to bring the system within reach of such people in so far as we can.  In so doing we could reduce the burden on all of those who are legally paying insurance and at the same time reduce the possibility of people going about without insurance and consequently having claims registered with the bureau and so on.  That problem is very involved and I am not sure the Bill before us tackles it sufficiently.  I would like to see much more comprehensive legislation coming into the House to deal with the problem and to attract the imagination of the <Col N="313" /> public in such a way that they would be able to see the net result as being in their interest.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies are always good at displaying the béal bocht when it comes to this issue.  As I mentioned at the outset, they were quite capable of telling us over the years that the high claims were a very serious problem when it came to high premiums for the consumer. They told us that their huge losses and at the same time they seemed able to open up brand new offices in plush surroundings all over the country.  I find that incompatible with the fact that they tell us about the massive losses they have. I know they must attract investors, investment and so on, because that is necessary in any financial institution. Nonetheless, a great proportion of the public believe that a considerable number of premiums could be reduced considerably without affecting the liquidity of the insurance companies concerned.  I know we have had one problem in that area but I do not think high claims caused that problem.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Yates and Deputy Cowen mentioned the possibility of introducing a no fault system.  That has merit in that it would reduce contention and would speed up the process, but it would also reduce the incidence of claims.  After all, in a country that has become very fond of litigation, we should be very wary of giving even tacit encouragement in any way to anybody who might feel that even if they were at fault they were entitled to be covered by insurance.  There is a considerable lobby of opinion in favour of the reverse, but, nonetheless, we should all be conscious of the need to ensure the highest possible standards of safety in industry regardless of the sector. For that reason, a no fault system would perhaps be open to abuse and, whatever else we do, we should not encourage such abuse.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to costly delays. Last night Deputy Cowen spoke about the need to ensure that full medical reports are made available before a decision is taken.  Delays in producing these <Col N="314" /> reports can also hold up court proceedings and increase the cost, which places a further burden on the insurance system and is not necessarily beneficial to the claimants or the person or agency against whom the claim is lodged.</P>
    <P>In the course of my ordinary constituency work I have seen conflicting medical reports and a good counsel would obviously have a field day in expounding on the case presented to him or her on the basis of such medical evidence.  Such medical evidence, although conflicting, can appear very conclusive and in such cases perhaps a tribunal could be set up to examine all the medical evidence at an early stage and put the onus on those producing such evidence to bring it forward as quickly as possible.  I know the argument can be made that it may be some time before the full extent of injuries is known and that it might be more beneficial for the claimant to avail of a medical report emanating a year or two years after an accident.  However, the general interest should be kept in mind and I see no reason for not setting up a tribunal which could deal with medical evidence and where documentation could be dealt with and processed to a high degree without going to court.  That might eliminate the problem of the cat and mouse game to which Deputy Yates referred last night, where in some cases agreement is reached on the steps of the court, depending on the ability of one side or the other to put forward the strongest possible case at that time which could have an overall effect on the outcome. I see no reason for the present delays as medical evidence should be able to determine the degree of injury even at an early stage.  There is nothing unusual in medical reports setting out the degree of injury likely in two or three years or, indeed, even a longer time.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed in some quarters that the ordinary citizen may not necessarily, by virtue of his or her social class, identify with the person or persons adjudicating on the case.  Such people feel that they may be at a disadvantage. I do not accept that argument because the system has shown itself to be reasonably <Col N="315" /> workable and those appointed to do a job have done it well and conscientiously. I do not see any militation against the interests of the injured party if the jury system is abolished and replaced by judges or a tribunal.  However, there is an obvious need for any change to show a reflection in the level of insurance premiums. I do not accept the arguments now being put forward by the insurance companies that awards are only a contributory factor to the high cost of insurance and that a change would not have a major impact.  It should have, because the jury system has been put forward as a contributory factor to high insurance premiums over a long number of years and I cannot see how it would change dramatically overnight.  Opinions have only been changed by virtue of the imminence of amending legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a special interest in this legislation in the sense that I have been a member of the legal profession for almost 25 years, although a practising barrister for approximately half that time due to my political commitments and full time political involvement as a Chief Whip of the 1973 Government when Jack Lynch was Taoiseach and as a Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1977 and at the Department of Justice at the end of 1979. Apart from those interventions, I have been a member of the Law Library.  The main burden of my practice has been on the civil legal side in what is commonly called running down litigation and employers' liability litigation.  I consider it a great privilege to be a member of the Law Library and to be associated with the profession of barrister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the law recently and I should like to make it clear that, having declared my interest, I have not been briefed by the Bar Council or the Incorporated Law Society.  I am giving my own point of view and, like many other points of view I have made in the House, it may be disagreed with, there is every possibility that nobody will listen to it and that, even if people listen, <Col N="316" /> they may pay no attention to it.  At any rate, I do not represent any arm of the legal profession.  I am speaking as of right as a Deputy.  It is difficult, by any stretch of the imagination, to disassociate one from the other.  I am not trying to do that; I am just making my position clear.</P>
    <P>My view on the Bill is clear in the sense that I also consider it a privilege for members of the jury to be allowed to participate in the administration of justice.  In my experience that has meant that participation in the workings of the jury system has encouraged a greater respect for the law and our legal institutions. While the existence of civil juries is not a constitutional right &mdash; that right is reserved for criminal cases &mdash; it is a civil right which has received widespread acknowledgement over the centuries and has become an essential part of the fabric of the administration of civil justice.  As with some aspects of the legal process and the administration of justice, it has attracted its fair share of criticism and debate from different sources.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate there have been many charges made against the legal profession.  Like all professions, it has its warts; but the legal profession has over the years served this country well.  Like any other profession or trade, it has had its hiccups and bad times, its bad representatives.  But it is grossly unfair to condemn the profession, both the Bar and the solicitors, because of the shortcomings of some individuals.  I do not want to be seen to be a Tadhg an dá thaoibh, to be on both sides of the fence, but equally the insurance profession has had its problems.  Insurance companies have been set up and have gone out of existence.  It is only fair to say that not only have the public been hard done by but many employees in the insurance industry have been hard done by.  Let us remember that the people in the insurance industries are ordinary men and women with wives and husbands and families and when one is critical of personalities or individuals in the insurance profession it is fair to give them their due justice.  But my experience of insurance companies has not been bad.  Certainly, <Col N="317" /> the individuals I have met have in the main been people of the very highest integrity doing the best, as they see it, for their employers.  Of course, if people are hurt along the way, it is a dreadful thing that that has happened; but it happens in every trade and profession.</P>
    <P>However, the principal argument against the continuation of juries in civil cases is the argument of cost.  When the call first came some years ago for the abolition of juries in civil cases it was argued that jury awards had become excessive and far exceeded those in Great Britain &mdash; why we always have to compare ourselves legally and every other way with Great Britain never ceases to amaze me.  However, it was said in support of the argument of costs that juries removed certainty from the settlement of civil litigation and increased the cost of insurance premiums to the average motorist and those covered for public liability insurance; and the main thrust of the argument was that it was the man in the street who suffered most because of the continuation of civil juries.  But, when the Government indicated that they intended abolishing juries, the reaction of those against the continuation of juries in civil cases was, to say the least, amazing. Far from agreeing that premiums would be reduced it was agreed that the removal of civil juries would have no effect on those premiums.  The emphasis of the argument was subtly switched to the need for better road safety and accident prevention measures and that the real problem was the number of uninsured drivers on the roads.  At the end of my contribution I will deal with the question of uninsured drivers.</P>
    <P>While I agree that it is desirable that we should reduce the number of uninsured drivers and improve safety measures in industry, these are not the issues with which this debate is concerned or upon which the debate is centred.  What is at stake here on this debate is the balance of justice and the public good and whether it would be better served by retaining the jury system in civil cases rather than leaving it entirely in the hands of the judges. If we are to take the case against the <Col N="318" /> continuation of juries in civil cases, the argument that it would be better to leave the matter of deciding fault and damages with a judge sitting without a jury &mdash; that damages would be lower and there would be more certainty as to the amounts which would be awarded &mdash; falls down on both counts.  There is every indication from the rare cases where judges have decided on personal injuries cases on their own that they will award just as much in the way of damages as juries do. It is also the experience of most practitioners, particularly in the Circuit Court, that judges vary significantly in their assessment of damages for fairly similar injuries.  This may be accounted for by the fact that no two injuries are the same, but it also arises because different judges have different attitudes and appreciations and awarenesses of changing money values and economic trends in our society.</P>
    <P>To say that juries are too generous in their awards because money values for different injuries can be significantly higher in Ireland than in Britain is not necessarily the correct approach.  I would respectfully suggest that it is entirely the wrong approach, because one is dealing with two different situations.  If we were to compare awards in the United States with awards in Ireland it would be obvious that ours are miniscule in comparison. The fact that an English judge might award £18,000 to £20,000 for the loss of an eye and an Irish jury about £50,000 for the same injury is not to say that the Irish jury is wrong and the English judge is right.  Rather I would argue that our juries' approximation of the value of a lost eye reflects far more sensitivity and appreciation of the significant and permanent disability which such a loss entails.</P>
    <P>That is a very reasonable case.  I believe that the loss of an eye is far greater in value than an English judge sitting alone awards.  Equally, the awards for the serious, moderate and mild whiplash injury in England is in my view, diminished by a judge sitting alone.  There is a scale of values on these particular injuries taking them on their own.  The value, for <Col N="319" /> example, for a serious whiplash injury can vary between £15,000 and £20,000. That is, on its own with no sequela; of course, it would depend on the age of the individual, the type of work the individual is expected to do and so on.  The value of a moderate whiplash injury would be between £7,000 and £10,000 and the value of a mild whiplash injury would be anywhere from £3,000 to £4,000 to £7,000.  That reflects a standard or scale of evaluation of that type of injury which is realistic, but there is no support for those values in England, where the situation is different and the valuation on those types of injuries is far less and, I believe, wrong.  Anybody involved with the loss of an eye or in a whiplash injury is aware of this.  The loss of an eye is permanent and my view is that a whiplash injury is also permanent.  Despite what the physiotherapists might try to do for one or despite what the doctors might say about it, it will always be there in a mild or moderate form.  It will always be present and it is a lifelong disability.</P>
    <P>I know it is the experience of most lawyers that juries do get it right most of the time.  The other fail-safe situation is that, if juries do get it wrong, there is an appeal to the Supreme Court on value and the general experience nowadays of the Supreme Court is that they can revalue the case upwards or downwards themselves or they can send it back to the High Court to have the matter adjudicated upon again by another jury.</P>
    <P>Physical injury, pain and suffering are of their nature very personal things.  The payment of monetary compensation to the victim of personal injury will never heal the injuries.  The best that monetary compensation can do is return the victim as near as possible to his or her economic position before the accident.  A jury of 12 men and women can bring to this task a broad range of experience and commonsense, and in hard practical terms a real appreciation of the social and economic value of monetary compensation in present day terms and standards.  They will not easily be fooled by the exaggerations of untruthful plaintiffs, nor will <Col N="320" /> they be insensitive to the plight of the genuine and seriously injured plaintiff.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember that on three occasions in the recent past Government appointed committees have considered the jury system and reached the conclusion that juries should be retained.  This raises the question: why do the Government at this stage want to abolish that system?  Why bring in this trivialising Bill?  Surely there is much more serious work to be done involving the legal profession and the courts?  Of course, the legal profession needs to be modernised and made relevant to the present day, but to deal with the matter piecemeal, as the Government are doing on this occasion, is wrong.  It is doing a disservice to the principle of the need to modernise the law.</P>
    <P>Many submissions from interested parties were received by the Government appointed committees who considered the matter of the jury system.  These committees were, first, in 1965 the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure; second, in 1972 the Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry; thirdly, in 1982 the Prices Advisory Committee &mdash; the motor insurance reported inquiry into the cost of providing motor insurance. No significant or substantial report has appeared since these which could fairly be relied upon by the Government as indicating a change in the situation.  It is fair to say that the three committees deliberated over a long period of time and took evidence from all walks of life. The Government fell down badly in putting this legislation before the House. The objective of any measures taken to interfere with individual citizens' rights to compensation for personal injuries should be in the interests of justice, not temporary economic expediency, or the sectional interests of one or two lobbies.</P>
    <P>We do not question the right to trial by jury in criminal cases.  Indeed, this is guaranteed by our Constitution.  Is there any reason why the same principle should not be retained in civil law?  The Minister argues that most people regard jury service as a burden and go to great lengths to avoid it.  If that is the case, has he in <Col N="321" /> mind the removal of juries from criminal actions also?  Like it or not, we are not dealing with the convenience of the juror, but rather with justice for the citizen. That principle alone should guide the Minister in his deliberations in this issue. Of course, if we are retaining the jury system in civil cases and if we are having a look at the whole inadequacy, in many instances, of the legal system, juries have been abominably treated over the years. The facilities provided for them in the courts they are serving are pathetic.  In many instances there is no question of a meal being provided.  This is particularly annoying if a case goes on for up to four days.  I can understand a juror coming into such conditions wanting to get out of them as quickly as possible.  However, that is not a good reason for abolishing jury actions in civil cases.  It is a good reason for updating the facilities provided for jurors who come to do their duty in the interests of the State.  Juries are herded from one court to the other, they sign on daily for jury service and find that they are not needed, so their time is wasted.  There is also the question of payment for jury service.  It would not be unrealistic to pay jurors for their service &mdash; on the contrary.  I would pay them, give them decent facilities, a meal or a meal voucher and treat them with the dignity they deserve in the context of the service they are giving.  None of those conditions have been provided for jurors. It is understandable that jurors are rather soured by the system, but that is a matter for the updating of the system, not something to be used against the retention of jury service.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister laid great emphasis on the need for consistency and predictability of awards.  I do not consider myself the greatest example of a high flying practitioner or a gift to the Law Library; there are far more able people in that library and the legal profession than I.  However, as a practitioner I know, as a matter of ascertainable fact, that 99 per cent of all personal injury cases are settled before they reach court, which is an extraordinarily high number. Such a high figure for settlements would <Col N="322" /> not be possible were it not for the fact that insurance companies and lawyers have a fairly accurate idea of the individual value of each case.  They can predict within a reasonably accurate margin what a jury would give in the High Court or what a Circuit Court judge sitting on his own is likely to award in that court.  The figure given in Brian McMahon's pamphlet, <i>Judge or Jury: The Jury Trial for Personal Injury Cases in Ireland,</i> is 99.8 per cent, it being stated that only .2 per cent, one in every 500, of all insurance claims ever get to actual hearing.  He reaches that figure from calculations made from information contained in the MacLiam report, page 48, and from figures prepared by the High Court Registrar's Office in the Michaelmas sitting of 1984.  I can see the logic of the Government's argument for retaining jury trials in certain civil actions &mdash; for example, libel and slander, probate actions, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.  The liberty of the individual and his good name are involved here and I would certainly support the retention of juries in those instances.</P>
    <P>The liberty of an individual, albeit of a different kind, and also his good name are often involved in cases of personal injury due to the negligence of another. It deprives that person of a limb or a livelihood.  The serious personal injury may prevent the victim from working in the future.  Why should a jury not decide on the amount of award to which that victim is entitled for that disability? There is no widespread evidence of a demand in society for the abolition of the jury system in civil cases.  If the facts were fully known and if this were a matter on which a referendum was required, I am satisified that the jury system would receive an overwhelming yes vote from the public.  It is unfortunate that this type of issue cannot be put to the people in a referendum.  We are adjudicating here on an issue which will be carried by the party or parties with the largest majority in this House.  The people are not being consulted.  That is not altogether an argument for which one can make a clearcut case, however. <Col N="323" /> Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the usual practice the figures for Exchequer borrowing in the domestic market will be released in conjunction with the Exchequer returns for end-June 1986. The Exchequer's normal borrowing operations in the domestic market have not had an adverse effect on interest rates.  The high rates in the early part of the year were caused by speculative pressures in advance of the recent EMS realignment.  As these pressures have unwound they have allowed a significant fall in interest rates to take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a function of the Minister for Finance or of the Revenue Commissioners to establish depots for the inland clearance of goods. The Revenue Commissioners, however, are empowered to approve places for the deposit inland of goods pending customs clearance.  Approved places can take <Col N="330" /> either of two forms.  Authorised consignees' premises cater for goods transported under the Community transit procedure.  Transit depots cater for other imported goods.  Approval of either type of premises is given only where there is a reasonable volume of business.  Approval is subject to conditions imposed by the commissioners.  At present customs officers visit authorised consignees' premises and transit depots when goods have been selected for examination or for the purpose of customs control.  This usually takes place during normal working hours.  Any extension of the facilities provided by customs, such as in relation to hours of attendance, would depend on the volume of business involved in a particular application and the availability of customs staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="331" /> for Finance if he is satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners supply sufficient public information, particularly to tax practitioners, on practices followed; and if sufficient statements of practice are being made available by the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for implementing a very extensive body of tax legislation in relation to over one million subjects within the charge to tax under a number of tax heads.  The impact of these taxes on individual taxpayers varies from case to case depending on circumstances and the staff resources required to deal with requests for information and assistance from members of the public are large by any standard.  Within the resources available to them the Revenue Commissioners supply as much public information as is possible.  It is estimated that at least 25 per cent of the time of Revenue staff is devoted to this aspect of their work.</P>
      <P>As regards the issue of practice notes there are important limiting factors. Decisions of the Revenue are, in general, subject to appeal to the Appeal Commissioners or the courts.  The discretion of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the implementation of statutory provisions is quite limited and in this regard Revenue must take account of court rulings as recorded in case law.  In individual cases Revenue would have discretion to deal with hardship situations or cases where clearly unintended burdens would result from a rigid application of the law. The placing of taxes under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners implies that normal administrative prudence is to be used to avoid the wasteful application of resources such as in pursuing sums which are insubstantial relative to the administrative costs required to secure payment.  The Revenue Commissioners are not, however, free to endorse as general rules of practice the special treatments accorded to individual taxpayers to cater for exceptional circumstances of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners do, in <Col N="332" /> fact, publish a considerable amount of information each year in the form of an annual report, by way of advertisements in the national press through the issue of leaflets and booklets explanatory of the main taxes and by way of lectures and seminars given to associations, trade unions, clubs and many different small groups.  The outdoor staff of Revenue make frequent educational visits to small concerns experiencing difficulty with the operation of PAYE and VAT and new business concerns are given in-house assistance in dealing with the setting up of operational systems for those taxes.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners and members of their staff hold regular meetings with representatives of the main professional bodies concerned with the implementation of tax legislation.  In the last two years staff of the Revenue Commissioners have contributed significantly to the free-phone service provided to the general public in connection with the budget.  The commissioners also provide a loose-leaf service covering income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax and value added tax.  Another very important service provided by the commissioners and which is of particular value to practitioners is the publication of tax leaflets setting out the judgments of the High Court and Supreme Court on issues affecting tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for all the information.  In regard to my question, in view of the fact that Irish case law is very similar to English case law, the tax practices followed being very similar, would he consider asking the Revenue Commissioners to introduce statements of tax practice along the lines of those provided by the Inland Revenue in Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitutional position is quite different in Great Britain; they do not have a written Constitution. Therefore I understand that it is easier for the Inland Revenue in England to publish lists of extra statutory concessions to various groups.  Here in Ireland the line between what is administrative discretion <Col N="333" /> and the usurping of the functions of the Oireachtas is something that is of greater concern.  Clearly, given that we have a written Constitution, it is not as possible for the Revenue here to undertake what could be described as rule making with the same freedom as can be exercised by the Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom where they are not governed, as we are, by a written Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider asking the Revenue Commissioners to compile statements of practice in view of the fact that not only the general public but tax practitioners in general find it very difficult to know precisely what practices are being followed by the Revenue Commissioners?  Is the Minister aware, for example, that this can differ from inspector to inspector, from one geographic area to another?  Would the Minister ask the Revenue Commissioners to consider this point?  I do not want to have the difficulty of going through this matter with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners when he comes before the Committee of public Accounts.</P>

It is not simply a question of whether one does or does not go through it with him at the Committee of Public Accounts.  He must act in accordance with the constitutional and legal environment obtaining in this country.  Clearly I would see difficulty with the first part of the Deputy's first question which related to publishing case law deriving from another jurisdiction.

Case law in regard to taxation from another jurisdiction would not be an appropriate subject <Col N="334" /> for publication by the Revenue authorities in this jurisdiction.  However, I will discuss the point with the Revenue Commissioners, ascertaining whether any of their existing publications can be amplified in any way to provide fuller guidance than is at present available.

      <Col N="337" /> As regards our plans for the national park, when we have acquired the land, it will be operated in accordance with international criteria on national parks. It will be kept, as far as possible, in its natural state.  We will underline any outstanding natural features.  Extensive size and so on and effective protection by central Government authority will be borne in mind.  We will accommodate the admission of visitors and, of course, interpretation, to the best possible advantage, by visitors of the park and its surroundings, including its flora and fauna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage we have acquired 400 hectares.  The minimum size for a national park under international criteria is 1,000 hectares.  Therefore, the Deputy will see that we have a little way to go in having the minimum amount of land acquired in order to declare it a national park.  As little building as possible would be my answer in relation to building structures in our national parks which of their very nature should be maintained in their natural state.  However, it is quite possible that an interpretative centre and such other visitor facilities as may be necessary may have to be erected but there are no definite plans as yet.</P>

      <P>The current budget deficit for the first three months of the year was £641 million, which was in line with budget day expectations.  The deficit for the first six months will be disclosed in accordance with normal practice, in the statement accompanying the end June Exchequer returns which will be published at the beginning of next month. The latest indications are that there will be a marginal loss of tax revenue in consequence of the decision to reduce the charge on gross investment income of insurance companies.

I indicated that, as the House is already aware, there will be a marginal loss of tax revenue in consequence of the decision to reduce the charge on gross investment income of insurance companies.  The House may or may not be aware that there will be some slight difference in non-tax revenue from what was originally anticipated, mainly because of a decline in the prospective profit payments to the Exchequer from Bord Gáis, as a result of the fall in oil and gas prices since the beginning of the year when the figures were originally projected.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister acutely aware of the Government's commitment to get the current budget deficit to 5 per cent by the end of 1987?  Will he confirm that the achieving of that target would involve expenditure cuts of £450 million or about 5½ per cent or 6 per cent of total spending?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the budget deficit projections contained in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  I am also aware that the previous Minister for Finance explained, in dealing with his most recent budget and the preceding one, the policy being pursued by the Government in regard to reducing the deficit in such a fashion over the three year period as not to cause disruption in the course of an incipient economic recovery.  At this stage budgetary policy for 1987 has not yet been settled and it is, therefore, not possible for me to give an indication as to the actual budget deficit projected in 1987.  It remains our general objective to get to, or as close as possible to, the targets set out in <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling this House in all seriousness that it is still Government policy to get the current budget deficit down to 5 per cent in 18 months' time, considering that it is heading for 7.5 per cent in the current year? That will cost £450 million in cuts in the next year.  Is he still telling the House that he is going to get to that 5 per cent figure, while it is currently 7½ per cent? It is impossible and the Minister should admit it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have made a statement in regard to this matter stating their intentions for each of the intervening years and for 1987.  It is fair to say that the deficit for 1986 is not as far along the course towards the 1987 projected deficit as one would expect if one were moving in a straight line <Col N="340" /> between the deficit at the time of publication of the plan and the deficit intended for 1987.  I have to acknowledge that this does pose considerable difficulties in achieving the 1987 target.</P>
      <P>That is why I chose with some care my words in reply to the Deputy's earlier question.  I said it was our aim to get to, or as close as possible to, the 1987 target. While we all share the Deputy's concern to get the deficit down as far as possible, at the same time it is not possible for me to predict at this stage what is capable of being achieved because we have not really commenced a study at this point in the Government's work for the year of the likely budgetary outline for 1987. However, work has commenced on the subject in my Department and in other Departments but it is too early to draw any conclusions.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank have primary responsibility for interest rate policy.  Following the easing of the upward pressures on interest rates experienced in the early part of the year, significant reductions in interest rates have taken place in recent weeks.  The rates charged by the banks to farmers had fallen by up to four percentage points by the end of last week, and a further round of cuts is now in process.  Rates charged by ACC, which had not risen to the same extent as those of the banks, have also been reduced.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have agreed on a number of occasions in the House with Deputies who have suggested that our <Col N="343" /> interest rates at the moment are undersirably high from the point of view of the productive sector.  I have done all I can, in consultation with the appropriate authority, the Central Bank, to bring rates in a downward direction.  The Deputy will be aware that even this week a further downward movement in rates is actually occurring.  It is interesting, however, to make a comparison with other countries. Our real rate of interest, that is when the rate of inflation for the previous year is subtracted, is not significantly higher than the average obtaining in most other Community countries because other Community countries have had lower rates of inflation.  The difference between their rate of inflation and their rate of interest is in most cases around the same gap as is ours.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the recent ACOT report on the corporate plan, 1986-91, clearly indicated that with regard to some of the most popular lines of farming, intensive beef production and tillage, unless those involved can develop within their own resources it will not pay them to borrow?  Will the Minister agree that farmers have difficulty in being competitive not to talk about having to pay the interest rates which are higher than in other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, real and high interest rates are a feature all over Europe and all over the world at present.  It is not something that is happening only in Ireland.  However, it is in marked contrast to what obtained in Ireland, and all over the world, five or ten years ago when we had negative interest rates &mdash; interest rates below the rate of inflation.  In the face of that many people borrowed on a scale that was probably not justified by the enterprise they were engaged in or the uses they were putting the funds to.  As a result those people found themselves in considerable difficulty when interest rates moved from being negative to being real. Clearly, at present it is prudent to be sure that any investment one undertakes with <Col N="344" /> the aid of borrowing will earn a sufficient profitability not only to pay the interest but also to provide a reasonable income for the farmer over and above the payment of interest involved.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is a reluctance on the part of the Central Bank to reduce interest rates, because of our budget deficit and foreign borrowings?  Will the Minister agree there is little point in talking about low inflation when we have high interest rates?  Will the Minister agree that there is no relation between low inflation and interest rates?  It is not right to compare our inflation of one year with European inflation and interest rates because European rates are lower than Irish rates.  Irish farmers and industrialists are operating at a disadvantage because of that.  This represents a form of tax.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that the party opposite have recognised that there is a connection between borrowing by the Government and high interest rates.  This is something their Leader did not seem to realise when he used the term monetarism as a term of abuse in the House in the past.  He now realises that creative financial policies involving borrowing <Col N="345" /> money by the Government do result, as they have done here, in unduly high interest rates for the productive sector.  The solutions to our economic problems advocated by the Deputy's party, even as recently as at their Ard-Fheis some months ago, are directly designed to increase interest rates even further because they would involve further borrowing by the State.</P>

I do not necessarily see that as an immediate solution to any problem that might arise under the 16th Directive. The problem arises from the Schul case in the European Court which was concerned at possible double taxation of secondhand goods imported from one State to another.  VAT was paid in the member state where the goods were bought as new and then paid again when the goods, secondhand, were imported into the second member state.  I would not rule out the possibility of finding a solution to that problem other than on the basis of the 16th Directive in its present form.  We would all wish to find a reasonable solution to that problem and thus we would be on the same lines in general, if not precisely, with the Commission.  I hope that Irish participation in these discussion will be conductive towards finding a solution to the problem rather <Col N="348" /> than simply resisting the proposal regardless of alternative methods of disposing of the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The current working assumption of international forecasting agencies, including the OECD, is that crude oil prices will remain at about $15 per barrel from the middle of this year. On this basis, and assuming further that petroleum product prices behave sympathetically and that the dollar's exchange rate remains broadly unchanged, this country's oil import bill this year could fall as low as £500 million, little more than half the level of last year.</P>
      <P>This will bring significant economic benefits and will accelerate the reduction in Ireland's balance of payments deficit. Most forecasters now expect the deficit to fall from some 3½ per cent of GNP on 1985 to about half that in 1986, and to remain at or below that level in 1987.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by that question.  In the natural course of events the drop in prices will be available to those using oil.  It will be passed on through the economy to the consumers.  The suggestion that the Government should step in to accelerate or decelerate oil prices is puzzling, as is the idea that the Government should become involved in some way in what is a normal change in the terms of trade. Terms of trade tend to change in different directions at different times and what can move in one's favour on one occasion can move against one subsequently.  I am not quite sure it would make sense for the Government to change their policy just because of a change in the terms of trade in respect of a particular problem.</P>

      <P>Tax receipts so far this year give no reason to indicate that the budget estimate for tax revenue will not, in broad terms, be achieved.  On this basis, and using the latest estimate for GNP, total taxes are likely to be of the order of 35.7 per cent of GNP this year.</P>

      <P>Total taxation this year will be of the order of £6 billion, whereas it was £4 billion when this Government came to office.  Will the Minister not acknowledge that such an increase in total taxation in that time is an indictment of the Government's failure to meet their own stated targets of reducing the overall level of taxation? In view of the fact that that represents something of the order of £6,000 on average per worker &mdash; the figure was less than £3,000 per worker before they came to office &mdash; will he not acknowledge the Government have failed totally to meet their stated commitments of reducing or controlling the level of taxation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a substantial inflation element built into the figures quoted by the Deputy.  Obviously, £6 billion now is worth much less than the same amount was worth five years ago because of inflation.  Using such figures is not particularly helpful.  It is more helpful to look at the reality of the situation, rather than seeking to make a political point.  For instance, he should consider taxation as a percentage of GNP.  In the national plan.  <i>Building On Reality</i>, the Government said their aim would be over the three-year period to keep taxation as a percentage of GNP unchanged, that is at 36.5 per cent of GNP.  If anything, during <Col N="354" /> that period I expect that taxation as a percentage of GNP will be lower than that figure.  Certainly it will not exceed the planned target.</P>

Will he not acknowledge that an increase in terms of proportion of GNP from 33.5 per cent in 1982 to over 36 per cent of GNP is a move in the wrong direction and at a rate that will ensure that the economy will not be able to cope with the level of taxation?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree our tax burden is far too high.  We are collecting too much tax from the people under all headings. However, to reduce it requires reductions in expenditure.  Obviously, we cannot borrow any more.  That would be highly imprudent of us; and I think Deputy O'Kennedy is one in his party who has urged us not to borrow more, if I understand him correctly.  The only way to reduce taxation below what I agree is an unacceptably high level is by reductions in expenditure.  Over the past three years the Government have been reducing their expenditure in many areas and, for example, they have been particularly successful in reducing the number employed in the public service which was increasing at a rapid rate when we came to office.  Now that number is being reduced.  Similarly under other headings of expenditure we have succeeded in making significant reductions in public expenditure.</P>

      <P>I do not think we should get into an argument about economic policy in general.  There has been a very considerable growth in total taxation under this Government, either in gross terms or as a percentage of GNP. For instance, there has been an increase in income tax from less than £1.5 billion to something of the order of £2.5 billion. Will the Minister not accept the Government are failing utterly to control and regulate the growth of taxation?  Irrespective of what he says about the control of public expenditure, we have a huge and continuing growth in taxation.  The figures demonstrate that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Government's targets for employment in the Joint Programme for Government and in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> are still a feature of the Government's economic policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government aimed, in the national plan <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987</i> to create the conditions in which employment would be more readily created and sustained.  On the basis of certain assumptions concerning economic trends and conditions, it was projected that there should be a substantial increase in private non-agricultural employment over the period covered.  It was hoped that, taken with the special measures envisaged in the plan to help the long-term unemployed, this would halt and subsequently reverse the upward spiral of unemployment.</P>
      <P>As my predecessor pointed out in reply to a question from the Deputy on 19 December 1985 &mdash; Official Report, columns 3090-3092 &mdash; the performance of private sector employment has not been as strong as had been hoped.  He referred on that occasion to the Government's decision, announced by the Taoiseach in the Dáil on 23 October last &mdash; Official Report, columns 276-285 &mdash; to introduce policy adjustments designed to boost employment creation with a view to bringing the position closer into line with the plan expectations.  Major elements of this package were the improvements in housing grants and the scheme for the waiver of PRSI contributions in respect of new employees.  Both of these measures have had considerable success.  To date over 80,000 completed applications for house improvement grants have been received and it is estimated that the PRSI exemption scheme has provided employment for close on 3,000 persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> Where there are no comprehensive statistics on the overall employment situation subsequent to April 1984, the available indicators, particularly the trend of the live register, suggest that total employment is again increasing. The year-on-year increase in the live register in the first five months of this year has been on average only 5,800, which compares very favourably with the rise of 16,600 in the same period last year.  In the light of the improving trend in the economy, combined with the prospect of still lower inflation and the recent decline in interest rates, the outlook is for a significant increase in employment over the remainder of the plan period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government came into office the unemployment figure was 170,000 and the number unemployed at present is 230,000.  Is emigration a key part of Government policy to cope with the levels of unemployment in view of the fact that more than 100,000 people have emigrated since this Government came into office and if they were still in Ireland that figure would be 330,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not comment on the Deputy's figures because this question does not deal with emigration.  If the Deputy wanted information about emigration he should have asked a question about it rather than the question he put down.  If he does ask about it, I am sure the figures he has just quoted will be more than adequately corrected and his advice on the matter will be put in a more objective framework than it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course emigration is not part of Government policy.  It is the aim of the Government to provide employment, in so far as the Government can influence it, for all seeking employment in this jurisdiction.  I should like to remind him that when this Government took over from the Government with which Deputy O'Kennedy was associated unemployment was rising at a rate of 40,000 a year. It is now rising at about 5,800 a year. <Col N="358" /> almost one-seventh the rate of increase which obtained when Deputy O'Kennedy with his many imaginative ideas took himself and his friends to the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>There has been a noted improvement in performance since then.  If one looks at the radical reductions in the rate of increase in unemployment.  One will realise that we are on the right course as far as employment is concerned and that the Government are correct in believing that employment is increasing and that soon unemployment will be decreasing.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the national plan, the Government's policy objective is to stabilise the Exchequer's foreign debt as a proportion of GNP by 1987.  In fact, this has already happened.  At the end of 1985 Exchequer foreign debt was 54.2 per cent of GNP, practically the same as at the end of 1984 when it was 54.0 per cent of GNP.  That satisfactory outcome was helped by a weakening of the US dollar in Irish pound terms but resulted also from significant reductions in new foreign borrowing by the Exchequer since 1982, from 9.3 per cent of GNP in that year to 5.2 per cent of GNP in 1985.</P>

If the Minister disputes those figures I am prepared to give way to him, but if he tells me the figures are correct, how does he reconcile that with the case which he and his Government colleagues continue to make that they are reducing the level of foreign debt when it represents something of the order of £7,500 per worker?

      <P>On acquisition by the Government in 1965 the B &amp; I company had an authorised share capital to two million shares of £1 each of which 1,600,000 shares had already been issued. Section 2 of the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) (Amendment) Act, 1971, and amendments thereto of 1976, 1979 and 1982 gave the Minister for Finance power to purchase not more than 58 million additional shares in the company, making the <Col N="405" /> present total authorised share capital 59,600,000 shares of £1 each.  All but £100,000 of the present authorised share capital has been taken up by the Minister for Finance.  The purpose of this section is to increase from 58 million ordinary shares to 96 million ordinary shares the provision in section 2 of the 1971 B &amp; I Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on Second Stage that the general thesis of helping the B &amp; I Company to restructure and to become commercially viable would get support from this side of the House but there are some questions I want to ask about section 1.  If we on this side of the House are convinced that the general principle of this section is that the money being provided, £38 million, will be used for the reconstruction of the company and making the company commercially viable, we will support it.  If we are investing a sum of money of that size, £38 million, we should consider the many facets of the problem.  One important point which has not been emphasised in the House is that if the House is voting £38 million &mdash; that in effect is what section 1 purports to do &mdash; then we would expect an increase in employment, but as it seems at the moment anyway &mdash; may be in the future this will change &mdash; we are voting £38 million for a venture which is reducing employment.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on that because it is important to realise that is the area of our national life to which we would have to look in the future for an increase in employment.  I mean the services sector, and this is true of the world economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not forget that the USA, which is the strongest economic unit in the world, employs two thirds of its total labour force in the services area, so that if we are allocating moneys to a semi-State company, as we are here, we can not avoid the consideration of employment and of the number of people employed.  A recent study, important in its own context and in that of this country, indicates from 1986 to 1990 and from <Col N="406" /> 1990 to the end of the century where the possibilities of increased employment are and the general conclusion is that overall numbers will decrease in agriculture, engineering and such important areas except for the top experts, scientists and engineers of top calibre.  The operatives area will decline but in the top areas the numbers will increase.  It seems a paradox, but it is important, that the one place where everybody is agreed employment can be increased is in the services area.  I would like to know the Minister's thoughts on this.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to raise on the section is that the plan for reconstruction of B &amp; I about which we were told originally indicated that the chairman and chief executive and the board were looking for £43 million rather than £38 million, the figure mentioned in section 1.  I do not intend to oppose this section if I can get a rational explanation of the cut of £5 million which is implicit in the allocation mentioned in section 1. For example, I expect that the plan as forwarded to the Minister for consideration by the Government finally accounted for every £1 million in the restructuring process.  Consequently there must be an area to which the £5 million referred in the restructuring which is now to be changed, or neglected, or excluded from the plan.  Therefore, I would like the Minister to expand on that.</P>
    <P>The original plan was for £43 million of equity; that is now £38 million, and £10 million of that in the original plan was to be new investment.  I called for the specifics of that on Second Stage, although I suppose Second Stage is not for specifics but Committee Stage is.  The House should know if there is an area which the chairman and chief executive and the board wanted covered by that £5 million which will not now be covered. The <i>Wicklow</i> and the <i>Tipperary</i> were damaged.  Were they insured adequately?  Who insured them?  It would be interesting to know.  Was it the Insurance Corporation of Ireland?  Is any of the £38 million to cover the losses sustained <Col N="407" /> when the <i>Wicklow</i> and the <i>Tipperary</i> were damaged?</P>
    <P>Those are the points I have to make at the moment on section 1.  I do not intend to put the section to a vote unless there is no adequate explanation with regard to the £5 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point the Deputy alluded to was the jobs and employment situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the £38 million.  B &amp; I employment figures before rationalisation were 1,800 employed by the company.  After rationalisation this was reduced to 1,400, which meant a job loss of 400.  The £38 million will protect the 1,400 jobs that exist now and ensure a secure future for all those working in the company.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned a shortfall in the original request of £5 million.  Let me refer him back to the Minister's Second Stage speech a few days ago which catalogued the requests of the board when they submitted their proposals to the Minister who detailed them.  I will not got through them all.  One was the £43 million and there were various other things.  A specific proposal of the board was that substantial cost efficiencies would be achieved through various means, and I understand that the Government's offer of £38 million bore in mind the fact that even greater cost efficiencies could be achieved and thereby the £38 million would suffice.  Insurance loss was not included in the £38 million.</P>
      <P>I hope I have covered adequately the three points the Deputy raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister's answer is too general to satisfy me with regard to the £5 million.  Was there an arbitrary decision to cut just by £5 million or was the cut related to specifics?  I know that the chairman and chief executive, Mr. Spain, has a reputation for efficiency and for sharp business knowledge.  Therefore I would expect that when he put his demand in for £43 million equity the specifics of that £43 million were spelled out in detail.  From my understanding of his <i>modus operandi</i> I gather that he would <Col N="408" /> not give a global figure and say he needed this for a particular purpose but that the purpose of the £43 million would be spelled out in detail.</P>
      <P>The Minister simply said that the conclusion was reached that cost efficiencies were built into the original structure and, I expect, pruned and sharpened as much as the the experience of the chief executive of this board and the management generally could do.  The £43 million was a pruned down, pared down, slimmed down, ascetic figure as far as this venture was concerned.  Did the Department of Communications say simply that they would chop £5 million off and after that restructure or re-jig the whole figures with regard to running the operation?  It would not be worthy of the Department if that is what they did, but I do not believe they did that.  There must be an area to which that £5 million related.  Just saying that other cost efficiencies to the tune of £5 million was expected is not good enough.  It is not an explanation that would or should satisfy the House as far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, having examined the proposals made by the B &amp; I, felt that certain aspects of the proposed capital expenditure could not be justified then, particularly in the context of the tight Exchequer cash position. The capital expenditure to which I refer includes the proposed move to Dún Laoghaire, for example, upon which no decision has yet been made.  Taken in the context of the offer of the board of B &amp; I for greater cost effiency all round, the Government felt that £38 million was adequate and the board of B &amp; I accept that that sum will meet the position at present.  Basically, the Government's objective is to make B &amp; I an efficient and commercially viable enterprise which will provide a vastly improved service for their customers in sure, secure employment and which will contribute to the development of tourism and trade and general economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it from the <Col N="409" /> Minister's remarks that the cost efficiency related to suspending the transfer to Dún Laoghaire will cost £5 million?  If so, I would be surprised and disappointed because a £5 million tag on that exercise is excessive.  I did not understand from the debate so far that that kind of money would be involved in moving from the port of Dublin to Dún Laoghaire.  During the course of the debate Deputy Andrews raised the exact reverse move which seemed to be something in which the Dublin Port and Docks Board were involved and addressed Dún Laoghaire Borough Council on it.  From the Minister's reply on Second Stage, it is clear that a document had arrived in the Department of Communications about this and it is not now a live issue.  I appreciate what the Minister said about maintaining and preserving 1,400 jobs and I am also on record as saying it is important to strengthen management <i>vis-á-vis</i> this whole operation.  I hope the board will not be so conservative as to think they cannot expand the labour force beyond 1,400.  They should consider that as part of their brief also.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to the question of the £5 million.  Is the Minister saying the movement from the port of Dublin to Dún Laoghaire will cost £5 million in capital expenditure?  If so, my response would be very different from that which I gave already to such a possibility.  It seems a huge sum of money in this regard considering the very heavy State investment in Dún Laoghaire and the very fine facilities provided for what used to be a competitor company &mdash; but not any more &mdash; and that reciprocal arrangements very often were not provided on the other side of the Irish Sea.  It is also worth taking into consideration that facilities were made available at a knock down charge to Sealink over the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not consider facilities at Dún Laoghaire to be adequate &mdash; I now have my OPW hat on &mdash; I hope I did not mislead the Deputy in to thinking I was referring to the cpital expenditure in Dún Laoghaire taking up all the £5 million.  I apologise if I did <Col N="410" /> because any necessary capital developments that might have been intended for Dún Laoghaire will be included in the shortfall of £5 million.  Also, for example, B &amp; I had intended moving their head office from the North Wall to the ferry port and this has also been deleted.  There was a proposal to have 520 redundancies at one stage but, by agreement, this was subsequently reduced to 400 so there was less redundancy compensation.  Those items would be included in the sum of £5 million and there are others which would come under the general heading of cost efficiency which I am not in a position to itemise but I will send that information to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I should like to take up the point regarding the proposal to move the head office to the ferry port.  As I understood it, there was then the suggestion that the head office as it is now would be turned to profit by the company by being leased or sold and that the money coming from that would counterbalance any expense involved in the change to the ferry port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>To my knowledge, there was no final decision in that regard. I remember media reports of the kind to which the Deputy referred but, as I said, there was no final decision.  In view of the depressed state of the property market, especially in certain areas of Dublin, it was not considered prudent to take into account what might have been realised if we had proceeded as suggested.  The figure was not taken into account in coming to the original figure of £43 million. Possible capital expenditure in moving to the ferry port was taken into account but that has since been deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a strict exercise, which one expects before anything is presented to the Minister and Government, must take into account &mdash; I am only saying this in the context of the £5 million &mdash; the possible use of offices which would be abandoned in favour of a switch to the ferry port?  A large property like that <Col N="411" /> could not possibly be left out of the reckoning and if it was left out as the Minister suggested it may have been, it was a culpable omission which would not be easy to pardon in putting this package together.</P>
      <P>This is the substantive part of the Bill. Again I must refer to the sum of £38 million and relate it to the freight part of B &amp; I.  Are we now voting £38 million to B &amp; I, some of which will be used in the freight end of the business?  I and other speakers raised a tricky point in regard to semi-State bodies, also relevant to CIE's activities.  Will there be any help to the freight sector which would leave private hauliers in a less than official position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the B &amp; I as a freight operator? It is important that that should not be so and that the hauliers concerned should see that it is not so, because I have had representations with regard to the B &amp; I as well as representations with regard to the CIE freight operation and there have been allegations that State subsidisation was being used to the detriment of the individual haulier involved in this trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to the Deputy's last point first and assure him that there is absolutely no intention to put the independent hauliers at any disadvantage at all.  Basically there are no capital moneys for the freight side included in the sum of £38 million.  In that figure, however, there are some redundancy payments which occurred in the freight section.  But generally, apart from the redundancy payments that would go to the freight section.  There is no provision within the £38 million for the freight end of the business.  As the Deputy is probably aware, and I think the Minister, Deputy Donnellan, referred to it this morning, the restructuring plan in relation to this area will improve the company's freight operations in that the manning and overhead cost reductions being implemented apply to all the company's operations, including freight.  The B &amp; I are, in fact, carrying on a detailed review of their freight operations and <Col N="412" /> pending the outcome of that review there is no proposal for capital improvements and it is certainly not included in the £38 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the freight area, I understand that as of now the maintenance of the fleet was an inhouse operation. It has been stated that outside contractors are being used or that there is a plan to so use them.  Are the redundancies in that area?  Is the total operation being switched to the outside contractors so that there will be a capital saving and even a possibility of realising some assets that the company have at the moment by way of sales of machinery and equipment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical people tell me I have excellent blood pressure with no sign of it going up as the years go by, but the Chair is bidding fair now to drive it up.  We got a reply from the Minister this morning with regard to ICL and, if I recall his answer correctly, he said that no part of this money was ear-marked for any dealings with ICL.  There is a report in one of today's newspapers, <i>The Irish Press</i>, with regard to ICL.  As far as the figures given by the Minister to the House go, the £38 million will be used for certain expenditures in 1986 and certain further expenditures in 1987 and 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if there is any substance in the reports about Mr. Spain's view of <Col N="413" /> ICL, but it is that there will be a total incorporation of ICL into the B &amp; I in the event of that company being taken over.  Does that mean the Minister will have to come back to the House with a proposal to amend section 1 and to increase again the equity to be taken by the Government in the new amalgam company?  I am relating it to section 1, seeing that there is something imminent. I raised this in the House already having visited Rosslare and having listened to what people were reporting in that area.</P>
    <P>If it is imminent it looks as if we are not doing the job properly in simply asking the House to substitute 96 million ordinary shares for 58 million ordinary shares.  A permissive wording could have been used, as has been done in the past, giving an upper limit beyond which we could not go without committing ourselves to spending the sum mentioned as the upper limit.  I mention this because it looks as if we are making work for ourselves in the context of reports that there is a proposal that the B &amp; I will take over ICL.  If I were on the other side of the House I would know the answer to this question; I know what a civil servant would tell me should be said in the circumstances. I am not going to give the answer, but I know what it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy could have saved me rising again, if he knows the answer.  But I will give it anyway with pleasure.  I can only reiterate what my colleague the Minister, Deputy Donnellan, said this morning that as of yet no proposal has come to the Government or B &amp; I in relation to the proposed purchase of ICL.  It would be considered on its merits if and when that happens, but it would be irresponsible of me to speculate in the House now and there is no part of the £38 million to which the section refers allocated for the purchase of ICL.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair enough answer and as far as the Minister can go. Am I right in thinking it would be in this context that any advance in that area would have to take place?  If it were a <Col N="414" /> B &amp; I investment it seems that we would not need a new Bill but, in fact, would be back in the patch and mend business with this Bill in the future.  I know it is a hyphothetical question but it is in the context of this Bill rather than in the context of a new Bill that we would have to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I would be speculating if I went too far down this road.  If the question did arise in relation to the possible purchase of B &amp; I by ICL it may not even require equity so we really do not know what section or what part of this Bill it might otherwise have been in if things had been different and if perhaps the whole ICL saga had been further down the line than it is today.  We are all speculating mainly because it is wishful thinking perhaps and we are all hoping for a satisfactory outcome.  I will go no further in relation to this whole difficult area at the moment.  I cannot go any further.  We cannot talk about what might have been in this Bill or what section it would be in if things had been different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister is saying.  I trust that there will not be an intervening period of two or three months.  If the commercial activity takes place, in other words, if B &amp; I are advised by the Government that the Government will support the purchase, we could be in the middle of the summer recess.  I do not know what kind of tools can be used by the B &amp; I for the purchase.  I am very heartened that the Minister said that they might not need any money at all.  Perhaps some of the financial institutions might put money up front.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">

      <P>There was a big rush to get to the Minister's ear.  It might not need Government equity.  It would seem that there are other ways in which it <Col N="415" /> could be arranged.  There are banking institutions already heavily involved in the ICL, having very heavy guarantees. I am putting on the record of the House the concern of this side of the House in regard to ICL in the light of what is being reported as to what is happening.  We on this side of the House are committed to Irish ownership, whether a full State ownership, or shared with private interests, or whatever, provided it is Irish ownership in the context of a company who are profitable and have already established themselves, are plying between this country and the mainland of Europe, particularly in the light of our membership of the EC.  I am glad the matter got a little airing.  I know the Minister is constricted in what she can say in this regard.  I hope we shall not find ourselves in a commercial desert in the middle of summer if things progress in the direction in which the reports are saying that they will.</P>

      <P>I think my colleague adequately covered this point this morning. I can only reiterate what he said.  We shall not go back over the history of the money which was on offer but not taken up over the last couple of years in relation to those routes in the southern corridor. It is really now a matter for local interests to pursue this.  In case we get back to it I should say that, to my knowledge, it is not included with the £38 million.  I presume, the debate being on section 1, that is the context in which the question was asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 be deleted&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister has agreed to the position which I advanced on Second Stage.  To recap the points of my opposition, I thought it was cutting the ground from under the board and management of the B &amp; I, that it was taking away a fundamental right of management with regard to remuneration.  I also thought the language was excessively strong.  It stated: &ldquo;The company shall comply with any directive...&rdquo; That language, in the context of industrial relations, was very strong indeed.  I expressed doubts as to whether it might infringe the rights of the board and management in law.  As company law applied to them and as company law put obligations upon them, this section was putting them in a very false position.  It was frightening in a sense, and an attempt to arrogate power to the Minister in an area where he should not be looking for power and where possibly he could be taken to court by workers and staff as infringing their constitutional right.</P>
      <P>It seemed to thumb the nose at the Departments of Labour and of the Public Service and to indicate that there was a whole new section of the Department of Communications where a degree of expertise in industrial relations, industrial bargaining and so forth had been developed beyond what was available in any other Department.  This was downright arrogance on the part of the Minister in putting section 2 into the Bill.  I regret to say this appears to be a tendency which has developed in recent years.  This is the first Bill which came to this House that I was involved in that included it. Another Bill is coming which also has this inclusion, but I understand that in another place the Minister indicated that he was withdrawing it.  I am glad this section is being withdrawn.  I am not advancing that argument in any context other than the one I have mentioned now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> There is a drive or thrust, of which I approve, to make this company one which will be a good employer and a profitable company which should be making returns to the State of the profits which they will make as a return on the money being invested in the company. As I mentioned on Second Stage the last report indicated that there was a turnover of about £88 million and a loss of £10¼ million.  That was an intolerable situation. It is hard to believe that it could happen that on that amount of turnover one could have such a huge loss.  The thrust now is to achieve a commercially viable company.  It was in that context that I expressed my opposition and that of my party to that section in the Bill. It was a recipe for industrial chaos and trouble in the future and I want to express my gratitude to the Minister for having withdrawn the section from the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to put it on the record that I got in touch with the Bills Office.  My amendment was to have the section deleted.  I see that the Bills Office interpreted that as &ldquo;Section opposed&rdquo; but I presume that is tantamount to the same thing.  The section is now gone, anyway.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that the approval of the Minister for Communications, given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service is required for alterations to any superannuation scheme currently in operation in the B &amp; I, or the introduction of any new scheme.  All bodies under the aegis of the Minister for Communications, with the exception of B &amp; I Company, are required to have their superannuation schemes and amending superannuation schemes in respect of their employees, including the chief executive, approved and in some cases confirmed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  This provision will <Col N="418" /> merely bring the B &amp; I Company into conformity with our other State bodies and with State bodies generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on that because it is an area that is causing some anxiety.  I considered putting down an amendment to have that deleted also. The wording is not quite as aggressive or all-embracing as the wording in section 2, in particular the statement &ldquo;the company shall comply with any directives with regard to such remuneration&rdquo;.  Even the word &ldquo;directive&rdquo; is something which one would expect to see coming from the Kremlin.  There is no such phrase in section 3.  Nevertheless, it would be foolish of the House not to recognise that there is a problem, in particular with regard to the remuneration of top management in semi-State companies.  As the House is aware, the method of employment of the chairman and chief executive which was adopted by the Minister for Communications in regard to B &amp; I was generally believed to be an attempt to get round the shackles put on the Departments and the Government by the Devlin recommendations.  The method was to appoint a chairman and chief executive combined and to employ a consultancy firm of which the chairman and chief executive would be a very important member.  There was legal sleight of hand in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office is mentioned specifically.  It would be foolish of the House to ignore that there is a problem, a problem which does not refer exclusively to B &amp; I.  It is encountered in other semi-State companies also.  The House must give consideration to this whole area and make it unnecessary for a Minister to have to contrive a method of securing somebody who is regarded as the best person for a particular job such as this.  It would have been easy to put down an amendment to have it deleted.  It is important to realise that the weaknesses that inserting this would show up in the whole system as of now.  I am not pressing it to a division but it is important to air the difficulty and to have regard to it.  The market decides what one pays a person to do a job like <Col N="419" /> this.  If we allow too much of a gap between what the market is offering and what a semi-State body are offering that is a recipe for getting a less competent person.</P>
    <P>In the past, and also at present, there were people in State and semi-State bodies who, outside of the company or body in which they operated, could command a much higher remuneration but stayed with the semi-State body because they had given their lives to it.  They become proprietorial with regard to it and are emotionally committed to it. They could not see themselves operating outside that body, even for more money. We gain by that.  I doubt if in the future it will be possible to get such people. When they develop the kind of strength and expertise that enables them to take on that kind of position, they will move with the market to wherever they are best remunerated.  It is important that we take cognisance of that.</P>

The whole area of payment of chief executives in semi-State bodies should be reinvestigated in order to attract the top management. People get involved in a personal way and many of the top class people have stayed within the semi-State sector. We should look at this area in order to ensure that we have the best people willing to come into the semi-State sector for the good of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I was discussing the problems relating to the proposals before the House.  I pointed out that many submissions were received from interested parties in connection with the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure set up in 1965 and, in 1972, the committee of inquiry into the insurance industry.  In 1982, the Prices Advisory Committee reported on the costs and methods of providing motor insurance.  No significant or substantial report has appeared since then which could be relied upon to indicate a change in the situation.  It is my submission that the reality and importance of these committees is that at no stage did they indicate they were seeking the abolition of <Col N="421" /> juries in civil cases.  These committees which were set up by successive Governments consisted of prominent people in positions of authority.  In those circumstances and by virtue of their experience they would have known the problems from A to Z.  Being fully aware of the problems, in their wisdom they decided there was no case at that time to be made for the abandonment of juries in civil cases.</P>
      <P>Before lunch I also said in regard to the liberty of individuals &mdash; and I pointed out this might be a liberty of a different kind &mdash; it is proper where their good names were involved that there should be juries but equally where there were personal injuries of a substantial nature involved the matter should be left to a judge and jury as distinct from a judge sitting alone.  Another point I raised was that there is no evidence of a widespread demand in this society for the abolition of the jury system in civil cases.  If the facts were fully known, and if this was a matter upon which a referendum was required, I pointed out that there would be general agreement that the jury system would receive an overwhelming yes vote from the public at large.  However, this is not the case and in the circumstances it is a matter entirely for the legislative wisdom or un-wisdom of this House.  We live in a free society in which as politicians we constantly advocate the full participation of every citizen in everyday life.  We ask that all citizens fully participate in the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why at this stage when respect for law and order is at a low ebb should we further reduce the right of the citizen to participate in the administration of justice?  I must ask the Minister to consider whether this legislation is constitutional and whether, following its passage, he will be faced with a constitutional challenge as to its efficacy in the context of our Constitution.  I must ask the Minister to refer this legislation back to his law office to consider whether or not it is constitutional in the light of the case of <i>de Burca v. the Attorney General</i>, 1976, Irish Reports at page 38, where the plaintiffs challenged the Juries Act, 1927, <Col N="422" /> which <i>inter alia</i> exempted all women from jury service.  The then Chief Justice asked whether this discrimination is permissible or is it of such a nature as to be regarded as being invidious.  He said if service be regarded as a right, then this means the exclusion of many thousands of citizens merely because they do not possess a particular type of property.</P>
    <P>Clearly, in this case the Supreme Court were of the view that jury service was a right and a right which had to be protected under the Constitution.  That was why I raised the constitutional point.  In the case of <i>de Burca v. the Attorney General</i> the then Chief Justice quite correctly took the view that all citizens as of right were entitled to serve on juries. Consequently, that conclusion became evident.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am now asking the Minister to refer the Bill back to his law officers with a view to obtaining a constitutional view on it.  If it comes back with the views enshrined in his Second Stage speech, so be it.  There is a constitutional case to be made.  Whether it would succeed or not is another day's work but it is worth raising because we would have been wasting our time discussing this legislation in this House if it were found to be unconstitutional. It would have been an appalling waste of time and money if this legislation were to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and then found itself defeated as being unconstitutional.  For that reason amongst the other reasons I have offered, we on this side of the House are strongly opposed to this legislation.</P>
    <P>Before the break for Question Time I had raised the question of uninsured drivers.  I believe that to be the main reason for the cost of insurance premiums having risen to such an extent.  My view is that the uninsured driver is a criminal, that his or her behaviour is anti-social. They do a disservice to those people who pay their insurance premiums, in many instances very large ones.  They are placing not alone their own but other lives at risk.  I accept that in the case of personal accident, where there is no insurance cover, there is a pool paid into by the various insurance companies <Col N="423" /> called the Motor Insurers' Bureau.  They pay for personal injuries only.  They do not pay for physical damage done to a car; that is a total write-off.  If the law were applied properly, if the Minister had his Department exercise considerable muscle in the context of the uninsured driver, then we would not have to be dealing with this problem here today.  I understand that in the not too distant future it will be compulsory on all drivers to display and insurance disc on motor vehicles generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister and those people who have been critical of the legal system are right because there is no question but that it leaves a lot to be desired.  Indeed, the members of the legal profession recognise that there is much to be done to update the system.  In the context of the Bar, the Law Library, where we wear wigs and gowns, I may be able to make a case for the wearing of a gown on the basis of protecting one's clothing, acting as an overall in the to-ing and fro-ing in the courts, consultations, referring to law books on a daily basis.  But there can be no case whatever made for the existence of the wig.</P>

      <P>It is inclined to damage what little bit of hair some of us have left.  We could start with the abandonment of the wig in the Law Library because it is unnecessary.  Also the language of the law in court is archaic &mdash; expressions such as: &ldquo;may it please your Lordship&rdquo;, &ldquo;if your Lordship pleases&rdquo;.  The manner of addressing judges on the bench is out of date.  They are examples of things which could be dealt with immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many allegations have been made against the legal profession.  However, speaking as a practising barrister I should like to pay tribute to the very high standards maintained by the Bar in the face of unresearched criticism in many instances. The Bar is made up of people who have had the privilege of an education sufficient to bring them into the Law Library <Col N="424" />&mdash; agreed, it is a rather privileged condition in life &mdash; but those people who do go into the Law Library are of the highest integrity and standards.  There is a code of exemplary behaviour in the Law Library.  I am proud to have been part of it, to have been associated with it over many years.</P>
    <P>There have also been some extraordinary, unfair accusations against insurance companies and individuals within those companies.  Speaking as somebody with experience of the insurance industry generally, it is my opinion that in the main these are people of the highest integrity.  In the legal profession or in the insurance industry always there will be examples which can be highlighted where the system can be seen to have broken down, but the system overall should not be condemned for the shortcomings of the few.  It happens in every walk in life. Because there may be one or two bad apples in a barrel, the entire barrel should not be condemned.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate The General Council of the Bar of Ireland sent a letter, dated 10 June 1986, to all Members of the Oireachtas.  The second page of that letter is worth reading into the record.  It is signed by the Chairman of the Bar Council, Mr. Patrick MacEntee, who, in the view of many, is one of the best criminal lawyers of his generation or, indeed, in the history of the Law Library.  On page 2 of that letter under the heading &ldquo;conclusion&rdquo; he had this to say:</P>
    <P>The abolition of juries is the equivalent of buying a &ldquo;pig in a poke&rdquo; and it does not make good sense to effect change for the sake of change;</P>
    <P>We seem to be pussy-footing around a very large problem in relation to the operation of the legal system.  The abandonment of juries in civil action cases appears to be effecting change for the sake of change and does not make too much sense.  Mr. MacEntee goes on to say:</P>
    <P>...particularly when it cannot be <Col N="425" /> established that the suggested &ldquo;cure&rdquo; is preferable to the &ldquo;disease&rdquo; and may even aggravate the situation.</P>
    <P>He then goes on to pose the question: &ldquo;Will the abolition of juries serve the interests of justice?&rdquo; and says:</P>
    <P>1.  Among the practical effects of the abolition of the jury system are:</P>
    <P>(a)  It will remove from the public at large one of the very few opportunities they have to participate in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with that.  It is proper that as many citizens as possible should be involved in the administration of justice, so that they will know firsthand, from their experience, how the system operates, warts and all.  I have already pointed out that the treatment of jurors in whatever courts they served left much to be desired.  Their conditions left much to be desired.  Undoubtedly they were &mdash; if I may put it crudely &mdash; soured and disillusioned by their treatment when they came to perform a public duty on behalf of the State.  They were treated shabbily by way of conditions, their knowledge of how the system operated, how they were to serve, even in terms of the possibility of payment for the service they rendered or of being provided with a meal in the course of that service which inevitably lasted a fortnight or three weeks.  Indeed, during that period quite a number of the panel of jurors presenting themselves might not have been called to serve on a jury.  Taking account of that, that observation by the Chairman of the Bar Council is a fair one, that it will remove from the public at large one of the very few opportunities they have to participate in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The second point made by Mr. MacEntee is:</P>
    <P>(b)  It will transfer responsibility for setting standards of care in this country from the hands of a cross section of the community who, collectively, would probably have a wider experience of &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; living and a better appreciation of acceptable behaviour within <Col N="426" /> the community into the hands of a judge.</P>
    <P>I stress that that comment emanates from the Chairman of the Bar Council, not from Deputy David Andrews.  Then he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In other words, from now on, the judge, rather than a cross section of the community, will decide questions of responsibility for accidents and what standards of care are appropriate on the public road, on the factory floor and as between the professional classes and members of the public, i.e. alleged negligence of solicitors, doctors, accountants etc.</P>
    <P>That is the point I made about the differential between the types of awards we give and the low awards given in England for the same type of accidents.  The letter goes on to state:</P>
    <P>It could, if the English example were followed, have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation recoverable by persons injured through no fault of their own, to a very low level by comparison to what they could now reasonably expect under the jury system, e.g. a jury can be expected to award something between £50,000 and £60,000 for the loss of an eye, whereas in England the same injury would attract an award in the region of £15,000 to £17,500.  The availability of jury trial serves the useful social function of discouraging or even preventing litigation from becoming the exercise of an exclusively professional ritual engaged in by professional lawyers, judges and advocates.  It ensures that the kind of justice administered is one which the ordinary man can understand and desire rather than the kind that the professional lawyer thinks he ought to have and is good for him.  It is our view that the decision by one man alone is always potentially inferior to a collective decision.</P>
    <P>That is a matter of opinion.  I do not think at any stage in the course of his letter Mr. McEntee, the Chairman of the <Col N="427" /> Bar Council, attempted to diminish or deny the undoubted integrity of our Bench.  They have never been found wanting in the service of both the country and the legal system.</P>
    <P>Mr. McEntee's letter goes on to state as follows:</P>
    <P>It is questionable that the interests of justice are better served by the substitution of the views of a judge for those of the ordinary man in the street in relation to proper conduct within the community and the level of compensation to be paid to persons injured through no fault of their own.  The Bar Council in bringing to you its views on this matter of public importance wishes also to restate its willingness to co-operate to the full.</P>
    <P>In the event of this Bill passing successfully from the Government's point of view through this House, the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society will make the system work.  There is no question about that.  They will co-operate fully and continue to do their duty within the purview of what they are asked to operate.</P>
    <P>I apologise for having held up the proceedings of the Dáil and arriving rather out of breath and in an unfit state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute on this Bill.  I would probably agree with most of what has been said by my constituency colleague, who is also a lawyer, particularly regarding the need for a review of the legal system.  For that reason I have to question the simplistic approach in the introduction of this Bill.  Many arguments can be made for and against trial by judge and jury and trial by a judge sitting alone. This legislation has been brought forward as a response to simplistic headlines concerning the slowness of justice or the peculiarities of certain awards made from time to time.  It is dangerous for us as legislators to believe that a simple Bill like this, seen as a sop to certain elements, will actually achieve anything.  We may well abolish juries but at the end of <Col N="428" /> the day will we have achieved anything or solved any problems?</P>
      <P>We should undertake a total review of the operation of the legal system, considering how actions arise, the working of the Bar Library, the courts and the Incorporated Law Society.  All these bodies and all systems need review and changes in their procedures from time to time.  A review of these operations would bring about greater results and answer more demands.  I have not had a massive amount of lobbying for the abolition of juries.  I have had complaints about cases coming on, about solicitors and barristers and delays in medical reports coming forward. Recently I had a complaint about the state of Dún Laoghaire District Court.  A total review of the legal system would encompass the various problems involved to see that our legal system in all its aspects is brought into the 20th century, doing away with outmoded rituals so that justice would be seen to be more swift and effective.  While we have been well served by our legal system, the fact remains that it needs updating.</P>
      <P>I do not want to dwell unduly on this point but in Dún Laoghaire District Court the corporation are responsible for upkeep but the people who work there are Department of Justice employees. The court has just one toilet and no public telephone, yet here we are abolishing juries as if this is the most urgent need. I have to question the priorities.</P>
      <P>That is why I would have preferred to see a review of the legal system as it operates.  We should examine how it operates at various levels and consider the different bodies who work in connection with the courts, everything from the appointment of judges to the workings of the Bar and of solicitors and the whole process by which cases are brought on. Such a review is long overdue.  I hope it will take place and that it will not be claimed that this Bill will solve all the problems.  It is true that delays occur in cases.  The intention behind this legislation is to reduce the level of awards and the cost of bringing about the awards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time court awards hit the <Col N="429" /> headlines in our newspapers, particularly where a person has been paralysed or lost a limb or two.  Such people deserve substantial compensation but in some cases there is a tendency to go overboard in regard to such awards.  There is also concern about delay in processing cases where people are seriously injured. There must be consideration for those who have to change their lifestyle following an accident.  Awards for such people should be calculated on the basis of providing them with an income to allow them to live comfortably.  It is unfortunate that in the case of many big awards plaintiffs do not live too long after settlements.</P>
    <P>We must understand that the majority of personal injury accident cases are settled before they go to court.  Representatives of both parties get together and arrive at certain levels of compensation for different injuries.  Obviously, some lawyers can manage to get more from some insurance companies but in the majority of cases the awards agreed are reasonable.  I accept that such awards cost insurance companies a lot of money but I wonder if the abolition of juries will mean that awards will come tumbling down.  Will premiums fall as a result?  I do not think that will happen.  However, I hope that the introduction of the insurance disc system from next month will mean that fewer uninsured drivers will be on our roads.</P>
    <P>The insurance premium on the cheapest car costs more than £200 but the fines for driving without insurance cover are not as high.  I advocate that those caught driving without insurance cover should have their vehicle confiscated.  That may sound reactionary but driving without insurance is a very serious offence.  There is no doubt that the high cost of insurance is partly due to the number of uninsured drivers on our roads.  Two of the largest awards in the past 12 months were awarded by judges sitting without a jury. It must be borne in mind that it is open to insurance companies to appeal the amount of awards.  I can recall an award of £1½ million being reduced substantially on appeal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> The point has been made that the abolition of juries will speed up civil injury cases and there is no doubt that that will be so.  However, we must remember that there are other reasons why it takes a long time before a case goes to trial. Medical consultants may have to delay for six to 12 months before giving an opinion on the condition of an individual. There is always the fear that arthritis will set in and it is not possible to diagnose that immediately after an accident.</P>
    <P>Some time ago there was a backlog of cases in the High Court because we did not have sufficient judges, but that has improved.  I accept that it is possible that the abolition of juries will result in greater consistency in the amounts awarded to those injured in accidents but the judges do not come from the same family background. Some come from a sheltered background while others may have come up the hard way.  As happens in the District Court in relation to sentencing policies, and in the Circuit Court in regard to awards, judges differ.  I am sure all Members will disagree on the amount that should be awarded for the loss of an eye or a leg.</P>
    <P>We should look at the proposal again before we decide to abolish a system that has been with us for a long time and has served us well.  I am not convinced that the abolition of juries will be of great benefit.  I am inclined to agree with some of the criticism of our legal system such as complaints about the Law Society or barristers, but it is too simplistic to say everything in the garden will be rosy after the abolition of juries.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has to be taken into account is the cost to insurance companies of the retaining of two senior counsel on either side.  Justifiable cases can be made for having one senior counsel and one junior on either side.  There could be a rule to that effect.  Many barristers would agree that two seniors on both sides are unnecessary.  There may be cases when it would be necessary, but many barristers would be inclined to accept that half a loaf is better than no bread.  Again, there may be cases in which there would be a need for expertise <Col N="431" /> or specialist knowledge on certain matters, but costs could be shared accordingly and there could be an agreed overall fee, with the insurance companies sharing out the total amount among the barristers employed.</P>
    <P>These are matters of greater public concern than the abolition of juries.  I have great respect for the Judiciary who have served the country well, but different judges have different standards and come from different backgrounds and most people would prefer to have their cases tried by 12 men and women. We must remember that there is still an appeal from the High Court.  I do not know how much public demand there has been for these provisions.  I am a solicitor and I have not had a flood of demands for the abolition of juries, but I have had complaints about the outmoded legal system and about the standards operating in it.</P>
    <P>I will refer again to the District Court where consultations sometimes have to be held in the rain because of lack of consulting rooms.  Proper accommodation in the courts is far more relevant as far as the public are concerned than the abolition of trial by jury.</P>
    <P>I do not think a case has been made during the debate that insurance costs will suddenly be reduced after this Bill comes into operation.  I do not think that will be so or that insurance costs will be maintained even at their present level. The insurance companies have already said that.  If as a result of this legislation awards are reduced, the saving will go into company profits and will not be felt by the long suffering consumers either in reduced premiums or lower costs for getting insurance cover.</P>
    <P>This seems to be a simplistic approach to the problem of rising costs.  We have had various criticisms of the legal profession and as a solicitor I accept that there are many problems which could be dealt with readily in this respect without this legislation.  We would be far better disposed providing facilities for the public, for lawyers and court officials in our courts, and a review should be taking <Col N="432" /> place with this in mind.  I am sure officers of the Department would be more concerned to provide improved facilities than to abolish them.  The Bill may bring about a speeding up of litigation but all the facts in cases must be heard if they come up for hearing: there would have to be medical reports, further reports and time spent on the setting down of cases.  Many cases are settled out of court.  There has been a suggestion that if juries are abolished judges will be snowed under with extra work.  A review of the entire legal system and its outdated methods should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Another matter that puzzles me is the proposal to abolish juries in personal injury cases, which are the vast majority of cases for trial, but retaining them in defamation cases.  I do not know if the Minister told us why the distinction has been made.  Does this mean that we are to have one law for one group of people and another law for another group?</P>
    <P>What is clear is that the legal system is in need of review and everyone in this House and those involved in the legal system accept that fact.  I visited Dún Laoghaire courthouse last week: the premises does not have a public telephone; it has one toilet and consultations have to take place in the yard.  We must question if we have our priorities right.  That is why I say there is a clear need for a review and such review might even include the question of abolishing juries. However, I do not think the argument for abolishing juries can stand up on the basis that it will reduce insurance costs.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister responsible will keep an eye on the cost of insurance.  We know that because of the number of motor accidents and robberies insurance is very expensive but I do not think that abolishing juries will reduce the cost.  If the costs are stabilished I suppose something might be achieved but I do not know if even that will be done.  However, I will be very glad to be proved wrong on that point.  Perhaps the reduction in awards might be offset against the cost of premiums but I do not think that will happen.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that insurance of any <Col N="433" /> kind is very expensive but this Bill will not solve our problems.  Perhaps some awards have been excessive but, equally, others have been dramatically reduced. In addition, some of the largest awards have been given by judges and in some cases they have been appealed.  It is not enough to say that the abolition of juries will mean a dramatic reduction in costs.</P>
    <P>In some cases instead of a massive award being given, perhaps the needs of the person concerned could be ascertained under various headings, for instance, for medical expenses or for necessary alterations to his home.  Thereafter, perhaps the person could be given an income or a certain sum could be bonded and guaranteed in case of a change in circumstances. We all know that a person's medical condition can change after a number of years and the award given should take account of that fact. Obviously in serious cases no amount will compensate a person.  For instance, a young person of 20 years, probably good at games, who suffers an accident and is confined to a wheelchair will not regard any compensation, however large, as adequate.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for a review of the legal system.  I hope the Minister will come forward with basic proposals, and I also hope that the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society and those involved in the courts will come forward with their own proposals to improve the system.  There is a need to abolish some of the outmoded rituals existing today in order to bring the entire operation into line with the last years of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the approach being adopted here which I regard as too simplistic.  There are plenty of people who bash the lawyers and probably the lawyers are able to take it.  I do not mind constructive criticism but adopting a simplistic approach as a response to the problem is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to think again about this Bill.  Certainly he should commence the review and do something about facilities in courthouses.  I refer again to the conditions existing in Dún Laoghaire <Col N="434" /> courthouse, no public telephones, one toilet and consultations held in the yard. Doubtless other places in an even worse condition.  A review of the legal system is long overdue.  We have had committees to deal with other matters that possibly were less relevant and less important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been quite an amount of public argument about this matter for some time and I suppose it was inevitable that the Government eventually would address themselves to the question of claims for personal injuries so far as the jury system is concerned. It is fair to say there has been no demand from the general public for this change, that is to say, not from the public so far as it concerns the jury system <i>per se</i> but there has been a great demand from policy holders for reduced insurance costs.  The Government's response is rather a simplistic one in that they hope the removal of juries will be the panacea for all the ills of high insurance costs. However, they are misjudging the case in that regard.  The jury system may have an input so far as high insurance costs are concerned, but it is not the only factor.</P>
      <P>It is stretching it too far to expect us to believe that this one single aspect of the legal system so far as claims for personal injuries are concerned could be suddenly wiped out by this one simple adjustment. That is the not case.  The general public and policy holders generally were led to believe that if the jury system was abolished, as has happened in many other countries, insurance costs would be reduced.  Now that this Bill has been introduced their stance has altered.  We are being put on notice that, irrespective of what happens under this legislation, the general public and the policy holders cannot look forward to insurance premium reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for a greater degree of consistency in the assessment of damages. If that greater degree of consistency applied in the legal system it would speed up the system of awards and would be of considerable benefit to all sides of the argument.  The argument has been going on for many years and it appears that <Col N="435" /> even among the judges there is a diversity of opinion so far as the pros and cons of this business are concerned.</P>
    <P>It has to be stated quite clearly that the high levels of awards affect the level of settlements which take place outside the court.  A very small percentage of cases reach the High Court.  It is reckoned that about 4 per cent or 5 per cent of cases go to court, and that about 2 per cent end up before a jury.  It has to be remembered that it is the cases which eventually end up before the jury that set the norm for the practice of settling on the steps of the court.  The 95 per cent of cases which are settled out of court take their levels of compensation from the .2 per cent which go before the juries.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that of the .2 per cent, a number of the more serious cases are appealed to the Supreme Court. It is also interesting to note that in the period from 1980 to 1984, 316 awards of the High Court were subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.  The most interesting statistics as far as those appeals are concerned is that in twothirds of these cases the Supreme Court disagreed with the high levels of awards. This seems to indicate that in a substantial number of the .2 per cent of cases, the paymaster &mdash; in 95 per cent of the cases this was the insurance company &mdash; got a reduction of the original award.  It is that type of situation which had led to the unreliability and unpredictability of the system as we know it.</P>
    <P>In a case which has been widely publicised the High Court awarded £35,000 in damages.  This was appealed to the Supreme Court which referred it back to the High Court.  The second jury granted £192,000 which was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court who finally settled the matter at £108,000.  It is this up and down movement in the .2 per cent of the cases which were eventually judged by juries which caused the outcry against the unpredictability of the system.  It has always been difficult for insurers to estimate what their outstanding liabilities were.  That caused problems in preserving practices of insurance <Col N="436" /> companies and the solvency ratios they had to comply with in getting their licence from the regulatory body, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>One is at a loss to know whether this new departure will have the desired effect.  The Minister is adamant that it will improve the situation, but it appears that even the legal people are divided on the issue and representations are being made from barristers, solicitors, High Court Judges and all levels of discipline. It is a pity the legal profession could not have got their act together and made a recommendation one way or the other because that might have been of some advantage to the House.</P>
    <P>To my mind it is questionable whether the awards to which we have been accustomed to the High Court granting will be reduced from the levels now prevailing. At the same time I am satisfied that, if some method of consistency could be brought into the system, insurers and all litigants, plaintiffs in particular, making claims would have a better means of assessing the outcome of their claims. This would have the double advantage in that insurance would be able to estimate what their possible liability might be for the ensuing years following the date of claims being made, and plaintiffs would know what they could expect, which would not necessitate them getting involved in very expensive legal procedures. When all is said and done, the plaintiffs are always in the hands of the professionals so far as settling is concerned.  The plaintiff is generally a non-expert and is dependent on the advice tendered by the professional &mdash; always the legal profession. If a consistency could be brought into the whole procedure, it would have a great advantage for both sides of the argument.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a case on Second Stage but he was not very convincing to the people who have to bear the brunt of these costs, the insurance industry and the policy holders.  He was not convincing that anything substantial could be done, but he gave an undertaking that there would be close monitoring of the insurance industry following the introduction <Col N="437" /> of this legislation.  We heard that before particularly when emergency legislation was introduced to deal with the insurance companies over the past few years.  There was a lot of talk at that time about the need for the supervisory authority to be more active in their role of monitoring the insurance industry.  With that in mind a commitment was given to this House that actuarial staff would be brought into the Department.  Unless this happened in the last week, the two actuaries who were to have been employed have not yet been appointed.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he will take a closer look at all aspects of awards and the level of premium pricing by insurance companies following the experience of this legislation, but he does not have sufficiently experienced staff to deal with that matter.  There is no doubt that the increased number of staff in the supervisory sector of the Department is a welcome trend.  They have always been undermanned to my knowledge, and they were expected to supervise and monitor the activities of a £2 billion industry.  All they had were a few civil servants stretched to do their best and their main preoccupation on a year to year basis was to make sure the Blue Book was published on time.  That in itself is a fair piece of statistical analysis for any group of civil servants.</P>
    <P>Experienced actuarial staff in this section would have been a great help.  It is regrettable that just because the Minister is not prepared to pay the going rate he cannot recruit the people necessary to do the job for him.  I would like to think that he will forthwith appoint these people and pay whatever is necessary to do the job.  If he is not prepared to pay the going rate for actuarial staff I suggest that at least he take on actuarial consultancy staff and do it by that method, and that might not inflict as much pain on his colleague, the Minister for the Public Service, if he is breaching the guidelines for staff remuneration.  Something must be done there.  It gives no comfort to the people who are paying the excessive, exorbitant policy premium costs particularly in the commercial sector, to be told <Col N="438" /> that there will be close monitoring in future following this new arrangement of trial by judge alone.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the legal costs and the multiplicity of legal representatives who appear on both sides in cases of this kind and said that that would be examined critically in the context of the new arrangement.  Any time one hears language of that nature in a Minister's Second Stage speech one can be quite sure that the matter is heading for the top shelf and will be quickly and quietly forgotten, and that is all that can be assumed from what the Minister said on the occasion of the introduction of the Courts Bill, 1986.  Looking at things critically is not a response that one would have expected when he was going to the trouble of changing the whole system of juries.  It would have been preferable to this side of the House if he had decided to do other things also, and one of them would concern that very thing the Minister referred to &mdash; legal representation in court cases for personal injuries claims.</P>
    <P>Very high insurance premiums operate in this country and the variations on those premium costs are out of line with those of our competitors in Europe and the UK.  There are cases where we are so far out of line that premium costs here in certain classes of insurance can be three, four and five times higher than those of our competitors abroad.  It is just too simplistic to suggest that high premium costs can be attributed entirely to the jury award system alone.  Conflicting statements by interest groups have not helped in this regard.  Everybody assumed that substantial reductions would be possible if clear support was given to the abolition of the jury system.  It is not fair at this stage for interested parties to put down markers, irrespective of what monitoring or supervision of accounts the Minister becomes involved in through his Department, it will not result in any reduced costs to the hard-pressed policy holders.</P>
    <P>I must refer at this stage to other legislation following on immediately after this, that is, the Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Bill, 1986.  It seems like a <Col N="439" /> double think on the part of the Government and it is difficult to understand the rationale of their argument in trying to eliminate juries on one hand &mdash; they say that if the Courts Bill is passed it will stabilise rates of insurance and minimise the level of increases that might have to be borne by hard-pressed policy holders in future &mdash; while on the very same day, not a week, month or a year later, that we are discussing that prospect we are also going to consider the Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Bill which without a shadow of doubt will add significantly to the commercial property premium rates that will be applicable.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says that there will be a saving of possibly some £20 million by the adjustment of the malicious injuries legislation, only one other group can make up that difference and that must be the policy holders.  It will be claimed that the insurance companies will have to provide insurance cover to cater for these cases, but we all know full well that the insurance companies are in the business of being solvent and they are not going to hand a blank cheque of £20 million per year to anybody just for the sake of placating the Government in their intention. No, there is no question in the policy holders' minds or in the minds of business people, and it is stated specifically by the insurance industry that the Malicious Injuries Bill becomes law there will be a need for somebody to provide adequate cover for people who will find themselves in certain situations where they will face increased insurance premium costs, and that will lead to and escalation of costs in that sector.  It seems terribly out of focus that the Minister is trying to suggest in support of abolishing the jury system that there will be stabilisation of insurance premiums and subsequently he is going to penalise the very people who are hardest pressed by way of insurance premium costs, those people located in big urban areas, by removing the malicious injuries cover that they have enjoyed for so many years.  The Minister will be hard pressed in his summing up on this Bill to show. <Col N="440" /> good faith in the light of the conflict between those two items.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play when dealing with this Bill.  Perhaps the biggest single reason why he is prompted to introduce this legislation at this time is the escalating insurance cost applicable particularly to business, householders, motorists and the whole general area. Policy holders are in every single sector of the general insurance area, and that includes employer's liability, public liability, fire, theft and motor.  Every person who holds a policy in that area has had to take on board increased costs over the last few years.  Policy holders are unable and unwilling to pay premiums that are demanded by insurers and underwriters. That was not the case until a few short years ago.  Policy holders generally recognised that if they required proper cover they had to pay a reasonable cost for it, but matters have somehow gone out of control and now they are not able to meet the demands.  People are put in very difficult circumstances in providing proper cover for their property and goods.  People need more protection in every walk of life in the times we live in, and there is no question about that.  The need is greater every year for people to provide greater protection for themselves.</P>
    <P>It has been made very difficult for them because of the escalating costs of insurance. It is unacceptable that the insurance industry is unable or unwilling to provide the protection to which the policy holders feel they are entitled.  I would go as far as to say that it is a civil right for individuals and property owners to be covered at a reasonable cost by underwriters. One has property and goods and it must be accepted by all and sundry that it is not proper to price premium costs so high that it makes it impossible for classes of people in certain areas to provide cover for themselves.</P>
    <P>We would have to conclude that there is indisputable evidence of a crisis for many sectors seeking cover.  There is a lot of media comment in regard to the city centre with its no go and no insurance <Col N="441" /> areas.  We hear about hotels, not just one or two, but whole chains of hotels in various parts of the country in serious difficulty because of escalating insurance premiums being demanded of them.  Last week, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 10 June, an article stated that soaring public liability insurance premiums were pushing some hotels to the brink of closure.  That statement was made by the Irish Hotels Federation, a very competent body, who are very closely in touch with what is happening in the industry as a whole.  The article, by two well known correspondents, went on to say that hotel premiums have gone up by up to 500 per cent in the past year.  I cannot see what relationship there is between premium costs and the rate of inflation.  There has been no growth in the hotel sector over the last few years.  There are about 700 hotels in this country and half of them lost money last year.  That means they have no money for refurbishing, reinvestment or development.  Yet in that very difficult situation their prime insurance costs have increased by up to 500 per cent.  Any Government would find it hard to justify that increase for any sector and hope that the sector can survive.</P>
    <P>Of course, another element is referred to in that article which applies equally to many other sectors in so far as in many instances hotels find it impossible to obtain cover at any cost.  Indeed, a case was quoted where premiums have doubled in the past year, so much so that individuals and hoteliers have had to seek insurance cover abroad.  I regret that that should be the case, because if that becomes the pattern it will have a seriously damaging effect on the revenue of the insurance companies in this country, their premium total will be reduced and it will inevitably lead to difficulties within their own sphere of activities.  We do not want that either because the insurance industry is a fundamental part of our financial institutions and we must ensure its protection.</P>
    <P>There are very great difficulties in so far as building contractors are concerned in getting insurance cover.  The whole rural housing programme is in jeopardy <Col N="442" /> because local authorities are now obliged to check certificates of insurance before they can enter into a contract with a small contractor to build rural houses.  While many people in the House might not see the significance of that, I am sure that Minister Hegarty knows what I am talking about.  The rural housing scheme was one of the bulwarks in dealing with the housing problem throughout rural areas and now, because of the cost of insurance cover and because county councils are not entitled or able to enter into a contract with these people if they cannot provide an insurance certificate, many contracts have lapsed.  It is having a very serious effect on the construction industry in rural areas.  We all know of the insurance costs which householders have to bear and that the motoring sector has borne extremely high costs over a long period.  We must have the most expensive motoring in the world.  We pay the highest duty costs on new cars, the highest tax on petrol, the highest levels of insurance cover and we even have to pay for those who drive uninsured &mdash; now one in six of the total &mdash; which results in the Motor Insurance Bureau having to come to the aid of more and more people each year.  The outstanding claims can amount to £80 million.  Who will pay for that?  It will be existing policyholders eventually.</P>
    <P>There have been many debates in this House as to what might be done to reduce the cost of motor insurance, but sweet nothing has been done by the Minister. On prodding from this side of the House two years ago, the Minister took on board one of the recommendations from the McLiam report that an insurance disc should be displayed from 1 July on every single insured car.  I sought information as to its size and colour and the information it would give, but I am still waiting for it.  However, from 1 July this year I take it that the insurance disc will become effective and that we will know which cars are covered.  Perhaps it will go some way towards reducing the number of uninsured motorists.  Methinks we have a long way to go before motor insurance is reduced to a reasonable amount by <Col N="443" /> international standards.  There are too many claims from a claims conscious society and some of the awards can be very costly.</P>
    <P>It is not just a matter for the insurance companies to come to the rescue and to provide us with cheaper insurance. There is more at stake than that.  There are three groups involved, the Government, the insurers and the community. The parameters necessary to bring about a better situation in this regard have been outlined in many reports over the years, more recently and more succinctly in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses.  They did a very good critical analysis of the problem that exist not just for small businesses but for business generally as far as insurance costs are concerned.  It is a pity the report did not find its way into the debate here in the House.  Perhaps before the end of the year it might, if the Government are still around to provide us with a debate of any kind.  It would be beneficial because it clearly indicates some of the areas where the Government could help in bringing about a situation where insurance costs might be reduced.  It certainly is critical of Government action to date and about insurers.  It can be fairly stated that the community at large have something to do as well.</P>
    <P>If all these elements which have been dealt with quite well in that report could be brought together, the general public might be able to look forward at last not just to a stabilisation of insurance costs but a reduction in them.  However, there has been no concerted effort to deal collectively with the problem and that is our biggest complaint with the legislation.  It is piecemeal.  It is just doing something to accommodate a particular element of the problem, whereas there was so much to be done that could have been incorporated in it.  There could also have been a commitment to introduce other legislation which would have helped to bring about the stabilisation we are all talking about.</P>
    <P>Piecemeal legislation is never really effective and we have seen that proved <Col N="444" /> on more than one occasion in the past.  It will simply prolong the frustrations of the various sections that have so much difficulty in this area.  It will certainly heighten tensions in the market place. We take it it is guaranteed that by the very force and weight of marching feet this legislation will be passed.  So we are facing up to the fact that there will be no jury system following the termination date to be announced by the Minister. But when we have a chance of gaining some experience of what the new situation brings about, if the stabilisation does not become a reality, if insurance premiums continue to escalate at anything like the rate they have been doing in the past few years, then we will have to come to the unhappy conclusion that this change was a waste of time and did not bring about the response we so urgently needed.</P>
    <P>The problem of high premiums is not insurmountable.  One of the most important aspects we have to address is to reduce the number of claims.  If we could reduce the number of uninsured motorists on our roads it would go a long way to reducing the number of accidents and the number of claims for personal damages coming before the courts, and this would bring about a reasonable reduction in car insurance premiums.  One only has to look at the number of uninsured motorists here to get some idea of how far out of line we are.  One in five or one in six motorists here is uninsured.  In the UK where the level of insurance premium is much lower the average of uninsured motorists is only 9 per cent.  The average in Continental Europe is only about 4 per cent of all motorists.  We are no better or worse in a lot of things than our counterparts in the UK and in Continental Europe.  So there must be some basic fundamental reason that other countries can maintain their level of uninsured motorists in single percentage figures while we have 20 to 25 per cent on average.</P>
    <P>It must be related in some way to insurance premium costs.  If that is the case then something drastic must be done. The legislation might go some way along <Col N="445" /> that road but it will certainly not address the problem we have at this time.  Those ininsured motorists also get involved in accidents and quite a number are involved in serious accidents resulting in considerable claims through the courts. Motor and personal accident claims account for a very large percentage of all cases that go to court and if one goes by those reported in the newspapers many are involved in the .2 per cent of all cases that eventually go on to juries.</P>
    <P>The average cost of those claims for uninsured motorists each year is about £9 million.  That has to be taken up by the Motor Insurance Bureau which is contributed to on a <i>pro rata</i> basis by the individual insurance companies involved each year and that outstanding money has to be met by the insurance company who pass the costs on to their policy holders. So, in effect, it is just one big vicious circle.  The jury system might be part of it but the whole uninsured area is probably a larger part of it.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that in tandem with what is being done here now the Minister could not have found some new way of dealing with uninsured motorists.  I would make one suggestion in that regard.  Perhaps it is time we synchronised the registration of cars with the insurance cover given by the various under-writers.  All of these matters are now computerised.  If one is in Belmullet town at the far end of my constituency and is detained by the Garda it is possible, inside two minutes, to have a run-down on the registration of one's car through the centralised computering service of the Garda.  I do not see why the insurance companies should not make their computerised system available to a central computer to match up the registration with the insurance cover.  Then it would be very easy to eliminate a lot of those who seem to think they can go along the roads of Ireland unhindered, uninsured and end up in an accident and have the rest of us pay for it.</P>
    <P>The number of claims on all fronts as far as general insurance is concerned needs to be reduced.  There must be a more realistic approach to risk management in this country.  We must provide <Col N="446" /> the incentive through policy variations, recognising the good employer, the good industrialist and the good businessman in the area of safety and security.  Not enough attention is paid to that aspect of insurance cover.  I presume it is the under-writers who will inevitably have to provide the educational process for the various sections, to point out to them how they can better secure their properties and better make safe the workplaces for their employees.  There is sufficient legislation available under the Factories Acts, but that is not always complied with.  If it could be established, by a process initiated by the insurers, that there would be a benefit from complying with all the existing regulations, taking no shortcuts, making sure that properties are really secure and that machinery and the workplace are safe and secure for employees, I am satisfied that there would be a considerable reduction in the number of personal accidents.  It is those accidents which cause the greatest trauma to the individual, the greatest hardship to the families involved, the greatest difficulties to employers by absenteeism and absence from work due to disability and sickness and the greatest cost outlay to the insurers.  All those things could be undertaken.</P>
    <P>It would be important to alert individuals and businesses to the need for better standards.  How often do we hear about shortcuts being taken in so far as standards of safety in places of work are concerned?  There is no doubt that a vast number of personal accident cases in the workplace come from carelessness and sloppy standards.  If employers were properly approached by the insurance people on the terms that if they complied with the highest standards and had a good record they would benefit by reduced premium costs, that would certainly improve the position as far as personal injury claims are concerned.  Making it worth-while for individuals and businesses to comply with all the regulations and statutes in existence with regard to standards and safety would have a beneficial effect. <Col N="447" /> There is always a price tag on responsibility. Insurers should sweeten the premium load for the good policyholder who is making a conscious effort to improve his standards.  Those who are reluctant to comply or unwilling to co-operate on the question of improved standards of safety should be penalised.  It should be clear that it is not satisfactory that their negligence or irresponsibility will make it more expensive for everybody else.  If they are not complying with the existing regulations, they are acting illegally and irresponsibly.</P>
    <P>There should be works committees in many of the places of major employment to keep an eye on these matters for management and report where standards are being reduced or shortcuts taken.  To encourage employers to invest in time and money on providing better standards of security and safety in the workplace the policy premium should be sweetend. Making the premium lighter must be an incentive which would bring about a reduction in the number of personal injuries that take place in our factories and places of high employment content. If you reduce the number of accidents, you reduce the number of claims, you reduce the workload on the High Court and the premium cost to individuals and businesses alike.</P>
    <P>Insurers could find some way to perfect their monitoring system in this area also. There is not much point in providing a sweetening of the policy premium price if one is not going to follow it up by the right kind of inspectorate.  If the State, for reasons best known to themselves, cannot provide this inspectorate, perhaps there is a case to be made for suggesting to the insurers that they have a closer look as to how those to whom they are quoting premium costs are complying with existing regulations and with the incentive packages that I should like to see recommended by them.  That would be a very great help to the insurance people generally and to the policyholders.</P>
    <P>We cannot overstate the importance of liability insurance for our industry.  The <Col N="448" /> bold facts are that Irish industry labours under very high insurance premium costs. This has resulted in a loss of competitiveness over the years.  There is a general acceptance by industry and by underwriters that the burden of insurance cover must and should be reduced now.  The secret is how to achieve this, considering the pattern of losses which have been recorded in the area of general insurance over the past number of years.  These losses started some time in the early sixties and have continued apace since.  It is interesting to note statistics to put it in perspective.  Between 1981 and 1983 in the area of general insurance losses the amount was about £210 million.  It has been averaging somewhere around £100 million per year since and most of the loss has been in the motor and liability accounts.</P>
    <P>Employers' liability and public liability losses have been staggering and there has been a steady increase in those losses over the years.  The situation must be faced that the losses are far in excess of the premium level in so far as employers' liability and public liability are concerned. It has been stated to be perhaps 150 per cent plus as against premium level.  No business could stay solvent with losses of that magnitude outstripping premium level, so there is a crisis to be faced. Whether this legislation is the vehicle to do that cannot be stated yet.  Certainly markers have been put down from all sides of the House that in isolation this legislation will not properly and finally address the crisis in general insurance practice in this country.</P>
    <P>Employer's liability is of particular concern.  Its cost to industry is fundamental because we would all like to see the question of employers' liability being mandatory on industry, but it is not.  One does not legally have to have employers' liability in this country.  I have been asking that it should be considered actively because it is necessary for employers to have that cover to protect themselves. It is also necessary for their employees. The costs are astronomical.  Employers say that they cannot afford it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The basis for the Minister's argument was that the insurance industry was demanding that this take place so that it would help to reduce and stabilise insurance premium costs.  There is no other reason put forward by the Minister in support of this legislation except the effect that this has been having on the insurance industry and the level of personal injuries claims made against insurance companies.  I take the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's point, but this is a fundamental aspect of it and has to be addressed.  If there were no uninsured drivers, if the level was at the average European level, if we had the number and cost of claims against insurance companies seriously reduced, then this legislation would not be before us today.  Why throw out an administrative and legal practice that has served the country well in the interests of fair play and justice for so many years unless there was a very strong argument to do so?  The strength <Col N="450" /> of the Minister's argument came from the number and the cost of the existing claims being made and being paid for by insurance companies for personal injuries.</P>
      <P>Employers' liability cost manufacturing industry £70 million last year.  That was up between 30 per cent and 50 per cent on the previous year.  That works out at almost £1,000 per annum per employee, which now has to be paid in heavy manufacturing.  Imagine the impact that has had on the whole area of our competitiveness in manufacturing industry.  What a shame that that is so. The reason it is so is that the insurance companies, in order to maintain their solvency and to meet claims for personal accidents which are placed on them, have had to increase their demands from policy holders each year by very substantial amounts.  Had they not to do that, that money could have been used for increased output, reinvestment in industry and job creation in industry.  It would be preferable to have that £70 million, or a portion of it, operating in that area rather than having it diverted to insurance costs because of demands being made by the industry.  The implication for employment is quite serious.  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will appreciate that more than anybody else. We have very staggering unemployment levels at present.  Anything that could be done to release money that has to be paid in high premiums to defray the costs of personal accident claims that go to the High Court would be welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of premiums is always related to the potential claims.  If these are too numerous and too high then there will be an inexorable rise in premium costs.  That has a major impact on our position.  We are always talking about our free trade environment and the fact that we have to compete in an open economy.  We have to maintain our competitiveness or we will not survive as a major exporting country.  Our competitors operate in a different insurance cost and claims environment.  They operate in a much lower cost environment than we do. Some people operate without any insurance cover.  While that can be attractive <Col N="451" /> in the short term, it is self-evident what the consequences of it might be.  A good example of it is the number and the cost of personal injury claims in the motor sector.  If we were to transport that into the general area and if one in every five or six employers, because he could not stay competitive and keep his doors open because of high insurance costs, decided to go it alone and carry the risk himself, it would not matter because the limited liability status would see him out.</P>
    <P>Think of the damage it would do to the whole fabric of the insurance industry through loss of premium income.  Think of the damage it would do to their reserving capacity and their solvency ratios. Think of the damage that would ensure if individuals involved in personal injuries had no place to take their claims.  Would we then be involved in another enormous compensation fund that would have to be met by subscriptions from the insurers and underwriters collectively?  That only means one thing, as it does in regard to the Motor Insurance Bureau.  It means that those who are able to pay have their premiums increased still further to pay for those who are irresponsible and do not take the necessary precautions. The insurance industry must play a more compelling role in keeping costs competitive.  They can certainly have a major input into the role of safety in the workplace.</P>
    <P>The history of the level of premium costs has been quite erratic, to say the least.  The attitudes of underwriters in the past have also been quite erratic.  That is also referred to in the Minister's speech in so far as EC directives are concerned. It leaves something to be desired regarding the whole question of underwriting. The freedom of establishment regulations have been in force for some time. This means that foreign insurers in the marketplace can come in here and set up office, but they have to comply with the licence granted to them by the supervisory authority, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When that become operable foreign insurers came into this <Col N="452" /> market.  Perhaps this is one of the ingredients which led to the whole problem of rising costs in so far as settlement of High Court cases are concerned.  When that directive became operable foreign insurers came into Ireland and the cut price premium war started and lasted until the early eighties.</P>
    <P>Market share was the only criterion amongst the battling premium protagonists. Quite a number of foreign insurers moved in since the directive was implemented in 1976 when the barriers preventing entry into Ireland of non-life insurers became operable.  About 12 licences were granted.  These were new entrants to the Irish market.  That represented almost a 60 per cent increase in the number of companies operating.  They came in from all over the world.  What a scene ensured.  There was a cut price premium war which was relentless until in the end it broke the backs of some of those involved.  Foreign insurers and indigenous companies which had been there previously made huge losses.  These are the losses we are talking about now. As a result, many of these companies had to withdraw.</P>
    <P>We know what happened to two large un-named companies in the Irish insurance general sector as a consequence of the punishing premium battle which went on in the late seventies and up until 1982. Those two large Irish company collapses had a very big impact on all we are talking about this evening.  The resultant uncertainty is still being felt.  The taxpayer has been feeling the pinch and will do so for the next 25 years.  If that is to go on for the next 25 years the result of the insurance company getting to grips with themselves in that price war in the late seventies will have to be paid for for many years.</P>
    <P>It placed the solvency of many financial institutions at risk at that time.  That is accepted by the Minister, the insurers and financial institutions alike.  It generally made a mess of the stabilised premium price fixing mechanism which was in existence before the directive became operable.  Some of these companies have now gone and we get back to the survivors <Col N="453" /> who stayed on following the price war. Many had to leave because of the losses they sustained.  Maybe the result of dispatching some of the outside competition was achieved, but at what cost?  A viable and solvent insurance industry is essential to this country and is essential to the ordinary development of Irish business. Every effort must be made to restore business confidence in the industry because it is undermined at present.  The basic reason why it is undermined is the high level of insurance costs for policyholders.</P>
    <P>If that solvency is achieved by penalising policyholders with increased costs, then both sides will be the losers.  Market share will be lost to the insurers and we will have the inexorable rises in premium costs.  We will have job losses not just in businesses but also in the insurance industry.  That must be avoided.  We do not want a return to the price premium war which went on after the freedom of establishment regulations became operable in 1976.  This Bill would not have to be introduced if that directive never became operable.  I am satisfied about that.  We had a good stabilised insurance industry at that time with reasonable costs.  They were able to meet their solvency margins.  Their losses were minimal.</P>
    <P>In effect, everybody was satisfied with the legal system of justice which existed in the country.  It is only since these losses began to escalate out of control that it became necessary to do something to salvage the situation.  People latched on to the idea that the jury system was one of the elements which was leading to the high costs.  I accept there is some justification for that argument.  It is not the only dimension but it is a part of it.  It has yet to be established beyond yea or nay whether it will have the desired result.</P>
    <P>Following the price premium war which took place for a number of years, the freedom of services directive has come on stream.  In that circumstance, service will be provided by insurers who do not necessarily have to have any office in this country.  They will not have to maintain their premium income here <Col N="454" /> which will cause a major upheaval in cash flow as far as the Government are concerned. That will be a great challenge for the insurance industry.  They will then have to compete on unequal terms with major international companies who will be writing insurance from offices abroad while only maintaining a computer terminal in this country.  This will have a devastating effect on the insurance industry.  There is no doubt that the unions representing the insurance workers and the financial institutions are very concerned about this.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, following much prodding by me over the past year, seeking a derogation for this country so that the Irish insurance industry will not be punished further until such time as they can get their act together in so far as new technology is concerned.  Cost effectiveness by the industry by way of new technology is absolutely essential.  We will also have to get rid of and eliminate wasteful practices in the industry.  These will have to be examined very carefully if the domestic market share is to be maintained by the indigenous Irish companies. If the insurance industry falters, we will not be able to be accommodated by a change in the jury system.  Something else entirely will then have to happen.  It would be entirely inappropriate to have the major share of Irish insurance costs and business being undertaken and underwritten by companies that do not have a presence in and a commitment to this country.</P>
    <P>The investment income general insurance in particular generates is vital to Government borrowings and the money market.  I do not think it is generally understood what the freedom of services directive will mean when it is finally introduced. It is due for implementation in national legislation in 1988.  I am asking the Minister again if he will seek the derogation necessary to give us at least five years before it becomes operable. Even that will make it a difficult scene. This has been recognised by the insurers themselves.  Only the best will survive.  I would like to think that sufficient space <Col N="455" /> will be given to all insurers so that they can all survive in the best interests of an industry which has served this country well.</P>
    <P>Because of the price war they were involved in over the years and because of the escalating difficulties in the area of crime and vandalism and the other related matters, the whole thing has become untenable.  Hopefully, once this legislation is implemented it will go someway to redress the situation.  There may be a <i>prima facie</i> case to do something about it in that area.  There is nothing established as yet which will guarantee what was promised in the past &mdash; that a reduction in policy holders' premium costs will take place in the foreseeable future.  The reverse would seem to be the trend of the public statements being made by people involved in this area at this time.</P>
    <P>We must consider another aspect which was dealt with by the joint committee that examined the high premiums because of personal injury claims in the High Court and whose report was published some little time ago.  There was particular reference in that report to the levels of crime and vandalism.  We have to place on record here that the present level of crime and vandalism is unacceptable to our people.  It would appear that the increase in that crime level has gone unchecked.  It is a major factor in the increased losses of underwriters in the insurance industry.  It is also one of the reasons the Minister says this Bill is necessary and it also constitutes one of the factors for increased business costs.</P>
    <P>There is one set of statistics that demonstrates this fact more clearly than anything else.  These are the 1984 figures, which are worth repeating here.  The 1984 figures for robbery and aggravated burglary show that the numbers involved were 3,007, representing an increase over the previous ten years of 165 per cent. The number of burglaries in the year 1984 was 35,228, representing an increase of 86 per cent over the previous ten years. The number of incidents of arson and malicious damages in 1984 was 2,655, <Col N="456" /> representing an increase over the previous ten years of 163 per cent.  Surely those increased percentages demonstrate that we are becoming a lawless society? The implications for insurance and its costs are self-evident, because it is the insurance industry that must meet all of those claims.  When one adds the personal injury cases on the motoring side, employers' and public liability cover, fire and theft, the whole area of general insuranc, one arrives at a staggering total, a problem that has not been addressed satisfactorily by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>Reading some of the debates in the course of this type of legislation and the malicious injuries legislation back in 1980 one sees there was clear recognition at that time that something must be done to get to grips with the level of crime and vandalism then obtaining.  At that time the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Michael Keating, was very loud and antagonistic toward Deputy Séan Doherty, Minister of State on that occasion.  I can still visualise Deputy Keating here waxing eloquent on how the Government had failed to address the level of crime and vandalism in this city and the country generally.  But that was only a tea party compared with the levels of crime and vandalism we have now.  If it was justifiable to make those kinds of references at that time how much more justifiable is it for me to be very critical of the Government for not having made efforts to address this difficult problem? It is regrettable that the Government seek to delude the public that the crime wave is under control.  I would suggest that it is not quite fair of them either to suggest that the provision of this Bill will somehow provide a panacea for all of the ills in so far as costs in this area are concerned.  There are now no-go insurance areas increasing in number.  There have been business closures in this city because individuals were not prepared to continue in business because of fear for their own safety or for that of their stock and property.  Therefore, they decided to move out, closing down altogether.  I do not believe that to be in anybody's best <Col N="457" /> interest and I say that, even as a rural Deputy.  I like to see our capital city as a thriving community, a thriving business, because that is what a capital city is supposed to be &mdash; the hub of society and of business activity.</P>
    <P>The number of representations I receive from agencies, individuals, communities and associations in business in this city and other large centres concerning escalating insurance costs, damages and claims no longer represents just a trickle.  What answer can one give them? Somebody must accept that a problem has been identified and that something needs to be done about it.  I contend that a major portion of the blame must be laid at the Government's door.  They are the people who should control this by way of legislation and enforcement agencies. There have been many business closures with huge job losses in many city areas. Equally there has been a rise in the protection rackets.  We had a debate about it when nobody on the Government side seemed prepared to accept that it was an escalating problem, or indeed that it constitued a problem at all.  Yet RTE had a special programme on the subject, interviewing people, putting it beyond doubt that there is a problem of that nature obtaining in the city.  I am contending that it is becoming an increasingly difficult one.  When something like that gets a grip on an area it does not become merely a no-go area, it becomes a no-insurance area, with claims escalating and, consequently, the costs of general insurance escalating.</P>
    <P>There is a reluctance to face up to the crisis.  The problem has been sufficiently identified.  That was accepted by the Minister in his introductory remarks on Second Stage.  The public do not want further identification of the problem. What they now want to know is: what action will be taken by the Government in the restoration of law and order in this city and others throughout the country? If the Minister could give a solemn undertaking that he accepted the level of the problem and was prepared to do something about it, he would have the support of all sides of this House.  It should be <Col N="458" /> remembered that it would be in our best interests, not merely to have a free and easy society for ourselves and those citizens we represent, but it would also result in reduced costs and overheads for the business community, with a better climate for business competitiveness. People in the insurance industry would be much happier.  They are under considerable pressure at present.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry are beleaguered by the number of people critical of the way they are conducting their business. Something should be done by the Government to restore some semblance of law and order to our streets, which would result in reduced insurance premium costs and a much improved, settled position <i>vis-à-vis</i> insurance competitiveness. Despite the best efforts of business in the area of security, the crime wave continues to grow.  Businesses in the high crime areas have suffered substantial losses and feel undefended by the law enforcement agencies and hard done by underwriters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in support of the amendment proposed by the Government. One of the basic points is that the Government faced an appalling situation when they came into office three and a half years ago.  Fianna Fáil had been in Government for between five and six years and the economy was in a mess.  The problems our Government faced were frightening in the extreme.  A serious recession was facing us as a nation, brought about by the reckless manner in which the economy had been handled by the Fianna Fáil Government, particularly in the period 1977 to 1981.  They did not simply allow the economy to drift but through their mismanagement it was in turmoil.  Unemployment was rising rapidly, particularly in the period 1979 to 1981.  Inflation was rampant and there were serious doubts among economists <Col N="460" /> about the extensive borrowings undertaken by Fianna Fáil.  We as a Government had to tackle those enormous problems.</P>
      <P>One of the great economic successes of this Government's term of office has been the huge reduction in the rate of inflation.  In folk memory the mid-seventies and early eighties will be remembered as the years of inflation.  These were years of instability and uncertainty.  Those on fixed incomes faced damaging cuts in their real income each year.  For those on wages and salaries these years will be remembered for the constant spiral in wages and inflation as those at work tried to maintain their real income.  One of the main problems the Government inherited was raging inflation and the accompanying problems.  Chief among the tasks facing the Government was that of restoring our international competitiveness which had deteriorated alarmingly in previous years.  At the beginning of this decade our inflation rate was about 20 per cent, which was alarming in itself, but particularly damaging was the fact that inflation here was twice the average among our trading partners in the industrialised world and far above the level in the United Kingdom, who are still our main trading partners.  As earnings strove to keep pace with inflation, nominal wages were also rising by more than 20 per cent each year, leading to a serious erosion of competitiveness at home and abroad.  This added to the task we faced in maintaining the level of employment in the face of a deepening world recession, particularly in our traditional industries which were exposed to fierce international pressures.  As a major priority, the Government faced up to the task of repairing the damage to our international competitiveness by bringing cost and price increases into with those of our competitors.  This was no easy task, given the many other difficulties we faced, especially in relation to the public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a startling contrast between that period only four short years ago and the situation we face today.  By last year <Col N="461" /> our inflation rate had fallen to 5.5 per cent, which was actually lower than the inflation rate in the United Kingdom and well in line with the EC average.  It is my guess that when figures are next issued they will reveal an inflation rate of between 4 and 4.5 per cent.  The rate is dropping all the time.  The rate of increase in manufacturing earnings, which was over 20 per cent at the start of the decade, is now down to 7 per cent.  This compares with 9 per cent in the UK, so helping to improve our competitive position against UK producers.</P>
    <P>The decline in inflation has not yet reached bottom.  As the full effects of the fall in oil prices and the weakening of sterling and the dollar work their way through into domestic prices and costs, inflation will continue its downward trend.  In the second half of this year inflation could be less than 2 per cent and by the end of next year it could be zero. Some people will say that inflation is falling in other countries and I accept that this is correct, but the important factor from our point of view is that our position relative to other countries has improved significantly.  It will continue to improve in the future.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we take this opportunity to strengthen competitiveness, which means in essence holding on to existing jobs and creating new jobs.  The Government are making every effort to maintain current employment and create extra employment.  We can do this by ensuring that increases in wages and salaries reflect the reality of falling inflation. Most of the reputable economic commentators believe that inflation will fall to very low levels which we have not witnessed in Ireland or Europe in the past two decades.  This means that wage bargains in the coming year must take account of dropping inflation rates.  We have not yet seen the full benefits of the drop in inflation rates.</P>
    <P>The fall in inflation is only one indication of the turnaround in the economy which has taken place.  Growth averaged over 3 per cent in the past two years. There is every indication that this year the growth in the economy will again <Col N="462" /> reach or exceed this level.  It is worth bearing in mind that the rate of real GDP growth between 1984 and 1986 was faster in Ireland than in other EC counties. That is a sign that our economy is on a path of steady growth brought about by Government policies.</P>
    <P>It has been argued by commentators that the growth that is taking place is largely based on an increase in exports rather than a rise in domestic demand.  It is vital that our export market should expand to develop our industrial base. We must find new markets for our products. However, last year in addition to a major growth in exports we experienced a pick-up in home consumption for the first time in several years.  Progress continued this year and already retail sales are up on last year.  I understand that in the first quarter they were up by more than 3 per cent on last year's figure.  Retail sales increased each month in the past ten months.  Domestic demand will be boosted further by an improvement in consumer confidence and a rise in real incomes as inflation falls.</P>
    <P>The income tax reliefs in the 1986 budget have boosted real incomes and that should help to improve consumer demand.  The recent fall in interest rates will help to maintain and improve demand this year.  Those indicators suggest that the economy is emerging from its difficulties.  The past five years have been very difficult for the economy.  The Government could have adopted the easy and popular way out; they could have turned their backs on the problems which threatened the stability of our economy. Instead, the Government chose the more difficult and more unpopular road and faced up to these problems.  It is my view, and that of many economic commentators, that those policies will bear fruit. Our economy is able to take advantage of the upturn on the international scene.</P>
    <P>Where would we be now if the policies of promise of the Opposition were adopted? It is depressing that the policies which served the country so badly in the late seventies and early eighties have been revived by Fianna Fáil.  Most informed economic commentators are aware <Col N="463" /> that those policies will lead us not just into a blind alley but within a short time to economic ruin.  The Government have adopted the correct approach and whether or not Deputy Flynn thinks otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our amendment details the radical policy changes required if we are to reduce unemployment and create an industrial base that will increase jobs and it sets out the changes necessary in the collection of taxes.  The motion and the Government's amendment do not make any proposals in regard to those topics.  Unemployment is the principal issue the House should be dealing with.  It is in the background of <Col N="464" /> everything we do and we must work to provide solutions to that problem.  It is interesting to note that there were more people out of work when Fianna Fáil went out of office than there were when they took office.  In the case of every Government since 1973 workers were paying more in taxes at the end of their term of office than they were when they were elected.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party believe that full employment is attainable and we have made proposals in regard to that.  The projections for the economy are for a boom period but those who are predicting boom tell us that unemployment will continue to grow, that the boom will bring more money to certain people but it will not bring more jobs.  That is the flaw in the Government's policies.  They are relying on boom as a result of international factors but they do not have a policy to benefit from them.  At least 17 per cent of our workforce are unemployed. Unemployment is higher than 17 per cent in certain areas and the level of poverty has increased enormously.  The figure for those on or below the poverty line is one million people, one-third of our population.  Unemployment is one of the major causes of poverty which is widespread in my constituency.</P>
      <P>In regard to the current debate on divorce any person with an eye to see can see that unemployment and poverty in the home are the major causes of conflict within families and result in marriage breakdown.  It may be the unemployment of the parents or the children or the lack of hope by schoolchildren of getting a job.  Conflict in the home resulting from unemployment leads to marital breakdown on a wide scale but many people refuse to recognise that.  Some of those who are opposed to divorce legislation may be the cause of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a document entitled &ldquo;End to Crisis&rdquo; issued three years ago, we made the point that Coalition and Fianna Fáil policies in regard to unemployment were to throw money at private enterprise in the hope that jobs would result.  The belief was that the way to make the climate right for private enterprise was to have money <Col N="465" /> pouring out in the form of grants, subsidies and tax reliefs.  It was felt that if this was done private enterprise would provide jobs, but that is not a solution; it is a waste of money.  They are what we call spending policies.</P>
    <P>We have made an argument for production policies.  If we had production policies we would have economic planning and an investment policy.  If we had a system under which private enterprise in order to get grants had to meet production targets or produce a production plan, then there would be some meaning to the spending policies of the Government. Without investment and economic planning, and unless we concentrate on the development of industries based on our own natural resources and the productive State sector, the Government will not make any progress.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, can we expect that a Fianna Fáil Government would alter the policies they radically pursued during the past 60 years?  Nothing else will do, but where is the evidence of such a radical alteration?  It was Fianna Fáil who destroyed a growing food processing industry which had been developed by the State sector.  Would Fianna Fáil alter their tax policies?  I do not believe there is any evidence that they would.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, recognising the appalling seriousness of the unemployment situation and of the resurgence of emigration and the connected problems of excessive personal taxation and excessive public expenditure, calls on the Government and on all political parties to signify their determination to reduce public expenditure over the next four years by such amount as would enable a standard income tax rate of 25 per cent to be achieved by that time, in order that an economic climate might be created in the country which will restore an <Col N="466" /> incentive to work, to invest, to take risks and to employ.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the five minutes at my disposal I can only barely touch on the matters being discussed.  As our amendment makes clear, we feel that the core of the problems which this motion and the amendments discuss lies in the level of public expenditure which, in turn, is responsible for a penal level of taxation which, in turn, is responsible for a climate here in which there is no incentive to work, to invest, to take risks or to employ anybody. Consequently, we see large numbers of our people departing for good every day.  Unless the Government of the day and all political parties are prepared to agree on the necessity to address the whole public expenditure question, we will never break out of the vicious circle that exists today.  Unfortunately, I see no evidence that we will.</P>
    <P>I must comment on the use of Private Members' time from which we, as a party, are excluded, and the motions proposed here by Fianna Fáil in the last three weeks.  In successive weeks they called for increased expenditure on education, agriculture and health.  I have no doubt that in the coming weeks increased expenditure will be called for, too, on items they have in mind.</P>
    <P>This party, therefore, and anybody in Ireland in touch with reality, face an unreal choice in being asked to choose between Government policy, which most assuredly we have no wish to follow because nothing has been proved to be more unsuccessful over the past three and a half years than the economic policies of the Government, proof of which is in the unemployment and emigration figures, and the Fianna Fáil policy of being all things to all men and promising this, that and the other to everyone and anyone who will listen.  It is a sad reflection on our time and on the political straitjacket and paralysis in which most of this House is gripped that on the same day a couple of weeks ago the Leader of one of the major political parties was opening Knock Airport and the Leader of the other major party was bailing out <Col N="467" /> Bewley's bun shop.  While that attitude remains prominent throughout the generality of political representation here, we are in for a very serious time.</P>
    <P>They are the problems we have to face, and in the context of Irish politics as practised these days we will not achieve the sort of cuts in public expenditure which are the key to success in the taxation and employment results we would like to see.  There must be widespread agreement on that.  This party is the only one preaching that doctrine, and I would like all other parties to indicate that they also accept that this is the key, that it is something that must be agreed between all of us in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Emigration is now a key instrument of the Government's discredited policy.  Since they came to office more than 100,000 have been forced to emigrate permanently because of lack of any employment opportunities at home.  The actual figure for unemployment would be 300,000 were it not for this mass outflow of our people.  The most alarming aspect of our emigration trend is its particular focus on our young people, who have abandoned all hope of employment in their own country.  Very highly qualified and educated people are being forced to apply their knowledge and energy outside their own country at great cost to our economic well-being and to our future potential.  With their qualifications in technology, marketing, engineering and management they should be making a major contribution to our economy through the added value of their knowledge and skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will say to Deputy O'Malley that Fianna Fáil always, not just today, in periods in which we both served in Government together, made education a key element in our economic development programmes.  The decisions to locate the Institute of Higher Education in Limerick and to promote the capacity to exploit the opportunities in this era of technology, were collective decisions of Fianna Fáil Governments on the informed basis that the guarantee for <Col N="468" /> economic development always must be laid firmly on the application of knowledge. We do not always have to talk about the Japanese, but we might note the fact that 50 per cent of first time employees in Japan have third level qualifications or the equivalent.  Yet we wonder why Japan is the economic leader in the world.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will never apologise to any Member here, much less Deputy O'Malley, for pursuing, as we always have done, the need for expenditure on education and agriculture.  Instead of applying the knowledge which these young people who have been forced to emigrate possess, to the benefit of the whole community, the Government content themselves with providing short term schemes which are no substitute for constant employment. The Minister now in the House presided in the Department of Labour over the biggest growth area in the current budget.  The growth in Department of Labour current expenditure was in the order of 66 per cent in one year over previous years, yet the Government pretend that they ar engagaged in controlling public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil would switch that kind of expenditure to education for permanent employment as distinct from short term schemes for temporary relief which have proved to be not only ineffective but totally frustrating for the young people involved.  The Youth Employment Agency report published today &mdash; the YEA are a creature of the Department of Labour &mdash; indicates clearly that the future is very bleak for young people, particularly those who have been unemployed for more than one year.  The trouble is that at least 20,000 young people currently unemployed have been out of work for more than two years.</P>
    <P>Here we have a statement from a Government a agency saying that the future is very bleak for those young people.  The number of those young people unemployed represents a five fold increase on the numbers of young people unemployed when this helpless, hopeless Government came to office.  The Government have failed totally to honour their <Col N="469" /> commitment to reduce the numbers unemployed.  They are now relying on emigration, 100,000 to keep the live register numbers down.  They have introduced these schemes to give the impression that the numbers out of work are much fewer than we all know them to be. This Government have failed totally to honour their own commitments to reduce the level of unemployment and taxation and it is not surprising the public have lost confidence in them.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, other parties in this House pay more attention to opinion polls than do Fianna Fáil.  Therefore, I commend to them the findings of the latest opinion poll that are consistent with all the others.  They show that 68 per cent of the people now want a change of Government.  This motion offers an opportunity to all political parties here to recognise the disastrous failure of the Government and the wish of the public to terminate their period in office as soon as possible.  Tomorrow is a day later than the public wish that to be done.  This has been expressed in many opinion polls. Other parties here, particularly the Government parties, are sensitive about opinion polls and apparently they rely on the trends of such polls with regard to other matters.</P>
    <P>Some people may say that this motion is a political ploy.  We are all engaged in the business of politics.  We put down this motion deliberately, to invite the other parties to join us in condemning the Government.  It is not a ploy: it is a simple fact I am prepared to acknowledge.  It is up to the other parties to decide if they wish to join us in condemning the Government and to give effect to the wishes of the people.  It is not good for Deputy Mac Giolla to talk about successive Governments, trying to shelter under that phrase, or for the Progressive Democrats to do likewise.  The Government are the Government and either one supports them or one does not.  If parties in this House do not support this motion, let that be judged by the people.  It will be seen that they are keeping the Government in office despite the disastrous effect they are having on the country <Col N="470" /> and on morale generally.  Any party who refuse to support our motion will be shown as responsible for maintaining this discredited Government in office.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have been loud in the criticism of the policy of the Government.  Now is their opportunity to offer the people new hope and the opportunity to have new policies that will realise the great potential of the country and that will encourage the investment potential that has been suffocated during the last few years.</P>
    <P>With regard to promises, the tax proposals of the Progressive Democrats would cost £2 billion in a full year.  That represents one-third of total tax revenue and everyone must acknowledge this is way outside the capacity of the Exchequer at this point.  It is a matter for the Progressive Democrats themselves to explain how they can reconcile such outlandish proposals with their stated commitment to abandon the politics of promise.</P>
    <P>Every person is entitled to state his position but if there is one thing the rest of us, including the Government parties, feel somewhat impatient with is the notion being promoted that all integrity resides exclusively with the Progressive Democrats, that suddenly a new period of integrity has dawned in the person of those who are now members of the Progressive Democrats.  Incidentally, some of them were effective and active members in Government of which I was a member.  Apparently integrity starts from today.  It is a strange kind of integrity that promises tax reductions of £2 billion in one year, but that is a matter for them to explain.</P>
    <P>Their main obligation at this stage is to rid the country of this Government who have presided over the most disastrous decline in our economy and who have undermined the moral of our people. Over 100,000 of our people are now out of work for more than one year.  The total tax burden has increased from £4 billion in 1982 before this Government came to office to over £6 billion.  That represents £6,000 per annum per worker since this Government came to office.  That is the <Col N="471" /> burden of taxation now.  Income tax has increased from £1.45 billion to £2.5 billion, an increase of 70 per cent in the same period and total taxation as a percentage of GNP has increased dramatically from 33 per cent to 36 per cent.</P>
    <P>Clearly the Government have abandoned all their stated targets with respect to the current budget deficit and foreign borrowing.  The Government's first target was to eliminate the budget deficit by 1987, in four years.  In the document, <i>Building On Reality</i> this was revised to &ldquo;reduce the deficit to 5 per cent of GNP by 1987&rdquo;.  The Government abandoned that target, this Government of rectitude who came into office on that basis, and today we had a statement in the House from the Minister for Finance in which they confined themselves to the good intention of &ldquo;getting the deficit down as low as possible&rdquo;.  That is a long way from the very firm commitments they had and on which they rode into office on the basis that they were the only ones who were responsible and capable of doing the job.</P>
    <P>In the first three months of this year the deficit already totals £641 million, more than half the stated deficit target in the budget of £1,250 million for the year. There is not a chance of the Government living within the stated budget deficit of £1,250 million, which is well in excess of the deficit they inherited of £780 million.</P>
    <P>This Government of fiscal rectitude have abandoned all control over our deficit and our borrowing programmes. Total national debt under this Government has increased from £12.6 billion to £21 billion in the space of three and a half years, an increase of well over 70 per cent.  In the same period the total State foreign debt has increased from £6.7 billion to £10.7 billion.  This represents a burden of foreign debt of £7,500 on each worker.</P>
    <P>Let us have an end to the nonsense of this Government that they are controlling borrowing when it is obvious it is spiralling at an unprecedented rate, when the gross amount in the past three years has nearly equalled the total accumulated national debt under all Governments <Col N="472" /> since the foundation of the State.  Yet, they proclaim themselves to be proper custodians of the public purse.  They have been banqueting on borrowing and because of that profligate borrowing they have not been able to provide any relief in the burden of taxation or to provide employment opportunities.  There has been a decline of 40,000 in the number employed in manufacturing industry and the total unemployed in the country now exceeds the total number employed in the manufacturing sector.  Is it any wonder the mood of the country is one of depression and despair?</P>
    <P>The public are fully aware of the disastrous failure of this Government.  They do not need a litany from any of us. The business community are discouraged from investing.  There is no scope for private sector development.  The taxpayer, and particularly the PAYE taxpayer, has been singled out as a target for this Government.  It is time to put an end to this litany of failure and despair. It is time for this Government to acknowledge honestly that they are unable to meet the needs of our people. It is indeed time for a change.</P>
    <P>If this Government invested as much time, energy and effort in every other direction as they do in public relations, if they showed themselves as committed to developing and exploiting the great resources of the nation as they do to the presentation and projection of their public image, our country would be much better off.  Announcements are made outside this House, long before we hear of them here, daily and constant offences to the parliamentary function of this House.  If the Government directed all that energy to their proper job, then at least we could begin to make some progress. However, all the diversionary tactics and the public relations exercises have only one aim in mind, namely, to try somehow to distract the people from the problems of which they are too well aware.  Dáil Éireann now has the opportunity to end this period of unparalleled oppression for our people.  Those who fail to take the opportunity will have to answer to the people for maintaining in <Col N="473" /> power the most discredited Government in recent experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to avail of the opportunity to support the motion which condemns the Government for their failure to provide jobs, to reverse the spiralling growth of unemployment and to reduce the proportion of taxation under the PAYE system on the wages and the salaries of employees generally. These terrible twins of massive unemployment and vicious taxation are the greatest courage and affliction which our people have experienced since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>The neglect and exploitation of our young people in particular is surely the greatest scandal of all as revealed in the Youth Employment Agency report out today.  A startling revelation in that report is that the number of under 25 years olds who have been jobless for over a year has shot up five fold from 1980 to 1985, from 3,800 in 1980 to approximately 20,000 in October 1985.  Half of them have no educational qualifications, 11 per cent possess the leaving certificate and only one in every 200 is a third level graduate.  This is a serious indictment of this Government.  The treatment meted out to our young people is a shame and a disgrace and is fraught with the most serious repercussions.  The social consequences for the individual, the family and the nation are the terrible to contemplate if nothing positive is done to reverse that trend and to put our people to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I think of work I mean productive work, gainful, satisfying, remunerative and long term employment, not mere part time, short term, blind alley jobs of a soul destroying nature leading back after a few months to the dole, the emigrant ship, or worse, to a life of crime and drugs.  To be without a job today is bad, but to have a job and to be systematically robbed of one's hard won earnings by a tax system which is generally regarded as one of the most vicious and unfair systems in the world, is worse.  I believe that patently unjust system of taxation, the PAYE system, has contributed in large measure to the financial <Col N="474" /> chaos and the economic stagnation which we are experiencing today.</P>
    <P>It is time to end the policy of monetarism, to end the policy of ruthless Thatcherism which this Government have practised for the past few years, a policy of trying to resolve all our problems, financial, social and economic, on the backs of a vast ever growing army of unemployed with the application of a crippling system of taxation on an ever dwindling number of people at work.</P>
    <P>No Labour man or trade unionist worthy of the name could support such policies.  I certainly will not.  It is time for a change.  Fortunately, this House by its composition and numbers is in a position to effect positive change, a change of Government, and the sooner that change comes about the better.  I will lend my full support to bring about that change as speedily as possible in the interests of all our people, but in particular, those I represent in South Tipperary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope more Members will take the serious view of the economy which has been taken by Deputy Treacy instead of living in a world of fantasy. They should use their vote to bring about a change of Government policy if this Government intend to hang on.  In the few minutes at my disposal I want to talk about the real situation without going back over the past 15 years and saying who did what and when, although the Coalition Governments were in power for most of that period.  I want to hone in on a few important areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This economy is on a downward slide and the worrying feature is that Ministers, including the Minister for Finance, as well as Government speakers this evening do not appear to know the facts. They should not live on the backs of reports based on information obtained at the end of 1985 when encouraging economic signs were showing.  I have heard Government speakers talk about growth in the Irish economy this year.  I received a copy of the OECD report in May and I am sure Deputies are using data in that report as the basis for some of the figures they have given in this <Col N="475" /> House.  I am asking the Minister, Deputy Quinn this question: where will the growth in the economy come from this year?  The first sector that comes to mind is agriculture, but we all know there is a crisis in agriculture, that milk supplies are running 11 per cent behind, and that it is doubtful that we will reach our milk quota.  Can anyone say there will be growth in this very important sector?</P>
    <P>Would anybody even dare suggest that the building and construction industry have hit bottom?  In my view they are still in the quicksand and they are trying to find the bottom.  Cement sales are the best indicator of all.  Recent figures show that cement sales are only 55 per cent of what they were in 1979.  That is a serious devastation of any industry.  There is no growth in tourism.  The tourist industry is suffering a very serious setback.  There has been 25 per cent drop in the number of tourists from America and coach hire figures are down 40 per cent.  There will be no growth in that area this year.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this year will see zero growth in manufacturing industry.  It is time Government Deputies came down from cloud cuckooland and faced facts. They should look at the reason for the crisis facing that industry.  The import export figures for the first four months of this year are very relevant.  The import figures were down 9½ per cent.  We all know that approximately 50 per cent of our imports are the raw materials for manufacturing industry.  The figures for May show an increase of 3,200 in the underlying unemployment trend.  This happened during a month when everyone expected that unemployment figures would be reduced.  I know the Government were shocked by those figures and almost everybody else was shocked but that is reality.  If one were really studying the economy one would not be shocked. If the Coalition continue to live in a fool's paradise they will be twice as shocked next winter when they see the drop in the economy.</P>
    <P>For the first four months this year exports were down 3.7 per cent compared with the same period last year.  That does <Col N="476" /> not point to growth.  When anybody here talks about growth, will they please tell the House from which sector this growth will come?  Ministers should go into the marketplace and talk to the people who count, those who are the best judges of consumer spending.  I spoke to some of these people in the last week and they told me that consumer spending is flat. If there is an improvement in consumer spending this year I can tell the Minister where it will go.  It will find its way back into the banks because two thirds of the bad debts this year are in the personal borrowing sector.</P>
    <P>What is really happening in our economy? What has happened in the past four months?  I want to point to one factor which is outside the bounds of the private sector but into which the Government have their own input in relation to what can happen.  I know inflation is coming down but not as fast as in the countries with which we are trading.  We see a minus or a deflation of 0.5 per cent in Germany, plus 0.5 per cent in Belgium, 2.6 per cent in the UK, 2.7 per cent in France, 1.7 per cent in the US, and we gloat over 3 per cent here.  We have not even come down as fast as the others have, and there are no great thanks or bouquets for the Government because outside international events have achieved it &mdash; basically the drop in oil prices and in world commodity prices.  The serious signs are there.</P>
    <P>One factor causing untold damage in the indigenous Irish sector to which the Government should direct their attention fairly fast is the result of the realignment of currencies in the EMS recently.  I do not know on what assessment we took the strong stand we took that our currency was not going to move.  It may well have been on the basis of keeping a low inflation rate, but France devalued by 3 per cent and their inflation rate is lower than ours.  Britain devalued in relation to the Irish scene by at least 7 per cent.  Is anybody trying to tell me that Irish export industry can live in moving currencies of approximately 30 per cent in the US Dollar and 7 per cent in the UK market? Our business in the Far East is governed <Col N="477" /> by the dollar exchange rates.  That area has gone out of the control of anybody in the business sector.  In the short time I have left I will give one example of what the repercussions of that will be.</P>
    <P>Take the Irish confectionery section. We know the companies who are operating and I will not name any of them. We know the position.  I am putting it on the record of this House that not a single company in that sector can operate with a 90p punt in this situation.  The closure of the Irish confectionary sector will bring in its wake the following.  Thirty million gallons of milk are used by the Irish confectionery sector, and the sugar required for that sector represents the total output of the Mallow sugar factory,.  Those are the downstream implications of letting an Irish confectionery sector go under in the economic circumstances in which they have to operate at the moment, and all we hear from the Government are lectures to industry to take down costs.</P>
    <P>Industrialists are working slavishly at taking down their costs, but when your price on the export market is reduced over a couple of weeks by 7 per cent, and that has lasted for the last six months if you are in the UK market, and if you are in the US market it has been reduced by 30 per cent, how long can you stay in business?  It simply does not add up.  It is time for a national debate.  I am calling here tonight for a national debate on our exchange rate policy because it is the most important factor affecting the economy at the moment and no individual has control over it.  It may well be that the Government based their exchange rate policy on getting inflation down, but it would come down anyway as France has proved.  The other matter was to alleviate the problems of servicing our national debt.</P>
    <P>Those are very laudable objectives, but if the narrow assessment on which they are based is to continues throughout the remainder of this year, all the Government will do is continue along the foolish road of seeing more and more industry closing down, the productive base eroded and more taxation having to be taken from the few people who will have to <Col N="478" /> bear an additional burden to what they are bearing at the moment.  You cannot bring down taxation without addressing the twin problems of taxation and unemployment together.  You must get more people back to work so that more people will be paying into the Exchequer and so spread the burden more evenly.</P>
    <P>The problems are not small and the solutions to them are not instantaneous. I am addressing a problem here tonight that this Government have failed to take cognisance of.  The repercussions are signposted in the May unemployment figures.  What will those figures be next November or December?  That is the reality but it is not what is put forward by economists because they see a rosy picture.  I am reporting the real economy on the ground and I defy contradiction on any aspect of it that I have mentioned here tonight.  I hope when Members come to vote they will think in terms of how to put the economy back on the right path.</P>

      <P>The Minister, Deputy Quinn, to conclude at 8.15 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the duration of this Government our major priority has been to seek to halt and then reverse the growth in unemployment. Contrary to the simplistic assertions which have emanated from the Opposition benches in the course of this debate, dealing with our unemployment problem involves a great deal more than simply throwing borrowed money at what Deputy Haughey likes to refer to as &ldquo;selected targets&rdquo; and hoping that, with a bit of luck and maybe a few favourable shifts in the international trading environment, some of the money will stick and job creation will result &mdash; in the short term anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one can disagree that the current level of unemployment is unacceptably high.  What the Opposition consistently ignore is that the growth in unemployment has markedly stabilised.  The rate of increase has declined from 15.6 per cent in 1983 to 8.4 per cent in 1984 and <Col N="479" /> 6.4 per cent in 1985.  Between May 1985 and May of this year the rate fell to 3 per cent.  These figures have to be set against an increase of 27,000 in the labour force between April 1982 and April 1985.  The latest economic projections suggest that unemployment will start to decline in 1987, even allowing for the continuing growth in the labour force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a bet with the Minister on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In conjunction, OECD and ESRI forecasts predict growth rates in GNP of 3 per cent and 4 per cent for 1986 and 1987 respectively.  The ESRI expect the level of industrial employment to increase by 1 per cent to 2 per cent per year and service employment by 1 per cent per year over the next four years.  It is obvious, therefore, that on the basis of these independent assessments of the economic outlook for this country, the Government's policies for tackling the major problem of unemployment are beginning to bear fruit slowly but surely.</P>
      <P>Our economic strategy, in all its aspects, is directed towards maintaining the economic momentum and at the same time helping those who have been hardest hit by the recession.  I should add, at this point, that as far as this Government are concerned, an indispensable element of any strategy to counter unemployment must be improved international co-ordination of economic policies, particularly within the EC.  No state, least of all a small exposed economy like ours, can succeed by going it alone.  If Europe is to find its way out of its current economic predicament, then a co-ordinated and structured approach to economic growth and to employment creation is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give just one brief example of how this international co-operation can work.  At a recent Social Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg on 5 June, I was pleased to be party to an initiative, in association with my British and Italian colleagues, whereby a jointly agreed document, containing a series of positive proposals for action, <Col N="480" /> was submitted to the Council.  The document, which will be a principle item on the Council's agenda over the coming months, is intended to have the battle against unemployment designated as the central issue facing the European Community and to ensure that adequate resources are provided for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The major constraint facing this Government in their work of stimulating the economy, promoting job creation and dealing effectively with unemployment and its effects has been the incredible mess in the public finances which was our unwelcome legacy from Deputy Haughey's administrations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for measurable and testable record &mdash; I use the words advisedly &mdash; that alone in Europe this Government have protected the income and entitlements of the deprived sections of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> Social welfare payments have been maintained and increased at the rate of inflation and in some cases, in excess of that rate.  We have also successfully targeted resources in the manpower area towards those groups and categories among the unemployed which experience the greatest need, in particular, the long term unemployed.  Deputies can test that.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will be aware of the report published by the Youth Employment Agency this morning on long term unemployment as it affects the under 25s.  The survey shows the young people who are most likely to be long term unemployed have very low levels of education and training, are from families with a high concentration of unemployment and have had unfavourable employment experiences.  It also shows that the young people concerned have low aspirations and are mainly concentrated in certain parts of our large cities and towns.</P>
    <P>These conclusions confirm what other surveys, including successive annual school leavers surveys, have consistently shown, namely, that in present day circumstances those with little or no educational and training qualifications have the poorest job prospects.  It underlines the correctness of policy decisions such as the implementation of the social guarantee for youth.  Under this scheme all educationally unqualified school-leavers who are unemployed for more than six months will be offered a place on a suitable programme such as the AnCO skills foundation course to help them gain a foothold in the labour market.  It is a pity that Deputy O'Kennedy is not here, but if he sincerely believes the views he enunciated here today he should call into the AnCO training centres and tell the trainees that they are wasting their time and money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The report also underlines the correctness of the Government initiatives announced last October which included incentives to stimulate activity in the construction industry covering redevelopment of our so long neglected inner city areas, home improvements and the development of community and tourism facilities.  This strategic utilisation of resources is of general benefit to the communities concerned but it is also of benefit to the unemployed in those communities, both youth and adult.  In 1982, the Government identified the long term unemployed as a category of greatest concern and immediate need.  Regardless of the overall improvement in the economy and increases in employment, the long term unemployed experience greater difficulties than any other category in securing a return to the active labour market.</P>
      <P>In this regard the social employment scheme has made a marked contribution to growth in employment for the over 25 age group.  The target level of 10,000 participants on the scheme has been reached.  There are 10,555 on this programme.  About a third of the projects now in operation are sponsored by voluntary organisations.  The remaining 70 per cent of projects are sponsored by public sector bodies.  These include local authorities, schools and health boards.  The high standard of the projects is impressive and the scheme is credited in many communities with counteracting many of the adverse effects of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The AnCO Building on Experience programme for the long term unemployed has been similarly successful in achieving both its participation targets and its general objectives.  This programme is especially tailored to the <Col N="483" /> needs of the adult long-term unemployed and combines formal training with practical experience in a work environment. To date, placement rate from the programme has been 57 per cent and it is expected that 3,000 long term unemployed people will participate in 1986.</P>
    <P>These are just some examples of how the limitations imposed by the very real financial constraints facing this Government have been overcome in a way which is strategically of benefit to the least well off and the most disadvantaged in our community.  As far as I and the party of which I am a member are concerned, this is what the skillful deployment of scarce resources in a time of grave financial difficulty is all about.</P>
    <P>I noted that the Opposition bandied about some curiously derived statistics concerning emigration levels during this debate.  There is no accurate information available on the level of emigration from Ireland in the eighties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  We have estimates from the Central Statistics Office on the level of net emigration, that is the balance of people leaving and entering Ireland. These estimates shows that net emigration has increased in recent years, changing from a new inflow of people in the second half of the seventies to an average annual net outflow of 6,000 per annum from 1981 to 1984 and of 14,000 in the year to April 1985.</P>

      <P>We do not know the extent to which this change in the pattern of net mirgration is due to increased emigration and what portion is due to a fall in the number of people entering Ireland.  Particular attention has been paid to the question of youth emigration.  It must be remembered that youth emigration has been a constant fact of life in Ireland. Even in the years when there was a net inflow of people to Ireland, in the high point of the seventies, there was always a positive level of youth emigration. There is no clear evidence of any very large increase in the level of youth emigration in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern and that of this Government is to ensure that nobody leaves Ireland seeking work in Britain or elsewhere who is either ill-prepared for the experience or ill-informed.  The implementation of the social guarantee is one mechanism which is being used to identify and to offer early school-leavers who might otherwise feel tempted to emigrate the option of training and development opportunities specially geared to their needs.  Another necessary development which has been set in train is the provision of adequate and up-to-date information to young people who are thinking of emigrating.  This is currently being organised through the National Manpower Service and through projects funded by the Youth Employment Agency.  I would also point out that since I became Minister for Labour I have reconstituted the support services for Irish communities in Britain and I have also increased by more than 300 per cent the allocation of financial resources to this work.  It is, therefore, blatantly wrong for anyone on the Opposition side of this House to suggest that this Government have in any way shied away from dealing with the problems which may result from unplanned emigration by young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Launching scathing attacks on the concept of public enterprise and the public service has recently become something of a national political sport.  That is not my policy or my party's policy and it is not the policy which this Government have pursued over the past three years. In so far as it falls within my brief as Minister for Labour and for the Public Service, I am determined to see the <Col N="486" /> development of an efficient, streamlined public service whose delivery of services to the public will be as cost-effective as possible and untramelled by unnecessary bureaucratic rules, delays or impediments.</P>
    <P>How are health, social welfare and education going to be financed?  There is a very real distinction to be made between fair taxation and low taxation. The policy which is being pursued by this Government, as exemplified in the tax changes in the recent budget, is one of moving towards an equitable and fair system of taxation where each category contributes fairly and which will stimulate employment and economic growth. In any debate on taxation it is important for all of us to bear that distinction in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds made a couple of points in his own speech which I would like to refer to briefly because he made a very constructive contribution.  But he failed to recognise that Great Britain, if one accepts that it is as a single unit the largest group with whom we are trading, is not in the EMS and some of the difficulties in relation to currency movements are caused by the fluctuation in the value of sterling.  I accept the difficulties that are encountered by the manufacturing sector in relation to the position that currently prevails.  But if the Deputy looks at the levels of fluctuation in their currency in the last nine months relative to other currencies he will see the extraordinary difficulties anyone would have in anticipating in advance the level of exchange rate between one currency and another.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Deputy says about the need for this economy to be poised to take advantage of certain external improvements in international trading.  If we do not do this we will lose out on the opportunities for employment in the manner he suggested.  He was correct to point to the downstream effects of, for example, the confectionery industry.  But all this points to the necessity for a controlled approach to the economy and of getting our own economy in order.  Given the constraints and pressures on our <Col N="487" /> society at present, that is precisely what we have tried to do.  Many factors, both external and internal, have significantly improved relative to what the position was two years ago and the same business community that the Deputy is referring to would have said, if we had reported back from the coalface two years ago, that the reason there was no investment was that interest rates were too high and inflation was too high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They are still too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>But interest rates are beginning to come down.  They have moved.  We are always going to have explanations and excuses.  I am simply saying that the Government of the day must provide a clear framework within which public and private investment decisions can be made.  That is what we have been trying to do against a background of incessant demands for more consumption and less tax.  Frankly, I have to say that, while there are many areas that could be dramatically improved in our society, nothing that has come forward from Fianna Fáil in the generality of this debate gives any indication that they had any proposals.  As Deputy O'Malley said in his own five minute intervention, in the last three Private Members' debates we had in this House Fianna Fáil were calling for the spending of more money and now they are calling for a reduction in taxation.  There is no logic to it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last contribution by the Minister is symptomatic of the general attitude of Government Ministers who come in with prepared scripts put together by their bureaucratic advisers without any basis in logic.  I propose to deal logically with this matter and quote sources for the logic in which Fianna Fáil are engaged in putting down this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion condemns the Government on two basic fronts: their failure to <Col N="488" /> honour specific undertakings in the Joint Programme for Government in relation to the growth of employment and in relation to a specific commitment to reduce the proportion of tax taken under PAYE. That is written into the document which I have here and which the Minister can peruse any time he wishes, the Fine Gael/Labour Programme for Government. Our motion deals with economic and social policy, which, although part of the document published by the Government before they took office, appear to be areas on which the Government cannot agree and have failed miserably to perform on.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has risen by 3,200 in this last month of May.  It now stands at 234,000.  This is not just a Fianna Fáil figure but a figure acknowledged by the Government and specified as being very serious and of grave import in a publication out today issued by the independent consultants DKM dealing with current economic trends.  I will be referring to page 2 of that document later.  Direct Government policy has made a major contribution to this startling increase in unemployment by cutting the public capital programme in productive investment in 1985 by £88 million.  These moneys have been switched to pay, in the last analysis, for Government blunders like the ICI debacle.  In the budget statement of the Minister for Finance he commented on the public capital programme for 1985 on pages 152 and 153.  There we have a positive Government direction of policy leading to very serious problems in the public capital programme precisely in the productive area for which borrowing is justified, affecting employment in industry, agriculture and infrastructural development.  According to the DKM report, the number of persons under 25 years of age on the live register has increased substantially in May and is viewed very seriously.  We are dealing with current economic and social policies at present.  I quote from the report:</P>
    <P>This year on year increase in the under 25 group has been growing <Col N="489" /> steadily upwards and is more disturbing than last month's increase in the global unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>On top of all this, at a conservative estimate, 30,000 people are now emigrating on a permanent basis and we cannot get the Government to admit to that and draw up practical proposals to face up to that problem.  So, on top of the highest ever unemployment rate of people under 25 years of age, we now have a rising emigration rate which the Government do not even agree exists.  I listened here appalled to the last Minister speaking a few minutes ago not admitting to that fact.  It is a fact.  There is no point in behaving as if one did not live in current Irish society.  Unfortunately, the present emigration rate is at a conservative figure of 30,000.  That will be seen quite clearly when the computer delivers the results of the recent census some time in autumn.</P>
    <P>Private sector employment is decreasing due to a series of disincentive taxes which have deterred investment and expansion.  The notorious 10 per cent VAT slapped on to new house sales is a real example, amongest many others, of muddled Coalition mismanagement in introducing disincentive taxation in the construction industry which needs instead incentives to promote jobs in what is essentially a labour intensive industry.  What is needed is a whole range of selective incentives for employment, particularly in construction, tourism, the land and natural resources, together with all the related industries.  This should be backed up by a substantial increase in productive investment by the State. Labour Ministers within a Government, if their philosophy means anything, should be to the forefront in developing policies along those lines.  The trouble with the Labour Party within the Government is that they have become a lame collection of careerists who are no longer interested in Labour philosophy or policy.</P>
    <P>Basically, Ireland's present economic and social problems stem not so much from economic and financial mismanagement, although this is a contributory <Col N="490" /> cause, but from a lack of political will. The future development of this country depends fundamentally on confidence in the political system and the capacity of that system to yield people at the top in Government with the political will to make the necessary decisions that will cause things to happen in the economic sphere.</P>

      <P>Positive leadership is the major factor required to stimulate employment.  It is quite a clear that the investment climate has already been seriously damaged by the failure of the Government's economic and financial policies.  That situation has been aggravated substantially by the spectacle of fumbling political leadership from the Taoiseach, right through his various Ministers from diverse political parties who are pulling away from each other under an incompetent leadership on which they cannot rely.  They have a leader in charge who has lost not just the confidence of the people or of investors, but the confidence of his own colleagues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot emphasise too much that the country's economic recovery will not start until there is a change in political direction.  On any political analysis, Fianna Fáil alone can provide that political direction and guarantee the stability which is inherent in a single party Government commanding a clear majority in this House and getting on with the business of governing the nation.  There is a psychological malaise in our society at present which is leading to disillusionment, disenchantment and cynicism among our people.  This is blocking progress everywhere at every level.  That must change if we are to succeed as a nation in the immediate future.  There is no hope for Ireland today unless this happens.  Bringing down inflation statistics are meaningless while investment stagnates for lack of venture capital and projects will not come forward unless confidence exists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland needs economic expansion primed by investment policies at every level which will lead to more employment, creating a broader and fairer tax base.  We must reject the social crime of a young and intelligent workforce, in many cases well educated and trained, who cannot find work and are forced to emigrate in growing numbers.  The proportion of tax taken in PAYE from the wages and salaries of employees is grossly discriminatory and we reject it.  In a worsening economy it is blatantly unjust that the amount of tax taken under PAYE in 1986 is 25 per cent higher than in 1982.  This Coalition Government cannot agree to implement a single recommendation from the Commission <Col N="493" /> on Income Taxation designed to alleviate the PAYE situation.</P>

    <Title>Estimates, 1986. - Courts Bill, 1986: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the adjournment of the debate I was dealing with some of the arguments for and against the abolition of the jury system with particular reference to the level of high premiums that have to be paid by Irish business policy holders.  I pointed out that they have reached the stage where they are unwilling, and unable, to pay the premiums being demanded of them.  I made reference to the effect those high premiums are having on business generally and the dangers that will ensue if this policy is continued.  Many business people will not be able to meet the high cost of insurance and there will be serious job losses.  I was critical of the Government's attitude to the abolition of juries and their proposals in the Bill before the House concerning malicious injuries claims.  I have no doubt that the provisions of that Bill will involve policyholders in increased premiums to recoup the £20 million per year which the Government must pass on to the insurance industry to be claimed back in premium increases.  I gave statistics that <Col N="503" /> make it imperative that some initiative is taken now by the Government to reduce the level of crime and vandalism in Dublin city and restore some semblance of law and order to our streets.</P>
      <P>I repeat that in high crime areas businesses have suffered substantial losses and businessmen feel undefended and unprotected by the law enforcement agencies and the underwriters.  The Government have failed to provide the law enforcement with sufficient capital and manpower to do the job they were established for.  Businesses cannot afford the increases in insurance costs as further overheads, and risks are being taken by businessmen taking out inadequate insurance. That must be of serious concern to the whole business community.  Many papers have been written and agencies have been bringing to public notice that under-insurance is the order of the day and is leading to business closures and consequently to job losses with general debilitation in the business community.</P>
      <P>Business people are also looking with concern at the Malicious Injuries Bill and insurers will be bound to expand the no-go areas for insurance while those who manage to get cover after that Bill is passed will be saddled with increased costs.  It is an extraordinary situation, showing that the Government, in confusion, are producing <i>ad hoc</i> measures and are walking away from their responsibilities in these matters.  The sooner they are put out of their misery the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While referring generally to the legal system, we are all aware that the District Court has jurisdiction to award compensation of up to £2,500 and the Circuit Court can award damages of up to £15,000.  Both courts can do it with a judge or justice sitting alone.  Therefore, we have a misunderstanding in regard to the civil jury system.  It was thought to be a universal right in injury claims and all civil liability cases.  It is normal only in the High Court, where juries decide on liability and the amount of damages.  If a judge sitting alone can do it in claims of up to £15,000 in the Circuit Court, why <Col N="504" /> is it not regarded as proper that if a claim was for £15,001 a judge could decide without requiring a jury?  As I have said, it has worked quite well in the lower courts.</P>
    <P>Can it be stated that a decision of a judge sitting alone has always been inferior to a collective decision by a jury? I should like to get the Minister's response to that question.  It has been stated by barristers that collective decisions by juries have not always been superior to those of judges.  Why then is it mandatory to have juries officiating in all civil cases at all levels?  That is an argument the Minister has not addressed himself adequately to.</P>
    <P>Dissatisfaction has not been expressed that there has been inferior justice in the lower courts.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, which sat as long ago as 1965, recommended the abolition of juries in all civil cases.  It took 20 years for us to get as far as that single item.  My objection to this legislation is that the Minister is doing only part of the job here.  He is dealing with civil juries but he is not prepared to bring in the other reforms suggested in the MacLiam report and the reports of the Committee on Court Practices and Procedures and recommendations in many papers published since.  The Minister has not found it necessary to deal with our entire legal system, including the high costs of litigation and the causes for the high cost of insurance related to the number and the size of claims.</P>
    <P>There was also a report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses which dealt with insurance for small industries.  The Minister chose to ignore all those important matters and to go ahead with this single item.</P>
    <P>Judges sitting alone can decide certain cases right up to the Supreme Court.  It is only reasonable to suggest that they would be enabled to do likewise in ordinary personal injury cases.  If there was a suggestion of a noticeable divergence of opinion as between different judges, the Minister could have introduced in this legislation a quantum book on damages so that technical guidelines would be laid <Col N="505" /> down for judges.  This has operated in other jurisdictions and they have achieved a better balance in regard to damage awards.  Such a system here would do away with possible unpredictability of individual judges and people would not be waiting to see which judge they would draw before reaching settlements.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about inconsistency in awards by juries but he said nothing about inconsistency in decisions as between judges sitting alone.  If there was a standard book of guidelines on damages there would not be inconsistency in regard to personal injury claim awards. All that is necessary is a good standard reference book.  Provision for that is omitted from this Bill.  That would have allayed fears expressed by many in regard to individual judges, and that has been clearly expressed by barrister associations. Barristers are well versed in law and know the tendencies of particular judges.  If they are prepared to put that in writing we must take it in good faith. The Minister has not taken the necessary steps to help in the matter.  This is faulty, incomplete legislation.  As I said before, it is piecemeal legislation, not fully thought through and will not be of any great consequence in getting a final solution to the high cost of insurance and claims.</P>
    <P>Awards must be assessed by professional methods.  This is a complex area involving many factors and it lent itself to the professional advice that might have been made available had the Minister opted for an advice system to help the judges.  I take it the legislation will be passed and that the Government will not fall because of it.  That being the case, surely the Minister might try to improve the Bill even at this stage.</P>
    <P>The system of processing civil liability claims should be streamlined.  That was recommended to the Minister but it is not incorporated in the legislation and neither is the streamlining and improvement of the whole legal process leading to the finalisation of claims.  These are integral parts of the system but to pluck out one item and to make a very limited case is not adequate.  The Minister did <Col N="506" /> not make his case well and that is regrettable. If there was a case to be made and if it had been made sufficiently well, we would have had to answer it but that did not happen.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible to settle many more cases out of court and obviously that is the intention.  If the process could be streamlined, if we had more consistency and predictability with regard to awards, then people would take the option of settling.  They would not do so on the steps of the courthouse because by that time all the legal costs have been incurred and they become part of the final settlement. To reduce the size of claims and their cost, they must be settled well in advance of that stage.  If the Minister had taken the necessary steps to improve the legal processes we could have ended up with agreement rather than half agreement, as is the case here.  In nearly all of these cases juries are dealing with insurance companies.  It would be reasonable to expect they would have a certain sympathy and compassion over and above that expected of an individual judge but that is not guaranteed.  I have sufficient faith in the judicial system to expect that if a judge had a quantum book on damages and the necessary technical, professional expert advice he would be kept within normal guidelines.</P>
    <P>There was no reference to the delays that are an additional factor in actions so far as personal injuries are concerned.  It is not reasonable to have delays of two or three years.  Such delays are a major factor in the overall cost of litigation.  The Minister referred to the legal representation on cases.  People in this House and outside it have referred on many occasions to the number of lawyers involved in these cases.  There seems to be a universal acceptance that the four-lawyer system is antiquated and is superfluous to the requirements of the system.  There may have been need for it in the past for some reason, but today a more equitable system would be to have a two-lawyer system.  That could have been addressed by the Minister at this time but he only gave a vague promise that he would look into the matter in a critical way.  By that <Col N="507" /> I understand the system will be changed because I presume one does not make a critical analysis of some matter unless one intends to change it.  The Minister's reaction to this problem has not been adequate.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of expensive specialist witnesses.  Having doctors, consultants, engineers, architects and other expert witnesses standing by for long periods must add substantially to the overall cost of awards in the High Court. All these people stand by in advance of the case being called and even though the case may be settled on the steps of the courthouse the witnesses have to be paid. That process could be streamlined.  I accept it may be necessary to have cross-examination of expert witnesses on occasion but I am satisfied much of that could be done by documentation.  That is particularly so if there is not a long drawnout court battle, with individuals trying to convince other individuals that their point of view is the only one that matters. All these matters should be dealt with in a professional way by way of points of law.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have gone much further in dealing with this problem.  The fairest way to put the matter is that justice delayed is always justice denied.  A long delay of several years not only can have a material effect on the people involved but it can lead to considerable injustice for people on both sides.  It is not just the plaintiff having a bad time because of the delay: the insurers suffer.  They must keep their money on reserve.  They have to estimate what is needed in their reserve ratio in order to cater for their liability and that puts a strain on their investment income, on the premium reserve and on their solvency.  All of this leads to increased costs for the policy holders and that is what this is all about. The Minister made no bones about that in his contribution.  This is an effort to bring the cost and level of claims into some kind of order.  Legal costs account for 20 per cent of liability claims payments. Adding 20 per cent to the cost inevitably must mean substantial premium increases that have to be borne by <Col N="508" /> the policy holders, those who are lucky enough to have reasonable cover.  Unfortunately, fewer and fewer people are able to get the cover they require at a reasonable cost.  It has had a significant effect on business, job creation and job prospects.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, it is not suitable in a democracy to have no-go areas in a city, to have no insurance areas in a city, to have certain classes of business which cannot get a reasonable insurance cover.  I believe that in the long term that must have a debilitating effect on the insurers, the underwriters and business generally, and will lead to greater demands to have the freedom of services directive introduced here at the earliest possible date.  I am on record as seeking a derogation in that matter for at least five years to allow the Irish insurance industry to cope, to get technological advances geared to the average one expects in these matters in the European sense.</P>
    <P>I know from public statements made by leaders in the insurance world that if that freedom of services directive in its present form comes in, it will place considerable strain on companies who, by the nature of their returns in the Blue Book, find it difficult to meet their solvency margins.  They are all solvent at this time but they say the only reason they are maintaining their solvency is that they get increased premium rates together with their investment income. That investment income has been reduced.  The rate of inflation and interest rates are down and, consequently, their investment income return is also down. That means they have to reserve more of their premium income to maintain the balance for their liability expectations. This is putting existing insurers under pressure.  If some of that premium income is hived off to foreign companies, one can only imagine the effect that would have not just on the insurers, but also on the Government agencies which borrow substantially from that invested premium money.</P>
    <P>In all those circumstances, I regret that the Government could not put a right package together, that they could not <Col N="509" /> have addressed themselves to the four items mentioned in the Oireachtas joint committee's report on the insurance business. The Government, the insurance underwriters and the Community should work in tandem and a proper package should be produced so that we would see an effective means of dealing with the escalating costs of insurance for all sectors in the general insurance area.  We expected them to deal effectively with the volume of claims, the level of compensation, the legal system, risk management and the level of crime and vandalism.  These items have been identified, written about and reported on for the past 20 years, but now all we get is this one piece of legislation which is not even complete in itself.  The Minister would do well to reconsider his position and perhaps improve the Bill considerably on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirleach, and thank you Deputy Harney.  I oppose this Bill.  I consider it a Bill which has been brought in at the behest of a very powerful, wealthy elite in Irish society.  The Confederation of Irish Industry, the banking corporations and the insurance corporations have mounted a very effective and very successful campaign against juries in certain actions for compensation.  The power which this wealthy elite in our society have never ceases to amaze me.  They have the power to change budgets after they have been presented in the House. They have the power to pressurise the <Col N="510" /> Government into rescuing disastrous financial investments such as ICI for Allied Irish Banks.  They have the power to get the State to rescue the PMPA, a private, family owned insurance company set up by private individuals for their own personal gain.  They seem to be an all powerful elite in our society and they apparently have the power to twist this Government &mdash; and perhaps they had the power in the past to twist Governments &mdash; in the direction they want us to move.</P>
      <P>This time they are interfering with the right of ordinary citizens to have their claims for compensation in certain respects considered by a jury.  So far in the debate on this subject inside and outside this House, I have not heard a convincing argument that we should do away with juries in these cases.  There has been no call from the general public to do away with juries in these cases.  The only demand has come from this powerful wealthy elite.</P>
      <P>Problems arise in having to present a case to a jury, but these problems have more to do with the way the legal profession operate and the fact that our court procedures are so outdated and sluggish. A very good case can be made for modernising our court procedures and reducing the number of legal people who act for the plaintiffs and the defendants.</P>
      <P>The main argument put forward in favour of change has been that juries are inconsistent and in particular, that they give over generous awards to persons who suffered injuries or to relatives of persons who have been killed.  The insurance companies have suggested that this has led to extraordinarily high insurance premia in this country, especially for motor insurance, but this has not been proved.  They tried to draw an analogy between the situation here and that in the United Kingdom as regards insurance premia and awards to people who suffered injuries in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a submission from the Federation of Insurers in Ireland, Hawkins House, Hawkins Street, Dublin.  They present no evidence to back up the assertions they make in their submission.  As <Col N="511" /> far as I am concerned, they try to mislead me as a Deputy in the way they present their case, a case which I say is a very arrogant one.  The heading of their submission is &ldquo;Car Insurance, You're Right, It is too Dear&rdquo; and they argue against juries in compensation cases.  But at no point has the Minister in bringing in this Bill argued that doing away with juries will make car insurance cheaper.  He has not even claimed that it will peg car insurance where it is at present.  In the last paragraph, page 7, of the submission from the federation they do not even claim that, despite the fact that they say car insurance is too dear.  They say the insurance industry believe that the jury system must be abandoned entirely in High Court actions for personal injuries and that, without its total abolition, claims costs will continue to escalate and motor insurance premia continue to rise. They do not claim they will be nice to their customers, because that is what we are, and gives us our cut in our insurance premia, our public liability premia, or any other insurance we may be seeking from them.</P>
    <P>A particularly arrogant submission on page 2, paragraph 5, is:</P>
    <P>The jury system requires 12 people with little or no knowledge or experience of such matters not only to make decisions on legal liability but also to assess damages.</P>
    <P>Who do they think they are?  Do they imagine that professionals only have experience of life?  Generally speaking, members of juries are ordinary people, representing a cross-section of society, comprised of professional and non-professional people, trade unionists and nontrade unionists, manual workers and nonmanual workers.  Why do they claim that these people have not the capacity or ability to make a reasoned and fair judgement in relation to injuries that a person is claiming for?  It is a totally arrogant approach to ordinary men and women.  They go on to say at paragraph 6:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> The unreliability and unpredictability of jury awards as well as being unfair to defendants can also create injustices for the injured parties.  Two people with identical injuries would be most unlikely to obtain similar damages from two different juries and would in all probability be awarded significantly different sums by way of compensation. Such a system is manifestly unfair to both plaintiffs and defendants.</P>
    <P>Again, why do they make that argument? They must be aware, as ordinary, well intentioned, common, decent, intelligent people are, that even though you may have the same injuries your circumstances may not be the same at home. The effect of the injury may not be the same.  Because an insurance company consider that X award is too high for a person who lost a hand, a leg or an eye or had serious injuries, why do they assume that ordinary people who have experience of life are not capable of judging what a person may have to live on for virtually the rest of his or her life?</P>
    <P>On page 3 at the end of paragraph 7 they say:</P>
    <P>...to give verbal evidence and be subjected to cross-examination, all for the benefit of the jury.  Much of this could be dispensed with and replaced by documentary evidence such as medical reports if there were so jury. Lengthy opening and closing addresses by the opposing lawyers are designed mainly to influence the jury.</P>
    <P>These poor, simple, uneducated people have to be influenced by these professional gurus.</P>
    <P>Necessary reforms to streamline procedures are hindered or rendered impossible by the continuation of the jury system.</P>
    <P>Is the judge not just as likely to be influenced by the opening or closing remarks of an advocate or lawyer?</P>

      <P>Precisely, just as it depends on the jury who are much more likely to get a balanced outcome from having 12 people listening to what has been said and considering it and tossing it around and discussing it among themselves than a single judge would listening to and being influenced by lawyers opening or closing a case for either side.</P>
      <P>This submission was drawn in that vein, which I regard as arrogant and insulting to the intelligence of the Members of this House and to the ordinary people who are called to serve on juries in the normal course of the legal process.  In any event, it is estimated that in only 4 per cent of all claims against insurance companies in the motor car area are legal proceedings commenced and only one in 500 goes to court.  Therefore, only a very small number of claims go before court and many of these are settled out of court when the jury have no say in the matter in any event.  It is argued, of course, that awards made by juries have the knockon effect that cases settled outside court are influenced by the awards made in court, but surely if any person or any lawyer representing a person who is seeking compensation felt that they were going to get more money in court or that juries are so exceedingly generous, we would have all such cases coming before the courts.  Why should the plaintiff settle outside of court if he or she can go before a jury and get two, three or four times what the insurance companies claim they should get?  Why can they not go before these juries and get this huge amount of money from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be argued that a case in the High Court without a jury might be slightly quicker and cheaper but, as I have said, savings could be made in other ways. Surely when we are talking about compensation we are not talking about justice on the cheap or the legal process on the cheap.  We are talking about trying to arrive at fair compensation for the injured person.  Surely if the matter could be settled out of court it would be settled out of court.  The vast majority of ordinary people going to court detest having to go to court and stand before a jury or get <Col N="514" /> into a box to explain their case.  That is a harrowing experience for the vast majority of people.  Therefore a case can be made that the cost of proceedings before a jury should be accepted as worth-while expenditure to ensure that the person who has been injured has a fair chance of getting proper compensation.  Efficiency and speed should not be the be all and end all of our court procedures.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that juries can be inconsistent, but surely the same can be said for judges sitting without juries.  We have seen some bizarre, eccentric behaviour by members of the Judiciary.  There has been great variation in their sentencing policies, certainly in the District Court.  We are well aware of a judge who has made some extraordinary decisions, who has dismissed whole rafts of motoring offence cases on the vaguest of technicalities while at the same time imposing a £200 fine on a cyclist riding the wrong way on a one-way street.  There is inconsistency which beats anything that you will discover in fiction.  In the criminal area it is well known that there are judges who are seen to be hard or soft and that lawyers in many instances engineer cases so that their clients can avoid appearing before a particular judge because they feel that they would get a different verdict possibly from another judge.  If juries are abolished it is also likely that judges will get reputations for being generous or tight and that lawyers may engineer artificial delays so that their cases can be heard before a soft judge.  Obviously, insurance companies would try to engineer to get their case before the tight judge and this is likely to lead to more delays and more costs, so where are the savings to be made in that regard?</P>
    <P>A significant point that those seeking a change in the system have not mentioned is that many cases in which awards were made by a jury in the High Court are brought before the Supreme Court and that they are coming up regularly more and more in higher courts so that there is a fairly regular review of compensation awards.  Apart from all of the arguments about costs and savings here, there and everywhere, and the question <Col N="515" /> of comparing premiums here and in Britain, the fundamental case is that juries are a part of our legal proceedings.  If the jury system is abolished in relation to personal injuries, will it be abolished in other cases in which damages are involved? Will it lead eventually to abolishing juries in criminal cases?  The involvement of ordinary citizens in the law by membership of juries is a desirable and democratic procedure.</P>
    <P>It was not too long ago that juries were selected on the basis that they were property owners.  When that was changed to a position where any made over 21 could be a member of a jury, it was hailed as a great advance &mdash; and so it was.  It was even more recent that women attained the right to serve on juries.  That was achieved because a couple of women some years ago brought a case to the Supreme Court to establish their right to serve on juries. The abolition of juries and the gradual erosion of the power of juries ensures further alienation of people from legal procedures.  Under the Criminal Justice Act unanimity of the jury is no longer required in criminal cases.</P>
    <P>I oppose the Bill.  I am not convinced that it is anything other than a device by the insurance companies, the banks and the CII to save to few pounds in legal fees. In listening to the Minister I detected that he was not all that keen on processing the Bill throught the House.  For instance, he distanced himself from the primary argument of the insurance industry which is based on comparative costs with the UK.  He clearly indicated that he did not accept that as a valid argument.  If he disputes that, where does the case of the insurance companies lie?  I cannot see where it has been made by the Minister or other speakers in this debate to date.</P>
    <P>I urge the House to oppose the Bill.  I do not think that all Deputies fully realise its implications.  It has been described as the Courts Bill.  In the nature of things, Deputies will take an interest only in what is brought to their attention, what they are asked to speak on if the electorate contact them about something that <Col N="516" /> concerns them.  I have not come across any demand in my constituency for the abolition of juries in these cases.  The only representations I have got for abolition were from the Federation of Insurers and the CII.  For obvious reasons, I am reluctant to go along with them at the best of times.  However, they have mounted a very clever campaign by holding out the carrot of lower premiums if they manage to do away with juries in compensation cases.  If you study the statements carefully, you will see that they do not offer cheaper premiums.  The Taoiseach announced on the radio that premiums would fall if juries were abolished but he has gone back on that statement and has indicated that he does not think they will fall but that perhaps they might be stabilised.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the House to oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>Unlike the previous speaker, I am very much in favour of this Bill.  I disagree with Deputy De Rossa as I believe the Bill will have a major effect on the cost of motor insurance in particular.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as the Minister said, provides that actions in the High Court for damages for personal injuries will in future be tried by a judge sitting alone rather than by a judge and jury as is the case at present.  However, juries will remain available in cases involving false imprisonment, intentional trespass against the person which will include assault even if the damages claimed include damages for personal injury. Juries will also continue to serve in actions for defamation, malicious prosecution and for certain probate and matrimonial matters.  Our party support that. The public debate over the last few years has drawn attention to the consequences there may be for the cost of insurance if a measure like this is adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa spoke about the vested interests, the power of the elite and of industry in particular.  I have also been lobbied in relation to this matter over the last few weeks by the General Council of the Bar of Ireland.  I received <Col N="517" /> a letter from Mr. Patrick McEntee on their behalf and he argues very coherently and logically against this measure. There is merit in some of his comments but there are two sides to this issue and it would be unfair of me or anybody else who favours it to suggest that it is a panacea for all our ills or that the simple abolition of the right to have one's case tried before a jury in personal injury cases will of itself end the excessive awards which have been granted in recent years. We all know that there have been many cases where individuals received awards out of all proportion to the amount of pain and suffering caused.  While it is very difficult to estimate financial awards for pain and suffering, nonetheless, at times one can see that excessive awards have been granted.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in conjunction with recent decisions by the Supreme Court, will go a long way towards avoiding the payment of excessive awards.  It will also have the effect of allowing us to have more consistency and predictability in awards.  The fact that there is very little consistency at present and that awards are unpredictable means difficulty for the insurance industry.  It also means that very few people are prepared to settle out of court because, despite advice they may get from their solicitor, they are very often under the impression that if they go before a jury the case will be assessed more favourably and they will get a better deal.</P>
    <P>The present law in regard to negligence requires proof of fault before the plaintiff can succeed.  Accident litigation occupies a great deal of judicial time and it has been argued that the system is inefficient and should be replaced by a no-fault system of liability.  Indeed, the Minister spoke about the need to examine whether we should continue to have a fault based system or to consider having a no-fault system.  He said that there should be more investigation and discussion in this regard and that will obviously take place. Two important changes which are about to be implemented and which could help to speed up litigation and reduce court costs should be noted whether we talk <Col N="518" /> about fault-based or no fault-based systems.  This Courts Bill will remove the right to a jury trial in the vast majority of personal injury cases.  The two senior rule will be discarded as a consequence of this and this is also very welcome.</P>
    <P>Many of the speakers in this debate have gone to great lengths to deal with the defects at the moment, particularly in relation to the number of people driving uninsured vehicles.  Deputy Flynn referred to questions he asked the Minister concerned about the decision to make it compulsory to display a disc on one's car from 1 July.  He indicated to the House that he was unable to get very clear details from the Minister about the nature of the disc, the colour, the size and so on.  I hope this matter will not be delayed because it will go a long way towards ensuring that fewer people drive uninsured vehicles.  It must be a concern to all of us.  In recent years I have dealt with cases where people have been injured by uninsured vehicles.  It is very annoying and it is a major factor in the high cost of motor insurance.  We must not under-estimate the impact that has. Simply abolishing juries will not solve the problem of the high cost of motor insurance if many vehicles are still driven without insurance.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in the recent past juries have awarded very inflated sums to individuals.  It must be remembered that many of these awards were set aside and reduced on appeal to the Supreme Court.  Yet juries did set high standards for settlements in the vast majority of cases which never came to court.  Ironically in recent years jury awards, influenced by high insurance costs and the collapse of insurance companies, have become more moderate and this is welcome.  Awards by judges alone to compensate persons who have suffered serious damage will not be significantly lower; this will always be a costly business.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to justify the continuance of the two senior rule which I believe is a restrictive practice.  Its abolition will probably have very little effect on insurance premiums but, in the long run, <Col N="519" /> it will have an effect on the procedures in the court and on the involvement of two or more members of the legal profession in very many cases.  It has been argued inside and outside this House that in some cases one can have up to eight lawyers in a case.  This is a disgrace and it has to be very costly for the individuals involved.  Equally the duplication involved is unnecessary.  It is time this practice was abolished.</P>
    <P>The new rules of court to be introduced this year will help to streamline and improve the general efficiency in our court system.  But the preparation of any case of importance will always be a complicated and lengthy process if justice is to be done.  Many Members of the House felt that the passing of this Bill would help to speed up the hearing of cases before our courts.  I hope that will be the case.  But the preparation of evidence will always take a considerable length of time. I do not know what the actual effect of this measure will be on the length of time it will take to have a case heard before our courts.  But one would hope that it will have a significant effect on lessening the timespan and ensuring that cases are heard more quickly.</P>
    <P>Much discussion on this Bill has centred around the effect it will have on the awards themselves, on the taking of the cases before the courts and on whether or not the sum awarded to a person for a particular injury can, ten years down the road, be still adequate or excessive, on the fact that one is asked to look into the future and predict what is going to happen.  It is for that reason that I think after some time there should be the possibility of having cases reviewed.  We believe that the introduction of instalment awards would improve the situation; people would get instalments annually and these awards would be reviewed after a couple of years to see if the details given at the time the case was heard before the court had come to pass. Many people get rather high awards and, five, six or seven years down the road, one discovers that the injury may not have had as major an effect on the life of <Col N="520" /> the person as had been anticipated.  It would be a good idea if we could examine the possibility of introducing instatement awards, and reviewing such instalment or lump sum awards every couple of years and keeping cases under constant review, particularly in relation to injuries that occur to very young people.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa said the abolition of the jury system would mean that ordinary citizens would not now have any say in the kind of damages awarded to individuals. It is true that the jury system has served us well but we cannot say that a jury composed of a number of people will make a fairer, more just award than one individual judge sitting in judgement.  That is a very subjective view to take.  I believe most members of the Judiciary are reasonable people; they will look honestly and fairly at the cases before them; they will listen to the evidence that comes before them on behalf of the person who has suffered the injury; and they will try to decided, on the legal advice presented to them in the court, what a fair and adequate sum might be.</P>
    <P>I sometimes think that one person in that situation, sitting in on many cases and being able to compare cases and see how people in different situations are affected, might be in a better position than a jury that sits once only on a particular case and where the individuals have never come across the circumstance before.  This may well produce a fairer and better result.  One would hope that there will be no injustice done and that no individual who has suffered serious damage will have to lose as a result of the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the abolition of the jury system in personal injury cases will have the effect of ending the inconsistency in many court cases, not just in relation to personal injury awards but in our court system generally.  There have been many calls inside and outside this House for greater consistency in sentencing as well as in relation to awards made to individuals. This must be a good thing.  Whilst we all realise that circumstances are different <Col N="521" /> there are times when in similar circumstances very different awards are paid to individuals.</P>
    <P>Equally, we will have to become more viligant in relation to drunken driving laws.  We have fairly strict drunken driving laws but I do not think they have had the desired effect, perhaps because they have not been implemented effectively because the Garda have not the resources. We have not been as viligant as we might be.  We still have a high incidence of people driving cars under the influence of alcohol and that is to be regretted because there have been very serious accidents as a result and serious damage done to individuals and families.  I cannot over-emphasise the need to be ever vigilant in ensuring that our drunken driving laws are observed and enforced.  We must be extremely strict in dealing with people who drive cars under the influence of considerable amounts of alcohol.  We have to be viligant in ensuring that those who drive vehicles are properly and adequately insured.  These two measures alone could have a significant effect on the cost of motor insurance and of insurance in general.</P>
    <P>I know that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses looked at the question of the cost of insurance to employers and they were talking in particular about small companies.  The cost is rather enormous and it is particularly difficult for those involved in small companies to bear the cost of insuring their employees againsts any injuries that might occur in the work place.  Many take the view that the employer must accept all the risk for any injury in the work place. We must continue to have a fault based system in these circumstances to ensure that, if the fault rests with the employer, that is where the responsibility will lie. We must realise, however, the burden that this places on employers and people in industry and the resulting unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are many who say that individuals like to serve on juries and that it is a right which very few people would freely give up; but in the course of my work as a public representative I frequently get <Col N="522" /> requests to have people taken off jury service.  It does not seem to be popular with most people.  I was interested to learn from the Minister's Second Stage speech that only 30 per cent of those called for jury service turn up and serve on juries.  This involves as considerable amount of work for the court authorities who must call so many people, 70 per cent of whom do not turn up.  There is obviously a huge administrative burden imposed, at a fairly high cost, in calling so many people to serve.  The fact that it is not very popular may not be a reason for abolishing juries, but in the Circuit Court since 1972 I understand that a jury has not sat in civil action cases on personal injuries claims.  If a judge can do a good job at Circuit Court level, why can it not be done well at High Court level?  Although one is talking about different amounts of money, the principle is very much the same.</P>
    <P>The Prices Advisory Committee on motor insurance, known as the MacLiam Committee, concluded in their report in 1982, although recommending the retention of the jury system, that there was a need to deal with the problems of inconsistency and unpredictability in the awards being made before the courts and the effect this was having on industry, particularly on the motor industry.  I do not know how one could deal with this problem if one does not abolish juries. I cannot see a way out other than the decisions of the Supreme Court in which they made it very clear that certain limits must apply and that awards over those limits cannot be granted except in very exceptional circumstances.  However, the limits that they have applied are rather high and in the ordinary run of the mill average case it would be very hard to avoid a huge amount of inconsistency and unpredictability.  One would hope that the judges sitting in these cases would to a large degree ensure consistency across the board so that people in very similar circumstances will get fairly similar awards.  In many criminal cases defendants know that if they go before Judge X they will get off or will have the benefit of the Probation Act, but if they go <Col N="523" /> before Judge Y they will be sent away.  I hope we will not have the same difference with regard to awards as we have in sentences imposed in the Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>Many have argued for the Oireachtas to set down very stringent limits as to what can be granted in particular cases. It would be difficult to compile a long list of suitable awards for any situation which might arise.  Circumstances differ and two people in exactly the same accident can often end up with very different injuries. It would be almost an endless list, because of the many different effects which accidents can cause.  If we could compile such a list and make it work there would be no need for courts.  Courts are there to sit in judgement to decide who is at fault, whether a particular award should be granted and who is responsible for the damages.</P>

      <P>I know that there has been opposition to the Bill, but I have not heard very many speeches.  In those that I heard there was much agreement. Some of the points made by those opposed to the Bill are worthy of consideration. There is a lot of merit in them.  The position is not as clear-cut as it could be, but the passing of this legislation and the effect of the abolition of juries in personal injury cases on balance would have a good effect, both in terms of the cost of insurance and the delays involved in bringing cases before the courts.  It is hoped that it will lead to consistency, more predictability and that justice would be done and be seen to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa said that very few people had approached him about this matter and among the public in general there is not very much interest in this Bill.  It is only those who have been affected, who have gone through the mill and have had to appear before a court <Col N="524" /> who have a particular interest in it.  The interest appears to be from the insurance industry and from industry in general, from employers and also from lawyers who appear fairly unanimous in their opposition, and one wonders why.  They appear to think that juries are preferable to judges deciding in certain circumstances. With the exception of those who are very much involved in vested interests, to use Deputy De Rossa's term, the public on balance are not interested.  The effects of this legislation, allied with the Supreme Court decisions, will be good and it is hoped will lead to cheaper insurance and will be successful in that we will not regret having done something that is unjust or unfair.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harney has given some of the most cogent reasons that I have heard for retaining the jury system and not leaving the determination of these issues to a judge sitting alone. Her heart is not in this debate, but she does express a hope that the judges might be consistent.  There is a heavier hand, a stronger conviction among the Progressive Democrats who have spoken for the proposal to support the abolition of juries than Deputy Harney believes, but that is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must declare a certain professional interest, although it is a long way from what might have been declared as a personal interest in the days when the Minister's predecessor from my county, Minister Moran, used to charge those from the Fine Gael benches who had come from the law courts as coming from the lucrative vineyards, having finished their trade on the day and come over for a passing visit to Leinster House.  While I declare a personal interest as a member of the Bar for over 26 years, the fact that I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for almost 21 of those years must show that the amount of time that I spend in practice these days is very limited.  I leave it to the judgement of the House as to whether my pretty constant attendance here, which I believe any day will measure up to that of any other Member of the House, will demonstrate that I am <Col N="525" /> not making a lucrative income from the profession in which I would otherwise be engaged.</P>
    <P>I come to some of the points raised by Deputy Harney, which bear analysis in the first instance.  The Deputy referred particularly to the abolition of the right to jury trial.  That is what the Government are proposing in this Bill.  With regard to measures established and respected, such as a right to trial by jury in this instance, the House should think long and hard before reacting to the pressure groups, to prejudice, or to self-interest of any one element.  If somebody said that as the Bar were making a very lucrative profit from these matters let us abolish the Bar, there could be a case for doing so; but the fact that there might be somebody who would benefit willynilly because of the jury system does not justify abolishing that system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney said that this measure will not bring down insurance costs.  The major issue which is being presented to us is that it will bring down insurance costs.  She is not alone in saying that.  The representatives of the insurance industry agree with that.  Their spokesman, Mr. Dermot Ryan, stated categorically that the abolition of juries will not reduce insurance premiums.  If this Bill will not reduce insurance premiums, one has to ask what is the purpose of it.  Is it to enhance the profits of the insurance companies? Is it to enable them to secure a greater and more constant source of income and to pay out less to those who are insured with them for the purpose of protecting themselves against claim or injury?  If that is the case, this House should be in no way a party to such a proposal from any section in the community.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the insurance industry for making a case which would enable them to enhance their profits.  To the extent that I practise now, I represent insurance companies at least as much as I do plaintiff interests.  That is not very much in any event.  To that extent I am speaking against my part time employees.  Insurance companies are entitled to make this case.  Other people <Col N="526" /> do it also but that does not mean we in the Oireachtas should abolish the right of trial by jury which is very important in terms of justice for people who suffer serious injury and who will have in many cases if not permanent defects very serious ones because of accidents at work or car accidents.  It is not fair or right to propose that juries should be abolished on that basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned seven or eight different options which the Government had considered including retaining the present system, a tribunal, trial by judge alone, trial by judge with assessors and trial having defined the limit of the issues beforehand.  Without giving any argument whatsoever he then stated baldly that the Government decided to accept the proposal to abolish trial by jury and to introduce instead trial by judge alone. There was no case, no argument and no attempt to say why any of the other options were discarded.  The House is entitled to much more than that from any Government who propose to abolish what is an established right for citizens who are injured in accidents.</P>
    <P>Juries deal not only with the amount of awards but also with the question of liability.  In regard to what is reasonable between citizens it used to be said in England that it was the standard of the man on the Clapham omnibus meaning a regular representative citizen.  It could be the man walking along O'Connell Street, may be unemployed as many of them are, if there is such a thing as a representative person in our society.  That is the standard of care that juries establish.  Whatever we say about the level of knowledge of the law of juries, when it comes to making a judgement as to whose fault something is I cannot think of anyone better qualified than 12 people selected from among ourselves to decide whether or not an accident either at work or in a motor car was the fault of the person against whom the claim was made.</P>
    <P>For a very considerable time they have been apportioning liability between the plaintiff and the defendant.  In many cases they decide that the accident was 75 per cent the fault of the defendant and <Col N="527" /> 25 per cent the fault of the plaintiff.  The best example would be in relation to people who do not wear seat belts and who suffer accidents or injuries which might have been prevented had they been wearing seat belts.  We are talking about standards of reasonable people.  Any lawyer dealing with a case like that which goes before a jury, where the person injured was not wearing a seat belt which was available, will immediately reduce the gross value of the settlement by 25 per cent in the knowledge that if he does not do it the jury will do it for him.  They have done so very consistently.</P>
    <P>In this instance if a jury are delegated to make a judgement in a criminal matter as to whether or not a person is guilty beyond reasonable doubt, surely they are equally and uniquely qualified to make a judgement as to the balance of probabilities, the fault of one or other of the parties.  Any one of us would inevitably have a subjective view in a matter that is and always has been a matter of common sense.  There is no point in pretending we would not.  We would endeavour to be fair and objective according to the highest standards of the Judiciary of Ireland, which is of the highest standard, particularly in the High Court.  The present High Court bench is one that any country in the world would be very proud of.  They would acknowledge, both personally and collectively, that they have different judgments of standards in terms of making a decision as to whose fault something was.  How would they otherwise argue?  Deputy De Rossa, Deputy Harney, the Minister or myself would have different opinions.  If there were eight more of us we would have the average decision as to whose fault something was.  The Government propose to abolish that.  They are making a mistake.  It is retrograde particularly as the case is not based on reduction of costs to employers in terms of insurance premiums, to motorists or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I will demonstrate a couple of developments of recent times.  The case of <i>Cooke and Walshe</i> was taken to the Supreme <Col N="528" /> Court a few years ago, which the Government are now proposing to correct by way of legislation which is their right.  In that case the Supreme Court held that henceforth where a person is liable for cover under general social welfare insurance or medical card care &mdash; our general insurance applies to the vast bulk of our employees &mdash; the hospital and medical expenses in respect of a person injured in an accident are not now chargeable against the defendant.</P>
    <P>In this instance, in effect, it is not chargeable against the insurance company. Since the decision in <i>Cooke and Walshe</i> the State now provides, as it would in any case, for the costs of the medical, maintenance and hospital care of persons injured in accidents.  The bill has been passed from the insurance companies to the State.  The insurance companies are not able to tell us what the reductions in their costs were as a consequence of that decision in <i>Cooke and Walshe</i>.  They should be able to because it is very easy to quantify and to indicate what it has meant to them either in savings or in enhanced income.  The general estimate is that it represents something of the order of £4 million per annum, maybe a bit less, maybe a bit more as sometimes we are talking about very heavy costs.</P>
    <P>Since <i>Cooke and Walshe</i>, insurance premiums have not gone down one farthing. Some may say one has to take the rough with the smooth.  If one gets a bonus in a Supreme Court decision, he is entitled to it.  One is equally entitled to say, if that has been the consequence, why should we begin to believe it is going to be passed on directly now?  In fairness to the insurance companies and in particular to their spokesman, Mr. Ryan, they do not claim it will.  Therefore, what is this about?  It is simply about reducing the awards which may be given to plaintiffs. Even that may not be achieved.  I was very impressed by the points made by Deputies De Rossa and Harney in terms of consistency.  I have to say to Deputy Harney faint dreams and foolish hopes.  We may never see the consistency she spoke about in terms of judges' <Col N="529" /> awards for damages.  In the very same breath as Deputy Harney suggested that we hope to get consistency in terms of judges' awards she also acknowledged it is a matter of some concern that we are not getting consistency in sentencing in the courts.  I want to ask the House if that is a matter of concern.  I am not going to comment on whether or not people are concerned but there have been some decisions which have caused me concern in terms of inconsistency.</P>
    <P>Remember this, two points follow.  The Judiciary are independent under the Constitution. No one can say anything to the Judiciary as to whether or not they should change their sentencing policy.  Of course, we can express views publicly but effectively we can do nothing to bring about a change in sentencing policy.  We can encourage them and suggest to them that they should meet more regularly and compare sentences.  We could suggest to them we should not get extremes at both ends.  That is as far as we can go.  If that is the case in terms of sentencing, will someone please indicate to me why suddenly we expect in terms of awards to plaintiffs who are injured there will be total consistency?  This is not by way of criticism of judges but each of us as an individual has a different sense of values. It is a fact, no more, no less, that some judges have a different sense of monetary value.  Some in their own way might be people of a rather broad attitude.  Maybe some are very big spenders.  Others may be much more prudent.  Others whom I will not accuse of being miserly would not be known as expansive in their normal social attitudes.</P>
    <P>I want to record that the High Court is an excellent bench.  Any experienced practising lawyer could tell us this now as I can from my own experience.  If I am told tomorrow morning that I was in before Mr. Justice X, I would say let us go ahead but then if I was told tomorrow morning I was going to be in before Mr. Justice Y I would say we had better settle this quickly because I know, as everyone down there knows, that the monetary values and assessments of individuals are different.  That must not, as I hope it will <Col N="530" /> not, be taken as a criticism.  That is what the jury system is about.  That is what it is there to protect against.  I cannot say this definitely but I have a fairly informed opinion that the Minister who made some reference to this in his opening speech is incorrect.  If we take a straw poll amongst the current excellent High Court judges &mdash; it is not they are anxious to avoid work because juries do not mean less work for them &mdash; we will find that the majority of judges have come to the view that the present system is better and fair.  I cannot put it beyond that, as no one can do a poll.  It would be wrong.  No one from the Department of Justice can go to them and say which way do they want it.  There may have been prior consultation.  If they want to refer to consultations they had better go back and make sure they update them before statements are made in the House which suggest that the judges want the abolition of juries.  I am not speaking for them and, therefore, I do not know. If one contacts people who are more regularly in contact with them one will find that they recognise on balance that the jury system is the best one in principle.</P>
    <P>That said, there are improvements which can be made.  They must be made to ensure a better system and consistency and anything which will help the 12 citizens to discharge their duties more effectively between other citizens who have a claim one against the other.  Some of these improvements are obvious.  I am talking only of legal procedures.  There is no reason in the world a jury should not be told what are the general parameters or guidelines for damages in individual cases.  There is no reason in the world juries cannot be told why the Supreme Court laid down that the maximum for general damages for pain and suffering is £150,000 for the more serious injuries.  What increases the award after that is actuarial evidence for loss of income.  There is no reason juries cannot be told that the maximum which the Supreme Court hold tolerable for the loss of an eye is £60,000 in certain cases; that in the case at hearing, perhaps, the amount is somewhat less.  There <Col N="531" /> is no reason at all juries should not be told that if they award a sum in excess of that they are exceeding the norms set by the Supreme Court, that almost certainly the award will be set aside on appeal.</P>
    <P>Why should that not be done?  Judges' rules can be changed.  Up to this point the judges' rules have not provided such guidelines but I cannot see any reason such guidelines cannot be given to juries. I see every reason for their being given because it would be difficult for any of us, no matter how professional, to estimate the value of general damages. Guidelines should be given as to what the Supreme Court have observed and regulated constantly as being acceptable as maximums.  That should be done.  It would be very helpful to juries and would enable them to discharge their responsibilities in a more satisfying and effective way.  The Minister did not even refer to that.  He referred to it as being one of the options.  But he made no case, good, bad or indifferent, for dismissing or excluding it.  He owes it to the House, and to the public through this House, to come in and tell us why not.  I know it is one option that lawyers and jurors also would strongly favour.</P>
    <P>As to the amount of awards generally, the main element in some major cases emanates from what is called actuarial evidence, not just compensation for pain and suffering but rather for what is clearly identifiable and established as loss of income potential.  When doctors establish beyond doubt that a person will be unable to work again or, alternatively, will be unable to continue in the same job or similar type of work but will have to take a job at a lower level of income, the standard practice is to say: if that is the case established on medical evidence &mdash; and it is medical evidence only that establishes it because a judge would not allow actuarial evidence unless that was clearly established &mdash; then an actuary comes in in his professional capacity.  Actuaries can be expensive but they constitute important elements of such cases.  They calculate, by projecting into the future, the value of that loss of income to the <Col N="532" /> claimants.  While there is not an absolute obligation on juries to include that &mdash; they will hear perhaps conflicting evidence or presentations from the lawyers representing both sides &mdash; they will have the actuarial evidence to guide them and it is that evidence in terms of loss of future income that really accounts for the major damages.</P>
    <P>No judge will change that.  A judge will not ignore the fact that a person earning, say, £8,000 per annum at a certain job will be unable as a consequence of his or her accident to perform that task any longer, or has not done so for two or three years.  He may now be employed on a job earning £4,500.  One does one's actuarial calculation on the differential of £3,500 up to normal retirement age of 65 and that is how one arrives at the appropriate compensatory figure.  Therefore it is in respect of young people injured that the major awards are occasioned &mdash; the paraplegics, the quadriplegics &mdash; because their income capacity will have been reduced.  In other cases medical care may be necessary for the remainder of their lives which is also calculated on an actuarial basis.  Therefore, it is not a question of somebody saying: throw this in because of the general pain and suffering in the case of the loss of an eye, a leg or brain damage.  Juries do not go wild that way.  The figure is arrived at on the basis of the actuarial calculation of medical costs into the future or loss of income. Who is to say that that is not fair?</P>
    <P>People have talked about delays in the system.  Any lawyer with any experience would be very reluctant to bring on a case for trial in the High Court certainly within two years of an accident for the obvious reason that, before that time has elapsed, there will not have been a clear prognosis by the medical experts as to the permanent and final outcome.  One must wait at least two years from the date of accident for a proper trial to take place when one will know the full consequences of the injuries.  In some cases, in the interests of a client, one may decide that it should be delayed three or four years. People tend to say that juries cause delays.  For what it is worth let it be said <Col N="533" /> that in most cases now one can put a case down for trial in, say, Trim or Dundalk for the next session and it will be heard in the next session.  If one puts a case down for trial in Limerick and the next session has begun, it will be heard within that session; likewise in the case of Cork with three judges sitting.  Any case set down for trial is now being reached within a maximum of six months.  Probably it is still a little longer in Dublin but the time lag is reducing considerably.  I want to pay a special tribute to Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, President of the High Court, who has so organised the business of the courts as to ensure by way of the efficiency of the system, that cases come for trial much faster.  In any of the venues one will not find a delay of more than six to nine months and, in some cases, there is no delay at all.  Delays such as occur take place deliberately because sufficient time is required to elapse before one can take decisions as to the final outcome.</P>
    <P>Therefore I do not think people should contend that trial by judges alone will be much quicker.  Let me advance a reason why I believe it will involve greater delay, not in the conduct of cases because cases will be dealt with more quickly when they do get to court &mdash; I acknowledge that &mdash; there will be no need to address juries on what are their legal obligations, on what is their role and that of the judge; there will be no need for that, a judge will start right into a case on the evidence.  With the option of seven judges dealing with High Court actions in terms of liability and awards does anybody think that people will not wait until the last minute to see which judge will handle their case? In my view that system will mean that, instead of cases being settled earlier, it will be much later, that there will be more cases tried.  Given one's range of experience of individual judges, if people discover that if their case goes before Mr. Justice X they will get an acceptable settlement, people will wait until the last minute.  They will put their case down for trial.  Then perhaps when they see it going before Justice Y, they will decide that is not so good, that they have come out badly from the draw, when there will be <Col N="534" /> a rush for settlement.  On the other hand, if it looks good, if one's case is coming before a judge with a different view the insurance company may decide to push for settlement.  It has been the experience in England that the system does not reduce delay, quite the opposite.  When juries were abolished in the High Court in England &mdash; I accept that awards came down, although Deputy Harney made an important point in relation to recent jury awards &mdash; the Minister will discover that the system there could not have been operated were it not for the fact that 42 extra judges had to be appointed to cope with the increased volume of work because cases were being brought to trial that otherwise might have been settled out of court.  In terms of scale that 42 there might have to be four here; I do not know.  That is something that will have to be considered here.  Yet we are talking about saving the taxpayer costs.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Harney and De Rossa mentioned the general cost of insurance and uninsured driving.  Normally, if one were to draw a line across the most serious accidents, those involving the most horrific injuries, one would discover that they occur to a much greater extent with uninsured drivers than with the conventional, prudent driver who provides his own insurance.  The most horrific injuries occur as a result of either uninsured or drunken driving.  One would not have to spend too much time demonstrating why that is the case.  The real issue which was addressed by both Deputies Harney and De Rossa this evening was: what are we going to do about uninsured driving.  If we are interested in reducing cost is it not time the Government faced their real responsibility, as Governments must, of ensuring that the incidence of uninsured driving is reduced dramatically because it must be.</P>

      <P>Deputy <Col N="535" /> Frank Cluskey has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of renewed support by Libya for the IRA. He has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter in the House.  I regard as very serious the report widely carried in this morning's newspapers and also on RTE that a delegation of European Parliamentarians from Germany stated that the second-in-command of the Libyan regime indicated to them that because of the US bombing of Libya and the co-operation of the United Kingdom in that operation they were considering resuming support for the Provisional IRA.  In our circumstances we must take this statement by the German MEPs very seriously indeed.  We are not talking about people who might possibly be toying around with the idea of entering into this field; we are talking about a regime which we know in the past supplied arms, et cetera, to the Provisional IRA.  That type of support has led directly to the deaths of Irish men and women, irrespective of their religious or political persuasion.  This House, not just the Government, must take the reports very seriously.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what the Government have done since the reports became known to establish what precisely was said by the Libyan authorities and whether they clearly indicated their intention to resume support for the Provisional IRA.  If the Government have already made inquiries, did they find the statements made by the German MEPs to be accurate?  If so, has any message been expressed by the Irish Government to the Libyan authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had what I can only describe as the unpleasant experience of visiting Libya in the mid-seventies shortly after the arrest of the <i>Claudia</i> off the Irish coast when it was found to be loaded with the means of death and destruction among Irish men and women.  It was proved that that consignment at least originated in <Col N="536" /> Libya.  I was a Parliamentary Secretary in the Coalition Government and I joined in a parliamentary delegation to visit Libya.  I went with the express purpose of ensuring that the Libyan authorities were left in no doubt as to the attitude of the Irish Government and of all the parties in this House at that time in regard to support for the Provisional IRA or any other group or grouping intent on murdering Irish men and women to achieve their so-called political ends.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of that visit was the activity of some of the businessmen from Ireland who were running around Libya.  In my opinion they were there to enhance their own position, not that of Ireland.  Because of the system that operates in that country they went there to obtain agencies and in order to do so they were quite prepared to make what they regarded as the appropriate noises to the Libyans so that their visit would accrue to their advantage.  If it has accrued to their advantage there is no question that it has been very much to the detriment of this country and its citizens. I have no reason to believe that this activity is not continuing and it is one to which any Irish Government should give very close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>If the Libyan authorities are seriously considering resuming their support for the murder gangs operating in this country, we have a responsibility to ensure that there is no ambiguity as to our attitude to any regime or group that would support their type of activity.  Only the other night we saw on our television screens the body of a man whose hands had been tied behind his back before he was shot.  One would not treat an animal the way they treated that man.  His body was left for 12 hours because the security forces were afraid to approach his remains. That is just one example of what support from Libya can lead to for our fellow Irish men and women.  I make no distinction as to what side of the Border they live, what party they support or what God or religion, if any, they subscribe to.</P>
    <P>There are two choices but one of them is unacceptable to me.  This type of activity by Libya can be met by trying to kill <Col N="537" /> Libyans, which I would totally reject, or by the application of economic sanctions. I would have no hesitation in urging the Government to apply economic sanctions.  Not only should we convey that to the Libyan authorities but we should urge our EC partners to apply economic sanctions.  We tend to be somewhat selective about this.  There does not seem to be much dissent in Ireland in regard to calling for economic sanctions against South Africa.  I subscribe to that because I think it is the only possible alternative, the only possible chance of avoiding a blood bath in that sad country.</P>
    <P>I note that this week in Paris the Taoiseach called for economic sanctions against South Africa but if we have a moral responsibility towards the people of South Africa, which I believe we have, then surely we have at least the same moral responsibility towards Irish men and women.  However, if we were to apply economic sanctions against Libya certain sections of our business community would exert every conceivable pressure on political parties and politicians here.  There would be the valid arguments that we would lose trade with the consequent loss of jobs.  As far as I am concerned the choice is: are we prepared to make some economic sacrifice to save Irish lives.</P>
    <P>When we talk about having two choices it is worth recording that it was a sad day for me when our Government refused to condemn the United States bombing of Libya when the matter was raised in the House.  There were other ways of dealing with the support for terrorism emanating from Libya but the choice made was the hard one, strike Libya, kill some Libyans even though they are innocent people, rather than apply economic sanctions which would hurt the business communities in western countries.  On that day Ireland lost a lot of its moral authority in international fora by not condemning, without reservation, that activity by the United States.</P>
    <P>I accept that the introduction of economic sanctions would provoke a certain reaction from the business community here.  Those same gentlemen would <Col N="538" /> weep tears over the loss of jobs that would follow the introduction of sanctions.  I accept there would be a loss of jobs but I find it difficult to accept that that would be the main consideration of those people particularly when one considers how readily some of those gentlemen can close down their factories when there is not an adequate profit to be made out of the contracts they have.</P>
    <P>There is another side to this matter. The security forces here, in co-operation with security forces in other countries, have in recent months been very successful in intercepting arms from the United States and European countries destined for the IRA and other terrorist organisations. I regard that as a very welcome development.  It would be a great tragedy if following that success we are to be faced with a resumption of support by way of arms or money to the provisional IRA from Libya.  Those who look at the question of sanctions in purely economic terms must also consider that the activities of those murder gangs in this country, and on this island, are costing the Irish taxpayer in excess of £100 million per year.  Even in economic terms there is a very good argument for the application of sanctions if it is established that this statement was made by the Libyan authorities.</P>
    <P>I noticed in this evening's newspapers that many parties in the House voiced their serious concern about the statement alleged to have been made by a very senior member of the Libyan regime. However, I am concerned that the main Opposition party, as far as I know, have not voiced, as yet, any concern over this serious and dangerous development.  I hope, particularly against the background of the relationship I understand the Leader of the main Opposition party has with the Libyan authorities, that he will realise the importance of a clear message going out on behalf of the Irish people from all parties represented in the House, in particular from the main Opposition party, to the Libyan authorities.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us the results of the Government's inquiries in regard to <Col N="539" /> the statement?  If it is established that the statement was made, and that there is an intention by the Libyan authorities to resume supplying these murder gangs, I hope there will be a clear and unequivocal condemnation by all parties in the House of that intention.  I hope, there will be a unanimous decision by the House for the application by Ireland of sanctions against Libya and that we will actively engage ourselves within the EC, and other international fora, in calling for an extension of those economic sanctions. Serious though the application of sanctions would be, hurtful though they will be not only for the Libyans but for us, they are preferable to the taking of any human life and preferable to us sitting back and merrily continuing to trade with people who would supply the murderers of Irish men and women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to speak on this matter. I welcome this opportunity to express my concern at the reports of Libya renewing its support for the IRA.  These reports originate from a press interview given by a European parliamentary delegation in Tripoli during a recent visit there when the delegation was received by Major-General Ahmed Jalloud.  I have had the press sources checked and I am satisfied that they reflect accurately the substance of the press interview.</P>
      <P>I want to set out clearly the Government's policy and to inform the Dáil of the action I have taken.  Any foreign government that support the activities of the provisional IRA, morally or materially, are behaving in an unfriendly way.  I have made this clear to the Libyan authorities in the past and I am doing so again.</P>
      <P>I instructed our Ambassador in Rome today, who is accredited also to Libya, to make an immediate <i>demarche</i> to the Libyan People's Bureau at Rome and to follow this up by an urgent visit to Tripoli.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ambassador will express our grave concern about any support or renewal of support by Libya for the Provisional <Col N="540" /> IRA; the IRA are the enemy of the Irish State and of the democratically elected institutions of this State; Libyan Government support, whether moral or material, for the provisional IRA is unacceptable to us.  The Ambassador will describe the record of terror, suffering and death that is the mark of the IRA and will underline our total rejection of any attempt to promote political objectives by violence or the threat of violence in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have instructed the Ambassador to describe the horror with which patriotic and right minded citizens here regard the acts of the IRA and to give examples of these acts, naming most recently the coldblooded murder of Terence McKeever, an Armagh businessman carrying on his ordinary commercial affairs for the benefit of people North and South.  I know that all Members of this House join with me in condemning this brutal killing by the IRA.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this is not the first time that an Irish Government have had to protest to the Libyan Government because of their statements or actions in support of the IRA.  After the killing of Woman Police Constable Fletcher outside the Libyan People's Bureau in London on 17 April 1984, the Libyan Head of State, Colonel Gadaffi made a number of statements in media interviews about the IRA.  For example, on 2 May 1984 he was quoted as referring to contacts with the IRA in the seventies and to resuming support.  On that occasion our Ambassador on my instructions made a <i>demarche</i> expressing the Government's grave concern at such statements.  Most recently, in January of this year, officials of my Department at a meeting with Libyan diplomats in Dublin again emphasised the Government's concern about Libyan-IRA connections.  We were told on that occasion that Colonel Gadaffi did not support IRA activities.</P>
    <P>I have now asked for firm assurances that the Libyan Government will not encourage the IRA in any way or have contact with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> There is, of course, a wider international dimension to this whole question. As Deputies are aware, I have had opportunities on a number of occasions recently in this House to highlight our profound concern and that of our partners in the European Community about Libyan involvement in international terrorism.</P>
    <P>In recent months within the Twelve we have engaged in an intensive and detailed round of discussions aimed at elaborating an agreed European strategy to confront the challenge of international terrorism and to provide protection against terrorist attack.  We have sought, above all, as an immediate priority, to take action to dissuade Libya in particular from involvement in such terrorism.  These concerns were in fact central to the meetings of the Twelve Foreign Ministers which I attended on 27 January, 14 April and 21 April this year when a number of measures directed against Libya were agreed.</P>
    <P>The measures include a ban on the export of arms or other military equipment to Libya.  The Twelve have agreed that they will do everything in their power to ensure that their nationals and industry do not seek any commercial advantage from measures taken by others against terrorist attack.  They have also adopted measures directed against Libya in the field of diplomatic relations and in the area of stricter visa requirements and procedures.  Furthermore, strengthened co-operation on the problem of the abuse of diplomatic immunity.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, in accord with these agreed decisions, a number of partners already have taken action to reduce the size of Libyan missions in their countries.  Ireland, of course, maintains diplomatic relations with Libya, as I have already said, on a non-residential basis; we have regarded this diplomatic channel as an important part of our effort to ensure that our concerns about terrorism are fully communicated to the Libyan authorities.  We are communicating those concerns again now and we will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The Twelve have taken no decision on the imposition of trade sanctions against <Col N="542" /> Libya.  We and other partners at all times have made clear our reservations on such sanctions.  However, Libya or any other country which supports international terrorism will be in no doubt that they cannot expect to have normal relations with the Twelve.  I should also emphasise that the Twelve have sought to engage interested states, in the Middle East and elsewhere, in a dialogue about international terrorism with a view to mobilising international support for the eradication of this evil phenomenon.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from the comments I have made the very great importance the Government attach to the continuation of a co-ordinated and agreed Twelve response to international terrorism so that the specific concerns of all the member states can find proper reflection in that agreed strategy.  This, I believe, is the course which best ensures that action taken will be effective in discouraging support for terrorism.</P>
    <P>The measures agreed in regard to Libya have been on the basis of the evidence so far available to the member states about Libyan involvement in acts of terrorism and have taken account of the specific concerns which individual member states have about such involvement. If new evidence of Libyan support for terrorism becomes available, the Twelve will decide in the light of any such evidence the further action they should take.  If evidence becomes available of Libyan involvement in the particular problem of terrorism which we face in this island, Deputies may be assured that I will pursue our concerns directly with the Libyan Government and within the framework of the common Twelve approach I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to assure Deputies once again that I share their concerns about terrorism and the role of Libya in such terrorism.  The Government have a record of vigorous action in combating terrorism.  We are proud of that record and will continue to build on it in this country and internationally in co-operation with our partners in Europe.</P>

      <P>asked the <Col N="362" /> Minister for Finance the number of farms classified for purposes of the Farm Tax Act, 1985, at the latest date for which figures are available; the proportion of land holdings that are likely to have been classified by 1 September; when the Farm Tax Commissioner will be obliged to forward a list of classified holdings to the local authorities; if he is satisfied at the rate of classification of holdings; when it is expected that the first payments will be made under the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>By end-May 1986 the Farm Classification Office had determined the adjusted acreage of 2,340 farm holdings.  It is estimated that a total of 2,900 holdings will have been assessed by 1 September 1986.  This figure represents about 3 per cent of the estimated 92,801 holdings over 20 adjusted acres which fall to be assessed under the Farm Tax Act, 1985.  In acreage terms this amounts to 883,585 statute acres, or about 10 per cent of the estimated total of 9 million statute acres to be assessed.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 (5) of the Farm Tax Act, 1985, the Farm Tax Commissioner is required to issue the first classification list to local authorities as soon as may be after 1 September but no later than 30 September 1986.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that every effort is being made to achieve the maximum output possible, bearing in mind the need for accuracy and comparability of evaluation and the legal requirements of the Farm Tax Act.</P>
      <P>Allowing for the formulation, publication and display of the Farm Tax Record and issue of demand notes, the first payments of farm tax would in general become due around end-October, from which time those liable have two months to pay before penal interest accrues on the outstanding amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 to 40, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> In 1980 the Geological Survey carried out a study of the <i>in-situ</i> ore reserves of Bula Limited and concluded that there were 7.8 million tonnes demonstrated (combined proven and probable reserves) in the orebody at 5 per cent combined lead and zinc cut-off grade.  In 1981 the survey concluded that the mineable Bula ore reserves were 6.5 million tonnes at 5 per cent combined lead and zinc cut-off grade.  As I informed the Deputy in reply to a question on 11 June the Geological Survey did not break down the Bula reserves into separate proven and probable categories.</P>
    <P>The survey's figures differ significantly from the figures furnished to me by Bula Limited.  There can be variations of significance in calculations of ore reserves by different experts, depending, among other factors, on the methods of calculation used.  For instance the Geological Survey calculations were done on the basis of a 5 per cent conbined lead and zinc cut-off grade whereas the figures furnished by Bula Limited were calculated on the basis of a 4 per cent zinc equivalent cut-off grade.</P>
    <P>During 1972 and 1973 the Geological Survey had carried out on-going assessments of the Navan ore reserves in the light of emerging information from intensive drilling.  In September 1973 the survey's assessment was that <i>in-situ</i> reserves totalled 69.9 million tonnes of which proven and probably reserves amounted to 24.7 million tonnes at a combined lead and zinc cut-off grade of 4 per cent.  Tara Mines Limited and Bula Limited referred to and used the US Bureau of Mines definitions of proven and probable ore in <Col N="368" /> calculating the ore reserve figures which I furnished to the Deputy in reply to a question on 11 June 1986.  The definitions are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Measured (Proven): Material for which estimates of the quality and quantity have been computed, within a margin of error of less than 20 per cent from sample analyses and measurements from closely spaced and geologically well known sample sites.</P>
    <P>Indicated (Probable): Material for which estimates of the quality and quantity have been computed partly from sample analyses and measurements and partly from reasonable geologic projections.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the first part of the Deputy's question as regards the figures for Tara Mines ore reserves which I gave in my reply to the Deputy's question of 5 June 1986.  The figures I quoted were in respect of ore reserves as at 31 December 1985 which obviously could not have been extracted prior to that date.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by Tara Mines Limited that none of the Tara ore reserves quoted in my reply of 5 June 1986 occurred outside the Tara leasehold area.</P>

A grant of £722 was approved in respect of certain repair works and that grant will be paid within the next few weeks.  Grants could not be allowed for the extension, the installation of windows and other repair work as, contrary to a qualifying condition of the scheme, the particular work had already commenced when the inspector visited the house in December 1985.

      <P>This application was rejected as the required waiting period of seven years between payment of a previous grant on 5 March 1981 in respect of the house and commencement of the new works had not elapsed.  The applicant has been so informed. The approval of a grant in such a case before the expiry of the relevant waiting period arises only where the necessary works are of an emergency nature and are directly attributable to storm damage which arose immediately preceding the making of the particular application.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 78 together. The policy in relation to locating the headquarters of the Central Fisheries Board in Galway has not been changed. Due to the less favourable economic situation which has arisen in the meantime, including particularly the need for constraints on public expenditure as well as difficulties to be negotiated in relation to the transfer of the staff of the board from Dublin to Galway, the implementation of the decision has been delayed.  I am unable to say at this stage when the move to Galway can take place.</P>

      <P>The means in this case were calculated by taking the net weekly earnings of the wife of £57.30 and deducting from it the standard allowance of £45 and rent payable of £2.  The balance of £10.30 was assessed against the claimant as means. He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £82.05 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £92.35 less means of £10.30.</P>

    <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance from 29 December 1985 and his papers were referred to a <Col N="396" /> social welfare officer for investigation of means.  The investigations are taking somewhat longer than normal in this case as the social welfare officer is awaiting a statement from the valuation office regarding the capital value of land owned by the claimant.  However, it is expected that the relevant statement will be furnished shortly.  The social welfare officer will then complete his report and the case will be submitted to a deciding officer for assessment of means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the local District Justice has complained of the condition of Ballycullane Courthouse, County Wexford, and that he indicated that he would not hold his court there again until such time as a vast improvement was made, and if he will ensure that the courthouse which is very central to to the New Ross area will be refurbished as soon as possible, so that no extra expense may be incurred by those attending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the premises in which Ballycullane District Court has been held are in a very dilapidated condition.  The premises are so unsuitable that, in the view of the District Justice who sits there, it is not fitting to the dignity of the court that sittings should continue there and he has, therefore, ceased to hear cases at Ballycullane and requested that I formally approve of the closedown of this District Court venue by the abolition of Ballycullane District Court area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have consented to this request and I will make the formal order in the near future.  In making this decision, I have taken into account the fact that the volume of court business for Ballycullane is small.  The number of cases runs to about 600 per year and about 75 per cent of these are road traffic cases.  Closing the venue, therefore, is unlikely to cause much inconvenience to the local population. On the other hand, closure will assist the streamlining of District Court <Col N="399" /> business in Wexford through the re-allocation of the Ballycullane sitting days. When the order is made, business taken at Ballycullane will, thereafter, be taken Partially at New Ross and partially at Wexford.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Courthouse (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, responsibility rests with the relevant local authority for the provision and maintenance of courthouse accommodation. In the case of Ballycullane, I can see no justification for asking Wexford County Council to spend scarce public money on the provision of proper accommodation.</P>
