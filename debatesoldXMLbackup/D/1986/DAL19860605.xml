      <P>I tried, through a Private Notice Question yesterday, to raise the <Col N="1156" /> continuing dispute in Dublin Corporation. The Minister for Labour is not here now.  Would the Taoiseach give an undertaking today that he will ask the Labour Court to intervene?  Both sides are anxious to go to the Labour Court.  It would help to stop the escalation of the dispute.  Various actions are threatened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day Deputy Woods gave a very in-depth analysis and critique of civil juries and the position in the courts.  It was an analysis of the arguments which were put forward by the Minister in his submission as to whether or not we should have civil juries removed from the High Court in personal injury actions.  This is unfortunate legislation in that the case for it has not been proven.  It has been too readily entered into.  It is an assault on the rights of citizens. That has been happening all too frequently lately; we had it even yesterday and it seems to be a trend.  In this instance it is not only an assault on citizens' rights but it is an assault on citizens who are victims of very serious accidents, <Col N="1161" /> in the main.  It is an assault on people who are very seriously injured, who are often maimed for life and very close to death and who in many cases have to survive rather than live, who may be in a state of paralysis, in a state of brain damage, in a wheelchair, confined to bed or a quadraplegic.  That is unforgiveable if it is not thought out properly, if it has not been the subject of public debate and if there has not been a demand on it and, worst of all, if these people have not been consulted in any manner about whether or not they wish the situation to be changed without consulting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have healthy people deciding in the interests of a few vested interests in this country that we should change a system which has been time honoured and one of the few remaining bastions of freedom and civil rights and social justice whereby a person is tried by his peers in the case of one of the worst things which can befall a human being during the course of his lifetime, that is, to suffer a very serious personal injury and suffer very serious damage both physically and financially to a family, if there is a family involved, whether it is a spouse or whether it happens to be brother, sister or relative who has to take care of that person for the remainder of his life.  This debate came about not as a result of a public outcry; in my view it arose as a result of a very short, sharp prod by one of the most entrenched sectors, namely, the insurance sector.  The insurance companies wanted their costs reduced so that they could earn more profits.  In the space of two weeks they were able to persuade the Government to change their minds and have them declare that it was their intention to introduce legislation to abolish juries in civil action cases.  That was a disgrace and it happened twice within the past six or eight months.  It was later proved that move on the part of the Government was totally wrong and they had to retract and admit their mistake. The Government fell for the same propaganda on the part of the gaming interests, when they introduced emergency legislation within two weeks to increase the stakes in that industry.  In the first case <Col N="1162" /> enormous financial loss and hardship were suffered by citizens.  In this case, in addition to the financial loss and hardship that will be brought about as a result of the abolition of juries, these unfortunate victims will suffer additional pain, physical and otherwise.</P>
    <P>We might pose the question: from where did the demand emanate?  It was not brought about by those people who had their cases tried before a jury.  It did not arise on the part of John Citizen or by way of public demand.  It arose as a result of representations to the Government from the top levels of the insurance industry.  Indeed, it arose as a result of a public relations exercise on the part of that industry who are well able to afford it.  They must have been amused at the quick results of their campaign.</P>
    <P>Many of us in the House know how difficult it is to have any change effected within the bureaucratic system, or within the system of checks and balances obtaining at the different hierarchical levels in our bureaucracy.  It is amazing to note how the rich and powerful can bypass that system.  However, it is not difficult to understand when one remembers that they have easy access to the corridors of power or to ways of getting what they want done.  That is applicable in this industry internationally.  It is applicable in the case of other such powerful bodies, whether they be the multinational, the drug companies, chemical companies or whoever.  In this case the unfortunate Irish man and woman must bear the burden.</P>
    <P>I was particularly disappointed at the arguments advanced by the Minister in his opening remarks.  They were very weak and did not make a case at all for change.  I shall refer to those arguments as we progress.  One might first pose the question: what steps have the insurance companies themselves taken to reduce the amount of awards or damages where they say they are losing out?  Indeed, the insurance companies represent one of the most scorned, derided vested interests in any State, always having been regarded as filthy rich, having unbridled power, <Col N="1163" /> always making enormous profits with very few exceptions.</P>
    <P>I read an article in <i>Business and Finance</i> of 18 July 1985 headed &ldquo;New Life in the Insurance Game&rdquo;.  That article talked about the move away from motor and other forms of insurance into the more lucrative area of life insurance because, it was contended, it was more profitable and stable.  It talked about the key to understanding the recent scramble to buy into the life business &mdash; the difference between life and general insurance &mdash; life insurance being profitable and stable.  It was contended that general insurance is sometimes profitable but always unstable.  It spoke about the difficulties experienced in the recent past with general insurance and the growth experienced in life insurance over the past five years, when the average growth amounted to approximately 20 per cent. The article referred also to the dangerously variable liabilities in the general insurance area &mdash; coming within the scope of the provisions of this Bill, personal injuries &mdash; contending that even experienced actuaries have a difficult time attempting to second guess juries and potential awards.  The same article talked about underprovision or over-provision maintaining that life business does not involve a company in litigation or court cases except in the most rare situations.</P>
    <P>There is a school of thought which contends that the insurance companies should really lump all of their different types of business together, that if they suffer a loss in one area, such as the motor industry or public liability area, then that should be taken into account in the huge profits they make in another. Otherwise pressure will be brought to bear on the Government to become involved in the insurance sector, the same as in the banking sector.  If the banks are not prepared to take risks in certain areas of business then the Government have to become involved, as they have in recent months.  In the same way the Government would have to become involved in the insurance area.  Let us pose the question: <Col N="1164" /> what have the insurance companies done to help themselves or to remedy the situation?  From a critical examination of the position it would appear they have not done very much.  Two reports have been published in relation to the motor insurance business, one the O'Connor and the other the MacLiam report.</P>
    <P>I might refer to another article which appeared in <i>Business and Finance</i> of 13 June 1985 headed &ldquo;Insurers have become embroiled in arguing about the jury system and the high cost of awards.  They should be looking to more fundamental matters.&rdquo;  That article posed some questions, such as: Is there the political will to tackle the basic causes of the high premiums?  Why are the insurance companies not lobbying to a far greater extent for the fundamental changes needed in our existing system?  Why are they not co-ordinating their efforts and their advertising campaigns accordingly?  That is all based on the premise that the cost of insurance is too high.  The writer goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The insurers would have us believe that today's claims reflect tomorrow's premiums...</P>
    <P>He asks:</P>
    <P>I wonder what steps the insurance companies are taking to minimise the number of claims and the accidents that result in these claims.  Insurers surely have a vested interest in accident prevention which they do not seem to be exercising.</P>
    <P>Our attention is drawn to the number of designated black spots where accident statistics are very high and we are asked if this reflects our national attitude towards identifiable areas of known accidents or known risks.  Surely we should eliminate the bridges, turns, corners, the sections of roadway and our driving procedures that are black spots in our national insurance claims record.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that the most dangerous time to be on the road is after pub closing time and that most accidents, particularly fatal ones, are drink related to a greater or lesser extent.  There is a high cost to the State.  Every fatality that occurs costs <Col N="1165" /> the State £220,000 and every serious injury costs £67,000.  When it is realised that there are 400 or 500 fatalities every year together with tens of thousands of serious injuries it can be seen that the cost to the State is enormous which, in fact, means that the cost to the taxpayer is enormous.</P>
    <P>It is now suggested that insurance companies should be helped to make bigger profits by having the cases of seriously injured people heard not in front of a jury of their peers but judged by a graduate of what can only be described as an elitist group of the establishment.  As a result of the system which we have many people believe that judges are not really in a position to judge fairly all the time every section of the community, human fraility being what it is.</P>
    <P>People feel that, as a result of one person judging cases, some sections of the community from certain backgrounds and environments will be categorised and awards given accordingly.  A jury determine a case and then they are exempt for ten years if the case is a serious one.  A jury look at one case and the circumstances surrounding it.  A jury will take the human hardship involved into account more than a judge will who is a person with a lot of experience of law and whose senses can be dulled by the constant daily decisions which he makes. It is important that the human element be retained.  We are not dealing with an inanimate object but with a human being whose life span has perhaps been curtailed.</P>
    <P>We are talking about serious injury.  A person will not go to the High Court, which has power to give awards in excess of £15,000, unless there is documented evidence of serious injury.  Approximately 95 per cent of cases do not go to court.  There is usually a formidable file from medical consultants to verify the serious injuries.  It is important that a jury should deliberate carefully on the person's injuries and the effect they will have on the person and on the family.</P>
    <P>Every Christmas we are warned on radio and television that a campaign will <Col N="1166" /> be launched by the gardaí in order to enforce greater safety on the roads. Statistics have proved the worth of this. However, after Christmas the campaign ceases and we continue to have mayhem on the roads.  Why do we not have this campaign all the year round?  Why do the insurance companies not take over advertising around black spots?  Why do we not bring in laws which would discourage drinking and driving and ensure that people who want to drink must not drive? This is another example of us failing to correct the system and then penalising innocent people by taking from them the basic civil right to trail by jury in the High Court.</P>
    <P>There are many ways we could lower the accident rate but I will not go into detail on that now.  However, we should deploy gardaí in a better manner.  We have a lot of them available and they should be organised in such a way as to reduce the carnage on our roads.  I should like to develop that line of thought, which is relevant to the Bill.  The Minister has said that the main reason for the legislation is the high cost of insurance, but that is an appalling reason.  Why do insurance companies not campaign for greater safety on our roads?  They have campaigned, for example, for greater use of seat belts; but a seat belt is not much use in a car that does not have any brakes or that has fundamental defects.  Why do we allow cars on our roads which have not been tested?  Why do we not have compulsory testing of vehicles as occurs in other countries?  We have been talking about that for donkeys years but people continue to drive defective vehicles.  Cars with bald tyres, bad brakes or broken exhausts are involved in many accidents. Why is it that we do not ensure that the provisions of Road Traffic Acts are stringently adhered to?</P>
    <P>Accident black spots are well signposted and a lot of them are close to licensed premises.  As a nation we seem to be appallingly lacking in consciousness of what are fundamental safety standards in other jurisdictions.  Insurance companies have submitted that the Irish are more litigation conscious than others. <Col N="1167" /> Some Members hold a similar view, but I do not think we are any more litigation conscious than any other nation.  Most actions are successful in our courts because drivers or employees are negligent or in breach of statutory duties. Most of them fail to comply with the provisions of our Road Traffic Acts or legislation governing safety in industry. I do not think we can discuss personal injuries or the high cost of insurance without mentioning the huge number of uninsured drivers we have in Ireland.  I accept that it will be compulsory to display an insurance disc from July, but this is another example of us letting things get out of hand before we do something about them.  This is a reactionary society. We do not do anything if there is a break up in a particular area until everything gets out of hand.  Then we are prompted into fire brigade action.  It is never a question of prevention but of trying to lock the stable after the horse has bolted.</P>
    <P>I do not see why it is not possible to insist on tax and insurance being renewed from a certain date each year.  We have everything computerised and I do not think it would be difficult to introduce such a system.  In Canada, for example, after 1 April the police carry out intensive checks on all cars for tax and insurance offences.  The colour of the number plates there changes each year and the driver of a car found with the previous year's colour after 1 April is pulled into the side and prosecuted.  In that country one never sees an advertisement in a newspaper offering a car that is taxed to the end of the year for sale.  Drivers are not allowed to tax their vehicles for three months or six months.  The vehicle is taxed for 12 months, but we do not do that.  We are content to carry on with an old system which causes us enormous problems.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the high cost of insurance premiums is the slow reaction of insurance companies.  Very often they are to blame for the high legal cost because the cases are drawn out over a number of years.  Insurance companies must be informed within seven days of an accident or, if not, the policy may <Col N="1168" /> be declared void.  However, they do not respond.  If insurance companies handled claims quickly, either on a man to man basis or with the minimum of correspondence, there would be less involvement by the legal profession and, consequently, less cost.  Insurance companies are in a position to settle cases quickly if they want to.  Surely it is not asking too much of them to take the initiative and dispose of claims at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>The legal profession come in for a lot of blame &mdash; some of it is warranted &mdash; but most solicitors say that they have to drag insurance companies towards a settlement by initiating proceedings even where the same insurance company covers the two parties involved in an accident. Insurance companies must accept a lot of the blame for the delay in dealing with civil action.  They have to be dragged towards the courts.  They will drag a case out for as long as possible, even to the extent of taking advantage of a person who sustains serious injuries in an accident. I make that statement from my own experience and having thought out the issue very carefully.  In the case of a serious injury, where the person is not likely to survive insurance companies deliberately drag out the case and use the possibility of the imminent death of the injured party as a reason for not settling the case or settling it at a much reduced amount.  That occurs frequently.  I have had two family experiences of that.  My brother died as a result of a motor accident and his next of kin did not get one farthing.  My father-in-law was paralysed from the neck down as a result of a motor accident but his case was not settled by the insurance company for five years. When we discussed a settlement with lawyers, the insurance company involved told us, following their examination of him, what the lifespan was and that if we did not settle with them they would appeal the case through the High Court and on to the Supreme Court.  They delayed for five years and then settled for a reduced amount.  The settlement was reached nine weeks before that man died. That man was <i>compos mentis</i> and was <Col N="1169" /> confined to bed in a county home.  He could not get the care and attention he wanted because the insurance company did not even pay part of the award.  That occurs frequently, but now we will have the Supreme Court coming along to fix a ceiling of £150,000 general damages. That is appalling.  If men and women were appointed to the Supreme Court bench tommorrow it is quite likely that on consideration the ceiling would be changed because if the judges did not have experience of being personally involved in injury cases they might change the £150,000.</P>
    <P>If a person who has sustained the worst possible injuries is paralysed for life from the neck down, he or she will get a maximum of £150,000.  The rest will be made up of special damages for hospital care and attention.  Allowance will not be made for future hospital charges.  Nearly always in such cases complications arise long after the settlement of the injuries action but the person will not be entitled to go back and claim damages.  The people involved in such cases are ruthless, as all business people are in getting their pound of flesh.  I know the Minister would be very concerned that such would be the case.  If he extracts from his own speech the three arguments he used for changing the civil jury system he will find them very weak and that they do not hold water.  It is not sufficient to go back over the history of the court system and talk about Chancery and other courts and how they got rid of juries.  That seems to have been an administrative decision as time progressed and we ended up with the Circuit Court operating without juries and with a ceiling of £15,000.  Therefore, it does not follow logically that the next step should be to take another bit of cherished freedom from unsuspecting citizens and say: &ldquo;They are unsuspecting, we will remove the juries and there will not be an outcry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I continue in public life I find fewer and fewer outcries about anything.  The reason is that people are getting fed up of getting battered.  They are weary of taking on the system and even more weary of losing, whether they are fighting <Col N="1170" /> dumps or for the protection of the environment or for the retention of the few rights available to them under the common and criminal laws.  We have a Parliament, we introduce laws, and Ministers play the numbers game.  They bring in pieces of legislation, they have a majority on their side of the House, very few Deputies contribute to the debates and when they go into the lobbies most of them do not know what they are voting for.  Therefore, they rubber stamp the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Dáil has lost much of its power.  It is the intention to change that, but I despair of it happening.  That is the way our civil liberties are being eroded.  This legislation has been set up here, the Committee Stage will follow and I ask myself what are the changes I can suggest to protect citizens against the removal of their right to have cases tried by jury in the High Court.</P>
    <P>Deputies are either for this or against it.  I am against it.  Lawyers have argued for the retention of civil juries in the High Court, particularly barristers.  This is a laugh: they have been labelled as doing so with a vested interest, because they want to retain high fee earning possibilities &mdash; I will consider that in a minute. Not for once has anybody suggested that the insurance companies are arguing because of their vested interests, for what they can save by having uniform lower awards.  They will now be able to get a price for a finger, a price for a below-the-knee injury, a price for a foot, a price for an arm.</P>
    <P>In that way we will see the folly of the Supreme Court being allowed to have a ceiling of £150,000 for general damages. A person might lose a leg and get £60,000 or £70,000, and if he were to lose half of the other leg he might get another £30,000, or £100,000 for the loss of a leg and a hand; if he lost an arm as well, he might get near to the £150,000.  Little thought goes into the care and protection of the injured person during the rest of his or her life after a serious injury.  Juries, on the other hand, showed concern for the care and protection of injured persons for 20, 30, and 40 or sometimes 50 years <Col N="1171" /> after an accident.  If other medical complications arise after a settlement the injured person will be at a great disadvantage.</P>
    <P>John Citizen will be the loser again by this legislation.  He has taken a bashing and he will continue to do so.  It is ironic that this comes from a Government who have introduced so much social legislation, who have had the courage to do so.  They introduced recently the Combat Poverty Bill, three Children Bills &mdash; a Child Care and Protection Bill, an Adoption Bill and a Legitimacy Bill &mdash; a Contraceptive Bill, regardless of criticism, and now have given the people an opportunity to decide whether we should have divorce in the event of marriage breakdown.  It is ironic, therefore, that that caring Government should be introducing a piece of anti-social legislation like this.</P>
    <P>The only suggestion I can make on Committee Stage is that the Minister will not go ahead with this.  I do not think such an appeal would be successful.  Many people are concerned about this.  Many Deputies on this side are worried and we have had meetings about it.  I do not know if it is half-and-half or not, but numbers of us are concerned.</P>
    <P>This legislation is not as important as the Criminal Justice Act or the two Bills that went with it in order to temper the first harsh piece of legislation aimed at eliminating crime &mdash; those Bills tried to strike a balance by providing protection for the person in custody, for citizens' rights and the rights of the Garda.</P>
    <P>It is ironical and sad that this Bill was rushed into the House.  I know when machinery is set up it is hard to stop its operations.  I have tried to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister and I have called for an open discussion on the need to reconsider seriously the whole question before removing juries in civil cases in the High Court.  If people had been given more time to make their opinions known, it would not have caused any great damage or hardship.</P>
    <P>The Minister set out his case in his speech but he was very fond of quoting <Col N="1172" /> from minority decisions.  I was surprised at that.  He used those minority decisions to make his case but that does not make sense.  In his speech he made the following comment:</P>
    <P>It was against this general review of the present operation of the civil jury system and in the context of the renewed debate on the issue in relation to insurance matters, that the Government considered in principle last year to change the present system...</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the Minister's argument. He referred to a &ldquo;general review&rdquo; but there was no such review.  He also spoke about the &ldquo;renewed debate&rdquo; but I ask what renewed debate?  Does he mean the insurance companies decided to lobby to have the procedure changed, that they did it in a period of two weeks and that members of the Government caved in? What we are talking about is collective responsibility on the part of the Government. I know there is an element of social concern in the Government but were those members who stand up for social rights asleep when this matter came before the Government?  Where were they when this brilliant argument as set out in three paragraphs of the speech was used?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that for well over 100 years there has been &ldquo;a gradual erosion of the right to jury trial in civil matters&rdquo;. I am saying it is a right and it appears the Minister also believes it to be a right.  Yet, we are removing it.  In his speech the Minister said that jury trial achieved its present form by the 15th century and he made the following statement:</P>
    <P>In the Court of Chancery a jury's finding on issues of fact could be obtained by sending that issue to a common law court but that was rarely availed of and for all practical purposes Chancery cases were decided by a judge alone.</P>
    <P>The system evolved in that way and nobody objected.  People do not object to any great extent about matters any more because they are fed up and they know <Col N="1173" /> how difficult it is to change things.  They can tackle something obvious that happens on their own doorstep or district, but it is a different matter for them first to understand what happens here, then to get a sympathetic TD to listen to them and then to extend that to getting a majority of Members here to support their case.  They consider the game is not worth the candle.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The Common Law Procedure (Ireland) Act, 1854, provided that the parties might, on consent, and with the approval of the court, allow issues of fact to be tried by a judge alone.</P>
    <P>I ask a simple question: in 1854 what say had the common man in deciding whether he would allow issues to be tried by a judge alone?  Was he asked?  At that stage the British House of Commons were legislating for this country also and the House of Commons was controlled by people with property rights who were the ruling class.  It was very nice of them to word the Act in such a way as though the ordinary common man had a say in the affairs of State.  I presume some of the bigwigs, perhaps barristers or counsel in Kings Inns, Grays Inns, Inner Temple got together and decided at their club that this should happen.  The Minister tells us that rules made under the Judicature (Ireland) Act, 1877, obliged a party requiring a jury trial to state this when setting out the action for trial.</P>
    <P>Up to a few years ago one could say with absolute truth that people in the Law Library were an elitist group and some would argue that they continue to be an elitist group.  Certainly when I was there in the late sixties and early seventies it most definitely was an elitist group. Can anyone here say what was the literacy rate of the common people of Ireland in the period from 1850 to 1870?  How many of them spoke English and how many of them would have been consulted? Some of those poor wretches did not even know they were going to he hanged until the rope was put around their necks.  Many of them did not know until they were half-way to Van Diemen's <Col N="1174" /> Land that they had been sentenced to deportation.  Yet, this is the case the Minister is making to prove to us that juries were being abolished as though by common demand.  There is no such demand at the moment.</P>
    <P>Many people believe the only chance they have is trial before a jury and I go so far as to suggest that a person should be able to opt for trial by jury even in the Circuit Court.  If, as is the case at the moment, a person cannot opt for trial by jury in the Circuit Court the defendant or plaintiff should be able to take it to the High Court for a hearing before a jury.  That demand exists because many people believe they should have that right.  Some quake when they think they have to appear before a judge and they quake even more when it is pointed out to them that they have to appear before a particular judge.  Often they are told by their counsel that a certain judge is liable to act according to his moods, that a person could either get off or have to pay maximum damages.</P>
    <P>If a person has the right to a jury he can be sure that he will be heard by 12 men and women good and true, a different group each time, and one does not have to go to court too often.  The 1877 Act obliged the party requiring jury trial to state this when setting down the action for trial.  The Chancery (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1858, provided that the right to a jury in chancery actions should be in the discretion of the judge.  We can take it that these Acts were enacted by Members who acquired their fathers' seats at Westminster.  The landed gentry, the people with wealth, made these laws, not the common man.  Their successors are the insurance companies, people with vested interests, people with power &mdash; one would find many lords sitting on the boards of these companies &mdash; and they are now laying down the law for us.</P>
    <P>Eight months ago the gaming barons came here and whispered into the ear of the powers that be that they might lose a few million pounds if the law was not changed.  Within two weeks we obliged by bringing in legislation to increase the stakes.  To the shame of this House we <Col N="1175" /> still have not reversed that decision.  This legislation is still on the Order Paper which says we will increase the stake and the payout on gaming machines for the benefit of these racketeers who make more money than drug barons and drug pushers.  We still have not brought in legislation to ban these machines.</P>
    <P>In the same way we are playing around with the civil and human rights of our citizens, the most unfortunate people in our society, the sick and the indigent invalids, the people our spiritual leaders ask us to look after.  These are the people who would be most affected, not the healthy people.  They are very sick people who have suffered the most appalling injuries in car accidents or at work.  They may have brain damage, or they may be broken and weak but their lives are seriously affected, yet we are telling them they can no longer have a jury system.</P>
    <P>We had the Common Law Procedure (Ireland) Act, 1854, the Judicature (Ireland) Act, 1877, the Chancery (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1858, and the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, which provided that no party to an action for a liquidated sum, or for damages for breach of contract, or for the recovery of land, should be entitled to a jury unless the court considered that a jury was necessary or desirable. None of these decisions was made by the ordinary person.  The result of these developments is that, for all practical purposes and with limited exceptions, jury trials in the High Court occur only in personal injury cases.  That is all we have left and now, in one fell swoop, we intend to remove that.</P>
    <P>This brings us up to the sixties and the Minister mentioned civil juries in modern times.  In their third interim report in 1965 the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, by the narrowest of majorities &mdash; six to five &mdash; recommended that the right to civil jury trial should continue in the High Court.  The Minister preferred to depend on the view of the minority. The 1937 Constitution was passed by the narrowest of margins as well.  If the <Col N="1176" /> coming referendum is beaten by the narrowest of margins, do we take the minority view?  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure also recommended that the right to civil jury trial in the Circuit Court should be abolished and this was effected by a provision in the Courts Act, 1971.  I think that is a mistake and, if a concession were to be made, I would ask that that right should be given to the people who wish to opt for a civil jury.  The committee in their 20th interim report in 1978 reaffirmed their earlier view that no change should be made in the High Court system, although the Minister said they only considered the latter incidentally.  That is not good enough because there is no case for the removal of the jury system.  The only case made was by the insurance companies, with their power, contacts and inside track with the establishment.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the O'Connor committee report which decided that while juries should be retained, the responsibility for deciding the quantum of damages should rest with the judge assisted by assessors.  The Prices Advisory Committee on Motor Insurance &mdash; the MacLiam committee &mdash; concluded in their report in 1982 that the jury system should remain and they spoke about the problems of inconsistency and unfairness.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Court Committee's report that strong arguments arise on both sides of the issue, and that there are strongly divided views on the matter.  This is true even of Judges. Professor Bryan McMahon in his article &ldquo;July Trial for Personal Injury Cases in Ireland&rdquo;, published in May 1985 in <i>The Irish Times,</i> found that High Court judges who responded to a questionnaire from him were evenly split on the central issue...</P>
    <P>Even the judges cannot decide unanimously or by a majority that we should abolish trial by jury.  Where is the argument? In the 19th century the propertied classes, the aristocracy and their representatives decided these matters in <Col N="1177" /> Westminster.  They decided in their own interests always, not for the common good, what the ordinary wretch was entitled to.  That is not so here, yet the Minister finds an argument in this for abolishing juries.  The flaw in the whole thing is that he need not have gone to this trouble.  If he had put this out for public examination initially he would have come to the conclusion, by argument anyhow, that the right to trial by jury should not be removed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;It was against this general review of the present operation of the civil jury system and in the context of the renewed debate on the issue in relation to insurance matters,&rdquo; that the Government decided.  That does not make sense because that general review, as has been demonstrated, is flawed.  It was not a general review at all.  It was an evolved matter under the administrative system that went on in a partly disenfranchised country where women had not the right to vote until the twenties and where the propertied classes, the landed gentry and the rich controlled the Parliament and made the laws and their sons &mdash; there were no daughters operating in the courts &mdash; were the counsel, the barristers and the judges.  The highest placed families came from that sector.  They made the laws for the millions and they decided on this and that is how it came about.  The Taoiseach when introducing the Minister as Minister for Justice said that this concern for justice would show through.  If that is so, then we should strike a blow for the common man and try to reverse some of these decisions that were made against the common man, against the person whom he, I and all of us here represent in our constituencies because the aristocracy are long gone, as he is aware.</P>
    <P>Another point that must be made forcibly is that the type of person who becomes a judge and to whom it befalls in the event of the removal of civil juries to make the judgment in these cases comes, as many of us have said here, from if not entirely an elitist group, at least from the few people for whom this State was founded, who benefited most as a result <Col N="1178" /> of the founding of this State and whose sons and daughters through the profession have continued to benefit from 1922. They grasped what was there and got into positions of influence and power and held on to the professions largely to the exclusion of the rest of the population and they maintain those positions.  I maintain that to a large extent the Honourable Society of King's Inns, the Benchers and the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland are elitist groups.  Many of us have called for a change in this system and to date we have not been successful in this.  If we succeed in changing the system and have the professions opened up and legal education removed from both the Society of the King's Inns for barristers and the Incorporated Law Society for solicitors and the State gets control of those, I might have more confidence in even considering this matter.</P>
    <P>However, even if that was done, I would still be faced with the problem of recognising that education, third level education in particular is the preserve of the few in this country.  Statistics available show that in my constituency, to quote an appalling example, in areas of Inchicore 1 per cent of the population get third level education.  However, they make up 27 per cent of the population of St. Patrick's and Mountjoy.  In an area like Ballyfermot, of 40,000 to 50,000 people, 4 per cent, a miserable 400 or 500, get a crack at third level education and they make up 17 per cent of the population of St. Patrick's and Mountjoy. Yet we are asking that those people's peers be not given the opportunity to judge their cases of serious personal injury, people who would have a better understanding of what the unfortunate victim of a motor accident or an injury at work is going through, the circumstances under which that person is living and the pain and suffering and the miserable existence that is his lot because of the lack of social justice and equal opportunity.</P>
    <P>We are asking these people to give up their right and to let their future and their welfare and the amount of money they are to be awarded in such a case be decided by a member of the establishment, <Col N="1179" /> by a member of a profession who is accustomed to wining and dining in places that some of these people might never have frequented or will never frequent in their lifetime.  These establishment people as part of their examination had to eat 48 dinners, 12 a year for four years, at the King's Inns and dress formally to do so in the seventies and eighties. They get into a profession because they can nominate or know a person of ten years' standing in that profession who will sign a memorial for them.  How many people in this country know a barrister of ten years standing?  How many know a barrister at all?  That is the kind of condition that the `Honourable' Society of King's Inns demand of their students when they decide to let them into the profession.  They can decide that they will limit their numbers this year to 40 or 50 graduates otherwise the rabble coming in might crowd out their opportunity of earning more fees.  They can decide as benchers to sit around a table and indicate arbitrarily which student will go through their examination and who will not.  Even if some students fail but happen to be well connected or their family have been members of the same profession, they will be brought through on the nod.  These are the people who judge in our courts, who have rejected down through the decades ever since the foundation of the State the common man from membership of the Honourable Society of King's Inns.</P>
    <P>I am speaking from knowledge, not from guesswork or from anyone telling me.  I had difficulty in finding a barrister of ten years' standing to sign my memorial.  I had the difficulty of getting recommendations and I was rejected because I was a member of the working class, the common class of whom there were not too many up there at that time. I have seen my fellow students compelled to borrow money that they could not afford in order to buy themselves suits of clothes to go up and eat dinners that they could not afford to eat in order to fulfil the regulations as laid down by the Honourable Society of King's Inns.  If ever an <Col N="1180" /> institution qualified for &ldquo;Dis&rdquo; in front of its &ldquo;Honourable&rdquo;, that institution do and they have not changed much in the intervening years, except that certain concessions have been made in order to remove the spotlight from their unfair and dishonourable deeds over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Until that institution sorts itself out we should be very slow to make any concessions or to entrust justice to them.  We should be even slower in handing over State money, which we did last year to the amount of £600,000 to do up the Inns, without having control over the regulations they make for the admission of students and their legal education.  However, we did that in the same way as we brought in the emergency gaming law after a limited debate of two hours even though people who wanted to speak were not allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>If the referendum is passed we hope to bring in divorce legislation and we are assured that special divorce and family courts will be set up.  This is an important point.  The Taoiseach, the Government and the Minister who is introducing this legislation have assured the worried population &mdash; they are genuinely concerned &mdash; that special family courts will be set up with judges sitting who have a special interest in that area.  However, that is not happening in this case.  The argument is that the judges who sit in our courts at present are members of an élitist group who may not be suitable to judge all sectors of society.  Until that is changed and we become a more egalitarian society, we should not change the system.</P>
    <P>I was talking about insurance companies earlier and I want to continue the argument that they have not helped their industry or made any real contribution towards reducing motor or civil liability insurance because of their actions, or lack of them.  I said that most solicitors will tell you that they literally have to drag insurance companies towards a settlement by initiating proceedings.  When they enter into negotiations settlements are made much more quickly.  There seems to be a new reality dawning on <Col N="1181" /> insurers and solicitors at least in relation to personal injury claims and an awareness on both sides of the advantages of earlier negotiations and settlements.  It has been demonstrated that 95 per cent of all claims are settled before going into court in cases of personal injury, some of them on the steps of the court, and much of that is the fault of the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>There have been some improvements but more need to be made.  One is that the Incorporated Law Society have implemented the exchange of medical reports which has reduced the waiting time by at least six months for a High Court action.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies seem to blame the legal profession for high costs but they do not accept that there is a reluctance on the part of insurers to realise that the old order has changed and that there is an anxiety on the part of the legal profession for the earliest possible disposal of claims.  That applies to barristers as well as solicitors.  A solicitor has no reason for dragging out a claim as he is anxious to get it off his books and to get on with the next case and the same applies to the barrister.  Some insurance companies delay matters by having to obtain the opinions of a number of counsel and sending them to head office overseas before they are given authority to expedite claims.  That is because some of the foreign insurance companies based here do not have much confidence in the grey matter between the ears of most Irish people; we cannot do things very well, so they go back to their head office.</P>
    <P>Some insurance companies also instruct their counsel to fight every claim. For years and years the major insurance company here had a policy of fighting every claim; they dragged them out to the last and of course then they did not have enough money to cover outstanding claims.  Eventually the company collapsed and had to be taken over by the State. That was deliberate blackguarding by an insurance company and the earlier case to which I referred, in which my father-in-law was paralysed from the neck down, is proof that he was a victim of <Col N="1182" /> that company.  They dragged out the case and their counsel said that if he did not settle for a lesser amount they would drag it out for so long that he was likely to die before he got anything.  That is the fault of the insurance companies and not of the motorists or taxpayers and is damning to the case the insurance companies are making.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies have a vested interest in lobbying for changes in court procedures, extending the hours of sitting, reduction in vacations, more judges and for regular reviews of the jurisdiction limits.  If they adopted a unified approach to these matters their voices would be very influential and powerful.  Most insurance companies have internationally based offices and could import useful procedures used abroad to much advantage. They can cite advantages and disadvantages in other countries; they are involved and why do they not do something about it?  They seem content to work within the unsatisfactory system which operates here.  Insurance companies concentrate their energies too much on complaining about juries, the effect their decisions have on high awards and the overburdening of cases by the necessity to employ three barristers in each case.  Changes in these procedures will not effect the savings which the insurers hope for and they have confirmed that premiums will not be affected.  I remember quite distinctly, when the former Minister first mooted this idea, that I was the first to object at my own parliamentary party meeting.</P>
    <P>The Minister has searched long and hard in his Department for arguments but has not come up with even one.  The sole reason given was that premiums were too high and that the abolition of juries would reduce them.  The arguments produced since for bringing in legislation have been pathetic.  This debate could have taken place in committee rooms around the House with Members of all parties taking part. Members from all sides met the former Minister for Justice to bring in emergency legislation in relation to gaming which is still on the books.  We could have met in <Col N="1183" /> the same way about this and we would not now be in a situation where we are involved in a Second Stage debate about a Bill which the Minister is unlikely to change at this stage.</P>
    <P>Why am I going on about it if he is unlikely to change it?  The answer to that is very simple.  One gets various opportunities to make points.  One is in the parliamentary party; another is among one's colleagues and by going to see the Minister and talking to him.  Finally, if it is insisted upon, we come in here.  One has to make it very clear, even if one is a member of a party and is going to be whipped in what one's position is in relation to legislation.  As it happens, the main Opposition party do not agree with the removal of juries.  I do not agree either.  I do not accept the alternatives put forward by the spokesman for the Opposition, but I will get to that later.  I just do not want the jury system tampered with at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the MacLiam and O'Connor reports in which the situation was considered in detail and which concluded that the retention of juries was appropriate to certain modification of procedures.  I maintain that this legislation is an assault on the rights of citizens and it is inexcusable.  This removal of juries is not being done by popular demand.  One must ask who is making this demand and the answer is irrefutable &mdash; the insurance companies argue that high premiums are the result of the cost of actions and the high fees of the lawyers. Let me point out that there is a tendency among lawyers to drag out cases.  There is a lot of horse dealing going on.  I have actually experienced cases where barristers talk slowly to make cases go on for a certain length of time and perhaps get one or two days out of it. That situation has come to the attention of many people and Members of this House who want to change it.  While cases are being dragged out, a bit of horse dealing is going on in the corridors and, after two or three days when fairly high fees have accumulated, they come back <Col N="1184" /> in and say that a settlement has been arrived at.</P>
    <P>These insurance companies are complaining about the high cost of settling claims in court, but 95 per cent of these cases are settled out of court.  So what effect is the small percentage that end up in court having on the cost of premiums? One of their arguments is that because jury awards are sometimes high, they set the standards for the settlements out of court.  The insurance companies themselves must have some control over settlements.  Costs could be reduced if they moved faster, if they gave clearer instructions &mdash; it is not necessary to instruct two senior counsel to settle an action.</P>
    <P>If we really want to do something about that, the answer is in our own hands. There was an attempt twice here to fuse the two sides of the legal profession, the barristers and the solicitors, and it is one of my greatest regrets that it did not come off.  In 1970 the then Minister for Justice, the late Michael Moran, said it was his intention to fuse the professions and he worked to do that.  In 1973 his successor, Deputy O'Malley, then Minister for Justice, worked towards that.  Both said definitely and categorically that they would fuse the professions.  But the fellows with the curly wigs and gowns up in the Law Library got together to try to stop this.  The Minister was determined to win but he was beaten by the clock, not by the legal profession.  He was beaten by the coming to power of the Coalition.  I have to say that the Coalition were then, as they are now, a predominately legal party.</P>

In the early seventies, and prior to that, Fine Gael were very much a legal party, much more than Fianna Fáil, the only other party of their size. Since 1922 practically every judicial appointment in this State was a political <Col N="1185" /> appointment.  As it happens Fianna Fáil were in power for most of the time and appointed more people.  But in 1973, to prove the point which the Deputy has drawn out of me now although I was not going to make it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All this has interrupted my train of thought.  I was making the point that when the Coalition were in Government in 1973 they appointed 14 judges in a short space of time and yet they say they are not in the business of making political appointments.  When the Coalition Government came into power in 1973 they were not in favour of fusion of the professions because they had such dominance of associates at the Law Library and such close connections with senior members of the Bar Library and there were members of that Library who were also Members of this House and who later went up to the highest echelons of the profession, right up to the position of Chief Justice.  Had that fusion taken place and history been different, we had lasted for about another year, perhaps the late Deputy Ó Moráin and Deputy O'Malley would have succeeded in doing a great favour to this country.  There would have been a break away from the British system.  We would have had a <Col N="1186" /> single profession and not had the present high costs.</P>
      <P>The judges are still strongly divided on whether there should be that change.  The civilians have not been asked.  On a lighter note, as Sonny Liston once said: &ldquo;The only people who get paid whether they win or lose in this life are doctors and lawyers.&rdquo;  That is unfortunate.  With no reference to anybody, the greatest idiot can be looking after a case for you and whether he makes a hames of it or not, he will be paid and in full.  That is one of the reasons behind the high costs &mdash; and these people can be carrying on two or three different actions simultaneously.  If we were serious about reform we would fuse the professions.  That would go a long way towards sorting out the present difficulties.</P>
      <P>The barristers or the Bar Council are not in favour of this change.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 29 April last the Chairman of the Bar Council opposed the abolition of the jury system stating that premiums would not come down if juries were abolished; that has been confirmed.  The insurance companies are trying to hoodwink the Minister and the Government into bringing in this legislation in the hope that the premiums will come down.  The Chairman believes that the major reason for high premiums is the inefficient way in which insurance companies run their business, not the amount of jury awards. I have just proved that.  However, the lawyers and barristers are being blamed. The Chairman of the Bar Council accused the insurance industry of trying to manipulate the public into the belief that juries should be abolished in civil cases and said they were trying to save themselves money rather than have justice done.  I hope the Minister takes note of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no investigation of the juty system in recent years.  The Restrictive Practices Commission and the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure concluded that the jury system was the best and most democratic way of assessing damages.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 June 1985 the Bar Council also defended the jury system, saying that it was a civil <Col N="1187" /> right of considerable value which we are now about to throw out of the window forever.  None of the other pieces of legislation thrown out ever came back.  How difficult it would be to undo what is being done.  What kind of case would have to be made then?  Three paltry, watered down reasons, which do not stand up to examination, are put forward for abolishing the jury system.  What sort of case would have to be made for its reintroduction? We would need a body of knowledge built up over ten years, with many volumes of information and reports, needing delegation after delegation, with members of all professions and the public bombarding us with information.  Even then they might not succeed.  It is grossly unfair, to say the least.</P>
    <P>The Bar Council also say in the article that there are compelling social and democratic reasons for the retention of the jury system, that the arguments to the contrary centre entirely on economics.  It does mention one not too strong argument which the Minister also used to strengthen his argument, that it is a mode of involving the ordinary citizen in the working of the courts and ensures in that way not merely that the standard of justice administered is close to the feeling of the ordinary man, but that the respect of the ordinary citizen for the courts, which is essential for their proper functioning, is retained.</P>
    <P>It is true that rarely after this will one see a member of a jury, except in a criminal case, anywhere near a court of law. Then they have to suffer the trauma and fright of having to go into court when it does happen.  Any members of the public I have met who have done jury duty will tell you in great detail long afterwards of their experience, even though it may have been an inconvenience at the time. They will say how carefully the whole thing was considered and the detail that was gone into.  It is an experience that will stay with them for a lifetime.</P>
    <P>Another argument was used by the Minister and also by his colleague on radio last week, probably having been briefed by the Minister.  This was that it <Col N="1188" /> needed 10,000 citizens last year to make up the jury panels and that 30 per cent of these turned up.  What is wrong with that figure of 30 per cent?  There are many reasons for people not being able to be in certain places.  We still get the juries and have plenty of people from whom to draw.  A whole body of argument with reference to the jury system needs attention. There is very little for the abolition of juries except weak economic reasons. That will not lessen the cost because the solution lies in the hands of the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>There are options for reform.  Settlements which have been made are usually on the insurance companies' terms and those companies are always in the driver's seat when it comes to settlement.  They work very well together when they want to.  It is wrong to suggest either that the legal profession or the jury system is responsible for the high costs.  There are other more serious reasons.  One is the total lack of application of the Road Traffic Acts, compounded by the standard of driving and drunken driving.  The costs of the legal profession are not the difficulty.</P>
    <P>The solutions are in the hands of the insurance institutions which should not be getting the sympathy they are getting from Members.  They are well able to look after themselves, being past masters at it.  They can afford it and are in the business for what they can get from the system.  They are milking it dry, giving precious little back to the public.  The profits which they make in other areas of insurance, such as life insurance, should be taken into account.  They have many assets in their fine buildings and investments.  One would think they were not able to look after themselves in the big bad world, but they make fat profits by being very well able to use the system. They employ the best brains in actuarial services which are available.</P>
    <P>It is wrong of the Minister to compare us with Britain.  This is done whether we want to bring in a system or abolish one. We do not seem able to take our own situation in hand.  The insurance companies have the expertise of international <Col N="1189" /> offices and the experiences of different countries.  We seem to get the blame for everything.  They lack confidence in the Irish people to work out settlements for claims.  They have a lack of confidence in the Irish system.  They think it does not work as well as those in other countries. That is an argument which should be shoved down their throats and should not be tolerated.  It is unfortunate that the Minister insists that this is done after careful consideration.  I do not think it was carefully considered.  I have said enough about that to prove it right.  The Irish system is correct.  High awards should be favoured.  If a person is subject to a very unfair and low award, and has to live a life of misery as a result, that is not a reason for decrying the system.  Jury awards are mostly balanced and fair, as has been confirmed by Mr. McEntee, one of the most eminent members of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>insurance cost is for uninsured drivers. The Government could do away with that overnight.  If the members of the Garda implemented the law we would not have uninsured drivers.  I do not know how anyone can make a human suffering uniform or how it can be consistent.  It states in the Bill that we should get consistency. It is a disgrace to fix a sum for any injury. The whole family situation should be taken into account.  That is done by insurance companies.  The profits from insurance companies and other areas are not taken into account.  If they do not get their act in order the Government will have to look at that area closely.  That is what the Minister should be doing rather than bringing in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned the Road Traffic Act and drinking while driving.  The Supreme Court were very severe in fixing a figure of £150,000.  I know they have the right to do that, but I am confident that under a different system and with judges who have wider experience that would be overturned.  They should go on a tour of the Rehabilitation Institute and other places before fixing such a figure. That would give them an idea of what they had done.  The different strata of society would not be catered for in the <Col N="1190" /> case of the abolition of civil juries.  It should not be left to one judge alone.</P>
    <P>The Minister's case is very weak and he should recognise and address that. Deputy Woods made the point that a jury has no vested interest in a case.  They come to the court, make a decision and go again.  People feel glad of the experience of being able to help their fellow man.  It involves them in the administration of justice.  It gives them an input into social justice.  If there are 3,000 or 4,000 people coming out every year with jury experience mixing with the population and letting the people know what is going on, it has a soothing effect on society. The only reaction I have to this measure is to reject it because it is inopportune, wrong and unfair.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the cost of insurance. One cannot say the most extreme case should be fixed at a figure of £150,000. The most extreme case of suffering cannot be defined because one cannot take into account what is going on in the mind of a person who is suffering.  It is an assault and an affront on the sick and the most unfortunate in our society.  I felt very badly about some of the awards which were overturned by the higher courts because of the high media profile which some of these cases got.  It was very unfair.  I heard on the radio some weeks ago about a man from Cork who suffered in an explosion in the Glen of Imaal. He was one of a number of people who fought their case for five or six years.  He lost one leg and the other was very badly damaged.  He said that he had nothing to live for.  He got nothing out of it at the end of the day.  He was just thrown on a heap with no place to go and no recourse of action.  That case is now closed and cannot be opened again.  One person will have to make that decision from now on.</P>
    <P>The phrase used by the Minister was unfortunate.  In the light of historical arguments he should now change the system.  He did not prove anything with those historical arguments.  They reviewed chronologically how the changes were made.  Personal injury actions should take place before civil juries mainly because of the injuries and <Col N="1191" /> the pain that individuals suffer.  Each case should be considered by a body of men with no vested interest who are not prejudiced or intimidated in any way.  The Minister should not rely on minority decisions. There has been a self-corrective process in these awards.  Awards were increased and then petered out again. That was perhaps in response to inflation or to people being more conscious of the matter.</P>
    <P>The jury system is self-corrective.  It is very important that it has worked that way.  That is evidenced by the moderation of awards recently.  It is working properly. I will not reiterate Deputy Woods' suggestions because they are on the record.  I do not want to take the power away from the jury or give it to the judge. I do not want the judge assessing the amounts of money.  Sometimes he presumes that people are idiots by overturning an award and replacing it by as little as 25 per cent and 50 per cent.  I do not think he is in that position.  You can have hit and miss justice.  We will put the judge in an awful position if we leave that to him.  Maybe he will become hardened but he will always have his conscience to wrangle with over whether, in the light of experience four or five years later, his awards stand up or do not stand up. On a jury people are for or against certain amounts but they arrive at a better conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also allow the option for a jury trial in the Circuit Court. That is one suggestion I would make.  I will also make the suggestion that the defendant or plaintiff should be able to opt to take an action from the Circuit Court into the High Court in front of a jury if he will not get a jury in the Circuit Court.  Many people do not feel happy, for various different reasons, operating in front of a judge or a particular judge.</P>
    <P>This Bill is anti-social and it is unjust. I am sorry it has been brought in without the opportunity for us to have hammered it out on the outside.  It is an ideal Bill to have all parties sitting around arguing about it.  It is not a strong argument &mdash; if it cannot be used in the case of the <Col N="1192" /> referendum, it cannot be used here &mdash; that there is no demand for this Bill as there was no demand for contraceptives and there is no demand for divorce.  As my colleague, Deputy O.J. Flanagan would say, there is no demand from the citizen.  If there was a demand, it would be a demand for retention.  Therefore, I cannot use that.  I will argue strongly for the retention of the jury system.  I hope the Minister will reconsider.  I do not think it is too late to do that as the debate is only beginning.  I will reserve my further comments for Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is important for at least two conflicting reasons.  Historically, it proposes the abolition of the time established system of settling claims for civil actions by jury and, secondly, and perhaps more disappointingly, the Bill as circulated by the Minister does not bring forward any new, more effective or just proposals for the settlement of claims within the existing judicial system.  I agree that there are good arguments for and against the retention of the present system as we know it. The House must be fully satisfied that any proposed change is an improvement in the existing system and that we are not merely proposing change simply for change's sake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, the Bill should receive the fullest possible consideration and debate on all stages during its passage through both Houses.  I am tempted to ask where the demand for this Bill originated, or why we find ourselves debating it at this time of all times when there are so many other more important and pressing matters to which this House should be applying its time and attention. If I were asked for my views on this matter before the publication of the Bill, and before I had an opportunity to examine the proposals contained in the Bill, I would have said by way of almost instant comment that the jury system should be abolished as a means of deciding civil action claims for injuries.  If I were further asked to give my reasons for that view, I would have said that the existing system is a major factor in the increasing <Col N="1193" /> and escalating cost of insurances, in particular motor insurance.  If I were further asked why or how I came to that conclusion I would say it was the most often publicised reason and the explanation most often offered by those who answer criticism, the escalating costs of insurance generally.</P>
    <P>I would now say that the public perception of the system up to this point in time is exactly the same.  I have no doubt that, before this debate was initiated in the House, the vast majority of our citizens out there on the streets would respond to that query in the same way as I would have responded initially.  Somebody &mdash; and it must have been the vested interests in the insurance companies &mdash; has been very successful in having that viewpoint publicised, propagated and promoted. Therefore, they were successful in colouring the public attitudes and thinking in relation to what they would try to sell as the adverse effects of jury decisions in relation to the ultimate costs of insurances, as I said in particular motor insurance.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, lucky in this debate that we have available to us the mature and considered views of at least three committees which have examined and reported on various aspects of the insurance industry.  Let me say with respect to the Minister and to the Members who have already spoken, and to those who will follow in this debate, that the committees' study of the problem is more thorough and scientific than any amount of research which we as individual Deputies could undertake.  For that reason, their collective views, judgments and sometimes their decisions in relation to insurance generally, the effects of jury decisions in relation to awards and the general application of the judicial system in relation to awards, cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>The members of these committees, some of them very highly qualified in the area of insurance and some of them eminently qualified in terms of their judicial knowledge, put their collective views together with a view to making their findings available to our citizens and to Members of this House.  We would be <Col N="1194" /> extremely foolish if we did not take seriously into consideration the views which they have documented and made available to us.</P>
    <P>As one Member of the House &mdash; and I am sure the same will apply to every other Deputy &mdash; I should say I burned the midnight oil in an effort to brief myself as thoroughly as possible in relation to what the outcome of this debate would involve. Following my personal study of these reports and of the Minister's proposal to dismantle the jury system, I am not convinced that the proposed changes will in any way lead to a reduction in insurance charges which, presumably, was the Minister's main motivation in introducing this Bill.  However, on reflection, having read his speech and the Bill, I was not sure what was his motivation for its introduction at this time.</P>
    <P>One of the most telling and convincing arguments for me against the Minister's proposal is the fact that all three reports available to us &mdash; perhaps there are more &mdash; having examined all aspects of the insurance industry and the effects of the jury system on awards, came out to varying degrees in favour of the retention of the jury system.  That is particularly significant in the context of the debate in which we are now involved, that at the end of the day these three major, wide-ranging reports, having examined the pros and cons of the operation of the jury system and the general problems of insurance, came out in favour of the retention of the jury system as it has obtained in this country.  The committees in at least two of their reports clearly indicated that the involvement of juries in deciding on claims did not make any significant contribution to increased insurance costs.</P>
    <P>If one is not convinced by or satisfied with the views and comments of those three independent committees then all one has to do is look at the report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses which examined the insurance industry and came out in favour of the retention of the jury system subject to certain specific adjustments in the system as it operates at present.  The same applied to some of <Col N="1195" /> the other reports.  It is significant also that that joint committee gave long and serious thought and consideration to insurances generally and, of course, to the effects of the operation of the jury system.  Therefore, it is significant that they also on balance came out in favour of the retention of the jury system.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to repeat a question I have posed already: where did the demand originate for this Bill?  It is interesting to note that on some of the committees to which I have referred the insurance industry was represented and, presumably, at the end of the day they agreed with the final drafts of the reports published.  Be that as it may, one can only be suspicious that the main argument, demand and private lobbying for the need to introduce this Bill must have come inevitably from vested interests within the insurance companies.  As a result of a good publicity campaign somebody has successfully sold the argument to the Irish people that the jury system is responsible for the increasing burden and cost of insurance cover.  Yet all of the mature consideration and thought given the matter by various people, professionals and others available to us in this context, clearly indicates that there is very little evidence to support that contention.</P>
    <P>It is worthy of note also that, while the jury system in criminal injury cases in Britain has been discontinued now for a number of years, proposals to extend the system to Northern ireland were abandoned because of the British experience. Yet in recent times and on a number of occasions previously consideration was given to whether Northern Ireland should follow the British practice and do away with the jury system.  It was decided on the basis of the experience of the system in Britain that it should not be extended to Northern Ireland.  While that fact may not be significant in itself, nonetheless it is a further aid in helping us decide this issue for ourselves.  At the end of the day the argument which would have the most influence on our people is whether insurance premiums would be reduced as a result of the proposal to disband the jury <Col N="1196" /> system.  One need only look to the response of the insurance industry itself when they were confronted with the devastatingly disappointing reply that there would not be a significant reduction, particularly in motor insurance premiums, as a result of the disbandment of the jury system.  It must be obvious to many Members of the House that there are already conflicting views, even within the industry, in regard to the operation of the jury system.  That has been placed on record by way of a number of statements issued by interests in the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>We must pose the question: what, then, is the advantage?  Why should there be a proposal at this time to disband the jury system if there is not to be any saving effected in insurance premiums, if there is not to be any improvement effected in the overall availability of insurance? Indeed, the availability of insurance is becoming as much a problem as its cost. Regardless of cost it is becoming extremely difficult, particularly for young people, to get insurance cover on a motor car.  The same applies particularly in large urban areas where it is becoming extremely difficult if not impossible for householders to get adequate insurance cover.  That reflects the serious deterioration in law and order.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies are not willing or prepared to pass on to the consumer savings which would accrue through the changes envisaged by the Minister in this Bill.  There is an obligation on them to play their part in making insurance available as a right and at a price which people can afford.  Instead of talking about disbanding the jury system the Government would be better employed giving serious consideration to how insurance could be made more readily available to people who cannot afford very high premiums.  People in the lower income brackets who need a car to travel to work cannot afford to pay motor insurance. That is very serious.  People are left with the choice of driving without insurance or opting out of work.  The increasing number of uninsured vehicles <Col N="1197" /> is a greater factor in the high cost of insurance premiums than juries giving high awards.</P>
    <P>In bringing in the Bill the Minister is taking the easy way out and is content to try to cure the disease rather than tackling the cause of the disease.  If we are serious about job creation and economic recovery, we must accept that people will not always find jobs in their local communities and that they will need a car to travel to work.  The Government need to recognise that for many people a car is no longer a luxury.</P>
    <P>We are spending many hours debating the disbanding of the jury system when we would be more gainfully employed in trying to tackle this serious problem.  This House must legislate for an alternative approach to motor taxation and insurance. Serious thought should be given to a system which would relate taxation and insurance to the necessity for and the usage of a car.  My proposal would eliminate the problem of uninsured drivers and result in a substantial reduction in insurance premiums.  The large number of uninsured motorists contributes substantially to the high cost of motor insurance. It costs on average £70 on each insurance premium paid by motorists to cover the cost of uninsured drivers.  No one would condone the use of uninsured vehicles on our roads, but it is not difficult to see that a man on a low income would be unable to meet the escalating cost of insurance.  He might take the risk of driving without insurance in order to keep his job.  Our priorities are wrong. We should tackle the economic and social problems which prevent people from securing gainful employment.</P>
    <P>Instead of abandoning the jury system we should reform the present system of road taxation and motor insurance.  They should be linked to the tax on fuel oils. In this way a man who spends £15 a week on petrol would pay motor taxation and insurance proportionately, whereas a person whose car is a luxury and who could afford to spend £50 a week on petrol would pay proportionately more on insurance and motor taxation.  I am disappointed that someone who is in a <Col N="1198" /> position to tackle that aspect of motor taxation and insurance has not done so before now.  It would serve a dual purpose in that it would eliminate uninsured and untaxed drivers and lead to a reduction in the cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>Instead of abandoning the jury system we should be considering reforming it and making it more appropriate to the Irish scene.  In my view we should reform it in such a way that a judge could issue guidelines to a jury as to the extent of damages allowable in specified areas of injury claims.  Instead of dismantling the jury system we should amend it in the way I have suggested.  There should be certain levels of compensation related to injuries.  The Minister should give that suggestion serious consideration.  Such a system would help to rationalise compensation awards and minimise the uncertainty and confusion that exists.  We have often heard it said that juries are inconsistent in the awards they make and if a judge offers advice to a jury that inconsistency will be removed.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the level of legal and other costs involved in personal injury claims is out of all proportion to the amount of compensation awarded.  It is also out of proportion to the amount of work involved in representing claimants and defendants. Both sides are guilty in so far as costs are concerned.  Insurance companies are also contributors to the high cost of the system.  Defendants are left with little option but to fall into this traditional pattern of legal protectionism which in most cases involves two senior counsel, one junior counsel and a solicitor.  The Minister, and the House, will be seen in a more credible light if they tackle this vast area in an effort to reduce costs instead of making a token gesture by abandoning the jury system.  The jury system does not contribute in any significant way to the overall cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>The Bar Council have acknowledged that the list system is the root cause of the lavish and expensive form of legal bureaucracy.  If the House does not legislate to dismantle that system then we should not be here at all.  Why must we <Col N="1199" /> waste so much time debating the dismantling of a system which does not in any significant way contribute to increased insurance costs while at the same time we choose to ignore the legal representation system which is a major contributory factor to the overall cost?  If the Minister is not prepared to introduce reform in that area I will endeavour to tackle the matter through a Private Members' Bill. I have given this matter serious thought and have come to the conclusion that we must change it.  Many of my constituents who have been unfortunate enough to have to go before our courts to get justice have made their views about the level of representation in court actions known to me.  It does not reflect in any credible way on the Parliament that we have chosen to ignore such matters while we spend our time debating a Bill which amounts to nothing more than a window dressing operation.  The Government are pretending to be interested about doing something in regard to increased insurance costs.  They should have been concerned with such matters as legal and medical representation and the other paraphernalia associated with our judicial system.  In their own way they are more significant in terms of costs.</P>
    <P>The dismantling of the jury system will not result in a weakening of the present listing system.  The Minister implied that the listing system would automatically disappear if we dismantled the jury system.  Will he explain to the House how that will happen?  In my view the Minister is guilty of misrepresentation in that regard.  The alternative to doing away with the jury system is to give total control to the legal profession not only on procedure but also in the area of compensation. Is it not wrong to strengthen further that monopoly and hand over to the organised legal profession domination of procedures in our courts and let them decide on the level of compensation to be awarded to injured parties?  It would be wrong to create such a monopoly because the jury system will maintain some balance in the procedure.  It would not be in the interests of the public to <Col N="1200" /> pass this legislation as it is, because litigation in the High Court would become the sole domain of the professions operating exclusively in that area.</P>
    <P>Somebody said earlier that members of juries have no legal qualifications to adjudicate on the merits of injury cases. It may be that they are not legally trained, but from my experience of talking to ordinary jury members, I can say that from the moment they took the oath they embarked on their task with a great sense of seriousness and responsibility.  They always regard their position as being of great significance and importance and they have always exercised their judgment as they would apply it as ordinary citizens determining matters without legal qualifications.  Is it not the essence of democracy that we have Irish citizens sworn in to exercise their judgment as citizens, having heard the evidence summed up for them by a judge, and giving their collective citizens' views?  We could not have a fairer system because it includes consideration in a compassionate way of the social side of a claim, and that might not be taken into account at all by members of the Judiciary sitting on their own.  I would have much greater faith in a decision of a group of citizens to come up with correct proposals in relation to injury claims.</P>
    <P>I might be influenced in the opposite direction if there were convincing evidence before us that the jury system is contributing significantly to increased insurance costs, but all the evidence available to us clearly indicates the reverse.  The MacLiam report showed that only 20 per cent of all accident claims go to solicitors and of those only 12 per cent are listed as going to court.  In other words, only 4 per cent of all claims go to court.  Of that 4 per cent only 0.2 per cent go to court and are heard by juries.  How, therefore, can anybody credibly make the case that the jury system has been contributing to the high overall cost of insurance?</P>
    <P>It is worthy of note that the committee set up to examine the insurance industry and the operation of our judicial system <Col N="1201" /> in relation to injury claims reported as follows:</P>
    <P>Why should not the ordinary citizen, with guidance from the judiciary, be the arbiters of standards for their fellow citizens who fall victim to accidents?</P>
    <P>That fairly reflects the thinking of the ordinary citizen and I go along fully with it.  Later the report stated:</P>
    <P>The Committee having considered submissions from the Federation of Insurers in Ireland and the Irish Insurance Federation, considered that, whatever the merits or demerits of trial by jury, it is so essential a part of our system of justice, that we do not consider it should be called into question in relation to the legal determination of guilt.</P>
    <P>That is another convincing piece of evidence in favour of the retention of juries. Where is the demand coming from?  Why do we find ourselves this week and possibly next week, as we did last week, discussing such an insignificant proposal in relation to the insurance industry?  I do not want to be negative and I have put forward two proposals that would bring about greater prospects for savings in regard to insurance costs than this Bill.  I suggested reducing the number of uninsured drivers through a new taxation system.  That alone would reduce the overall cost of insurance.  During the passage of an earlier Courts Bill I said that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be increased from its present £15,000 to £30,000.  That in its own way would filter through the system and have the effect of reducing overall insurers' costs.  Earlier I said that the amount expended by the State in providing for victims of uninsured drivers in 1986 has been £4 million.  If the system I proposed were agreed it would mean an immediate saving of that £4 million, because there would not be any uninsured drivers.</P>
    <P>I refer also to the specialist costs involved in high insurance awards.  Judicial and specialist costs contribute significantly <Col N="1202" /> to the overall level of compensation awards and, consequently, the high cost of insurance premiums.  Last year I said the overall loss of revenue through uninsured drivers averages about £48 million annually.  If that revenue were available from drivers who do not insure their cars the saving would be £48 million, and one does not have to be a great mathematician to reckon that if that was made available to the insurance companies the premiums would be correspondingly reduced.</P>
    <P>One other factor contributing to increased insurance costs is the increasing number of road accidents.  I do not like citing the position in Great Britain as an example, but the number of cars involved in accidents there is only 9 per cent of the vehicle population.  Ours is double that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> What the Deputy has said is true but there is another trend, namely, that jobs previously classified as being in manufacturing industry are now classified as jobs in the services industry.  A pattern has developed where manufacturing companies are sub-contracting jobs as, for instance, catering.  Previously such jobs <Col N="1206" /> were classified as being in the manufactuaring sector but now they are in the category of the services industry.

      <P>Existing regulations <Col N="1208" /> require that the selling price of all foodstuffs must be displayed and that, additionally, the price by weight or volume, usually per kilogram or per litre, must also be shown when foodstuffs are sold prepackaged in variable quantitites or are sold without being prepackaged and are measured or weighed for sale in the presence of the consumer in the shop.  Examples of such goods are meat, fruit and vegetables.  Bread is normally sold in standard sizes and would not, therefore, require to be priced by weight.</P>
      <P>There is also legislation which prescribes the sizes in which certain goods may be sold.  There are many examples of such goods such as tea, coffee, jams, butter and milk.  My Department are currently reviewing this legislation to determine whether more coherent ranges of sizes should be adopted in order to further assist the consumer in making real price comparisons.  The Deputy may be aware that an order was made recently which establishes a more practical range of sizes for frozen vegetables.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out that discussions are under way at EC level on a proposal to extend the requirement for unit pricing by weight or volume to all prepackaged goods which are not sold in an agreed range of sizes.  My Department are currently considering this proposal and all relevant interests, including consumer interests, are being consulted.</P>

      <P>This question arises from inquiries I had from old age pensioners who were confused about the price of bread.  The Minister said bread is normally sold in standard weights and sizes, but the fact is that a number of loaves are not standard.  Is there any procedure for providing that either the manufacturer or the supermarket would be obliged to show the unit weight, the price per unit weight or volume in that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are standard sizes for bread &mdash; 400 grammes, 600 grammes and 800 grammes, but I understand there are other types of bread on offer which vary in size.  It would be very <Col N="1209" /> difficult to price by weight &mdash; in other words, to have a standard size for all bread.  However, in respect of the standard sizes, I will look into the possibility of putting the actual weight on each pan loaf.  This is an area where one can over-legislate and confuse the consumer.  What we are trying to do is to simplify things and give as much information as possible to the consumer.  The discussion at EC level is about extending this information for the consumer and we must examine this in the interests of the consumer.  It may involve a major extension of unit pricing of many prepackaged goods not currently affected as many of these goods are not subject to a range of sizes.</P>
      <P>This is a more complex area than appears on the surface, but I can assure the Deputy that the objective of my Department is to have as much information as possible on the products on sale in the interests of the consumer.  If there are any particular difficulties the Deputy has in mind, I will be happy to examine them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West)</i> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will give the staffing details of the monitoring and supervisory section in his Department, with responsibility for insurance matters; and the level of strengthening of that section which has taken place in the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 27 staff are currently employed in the insurance section of my Department, as follows: one assistant secretary (part-time), two principals, one accountant grade I, four assistant principals, eight higher executive officers, seven executive officers, one clerical officer, and three clerical assistants. This compares with a total staff complement of 21 a year ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some further developments have also taken place and in this connection I would refer the Deputy to a question I answered on 11 February 1986.  For example, I have obtained sanction for the appointment of two actuaries, and their recruitment is <Col N="1210" /> being pursued with my colleague, the Minister for the Public Service.  Also, an independent review of the supervisory procedures used by the Department in non-life insurance was completed earlier this year.  This review has endorsed the methods used to date and has recommended a number of detailed developments which will be implemented in conjunction with the new computer system due to be installed in the insurance section later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are plesed to hear the Minister has acted on the commitment given here last year but we are very anxious about the appointment of the actuarial staff.  When the emergency legislation dealing with ICI was introduced the Minister gave a commitment that two actuaries would be taken either on a consultancy basis or full time on the staff.  Can the Minister positively say what steps he has taken other than asking his colleague, the Minister for the Public Service, for sanction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two main aspects to which I would like to refer. The recruitment of two actuaries is under discussion with the Minister for the Public Service.  We are very anxious to have two actuaries of the right calibre and to ensure that we have a proper professional complement in the staff to cover life and non-life insurance.  There is no unnecessary delay in the recruitment of these officers. Whether they will be recruited by way of consultancy or by full time employment is at present under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm or deny that the reason he cannot recruit the actuaries is that the Department will not pay the going rate?  If that is the case and if he is precluded from doing this, would he take my advice and take on this actuarial experience by way of consultancy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the increasing complexity of financial institutions &mdash; particularly in regard to insurance companies getting into mortgage lending and looking at things like stockbroking, and new developments in financial services generally &mdash; is the Minister satisfied that an increase of six additional staff members, and the actuaries is enough to give a strong supervisory section in a market that is changing dramatically? The insurance and financial areas are changing more dramatically than any other sector of the economy.  Is the supervisory section in the Department strong enough and aware of those rapidly changing developments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the insurance industry itself rather than other financial sectors.  We had a review of the supervisory procedures carried out by a consultant and the review endorsed the methods used to date.  I am satisfied that the increase in the complement is necessary in view of the complexity of the work.  In 1976 there were ten full time staff members and one part-time staff member.  We have increased staff numbers substantially.  The appointment of the actuaries together with the installation of an advanced computer system which will allow a supervisory exercise to be carried out over a short period of time will be of benefit to my Department.  I am satisfied that the supervisory powers within my Department and staff to deal with them are adequate to meet the requirements of the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the present position concerning the market entry and development scheme as announced in the Government White Paper on Industrial Policy; the number of firms participating; and the assistance available under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The market entry and development scheme is designed to assist companies with the <Col N="1213" /> potential of achieving significant growth in their exporting capacity and which are financially constrained to break into new markets or undertake major developments of existing markets.  The scheme assists exporters with some of the expenses involved such as travelling, overseas research, advertising and promotion, staff, agents' accommodation and warehousing which arise in connection with breaking into a new export market.</P>
      <P>The unique features of the scheme are that it operates on the basis of a ministerial guarantee in respect of loans raised by participating firms that, if at the end of a specified period, increased sales have not been sufficient to cover the full repayment of funds advanced, no further repayments will be required.  In addition, the scheme allows for repayments of the guaranteed loans by way of deferred payments so as not to damage the company's cash flow in the earlier years.</P>
      <P>During 1985 CTT approved seven projects under the scheme and this involves the guarantee of loans to a total value of £1.6 million.  These projects also qualify for assistance under normal CTT grant schemes to a level of £0.58 million.  The seven projects span markets from the US to Europe and embrace products as diverse as processed foods, upholstery fabrics and engineering goods.  CTT would hope to approve a further 15 projects in the course of 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was expected when the scheme was initiated that perhaps up to 200 firms might or could benefit from it. Would the Minister not agree that seven projects in the year from that total identified as being capable of benefiting is a small number which perhaps would indicate that the scheme is not being given the full commitment that it should get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The figure of 200 companies arises from an assessment by CTT that there would be so many companies in the country who would have the potential for achieving significant growth in export markets but who are financially constrained.  This <Col N="1214" /> scheme was brought in then and those companies are the target for the scheme, but it was introduced initially on a pilot basis.  It is proposed now that it continue on a pilot basis so that we can have quite a number of companies operating the scheme before an assessment is made. The projection is that approximately 16 firms will be involved in the scheme in 1986 and that would then provide an adequate base for an assessment of the scheme.  It is a new scheme.  It will work well.  In so far as it has gone it seems to be working well but, because of the small number of firms involved in the first year, which was intended to be a pilot year, this scheme was extended on a pilot basis for a second year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Have CTT taken the opportunity to bring the details of the scheme to the notice of the 200 projects which were identified that might benefit? Has he brought to their notice the question about the deferred payment of the loans which are guaranteed by the Minister? Quite a number of firms would participate if they were aware of the details and the fact that they can get this ministerial guarantee for the loans.  Will he undertake to see to it that they are all notified of the details of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes, I will undertake to guarantee that they are re-notified of the scheme, but CTT are not in a position yet to do a proper analysis on account of the fact that only seven firms have participated and I do not want to become involved in a commitment to massive expansion of the scheme which could be costly.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Certainly one method of rescuing companies has worked with a certain amount of success in the past and the IDA are available to assist workers who form co-operatives to rescue companies in difficulty.  However, a strategy like this is more likely to succeed if the initiative comes from the workforce rather than attempting to impose this kind of structure on companies by an outside agency or Government Department.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes, but we are dealing with two concepts.  The co-operative movement is very strong in certain areas and enormously successful businesses are run by co-operative societies, with advice available from the ICOS.  The question referred to the rescue of companies by workers forming co-operatives when there seems to be no other viable way of keeping a company afloat.  That has worked to a limited extent and the five companies to which I referred are grant aided by the IDA.  I am not aware of any others.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of the policy holder to decide the value for which his vehicle should be insured. In determining this value he should bear in mind that cars depreciate rapidly and that an insurance company will not compensate any policy holder for more than the loss he has suffered.  At renewal date each year, therefore, the policy holder should review the value of his car in line with the rate of depreciation so that the sum insured represents the correct value. Reducing the value may also, of course, reduce the premium.</P>

After three years or so if there was a crash the value was based on the price of a three year old car.

      <P>It is the policy holder who specifies the value of his or her car at each renewal date.  Obviously, if the car is over-valued a higher premium is paid.  It is a principle in the industry that no one should be compensated for more than he or she has lost.  This principle is widely operated and I do not have any statutory right to change it.  It is up to each policy holder to assess the value of her car at renewal date to ensure that he or she is not paying too much and is not over-insured.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Government are committed to encouraging the full exploitation of the country's natural resources particularly through the development of the food and drink industry.  The future of the industry can best be served by expansion and diversification into value-added consumer-ready products in accordance with the strategy outlined in the White Paper on Industrial Policy and the national plan. The IDA have drawn up strategies for each of the principal sub-sectors of the food industry.  The development of new products and markets are primary objectives of these strategies and some of the means of achieving the objectives are by encouraging joint ventures and licensing and technology agreements.  In addition to the IDA, the Deputy will be aware that there is also a wide range of facilities and incentives available from agencies such as CTT, CBF, Bord Bainne, BIM, IIRS and SFADCo, to enable the industry move in this direction.</P>
      <P>In view of the strategic importance which the Government attach to this industry, the Taoiseach recently announced the appointment of Deputy Hegarty as Minister of State in both the Departments of Agriculture and Industry and Commerce with special responsibility for food.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has established a food committee comprising relevant Departments and State agencies involved in the food area.  The principal aim of the committee, which held their first meeting in May, is to promote a fully co-ordinated approach towards the development of the food sector though better co-operation and-or co-ordination between the agencies concerned and to consider how they can contribute more effectively to advancement of the sector.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, while the State will continue to do everything possible to assist the industry, its health and future are dependent largely on initiatives deriving form the industry itself.</P>

I do not have figures for a later period.  Does the Minister also agree that a 10 per cent reduction in that period indicates that there is something seriously wrong with this sector?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not agree with the Deputy as the volume of food exports has increased during that period.  As a percentage of total exports it has decreased principally because of the success of the manufacturing industry, especially in the hi-tech and pharmaceutical areas which account for an enormous amount of exports.  The manufacturing industry have overtaken agriculture as the lead exporter over that period.  That is not to say that the volume of exports has gone down; on the contrary, it has probably gone up quite significantly over that period.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree the low investment in new product development, together with an over-dependence on meat products and meat based industries, has resulted in a loss in so far as our percentage of total exports is concerned?  I should like the Minister to bring to the attention of his task force the need to do something immediately in this area because, while he may not have importation figures available, I put it to him that about £800 million worth of food was imported last year although half of it could have produced locally.  I ask the Minister to convey to the task force that that borders on a national scandal for an agricultural country.</P>

Any housewife will tell you if you walk through a delicatessen or the deep freeze area in the supermarket you could identify many imported products which we should be able to produce at home.</P>
      <P>The second problem which also needs to be tackled is the problem of standards and Irish plant complying with international hygiene and veterinary standards.

      <P>We have the finest raw material in the world in the food area.  The strategy has to be to add as much value as possible to that for its export.  That is where the problem is.  We are in a market of 320 million people. <Col N="1223" /> The situation is not bad in Germany, Holland, France and the UK.  If we can sell into their domestic markets obviously they can sell into our domestic market.  We are not going to eliminate food imports. We can certainly substitute for imports and export a lot more in the coming years if we get the strategy right.  The other problem is that all the primary products &mdash; beef, milk, cereals &mdash; are in surplus now in Europe and to maintain our share of the market and get the maximum benefit we have to go for added value and sell more than our competitors.</P>

      <P>The detailed Action Plan for Cork announced by Minister Bruton on 11 May 1984 gave details of the Government's response to the Cork Task Force report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan had two main elements: (1) <Col N="1224" /> an immediate and substantial capital injection for infrastructural work in the greater Cork area, and (2) long term development measures designed to secure the future of the greater Cork area as a prime location for industry.</P>
    <P>In so far as industrial development is concerned, the action plan initiatives are being progressively implemented.  The Ministers for Finance and Communications are currently preparing regulations to give effect to the establishment of a freeport at Ringaskiddy.  A number of industrial estates in the greater Cork area were designated for higher grant purposes in November 1984, for a three year period.  Major marketing programmes by the IDA to the United States, Europe and the Far East in relation to Ringaskiddy are continuing.  An enterprise centre has been established in Cork city which will, <i>inter alia,</i> provide accommodation for a microelectronics design centre.  The IDA are negotiating with a European company to establish in the design centre.</P>
    <P>The IDA and Cork Corporation are actively considering proposals for the joint development of a 130 acre international services park at the Model Farm Road in order to maximise its potential for industrial development.  Funds have been allocated to the IDA for site development in 1986.</P>
    <P>The IDA are promoting the food city concept in Midleton and a number of projects have been approved for location there.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible at this point to quantify the success of the measures taken, these facilities and initiatives have greatly enhanced the attractiveness of the greater Cork area as a location for industry.  In the period November 1983 to November 1985, 1,962 new manufacturing jobs were created in the greater Cork area.  In the same period the IDA approved grant assistance for projects in the area with a long term potential of 3,467 jobs many of which have yet to come on stream.</P>

Rather than incurring the <Col N="1225" /> wrath of the Chair by rising to ask several separate questions to elicit further information from the Minister, I will pose a few questions all together for answer, if that is agreeable?  The first is: why was the report of the task force never published? What details are in the report that are preventing it from being published?  That is one of the important questions I want answered.  Also can the Minister tell me what progress has been achieved in regard to the enterprise centre?  How many units in it are taken up?  What progress has been made on the design centre?  It is fine to mention all those things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is difficult to know where to start.  I suppose I could follow the procedure adopted by the Deputy by, since he asked a series of questions, giving a series of answers.  The Free Ports Act of 1986 became law in March 1986 and the regulations are being put together now.  On the question of designation, ministerial orders designating small industrial sites at Hollyhill, Churchfield and Togher Industrial Estate at Ringaskiddy were signed in 1984.  This allowed a maximum capital grant rate of 50 per cent to apply for medium and large industry and 60 per cent will be available for other industrial estates in the small industries projects.</P>
      <P>On the question of marketing, marketing programmes in regard to the United States, Europe and the Far East have been completed.  Obviously, if any concrete proposals arise from those, that will be of great benefit to the Ringaskiddy area.  On the food processing area I referred to in the previous question, Hanson's Laboratory from Copenhagen have been approved by the IDA for a cheese project.  The company have purchased a building in Little Island and hope to be in production in 1986.  There is a new initiative with University College, Cork and An Foras Talúntais.  The Deputy is also aware of what is happening in Midleton where Erin Foods will have an involvement and jobs will be provided in the KMP food co-operative meat processing plant, with 100 jobs approved; Midleton Food Products have approval for jobs as have Emerald Seafoods.  So, there is quite a significant amount happening there as well.</P>

The Minister mentioned the free port, but why is implementation of that taking so long to achieve?  This was suggested by the task force in 1984 and, if the immediacy and urgency of this section was then established, why has it taken so long to become effective because it is not yet effective?

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to an announcement of 29 June 1984 which related to an investment of £1 million in ten companies &mdash; four new small industries and six existing companies &mdash; from which it was hoped to create 97 jobs over two years in Louth, Cavan and Monaghan. I am advised by the IDA that so far approximately 45 of these jobs did materialise, of which 35 are still in existence. I am further advised that one of the companies which was expected to create an additional 15 jobs through expansion did not do so and has, in fact, ceased operations.  The IDA will continue to monitor progress on the realisation of the remainder of the projected jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>Both questions essentially refer to the possible opening up of the Irish market in non-life insurance to EC insurers who would be permitted to write insurance risks here without having to be established in the State.  This is usually referred to as the Freedom of Services Directive. As Deputies will be aware, EC insurers have been free to establish in Ireland to write risks here by way of branch or subsidiary in both non-life and life insurance under directives implemented in 1976 and 1984 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> Freedom of establishment and freedom of services are rights under the Treaty of Rome.  Freedom of services is covered by the draft Second Directive on Non-Life Insurance.  This directive has been at EC Council working group level since 1976.  Negotiations have temporarily halted since 1984, pending the outcome of proceedings brought by the Commission before the European Court of Justice against Ireland, France, Denmark and Germany in relation to the implementation of the 1978 directive on co-insurance.  The ruling of the European Court, which is expected later this year, will have a major bearing on the further negotiations on the Non-Life Insurance Services Directive.</P>
    <P>The Irish non-life insurance industry have been consulted on and kept informed of developments in the negotiations on the directive and in the proceedings before the European Court of Justice. The industry are well aware of the implications of the further competition which will result from the opening up of the Irish market to EC insurers operating on a services basis, that is, without having an Irish establishment.  The industry have been regularly encouraged to prepare to face the challenge.  In order to allow time for such adaptation, the Irish delegation some time ago lodged a request for a temporary derogation from the implementation of the directive.  My Department will continue to assist the industry in their adaptation measures and communication will be maintained with the industry in further negotiations on the draft directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the insurance industry, or the union representing the 8,000 employees of that industry, made a submission to the Minister concerning the possible seeking of a derogation from this directive over a period of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, my Department are in constant contact with the industry and, indeed, I met a deputation of one committee of unions representing workers in the area and the question of derogation was raised.  In my <Col N="1233" /> reply I stated that the Irish delegation lodged a request for a temporary derogation from the implementation of the directive.  However, should the court of justice give a decision against Ireland's position and against the position of other countries then we may not be in a position to get a derogation.  It would be a court of justice decision rather than a Council decision.  I have been trying to encourage the industry to face up to the fact that there will be liberalisation some time, perhaps sooner rather than later.  There is a need to be competitive and to reach out and offer their services abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Time is being sought so that the industry can gear themselves up to deal with this new competition.  They have asked the Minister to seek a derogation. I impress upon him the need for it to protect jobs and also to protect a valuable source of income for State borrowing. If the Freedom of Services Directive comes into being companies will not have to maintain any of their premium income in the State.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the urgency of upgrading the technology capacity of Irish industry, he will state (a) the number of technology transfer agreements completed in 1985 with foreign companies; (b) of these, the number which were joint ventures; and (c) the number of applications to date for the new technology acquisition grants under the Industrial Development Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department arranged for the conclusion with overseas companies of 52 technology transfer agreements in 1985, of which 28 were joint ventures.  The Industrial Development Act, 1986, enacted on 7 May contains provision for a new technology acquisition grants scheme to assist companies to develop their technological capability.  As the proposed scheme represents a change to our regime of State aids, the approval of the Commission of the European Communities will be required prior to its implementation. The relevant notification has been sent to the Commission.  In the meantime a number of companies have expressed interest in availing of the new technology acquisition grants and they are in discussion with the industrial development agencies on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that high industrial output and new sources of employment depend on the electronics sector.  The Irish productivity centre noted in May that software will grow by 20 per cent a year over the coming decade.  They said Ireland is quite weak in this sector.  Can the Minister state whether any special effort is being made to remedy our weaknesses in the software <Col N="1235" /> area by buying in expertise through specific joint ventures with established overseas companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I do not think it is correct to say that our total industrial base will be dependent on high technology.  That is not the way to approach it.  It is only part of the policy, and certainly an important part. The IDA encouraged over the last number of years the development of software by bright young Irish graduates working in companies here or coming from the universities.  They also succeeded in encouraging major electronics companies to locate research and development divisions of their operations, including software, in Ireland.  I agree with the Deputy that software is an area of great potential.  The agencies are very aware of that and are actively promoting the development of software both indigenously and by the enticement of foreign companies into Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not indicate, as the Minister said, that the software electronics sector is the only expanding element of industry.  Can the Minister comment on a recent report by the sectoral development committee on the electronics industry which pointed out that large numbers of skilled personnel, especially in the software area, are leaving the country because of heavy taxation on their pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are areas at the front edge of industrial development especially in research and development.  Part of this is in the development of software and coarseware, where there is a very small number of experts worldwide who operate in a world market.  They can be attracted out of the country and into the east coast of the United States, or into California, by offering levels of salary which would be impossible to match here.  A number of sections in the recent Finance Bill will help in a major way because stock options can be provided by companies to recompense targeted workers they regard as <Col N="1236" /> having very high levels of skills, who are in the world market and who can move quite easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The report by the development committee said that quite a number of people are leaving the country because of taxation.  The Minister says they are going because they are getting high salaries. Does he not accept that the reason they are leaving is taxation on pay?  Does the Minister not consider that it is unsatisfactory that the national micro-electronics research centre which was intended as a focus for joint research and development between the universities and industry depends to such an extent on the EC for its research work?  In 1985, 54 per cent of its research work came from the EC.  What steps does the Minister envisage to increase participation by native industry in research and development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)</NameTxt>
      <P>A small number of very qualified graduates in electronics and in pharmaceuticals leave Ireland and others come in.  The movement is caused by a variety of factors. Many people like to travel when they are young.  Others go for experience.  Others are attracted out by lifestyle and others are attracted out by money.  Taxation in individual countries is included as part of that package but it is impossible to put a figure value on it.  It is something that always has to be taken into account.  In the absence of radically reducing taxation, the best option is to allow companies to target key personnel in the manner in which they can now target them as a result of the stock option provisions in the recent Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question raises a very interesting matter about the level of research and development and other areas such as management and marketing in indigenous companies.  As the Deputy is aware, there is now a conscious policy of developing key indigenous firms.  It is a company development scheme which, among other things, would be interested in developing research and development in indigenous industry.  As the Deputy rightly points out, proper research and <Col N="1237" /> development are the key to expansion in the future.</P>

      <P>When the prices commission were abolished they were abolished on the basis that there would be a saving of about £300,000 and because inflation was quite low and is now approaching zero figures that competition in the market place would keep prices down in the absence of control.  If particular sectors or particular areas were seen to cause difficulty it was because competition was not allowed to operate. In areas such as these, all the powers of the Prices Acts are still available to me and I would refer the problem area to the Commission on Restrictive Practices to establish if competition was being inhibited. With the staff available to me in the Department and the residual staff in the prices commission I had surveys carried out on the price of petrol.  As the Deputy is aware, half of the outlets surveyed were overcharging, many of them significantly.  They were resurveyed subsequently and now about 91 per cent, representing practically all the volume&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This was a once off targeting as a result of complaints which came into the Department. The petrol aspect is now OK.  They are at the right price.  A small group of retailers are still overcharging but they represent a very small amount of the total volume.  Another area which was causing difficulty or seemed to be on the basis of complaints coming in to me was the price of drink.  This was referred to the Commission on Restrictive Practices and I am awaiting a full report on that area. It was along those lines I spoke at that particular luncheon and gave the information which was available to me.</P>

      <P>I had better say this now.  I received today about four questions for Private Notice.  I considered those questions carefully in accordance with Standing Orders and precedent.  I was clearly of the opinion that those questions did not qualify for Private Notice and, accordingly, I ruled them out of order.  I certainly did not rule them out of order lightly.  It would be much more pleasant for me to admit them all than to rule them out of order.  I have no alternative.  In accordance with the long standing precedent in this House going back to the foundation of the Chamber the Chair never has and I do not intend to start, discussed its rulings in the House.  If I were to do that, for example, <Col N="1242" /> today I would have four different arguments to deal with.  It just would not work.  I am sorry, but that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I do not wish to enter into argument with you.  I raised this issue a fortnight ago on the agricultural officers' dispute.  The position appears to be that when there is a major industrial dispute &mdash; I shall not go into the details of the one I sought to raise &mdash; and when a Deputy raises it once, it appears as if its urgency is in your mind then lost.  I would contend that two of the questions down in the names of Deputy De Rossa and me to two different Ministers were putting forward the reason that this is now a matter of urgency today, different from what it was yesterday or last week.  That contention is based on four issues: one, that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have called for an all-out picket which is at present under discussion; second, there is a danger of the dispute spreading to the county if there is not a resolution found by tomorrow; third, that the Army are now involved; and, fourth, there is a danger that the peace that had obtained on the picket lines at the various tipheads will disappear, the workers will feel that the Army are now involved and will block the public coming to these tipheads.  It is on those four grounds I would contend it is now an urgent matter, more urgent than it was yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no reason to argue with you, a Cheann Comhairle, but it seems to be a fair argument on the part of Deputies on all sides of the House who wish to see a resolution of this very serious dispute, unless you can prove to me that it is not urgent.  I know how the system works.  I know the difficulty you are in, a Cheann Comhairle.  I would have thought that if the Minister who gave me an undertaking in the course of the Labour Estimate last week was interested in solving this dispute he would be glad to come into this House and endeavour to get both sides back to the Labour Court.  That is <Col N="1244" /> all we are seeking &mdash; not to argue with the Chair, not to have any difficulty with anybody else, but to get the Minister for Labour to bring both sides in this very serious dispute back into the Labour Court, avoiding all of this unnecessary argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided that I would allow Deputy Bertie Ahern to make his case because he is a former Chief Whip of the largest party in the Dáil and is a highly respected Member of the House.  But to anybody listening it is quite clear that my earlier statement was meant to cover the situation in general in regard to Private Members' questions and the rulings of the Chair in particular. Somebody has to be charged with making the rulings.  I have made the rulings.  I have made them in good faith.  That is all I can say: I made them in good faith and without any bias one way or the other.  I am not going to discuss these rulings in the House.  That is in accordance with a rule of the House that is older than the carpet on the floor.  I am not going to go back on that.  The reason for it should be obvious.  I am sorry I cannot help further. That is the position.  I take the view, rightly or wrongly, that it is bad enough for the Chair to have to wrangle with one Deputy, but when that Deputy either becomes exhausted or decides to sit down and another Deputy then gets up on the very same line, that is grossly disorderly. I have dealt with all the questions that were put today and I am not dealing with any more.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to make the point to you that perhaps you would consider that there must be something quite extraordinary about your interpretation of Standing Orders if in the course of two days ten questions put forward by Deputies in all good faith as being of urgent public importance have had to be ruled out.  I mentioned this to you before. Perhaps, to make life easier for yourself and for all of us, something might be raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges over which you competently and wisely preside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, on a point of order, I might make this point to you, a Cheann Comhairle, that on the question that Deputy Lyons was seeking to raise it seems to us extraordinary that yesterday a question was ruled out of order on the basis that the Taoiseach had no function and exactly the same sort of question today was ruled out of order because it was not urgent.  I put it to you, Sir, that it seems <Col N="1246" /> there is a very clear contradiction in ruling there.  If a certain type of question was ruled out of order yesterday because the Taoiseach had no function, namely the Egan case, it might perhaps have been ruled out of order today on the same basis, that the Taoiseach had no function. It does seem extraordinary that a similar type of question, was ruled out of order today on a different basis, namely, urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome a discussion on matters like this at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I hope I will not be regarded as being smart, or appearing to be smart, when I say that rarely in my term of office over four years did we have them.  I welcome any of these matters that are brought up. If there is a consensus on a certain thing we will see where we go from there.  Just because I had to rule out of order four questions today and six yesterday does not make the thing right or any different. I think Deputy Haughey will not disagree with me when I say that, when he and I came in here in or about the same time, a Private Notice Question was as rare as is a good day now.</P>

You are the distinguished Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I have said this to you before.  You often say to us &ldquo;Let some Deputy raise it at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges&rdquo;. Perhaps you yourself would put some proposal before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to alleviate or obviate what you regard as a very distressing and unhappy series of events at this time of the day every day the House is sitting. Perhaps, in your own interest, for your <Col N="1247" /> own self-protection, and to avoid the difficulties which this matter causes you, in being fair, in giving rulings and interpretations here, you yourself would put before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges some new formula for deciding these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say, Deputy, that it is not customary for the Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to initiate something, that usually it comes from the Whip of one of the major parties.  I will certainly co-operate with the Deputy.  I will agree that I do regard it, perhaps not stressful, because when one takes on a job one has to do it, but as a distasteful part of my job to come in here day after day arguing on points that are obviously out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment I was demonstrating to the House that the jury system is not a significant factor as regards insurance costs but that there are a number of other areas where substantial savings could be effected if they were tackled by the Government.  I outlined the effects on the overall cost of insurance of very expensive legal structures which require that two senior counsel, one junior counsel and a solicitor be in attendance.  I asked the Minister to amend that requirement. This is a major contributory factor to the escalating cost of insurance and represents a significant proportion of the award which a plaintiff receives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also indicated that uninsured drivers were a contributory factor to the overall cost of insurance and I gave it as my view that there is need for an urgent review of the present system of collecting motor insurance and taxation.  While Members may not agree with my point that motor insurance and taxation could more fairly and equitably be collected through a tax on motor fuel, this suggestion deserves <Col N="1287" /> the serious consideration of the House as a method of eliminating the unacceptably high number of uninsured vehicles.</P>
    <P>We all know the trauma and turmoil which an uninsured driver can cause if he is involved in an accident.  He would not have any insurance with which to compensate an injured victim.  The State has imposed a substantial levy on insurance companies, and thus indirectly on those taking out insurance, to protect them in such circumstances.  If we did not have uninsured drivers we would make a significant contribution towards reducing the overall cost of insurance.  What we are discussing today is so insignificant in terms of its contribution to insurance costs that it hardly warrants debate.</P>
    <P>If we take it that road accidents represent a high percentage of all insurance claims, then it is logical that the causes of road accidents should be identified and some means devised to reduce the incidence of such accidents.  Successive Governments have not done sufficient to create an awareness that accidents contribute substantially to the high cost of motor insurance.  Almost 50 per cent of all road accidents are alcohol related.  I know the Government intend to bring in legislation to reform the licensing laws.  We have not seen this Bill but if it is proposed to liberalise the licensing laws I will be opposed to it.  It would be a step in the right direction to restrict the availability of alcohol and would make a major contribution towards reducting the level of serious road accidents.</P>
    <P>Another contributory factor to the cost of insurance is the cost of hospitalisation. Orthopaedic hospital beds are a scarce commodity but 28 per cent of them are occupied by the victims of road accidents. That gives some idea of the money involved in providing health care for such victims. We have a large waiting list of people, particularly the elderly, who are in need of orthopaedic treatment.</P>
    <P>I have made the point on many occasions that one cannot totally isolate one aspect of national administration from another and neither can one isolate the question of disbandment of the jury <Col N="1288" /> system and the cost of motor insurance from other areas such as that to which I have referred.  There should be a co-ordinated approach aimed at reducing overall expenditure in the areas I referred to.  We tend to overlook the level of State support in the form of disability benefits paid to victims of road accidents when we are considering the cost of such accidents. It is a hidden cost but we must bear it in mind when considering our approach to the Bill.  It has been pointed out to me that the cost of repairing vehicles involved in road accidents had escalated in recent years as a direct result of Government policies.  For example, because of the Government's rate of VAT a car wing costs £400 here compared to £150 in Northern Ireland.  That difference in cost is reflected in insurance settlements.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Bill is necessary and I do not know where the demand for it came from, but I suspect certain vested interests in the insurance industry were involved.  In my view it is a gesture by the Government to placate those who complain about high insurance costs.  I hope the debate exposes the Bill for what it is, an effort by the Government to pretend they are concerned about escalating insurance costs.  I get annoyed when I think of the other areas which are major contributory factors to the high cost of insurance that should be tackled here.  Those areas are being ignored by the House.  The Bill proposes to dismantle the only provision in our judicial system that gives a citizen the right and the opportunity to participate in settling damages in civil injury claims.  The Minister did not put forward a shred of evidence to indicate that the jury system has been a contributory factor to the overall cost of insurance.  I have demonstrated that it is the least significant area in terms of its contribution to overall costs.  The Bill should be rejected.  It does nothing to achieve the objective, which presumably the Minister has, to tackle the escalating cost of insurance cover.</P>

      <P>If, as Deputy Hyland said, the insurance industry has a vested interest <Col N="1289" /> in the abolition of the jury system, it must be said that the legal profession have a vested interest in retaining that system.  That is one of the reasons why there has been such vocal opposition from the legal profession to the measures before the House.  Deputies like myself are between the devil and the deep blue sea in trying to reach a conclusion on this matter.  On one side we have the legal profession who are the most arrogant, most dangerous and most vicious profession I know.  As individuals they are nice people but as a professional body they would slit one's throat if one tried to impinge on their rights or questioned their method of operation.  I will support that statement later with some facts.  On the other hand, insurance companies use every trick in the book to extract higher premiums, avoid reasonable risks and, in the event of a claim, they will use every means possible to get out of it.  I have evidence to support that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time I have been a strong advocate of the abolition of the jury system but at this stage I am not so sure. I support the Bill but, as occurs in regard to a lot of legislation, experience changes one's view.  Some of the most recent experiences I have had with the legal profession lead me to believe that I would be safer going before a jury if I had to go to court.  I am prompted to support the Bill because jury decisions are being overruled frequently by the Supreme Court.  Deputy Skelly told us of a case in Cork where an award by a jury was reduced on appeal to the Supreme Court. That man had to have his leg amputated arising out of an explosion in the Glen of Imaal.  His claim was dealt with by a jury in the High Court but his award was reduced drastically by the Supreme Court.  The courts were manipulated in such a way that the case was not defended in the High Court by the Department of Defence out of fear that too much would emerge about the incident.  The High Court jury awarded huge damages but the amount of the award was contested by the Department in the Supreme Court.  The details of the incident did not have to come out in the Supreme Court <Col N="1290" /> because the issue to be decided related to the amount of the award.  That man was a victim of the manipulation of the legal system not only by the legal profession but by an arm of the State.</P>
    <P>I should like to give another example. A woman whose husband was killed when he fell from a roof was awarded £65,000 by the High Court but the defendants had money to take the case to the Supreme Court where the award was thrown out.  The Supreme Court held that the woman, the mother of five children, was not entitled to one penny because of a technicality.  Is that justice?  What power have juries in such cases?  In my view they do not have any.  For that reason why do we not cut out the messing and the costs involved and let the Judiciary make the decisions?  We must bear in mind that an appeal to the Supreme Court costs the insurance companies a lot of money and that is passed on to those who take out insurance cover.  It represents nice profit for the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Although I support the Bill I have reservations about its provisions.  The cases I mentioned are examples of why the archaic ways of Irish justice are notorious and why they are enjoyed by those who are part of the system but feared and detested by those who suffer delays and are denied justice because they cannot afford the costs.  Calls for reform are heard from time to time but die quickly because of the indifference of the legal profession or their opposition. The will for reform has been killed by the indifference of all political parties in the past.  They have treated law reform as an issue of minor electoral appeal that did not matter.  Our problems exist because of the apathy of all policital parties. Deputy Skelly said my party were most culpable but there are lawyers on all sides.</P>
    <P>There is a need for major improvements and radical experiments aimed at removing waste of time and money. Unfortunately, that need has not been accepted by the legal profession.  Even minor changes are accepted only under pressure of public opinion.  I could quote many examples.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> Three years ago, in my innocence, I made a statement in Cork about the legal profession and the delays being experienced by house purchasers.  I was backed by the city manager at that time.  Lo and behold, the following day I had the Southern Law Association down on my back.  They said I was exaggerating.  It went from there to something else and I began to get letters from victims of bad judgments, or bad performances, or bad professional service by lawyers.  I put my case to the Minister at the time.  We were told by the Southern Law Association and the Incorporated Law Society that there was no problem, it was exaggeration, a political gimmick.  The evidence was gathered by the Minister, and the Law Society had to eat humble pie and accept there was a major problem involving mismanagement by lawyers, misbehaviour by lawyers and negligence by a number of lawyers.  If negligence arises, God help the client.  He cannot get his case into court because it is very difficult, and if he succeeds in getting it to court he is entering a jungle at his own peril.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now convinced there is need for reform.  The Incorporated Law Society now agree there is need for reform and they have put their views to the Minister.  We hope there will be legislation to deal with these matters in the next eight or nine months.  The point I have been making is that it is difficult to get those people to admit anything. They hide behind their dignity and the privileges they have enjoyed for so long. A major review of civil procedures is overdue and there is an immediate need for more radical reforms than those being proposed here now.  I agree with Deputy Hyland that this Bill is only the start.  I hope it is not just a sop because there is need for great reform in all aspects of the court system.</P>
    <P>The causes of avoidable delay and unnecessary expense must be identified not only in consultation with the legal profession but with the other users of the <Col N="1292" /> court system, and they are as important as the legal profession because they have to endure the present system.  Reform must occur with or without the co-operation of the legal profession.  It is regrettable that the Law Reform Commission have not been more active in this important area.  Instead of issuing reports and studies on minor issues of law, they should get involved in the difficult but more urgent task of trying to improve our court system.  I am disappointed that a major study has not been done on this by the commission.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable also that there has been lack of political will and lack of professional pride by the legal profession.  This has prevented us from modernising and simplifying the existing body of law.  For example, if we buy houses we have to endure the whole procedure of conveyancing, bridging loans and the heartbreaks that go with them.  Last year a Private Members' Bill went through the House of Commons in Britain, the sponsor being a member called Mitchell.  I was of the opinion that we could adapt that law to our condition, and I got the Bill and sent it to a friendly lawyer whom I trusted.  I got the opinion back: &ldquo;You are wasting your time.  The property laws in Ireland are so dated that you cannot simplify the conveyancing system.&rdquo;  They have managed to bring their laws somewhat up to date in Britain but here we left them in the 19th century, and consequently people are suffering, with 10 per cent going on to the price of houses every day in the week because we have not done our duty, or we have been influenced by the profession into not doing our duty.</P>
    <P>The obvious priority given to specific issues instead of broader issues benefiting the entire administration of justice such as reform of procedures and the simplification of the law seems to be very questionable. Law reform should be a continuing process at several levels.  At the moment we are moving too slowly and not always in the most urgent matters. Although complaints abound, there is no momentum behind law reform policy either from the profession or the politicians.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> As an aside, I will look at the Department of Justice.  We have had successive Ministers and I will not in any way criticise former Ministers, one of whom is sitting opposite.  However, I am sure Deputy Doherty will agree that most of his time was taken up with fire brigade actions dealing with riots in prisons or bank robberies throughout the country, and he had no time to deal with the important issues of law reform, which were his responsibility.  Much thought should be given to the role of the Department of Justice.  Unfortunately they and the Minister seem to be taken up with crisis after crisis.  Therefore, not only am I critical of the legal profession, but we as politicians should come up with procedures in the Dáil whereby non-controversial technical Bills could be put through the House fairly rapidly and parliamentary time could be given to the real issues, important Bills dealing in particular with law reform.</P>

      <P>I have finished with that matter.  It is my opinion that the whole process of law reform is governed externally by the major influence of the legal profession in all political parties.  Suggestions by some parliamentarians are resisted by vested interests who are effective in ensuring that their own interests are represented in the House and who can react so viciously when their interests are jeopardised.  It is my opinion that the legal process is being used as a vehicle of profit and power by the legal profession and by some of the financial institutions who are intertwined with the legal profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing that.  They use the court system as a weapon of intimidation against public representatives and the media.  I have many examples of how the court system is being used at the moment.  I have a list of court writ threats <Col N="1294" /> against me from building societies and lawyers.  The media also have them because they published speeches I had made.  That is the type of intimidation people like me and the newspapers have to put up with if we try to raise points of public interest.  I cannot insure myself against libel and therefore individuals must think hard before they speak out, because we will get threats of writs from building societies if we question their <i>modus operandi</i> in taking commissions from insurance, and the restrictive practices they operate.  It is a serious issue involving the courts system.</P>
      <P>I am not overstating my case when I say some of the financial institutions that are so deeply intertwined with the legal profession are using the courts to silence not only public representatives but also the press.  They are not above threatening public representatives with legal proceedings which, if successful, would put many of us out of business.  They have massive resources and their actions can be effective.  We have to look at our personal positions.  I have evidence here that there is widescale intimidation of public representatives and the media&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a major threat facing any public representative who takes on the powerful interests in the country.  I am supporting the Bill but I am doing so on the assumption that more radical and far-reaching reforms will follow in the near future.  I do so because I believe the present courts system where juries are involved has direct relevance to the massive escalation of insurance premiums and has resulted in the virtual breakdown of risk insurance cover.  I have plenty of examples of this and will quote one or two to show that reforms are required.  I have here a copy of a letter from an employer in Cork to the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the heading &ldquo;Insurance increases in employers' liability&rdquo;.  The letter stated:</P>
      <P>Further to our previous correspondence last year regarding increases in our insurance costs, this year's increase in employers' liability cover alone has gone from £19,500 to £28,000.  Our total insurance bill for this year is £50,000.</P>
      <P>The letter stated the company had a workforce of 28 persons and were paying more than £1,000 per week for insurance. That is a huge millstone around the neck of any industry.  In my speech I referred to insurance companies extracting as high a premium as possible and I have here a letter from a Cork firm addressed to me for transmission to the Minister.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I apologise if this letter seems long-winded but I would like to make one further point.  Having failed to get insurance in the Republic of Ireland, we took our proposal to an insurance broker in the United Kingdom.  We asked them to quote us for employers' and public liability insurance not only for the UK but for the other 11 countries in the EEC.  I must stress we did <Col N="1296" /> not mention Ireland by name but having taken all other relevant details they reported back within a week with the following staggering reply.</P>
    <P>They were pleased to inform us that our application for employers' and public liability insurance has been vetted and was passed as an acceptable risk and the cost would be £1,200 for one year.</P>
    <P>The letter stated that the public liability was to cover six qualified persons but there were a number of stipulations as follows: the company would be registered in the UK, it would be subject to UK law, tax returns would be filed in the UK the company could employ only recognised craftsmen, namely, those up to British standards, and there was a final stipulation that should the company be working outside the United Kingdom at present they could not employ foreign personnel.  That is concrete proof that what is happening in the insurance business here is killing industry and it is encouraging people to take their companies abroad.  The writer of the letter said that the insurance company were quite happy to accept them if they operated from their country, paid their taxes and were subject to their company laws.  However, that company were not considered an acceptable risk in Ireland. It is a sad state of affairs and sums up the chaotic situation existing.  We are caught between the legal profession and the insurance companies and I do not know which of them is taking us for a ride.</P>
    <P>The jury system is not the only reason for the high cost of insurance cover but it is a prime reason.  In jury cases the human element must be taken into account.  Juries are normally hearing cases for the first time and in many instances the jurors are in court for the first time in their lives.  Therefore, they are vulnerable to pleadings in cases where injuries are concerned and, accordingly, at times they make judgments that are inconsistent.  This point has been made during the years and it is one reason the insurance industry has called for the abolition of juries in certain trials.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> I have reservations because I can see that both sides are not acting fairly. Another factor that adds to the high cost of insurance is the matter of over-representation in the courts.  If a person wishes to go to the High Court he must have two senior and one junior counsel and a solicitor and providing the same number for the other side, we have a total of eight persons.  The insurance company pick up the bill but the cost ultimately is borne by the public in their insurance premiums.  I have debated this matter with lawyers in Cork and also in this House.  Privately they say they agree with one but add that any change in the system would be against their interests.  The process is killing industry and it is clogging up the courts, causing hardship because of the delays.</P>
    <P>I go along with the Bill in the expectation that it is not just a sop to the critics and that it will be followed by real reform in the next 12 months in respect of over-representation in the courts.  I hope there will be real reform in relation to solicitors and the way the Solicitors Act is operated.  We should not be fobbed off with comments that this matter is under discussion or that there will have to be further consultations.  The public will not tolerate that because the country is falling apart.</P>
    <P>If the jury system is abolished the insurance companies will have a major responsibility to bring some order and balance into the industry.  They must change their attitude.  As I have shown, they are running away from their responsibilities in certain types of cases.  I hope the Irish Insurance Federation are serious about the remarks they made yesterday and which were reported in the newspapers, that they will bring about an improvement in the insurance market as soon as possible if this Bill is passed.  We will be watching to see their performance in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>All types of risk insurance are in a chaotic situation.  Employer's liability is a huge element in the cost of employment. In my constituency I would put the number of jobs affected in the hundreds. <Col N="1298" /> A car hire firm in Cork got an international franchise but Norwich Union took them for a ride for three months. They discussed figures with them but after three months they said no.  The businessman brought his case to the Minister who went to the declined cases committee, and they went around in circles for another two months.  Then the entrepreneur gave up in frustration.  I can cite many more such cases.  If we were to tot up all the cases I have heard about we would find that there were hundreds of jobs at risk.  We are setting up new grants systems, enterprise agencies, the National Development Corporation and so on, but people who want to set up small industries are being discouraged because of the high cost of insurance.  We are dealing with this in a very small way today but this is very urgent and we should take the necessary steps to bring the industry under control.</P>
    <P>Irish people have become litigation conscious in the past few years.  If a person slips in a dance hall he goes to his solicitor next day and claims against the dance hall proprietor.  All this is adding to the cost of insurance.  It costs £70 or £80 to get a specialist's report and if he is called to give evidence in court, it will cost a fair amount.  All this adds to the high cost of premiums.  As I said, we are spending vast sums of money creating jobs through State agencies but the chaos in the insurance industry is killing initiative in many other areas.  Hundreds of jobs have been lost, or have not been created, in the past 12 months in my area alone because of the high cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>We must have a better programme of industrial safety.  We are not the greatest in Europe so far as industrial safety is concerned, and major improvements are required.  If we had higher safety standards insurance costs could be reduced.</P>
    <P>At my clinics my constituents tell me that many cases could be dealt with if the parties involved and their solicitors behaved sensibly.  Many cases are taken to court so that the legal profession can claim increased fees and costs.  I have <Col N="1299" /> heard of people who cannot afford litigation costs agreeing to pay their solicitors a percentage of the award.  This means that the greater the award the larger the cut for the solicitor.  The Law Society say this is illegal but it is happening and is adding to insurance costs.  The cases are taken into court, the sympathies of the juries are played upon and costs escalate. More important, the court calendar is crowded and a person who is suffering serious hardship because of a motor accident cannot get his case heard in court for three or four years.  This causes serious hardship.  This area too should be looked at.</P>
    <P>As I said, this system is being used as an instrument of profit by the legal profession.  As legislators we have a responsibility to eliminate this major problem.  Last December I spoke in this House about the free legal aid system and called it a run-in, run-out and collect your fee system, and I still stand over that.  The figures recently published in the press as a result of parliamentary questions are now being contested by every solicitor involved in the free legal aid system in a particular area &mdash; I do not want to be too specific.  Every solicitor involved is having a go at the individual who wrote the article in the newspaper.  This shows the Mafia type operation which is going on here.</P>
    <P>I have plenty of letters here to back up the case I am making &mdash; solicitors' letters representing building societies, individuals, and so on.  This is a very serious problem which this House must face up to because it is affecting employment, the court system and people who are trying to buy houses.  In my opinion, we have done little or nothing in the past 50 or 60 years to improve the situation because of the powerful vested interests involved.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill is a step in the right direction.  If Governments do not act, Deputies on all sides must come together and put forward Private Members' Bills to get the Government to act.  I would be prepared to sit down with anybody on any side of the House to come up with <Col N="1300" /> some proposals to start to tackle this appalling problem.  In this way we would be doing the public a very good service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies have referred to the fact that there are vested interests &mdash; the insurance companies and the legal profession.  Naturally where there is financial gain involved, great interest is shown by the parties involved. Our function is to ensure that we have a fair and just court system which will give the greatest possible protection to all our citizens, particularly accident victims.</P>
      <P>The Government's intention to abolish the jury system in certain civil actions will mean that no longer will we have juries sitting as assessors of damages and the amounts to be awarded in our courts. This is a great pity.</P>
      <P>The Minister could have brought a more comprehensive Bill into the house dealing with wider matters and all the factors that contribute to the high cost of insurance to the general public, but I do not believe the matter can be dealt with by the abolition of the jury system.  At the same time, I am not suggesting or implying that the jury system does not need to be improved.  It does, and I will outline where I believe improvements can be made.  Juries are comprised of men and women and have in the past rendered a service that could be rendnered only by people who have no vested interest other than the giving of an award in fairness and justice to the victim of an accident.  The complaint most frequently heard concerning juries is that they make inflated awards, that jury awards as far as the insurance industry are concerned are far too high but, of course one can ask at the end of the day, who better to decide on such awards?  After all, they are the people who pay for and contribute towards the costs in one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past awards here have tended to be much higher than awards in Britain. Recently very high awards were made in Great Britain.  This is a jurisdiction where the trial judge sits alone but where conditions otherwise in the courts are closely similar to what obtain here.  The insurance industry and others have emphasised <Col N="1301" /> that, as a result of appeals in many cases, the Supreme Court has reduced the amount of awards and thereby indicated that the jury awards tend to be over-generous.  It has been said that the jury's sympathy is on the side of the complainant and they fail to take into account that insurance companies suffer a real loss by over-generous compensation.</P>
    <P>What has always been described as a great defect in the jury system is the inconsistency of jury awards and the total lack of predictability of awards.  Many such awards can discourage parties from going to court because they perceive a certain standard for settlement.  The Government claim that litigation would become speedier and cheaper if the jury system were abolished and that the amount of awards given by a judge sitting alone would be more predictable.  The Taoiseach was quoted recently as saying that, when they take away the right of citizens to trial by jury in personal accident or injury cases, the Government will expect cheaper insurance in return.  On the other hand, the insurance industry stated that this measure will not bring about a reduction in the cost of insurance premiums; rather it will help to stabilise insurance premium rates.  There is a conflict between what the Taoiseach is saying on the one hand and what the insurance companies are saying on the other.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the insurance industry claim that the abolition of the jury system could bring about greater stability.  That may be true.  The jury method of assessment is a long established feature of the administration of justice here and it should not be abolished. Rather it should be improved and strengthened.  I hope the Minister will bring in another Bill to allow us an opportunity to examine in greater detail the real difficulties which are causing the high cost of insurance at the moment.  The fact that jury awards are too high, as is claimed by some, is not a valid reason for the abolition of the system.  It could be said that awards by judges in other jurisdictions are too low, and I believe that is <Col N="1302" /> the case in Great Britain.  The fact that the Supreme Court in some cases has overturned decisions of the High Court really indicates nothing.  After all, it is quite regular for decisions of the Supreme Court to overturn decisions of High Court judges.</P>
    <P>The jury system is an essential part of our system of justice and we should not set about its abolition without taking very serious account of all that is involved. However, I agree that a greater degree of consistency should be introduced.  It could be achieved in the assessment of damage bearing in mind what is necessary to ensure a fair and just award.  There are a number of methods by which greater consistency and general improvement in the jury system could be brought about. A jury can comprise 12 men or women or a combination of both.  I have always believed that they are representative of our people and our society, and that is a very important element of justification for the retention of the jury system.  It can be said also that juries do not form part of any lobby, vested interest, or financial or professional grouping.  The importance of juries in criminal cases has long been accepted here and juries are an essential part of criminal trials.  I cannot see why peoples should be denied the right of a jury assessment in cases of serious injury.</P>
    <P>We all know that jury assessment is not an exact science, but invariably, because of their composition, juries are more representative than a single judge sitting alone.  Consider the lack of uniformity amongst judges and district justices in the lower courts.  A case has been made that there is a lack of uniformity in awards made by juries.  Taking into account the Circuit Court and the District Court I am not happy that we can improve that by the abolition of the jury system.  One can see in the Circuit Court and the District Court, in cases that are somewhat similar, the very wide differences that obtain between one court and the other.  Lack of uniformity in the lower courts can very well indicate how difficult it could be to obtain the type of uniformity we seek in the higher courts in the absence of juries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> One of the practical effects of the abolition of the jury system will be to remove from the public at large one of the very few opportunities they have to participate in the administration of justice.  It will also transfer responsibility for setting of standards of behaviour the hands of a cross-section of the community who collectively have wide experience of ordinary living and appreciation of acceptable behaviour within the community.</P>

    <P>In 1985, out of state revenue from tourism, including carrier receipts, amounted to £691 million, an increase of almost 17 per cent over 1984.  This very satisfactory performance can be attributed to the success achieved in our major markets.  For the first time the North American market became our biggest single source of tourist earnings.  Revenue from North America increased to £190 million, or by 36 per <Col N="1304" /> cent over 1984.  The number of North American visitors totalled 422,000, representing an increase of 23 per cent on the 1984 figure.  Earnings from the European market increased by 21 per cent to £80 million and the number of visitors was up by 10 per cent to 334,000. While visitor numbers from Britain at 1,119,000 remained almost static, revenue grew by 12 per cent to £172 million. There was a welcome expansion in the domestic market where the number of holidaymakers increased by 1 per cent to 3,820,000 and revenue by 7 per cent to £269 million.  The number of visitors from Northern Ireland, however, declined by 19 per cent to 479,000 and revenue by 12 per cent to £36 million.  Despite this decline, 1985 was on balance a successful year for Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>Because of recent developments in Europe we will be fortunate if we can achieve any real growth in tourist revenue during 1986.  Our main difficulty arises from the uncertainty of the US market. At the beginning of the year Bord Fáilte had projected a growth of between 2 per cent and 4 per cent in that market.  These projections will have to be revised in the light of American reactions to recent events in Europe and Libya.  In 1885 more than 50 per cent of the US visitors came direct to Ireland, the remainder visiting Ireland as part of their European holiday. The cancellation of European package tours by many US tour operators will undoubtedly lead to a reduction in the number of Americans visiting Ireland.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are still hopeful, however, that the 1986 outturn for the US market will at least be as good as 1984.  The board and the other State agencies in North America are doing everything possible to reassure prospective visitors that Ireland is a safe and welcoming destination for all visitors.  The board and the tourist industry mounted a special major sales and public relations drive during May in North America for this purpose in which I also participated.  These promotion efforts will be reinforced by the marketing programmes of the two American airlines &mdash; Delta and Pan Am &mdash; who have recently introduced new air services <Col N="1305" /> into Ireland.  These initiatives should help to minimise the adverse impact of the present difficulties inhibiting American travel to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Prospects in other overseas markets are very encouraging.  Bord Fáilte are satisfied that revenue and visitor numbers from the British and continental markets will continue to grow during 1986.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement has led to a more favourable disposition towards Ireland in the British media and this is reflected in the level of inquiries at the board's UK offices and bookings through the different transport carriers.  The prospects for tourism from the Continent are even better.  The response to Bord Fáilte's and the industry's marketing drive in continental countries has been very good and business should increase by about 6 per cent.  It is difficult to make accurate predictions about tourism trends in the home and Northern Ireland markets but Bord Fáilte are hopeful of expansion in both markets.</P>
    <P>I would like now to outline how the Exchequer's allocation to tourism will be spent.  I should point out that, in addition to the total of £25.664 million being moved in this Vote, an additional £2.461 million is provided in the Estimates of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to cover expenditure on tourism in the period 1 January 1986 to 18 February 1986 prior to the transfer of the functions relating to tourism to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  A total of £28.125 million is, therefore, being provided for tourism in 1986 compared with £27.154 million spent in 1985.</P>
    <P>Of the total provision for tourism, £27.562 million is being allocated to Bord Fáilte.  More than £12 million of this sum will be spent by the board on promotion and marketing.  The board aim to spend about £4.5 million on promoting and marketing in the North American market, almost £2.3 million on the European market and almost £2.3 million in Britain. In addition, £2.3 million will be spent on promotions in Ireland and marketing activities such as conference and product promotions, festivals and assistance to Irish operators marketing abroad.  The <Col N="1306" /> pay requirement of Bord Fáilte this year has been estimated at £9.1 million, of which £2.08 million relates to the regional tourism organisations.</P>
    <P>A grant-in-aid of almost £4 million is being made available for Bord Fáilte's capital development programmes. Approximately half of this will be spent in grants under the board's hotel and guesthouse reconstruction and development scheme.  The scheme is designed to help small to medium-sized hotels achieve the same standards as their counterparts abroad and is confined to hotels committed to overseas marketing programmes.</P>
    <P>The balance of the grant-in-aid will be used to grant aid the development of caravan and camping sites, assist improvements to approved farmhouses and town and country homes and encourage the provision of tourism amenities. The board's amenity development programme, for which £1.102 million has been provided, encourages the provision of amenities and facilities for angling, inland cruising, waterways development, tourist recreation and sailing and equestrian centres.</P>
    <P>The sum of £436,000 being provided for the administration of the tourism division of my Department includes £150,000 for a consultancy service on tourist related expenditure.  It will be recalled that the Government in the White Paper on Tourism Policy decided to seek an outside view of the State's spending on tourism.  I expect this assignment to commence within the next month or two and to be completed by early 1987.</P>
    <P>In their White Paper on Tourism, which is essentially a blueprint for the development of Irish tourism, the Government have highlighted the crucial role of tourism in the economy and its potential contribution to future economic growth.  The White Paper clearly defines objectives and policies for the industry and for the first time gives tourism a key role in the Government's policy making process.</P>
    <P>The White Paper covers a very wide range of issues that have an impact on tourism.  I am particularly pleased about <Col N="1307" /> the commitment in it to give priority to tourism in the Government's efforts to tackle unemployment.  I have no doubt that development within the industry and the strategies and policies now being pursued can and will create many new jobs.</P>
    <P>The key elements necessary to achieve growth and the problems that need to be addressed by Bord Fáilte and the industry as a whole are clearly set out in the White Paper.  One of the priorities identified is the development of facilities and all-weather amenities to attract younger visitors from overseas.  Bord Fáilte are urgently developing strategies aimed at expanding this important segment of the market.</P>
    <P>The White Paper stressed the importance of effective promotion and marketing by all concerned in tourism and the need for the industry to be competitively priced <i>vis-á-vis</i> other tourist destinations. Bord Fáilte, within the limits of their budgetary allocation, will promote and create an awareness of Ireland in overseas markets but their activity must be complemented through active marketing programmes by all those involved in tourism. In future, Bord Fáilte will arrange their promotional activities so as to facilitate joint financing with commercial operators.</P>
    <P>An interesting example of the initiatives of the Government's new policy was the recent launching of the hotel brand marketing scheme by Bord Fáilte with the full endorsement of the Irish Hotels Federation.  The objective of this scheme is to bring unaligned hotels with marketing potential into the mainstream of export tourism business.  The scheme has organised 46 small to medium-sized Irish hotels into three distinct and identifiable marketing groupings.  The groups are being assisted initially by Bord Fáilte but it is expected that eventually the groups will become completely independent and be capable of marketing their hotels without Bord Fáilte back-up facilities.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposed certain measures to encourage investment in tourism projects.  The Government have accordingly raised by £5 million the <Col N="1308" /> amount available through the Industrial Credit Corporation for the working capital for tourism schemes.  In addition, the National Development Corporation Act empowers the corporation to invest, <i>inter alia</i>, in tourism projects.  A tourism development team has been set up in Bord Fáilte to identify tourism opportunities and to match developers and investors to these opportunities.</P>
    <P>The White Paper stressed the need for a greater private sector input into the running of the regional tourism organisations. The operations of the RTOs are being restructured and it is intended that the Exchequer's contribution to their overheads will have been reduced to 55 per cent by 1989.  The balance of the RTO operating budgets will have to be met through revenue earning activities and contributions from business interests benefiting from local tourist expenditure.</P>
    <P>The need for new ideas in tourism and for a more innovative approach by the industry to marketing their products was emphasised in the Government's White Paper.  However, while the State can play a role in developing tourism concepts, it is primarily a matter for the industry itself to take the lead in bringing forward new ventures in commercial tourism.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper the Government acknowledged that improvements in access transport services were necessary if tourism was to prosper.  Competitive air fares and adequate capacities on air and sea routes are essential to an industry dependent on access transport for its development and growth.</P>
    <P>I will be monitoring very closely in consultation with the Minister for Communications, who has primary responsibility for access policies, the position of the different ferry services into this country and in particular the future fares policy of operators on cross-channel routes under their new co-operation agreement.</P>
    <P>The primary importance of the environment to tourism was also highlighted in the White Paper.  Bord Fáilte will continue their endeavours to safeguard the environment by raising the <Col N="1309" /> awareness of the community to the problems which threaten that environment. The success of the Tidy Towns Competition in which 760 centres competed last year is an example of what can be achieved by people when motivated by the need to not only protect but enhance the environment.  While State agencies can and must give the lead in protecting and enhancing our environment, success in this area, which is so vital to our whole tourism effort, depends in the last resort on the co-operation and goodwill of all citizens.</P>
    <P>In my view, the long term prospects for Irish tourism are exceptionally good. With the Government's commitment to tourism development, I see no reason why Ireland cannot increase its share of international tourist traffic.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the Fisheries Vote.</P>
    <P>The total gross Vote for Fisheries is £18,712,000.  With estimated receipts of £1,206,000 the net Vote is for £17,506,000.  Of the gross expenditure, £7,755,000 is to meet the pay provisions for my Department, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards.</P>
    <P>The amount provided this year represents an increase of 8 per cent over last year's outturn and I regard it as a reasonable contribution to the fishing industry in the difficult budgetary situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>There have been problems in the fishing industry in recent years largely due to high operating costs and low returns on catches.  Thankfully this situation has improved as a result of the reduction in fuel prices and an improvement in fish prices.</P>
    <P>The aid package which was introduced in 1985 to assist fishermen in financial difficulty has been widely accepted and welcomed by fishermen.  It has contributed in particular to enabling boat owners to meet their loan commitments to BIM.  Fishermen who qualified for the aid package enjoy the benefits of increased interest subsidy, extension of the period of the loan and restructuring of the system of loan repayments.  The effect of these measures was to reduce <Col N="1310" /> annual loan commitments in individual cases by amounts ranging up to 60 per cent.  The full excise duty on fuel oil used in fishing is also refundable and this together with the fall in fuel prices has contributed greatly to reducing operating costs.</P>
    <P>During 1985 the total value of sea fish landings and mariculture production was in excess of £66 million.  The value of exports of fish and fish products during the year was in the region of £100 million. The principal export outlets continued to be France, the UK, West Germany, The Netherlands, Nigeria, Egypt, Spain, USA and Japan.</P>
    <P>Investment in shore-based processing facilities continued in 1985.  Nine fish processing projects, involving a total capital commitment of £10 million, which included State grants amounting to £1.9 million, were approved for EC (FEOGA) grant aid of £4.1 million. There is still room for further expansion of the processing sector and no doubt the position will improve with the development of fish farming.  However, developments in processing must take cognisance of realistic possibilities in the market place and the situation in respect of fish supplies, both wild and farmed.</P>
    <P>Work on the finalisation of the White Paper on Fisheries Policy is well advanced and as I already indicated to this House, I hope to have it published during the present session.</P>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy continues to work well and provides the necessary stability for the on-going development of the fishing industry.  The various technical and, more particularly, the conservation regulations, which are the main guarantee of the availability of stocks in the future, are applicable in all member states.</P>
    <P>With the accession of Spain and Portugal as full members of the European Community, the primary concern for Ireland in the accession negotiations was fisheries.  However, the outcome of these negotiations was very satisfactory from an Irish point of view, particularly the continuation of the Irish box for ten years <Col N="1311" /> after accession.  The terms enshrined in the Treaty of Accession will thus ensure that our national fisheries interests will be protected and that there will be continued scope for further development.</P>
    <P>Future prospects for the Irish fishing industry are, I believe, good.  The package agreed, on total allowable catches and quotas for Ireland, at the Fisheries Councils during December last is generally satisfactory from our point of view. We secured increases in the quotas for the majority of species of interest to Irish fishermen, particularly herring.  These increases for species other than nephrops are in financial terms worth £1.5 million approximately.  We also managed to secure a significant increase in our quota for nephrops; this increase, based on average values, is in financial terms worth £3.6 million approximately.</P>
    <P>Disappointment has been expressed at the level of our mackerel quota for the present year.  I appreciate that our fleet could take quantities in excess of our quota allocation.  However, one has to take account of the stock situation.  The state of the mackerel stocks is of paramount importance to the Irish fishing industry since the species comprises a major part of our wetfish catch and also constitutes a sizeable proportion of Ireland's fish exports.  In order to ensure that adequate breeding stocks are maintained for future years, fishing levels must take account of scientific data relating to the overall prevailing stock situation.</P>
    <P>An international mackerel egg survey is taking place in 1986 to give a broader picture of the current state of the stock and it is gratifying to see that the Irish fishing industry, through both the fishermen and processors, have decided to fully sponsor an egg survey off the Irish west coast in conjunction with this.  This practical contribution from the industry towards a scientific survey is very welcome and will, I hope, enable us to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the stock levels.</P>
    <P>Interest has also been expressed by a number of our fishermen in conducting exploratory fishing to determine the <Col N="1312" /> extent of the possibilities that exist in relation to certain species.  Should the outcome of these exploratory efforts prove successful, then significant new possibilities will be available to our fishermen because they will be fishing for species for which there are at present no quotas.  This is the type of innovative thinking and pioneering spirit needed in the industry.  I should like to mention, in passing, that facilities are now available from BIM and the EC to assist the purchase of large white fish vessels up to 33 metres in length suitable for catching the types of fish traditionally caught by Spanish vessels in our offshore waters.  I hope that in the next few years we will establish a fleet of this type of vessel, as recommended in the report of the Sectoral Consultative Committee on Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The general interest in fish farming continues to grow, particularly in salmon farming.  Generous grants are available for both pilot and commercial scale projects to enable further development to take place.  The implementation of the designation process provided for under the 1980 Fisheries Act has begun and three areas in Counties Mayo and Galway have been designated to date. Good progress has been made in the designation of other areas.  A special unit has been set up in the Fisheries Division of the Department to expedite this work.</P>
    <P>I recently initiated the designation procedures for Mulroy Bay, part of Gweebarra Bay, County Donegal and Kilkieran, Bartraboy, Mannin and Clifden Bay and Ballynakill harbour, County Galway.  I am in the process of finalising a list of areas where designation procedures will commence in 1986.  I would like to stress that until such time as a designation order has been made for a particular area, it is not possible to proceed with individual licensing in the area.</P>
    <P>Production of farmed salmon this year is projected at 1,200 tonnes, which is double the 1985 production and it has been estimated that by 1992 production will have reached at least 10,000 tonnes, with a value of £44 million.</P>
    <P>A grant-in-aid of £4,868,000 is being made to BIM to cover administration <Col N="1313" /> expenses and current developments, including the cost of the interest subsidy on boat loans.  There is also an allocation of £1.25 million to the board to meet the liabilities arising from repayment of Exchequer advances in cases where unpaid boat loans were written off.</P>
    <P>A sum of £4.7 million has been allocated to the board for capital purposes. The main thrust of the investment will be directed towards the modernisation and re-equipment of existing vessels and the development of the aquaculture sector. The BIM investment will be supplemented by grants under the EC Fisheries Structural Policy.</P>
    <P>The promotion and marketing of our fish and fish products at home and abroad by BIM continues to be a priority of development policy.  An increased financial allocation was made to BIM in 1985 and again this year under the Government's programme <i>Building on Reality</i> to enable the board to intensify their market research and promotion activities especially in the area of added-value products.  There has been some public concern that radioactive discharges from the Sellafield Reprocessing Plant in Britain could contaminate fish caught in the Irish Sea.  I would like to stress that, on the information available to me from the Nuclear Energy Board who are responsible for monitoring national levels of radiation, there is no basis for concern on health grounds about the consumption of fish caught in the Irish Sea.  I am satisfied that the quality of all Irish fish landings conforms to the highest standards and may be safely consumed by the public.</P>
    <P>Substantial exports of mackerel to the Egyptian market have continued under contracts negotiated with the Egyptian authorities during 1985.  In the case of the Nigerian market for our frozen mackerel, import licences were made available in the early months of 1985 and considerable volumes were exported.  Since April 1985, however, no licences have been made available by the Nigerian authorities because of the shortage of foreign exchange in that country.</P>
    <P>The herring market is extremely <Col N="1314" /> depressed in the EC because of oversupply resulting from the recovery of North Sea stocks and relatively free import regimes in the EC.  Considerable efforts have been made by BIM to develop new outlets for Irish herring products, particularly in eastern European markets.</P>
    <P>For 1986, I have approved a comprehensive programme for harbour and improvement works which includes the completion of works in hand, as well as major new development works at Greencastle, County Donegal and the provision of a boat-lift at Killybegs, County Donegal. Provision has been made also for works of a lesser degree at various other harbours and landing places.  Following discussions with local interests involved a major development scheme for Rossaveal Harbour, County Galway, has been agreed and an economic appraisal of the project is being currently undertaken.</P>
    <P>The total amount being allocated for Inland Fisheries is £5,579,000.  Of this a sum of £4,812,000 is being allocated to the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards to enable them to carry out their functions in the conservation, protection and development of our inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>As we all know, salmon is a very important element of our inland fisheries, both from the commercial and sporting points of view.  There are indications that the stock of salmon as a whole is being over-fished.  Catches are fluctuating and in general have been in decline in recent years.  I am glad to be able to say, however, that there was a substantial increase in the reported catch of salmon in 1985 as compared with 1984, namely 1,539 tonnes as compared with 839 tonnes. While it is far too early to draw any firm conclusions from that, I sincerely hope that we are seeing the beginning of the reversal of the downward trend in salmon catches.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that illegal fishing for salmon, including the use of illegal nets, continues to be a major problem and the increasing amount of violence being offered by some fishermen towards the protection staff of the fisheries boards and the Naval Service and gardaí is a <Col N="1315" /> matter of grave concern.  I condemn this violence in the strongest possible terms. The fisheries laws are crucial to the survival of the salmon as a species and must be observed by all.  Here I would like to compliment the protection staff and the gardaí and Naval Service for their work in enforcing conservation laws under very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have long been aware of the tourism potential of salmon, trout and coarse fish angling and, as Minister with responsibility for tourism, I will be paying special attention to encouraging inland fisheries as a tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>The present regime for inland fisheries protection and management involving the Central Fisheries Board and seven regional fisheries boards established under the 1980 Fisheries Acts is operating reasonably satisfactorily.  Nevertheless I feel it is desirable to review the arrangements in the light of our experience over the past few years and I am arranging to have such a review undertaken by my Department.</P>
    <P>A sum of £135,000 is included in the Estimate as my Department's contribution to the Foyle Fisheries Commission, the statutory body responsible for the conservation, protection and improvement of the fisheries of the Foyle area.</P>
    <P>The commission's income is derived mainly from the sale of its fishing licences, the price of which has again increased this year.  It has, however, operated at a loss in recent years.  This loss has been funded on a 50:50 basis by my Department and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.  The commission's deficit in recent years has been due to rising costs and increases in expenditure on wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>The report of the Committee on Public Expenditure on State support and services to the fishing industry has recently been submitted to the House and will be considered by my Department.  A number of the recommendations of the committee have already been made by the sectoral development committee and were taken into account by my Department in the preparation of the <Col N="1316" /> draft of the White Paper on Fisheries to which I referred earlier.  However, I do not wish to comment further on the report in this debate since there will be a later opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Forestry Vote for 1986, I would point out that the gross provision for the forestry and wildlife activities of my Department during the current financial year is £54.836 million, which represents an increase of 6 per cent on the expenditure for 1985.  That gross demand on the Exchequer will, however, be reduced by receipts estimated at approximately £18 million from sales of timber and other sources of revenue.</P>
    <P>Over the past year or so forestry has been very much in the news and, indeed, the subject of considerable public debate.  As I see it, the main conclusion that emerges from that healthy dialogue is that, because of the difficulties in the markets for some of our more traditional agricultural products, there is a growing recognition and acceptance by landowners of forestry as an alternative land use as well as a strong interest by investors in forestry as a sound long-term investment.  This is, I believe, a healthy and desirable change in attitudes to land use, particularly as regards land that is marginal for agriculture.</P>
    <P>The second noticeable change, and again a desirable one, is that it is now clear that there is a ready acceptance of the keen demand for Irish timber to meet the needs of the domestic construction industry, something that regrettably one does not have to go back too many years to note its absence.  Thus home demand for the products of our forests is strong. Moreover, unlike some of our major agricultural lines of production, the long-term export market outlook for wood is good, particularly in neighbouring export markets.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these are healthy and desirable changes of attitude on which to build for the future.  It is obvious, therefore, that we have reached a point in our forestry development when it is necessary to reassess and reappraise its future role with a view to developing and exploiting the asset to the best national <Col N="1317" /> advantage, particularly in view of its importance in industrial development, job maintenance and import substitution.</P>
    <P>That was why the Government decided in its economic plan <i>Building on Reality</i> to establish an independent review group to examine the structure, organisation and operation of the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department.  As the House knows, the review group's report was published towards the end of last year and laid on the table of the House.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the review group for their labours and especially for completing their examination in a relatively short period and furnishing a most valuable report.</P>
    <P>The group identified the various activities and functions of the Forest and Wildlife Service in areas of forest establishment, research, sale of timber, provision of amenities such as forest parks and forest walks, wildlife conservation and game development.  It stressed the desirability of separating the commercial from non-commercial activities and suggested the creation of a new organisational framework in which both of these diverse interests could develop and prosper. To this end the group has recommended the establishment of a commission or a national forest enterprise to take over the commercial forestry activities of the FWS which would operate under a director general and a board of management within the Civil Service and report directly to the Minister. The group's recommendations are thorough and far-reaching and merit close examination to ensure that any changes in the present structure will be in the best interests of the State and the industry.  My Department are currently examining the group's recommendations and I have also asked the various organisations who made submissions to the group for their views on the group's recommendations.  Final decisions on the recommendations in the report will be taken by the Government when this examination has been completed.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with specific points on <Col N="1318" /> the Estimates, I feel obliged to make a few comments on the criticisms frequently levelled against me and my Department about sales of timber from State forests.  As Deputies know, such sales are made on a competitive basis, either by way of the sealed tender system, by auction or under the large sawlog quota scheme operated by the Forest and Wildlife Service.  The real problem that exists, of course, is that the national demand for timber exceeds the available supply and clearly in this situation the FWS cannot meet or satisfy the demands of all sawmills.  The tender system is therefore the fairest system available to my Department for allocating the existing supplies of timber.  Obviously, if some mills were given all the timber they demand, other mills would get little or none.  This would equally involve the closure of the smaller mills and unemployment for their staffs.</P>
    <P>My Department have endeavoured to alleviate the situation by what I consider to be a very fair approach to a difficult problem.  After long consultations with the timber trade, a revised sawlog quota scheme has been introduced whereby efficient and progressive mills can purchase up to 40 per cent of their annual timber requirements outside the tender system at market prices while competing by tender for the balance of their supplies. I see no other way, in a situation where the available supply is not sufficient to meet the demand, of dealing fairly with firms nor indeed, I might mention, has any better or more equitable system been suggested by the trade.</P>
    <P>There have been allegations that purchasers of sawlog timber from outside the State are enjoying unfair trading advantages. Firstly, I would like to make it clear that, contrary to what is frequently stated in public, there is no evidence that such purchases, which account for no more than 10 per cent of the available supplies, are increasing.  In fact, they have been quite stable at the present level for some time past.  However, I have set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee under an independent chairman with representatives <Col N="1319" /> from the sawmill industry, the ITCTU, the Forest and Wildlife Service and the Department of Industry and Commerce, to examine and report as soon as possible on the allegations that there are factors distorting trade and competition between sawmillers north and south of the Border.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pre-empt the findings of that committee and will say nothing further on the matter at this stage other than to say that under our trade obligations as members of the EC, it is not open to me or to the Government to stop exports of timber to other member states solely on economic or discriminatory grounds.  This is, in effect, what I am asked to do from time to time by persons complaining about this trade.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal in greater detail with the provisions of some of the subheads of the Forestry Vote.  There is a substantial increase in the sum allocated for the acquisition of land in subhead C1, which has been increased from £4.25 million last year to £5.05 million this year. As there was a balance in the fund at the end of 1985 of £768,000 and a further £100,000 is likely to be realised from sales of land, the total sum available for the acquisition of land during 1986 will amount to £5.92 million.  About half a million pounds will be used for the purchase of land for wildlife conservation purposes.  It is estimated that a total of 6,000 hectares of plantable land for the State afforestation programme will be acquired during 1986.  With changing land prices, the quality of land being offered to my Department for afforestation has improved considerably over the past few years and indeed the situation now is that my Department are unable to take up all the offers made to them because of the limited funds which it is possible to provide for such purchases.</P>
    <P>The largest provision in the Forestry Vote is the provision of £29.362 million in subhead C2 for forest development and management.  This includes a sum of £20.834 million for labour.  Indeed, Deputies may be interested to know that wages and salaries account for almost 62 <Col N="1320" /> per cent of the gross expenditure on the Forestry Vote.</P>
    <P>The increase over the 1985 provision is due, apart from increases in wages and salaries, to higher prices for machinery, manures, weedkillers and expenditure on the repair, maintenance and running costs of the forest machinery fleet.</P>
    <P>Subhead C2 for forest development and management includes provisions of £0.986 million for the purchase of new machinery, and £1.403 million for maintenance and repairs of the existing machinery fleet and purchase of fuels and oils.  Most forest operations are now mechanised and my Department operate a large fleet of machines for ground preparation, roadmaking, transport of supplies within and between forests, nurseries and timber harvesting.  In recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis in Europe on the development of specialised machines for the extraction and harvesting of timber in forests and my Department continually appraise and assess their suitability or adaptability for Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>In addition, the FWS hire a wide range of machinery to supplement their own fleet.  The hiring of machines not only reduces expenditure on purchases of machinery but provides employment opportunities for local machinery contractors. I am currently examining the feasibility of introducing a scheme whereby the construction of some forest roads could be put out to tender to specialist road construction firms.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of expenditure shown in Part III of the Estimate sets out the details of expenditure covered by subhead C2.  There are activities, however, covered by the subhead which Deputies may find of particular interest.  It provides £4.690 million for the establishment of forestry plantations on newly acquired land and land becoming available after clearfelling.  This provision will finance the planting by the FWS of up to 7,000 hectares in 1986 thus increasing the stocked State forest estate to 333,000 hectares by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Part of the sum of £2.468 million provided in subhead C2 for new roads and <Col N="1321" /> buildings will be used for the construction during 1986 of 144 kilometres of forest roads and the upgrading of a further 32 kilometres of existing forest roads.  Subhead C2 also provides £1.143 million for the development of recreational amenities for the public in State forests.  This aspect of the Forest and Wildlife Service's work is very much appreciated by the general public who are availing to an ever increasing extent of the facilities provided.</P>
    <P>Since the adoption of an &ldquo;Open Forest&rdquo; policy 20 years ago, 400 forest areas have been opened to the public by my Department.  The amenities provided at these forests include car parks, picnic areas, nature trails, viewing points and signposted walks.  A further extension of this &ldquo;Open Forest&rdquo; policy was the completion and opening of 20 holiday chalets at Killykeen Forest Park this year.  These wooden chalets are sited on the shores of Lough Oughter, a lake renowned for coarse fishing, and were constructed exclusively with Irish grown timber.</P>
    <P>The project was designed to maximise visitor comfort in harmony with the woodland and lakeside setting.  A sum of £1.73 million was made available towards the cost of the project under the Special Border Areas Programme.  This programme was financed out of a fund created in 1980 by the EC and the Irish Government to improve the economic and social situation of Border areas mainly through the development of tourism activities.  We are breaking new ground in our Forest Amenity Programme with this development and I hope the project with Irish families and visiting tourists alike.</P>
    <P>The first of the long distance walking routes established by my Department some years ago was the Wicklow Way. Following its success and the subsequent establishment of the South Leinster Way, my Department and the National Sports Council are currently engaged in the establishment of the following further walking routes: the Munster Way, the Galway-Mayo Way, the South Leinster Way, the Kerry Way and the Carlingford Trail.  When all the planned long distance <Col N="1322" /> walking routes are linked they will, in conjunction with a similar walk in Northern Ireland, form the &ldquo;All Ireland Way&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland is unique in that 85 per cent of the afforested area is owned by the State. It is Government policy, therefore, to encourage expansion of private forestry in harmony with the State afforestation programme by way of two schemes of grants and a technical advisory service. A provision of £0.855 million has been made in subhead D of the Vote to cover the cost of private forestry grants under the Department's countrywide scheme and the forestry element of the western package which applies to the less-favoured areas of the west.</P>

I am sure Deputies will agree that any conflict which may have arisen in the discussions over the supply of timber to these firms must surely be considered in the light of the employment which is created and also the fact that the type of timber which has been used is timber which was practically lost to forestry some years ago.  We gain no money from <Col N="1323" /> it.  It is an important aspect of the Forestry Estimate.  I am sorry I did not get more time to deal with it.

      <P>In a year when tourism is threatened by factors outside our control it is bordering on economic lunacy not to address matters over which we have control.  The Dublin Corporation strike on refuse services is a case in point.  The policy of brinkmanship in industrial relations now being adopted by the Minister and the Government is inappropriate and a cynical response to the needs of the population of Dublin and the economic needs of the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reluctance to use his good offices to get a settlement in the dispute is regrettable and foolish.  What good is a Minister for Labour if he does not have it as his first priority to use all of his powers and influence to minimise disruption in industrial relations.  The Minister is being urged by public representatives from every side, together with all fair minded people, to take immediate steps to involve the Labour Court so that this damaging dispute can be brought to an early settlement.  This unfortunate dispute affects many aspects of the economic life of this city where it has a direct bearing on tourist receipts and the development of the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>Unsightly and filthy streets with rotting rubbish heaps in the middle of the tourist season destroys not just our tourism image this year but leave a bad smell for tourist promoters' plans for the future.  A solution must be found eventually to this and every dispute.  The sooner we set about finding that solution, the better for everybody.  State agencies are available to help tackle this problem.

      <P>If the Minister personally is unwilling to function in this matter then the Government should direct his office before permanent and lasting damage is done to the tourist reputation at home and abroad.  An early settlement of the dispute is now all the more urgent because of the imminent danger of a spread of the dispute to other parts of the country.  This, together with the increased tension on the picket lines, makes the solution of this strike an urgent national priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 the Government increased their allocation to Bord Fáilte by 13 per cent over the 1984 levels.  This year the Government are increasing their Bord Fáilte allocation by 4 per cent.  Surely these two vital statistics in so far as the tourist industry is concerned constitute a clear indication of the lack of Government commitment to the development of the tourist industry and are totally at variance with their own stated policy, as announced in the White Paper on Tourism. The Government national plan identified tourism as an industry with the potential to make a significant contribution to economic growth over the next few years.  It pointed to cost-competitiveness as a key factor affecting the performance of our overseas tourism.  Last year the Minister pointed out that growth in the tourist business would be achieved only by a greater contribution from the different sectors of the business community involved in tourism.  This will happen only if profitability and competitiveness <Col N="1325" /> improve in the tourist sector.  The drop in inflation and reduction in VAT levels are to be welcomed, but of themselves they will not eliminate the perception of Ireland as an expensive destination.  Last year in the course of this debate the Minister described the White Paper on Tourism, then in the process of preparation, as constituting a new departure.  It was no such thing.  It was an anodyne, colourless document, short on specifics, bereft of vision and concrete proposals, a deep disappointment after two years in preparation.</P>
    <P>I said last year that our aim should be to recover our loss, in relative terms, as to what our market share was ten years ago.  The White Paper refused to face the fact that a strong commitment by Government is necessary to spearhead that recovery and increase our share of a growing world tourist market.  Competitiveness in cost and quality still eludes us. We still fail to implement in an effective way the regulations designed to conserve our environment.  I was particularly disappointed to note the absence in the White Paper of any worthwhile proposals to improve integration of the activities of the various agencies directly and indirectly concerned with tourism development. Given the then Minister's commitment to eliminating duplication during the debate last year it was disappointing that the White Paper failed to seriously address itself to this problem.</P>
    <P>I said last year that if the plan achieved the elimination of duplication it would have my full support.  I am disappointed that I cannot give any such endorsement this year.  The plan failed significantly to provide a solid legislative framework to enable a co-ordinated approach to the development of tourism and to provide a fiscal and physical environment conducive to tourism investment and growth. This lack of faith on the part of the Government, this dithering approach to tourism, is entirely inappropriate at a time when tourism is expected to grow worldwide by approximately 5 per cent per annum.  The plan afforded the opportunity to create an investment structure for the industry over a number of years. <Col N="1326" /> Investment is needed if we are to capitalise on the fact that tourism is a growth industry, second only to banking in its contribution to the value of international trade.  Yet the White Paper contains no reference to the desirability of making available to the tourist industry the same tax incentive scheme for personal investment in new business as is currently available to the manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>It would have been imaginative to have extended the venture capital scheme to the industry, especially given its high dependence on bank borrowings.  It is pointless paying lip service to tourism development if the Government are unprepared to take the direct action necessary to create the conditions favourable to a vibrant tourism industry.  These include a more favourable investment climate, a less punitive taxation regime and a greater emphasis on marketing our tourism product, all of which boils down to more promotional activity on the part of Bord Fáilte.  There is a need for resolute action in these areas if we are to reverse the trend whereby our share of world tourism has been declining in recent years.  Bord Fáilte estimate that this year the coach holiday business from North America could be down by as much as 40 per cent over last year's figures, that overall the decline in the numbers of US visitors to Ireland is expected to be somewhere between 15 per cent and 25 per cent this year.  Certainly, Bord Fáilte must be congratulated on the speed and skill with which their most recent promotional task force was launched in the United States.  Bord Fáilte and the tourist industry were quite right to seek to exploit the fact that Ireland is perceived in the United States as one of the safest destinations in Europe this year.  I should like to thank the Minister for having contributed to that promotional scheme himself.</P>
    <P>I would fully support the Minister in seeking Cabinet approval for increased funding for Bord Fáilte following their increased promotional expenditure on the United States market.  However, even if the present crisis in the United States tourist market had not blown up, <Col N="1327" /> the trends discernible for some time in United States tourism to this country have been unhealthy.  For example, since 1977 Ireland's share of United States tourism expenditure in Europe has been in decline.  In 1977 our percentage share of United States tourism spending in Europe was 4.7 per cent, and by 1979 that figure had dropped to 4 per cent.  By 1981 our percentage share had dropped further to 2.7 per cent.  In both the years 1983 and 1984 our share of US tourism spending in Europe had declined further to 2.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Irish share of the British tourist market also declined in those years from 6 per cent in 1977 to 3 per cent in 1980 and to 2 per cent in 1984 and 1985.  There has been a downward trend evident in both those markets in recent years.  Since 1977 our annual share of the lucrative German tourist market has remained stagnant at 0.3 per cent, indicating our failure to further penetrate that European market.</P>
    <P>It is alarming to note that it is against a background of increased spending on international tourism that we must place Ireland's declining share of that market. International tourism spending increased by approximately 4.5 per cent each year between 1974 and 1985.  Between 1986 and 1996 the projected increase is in the region of 7 per cent per annum.  As well as taking action to recover and to increase the share of our traditional markets we must look at new, lucrative markets in Europe, especially the Nordic countries, and also to Japan and Australia.  Targeting new high income groups will require new promotional finance, not less.  The fact that there has been little change in the marketing composition of tourist numbers, that there has been a decline in the <i>per capita</i> spending of tourists to Ireland over the past decade, calls for a new marketing response.</P>
    <P>Our punitively high taxation regime and operating costs have led to this decline in our share of the world tourism market.  Job losses have been involved also and a sharp decline in competitiveness and profitability, which in turn have <Col N="1328" /> led to falling standards and a reluctance to invest on the part of the industry itself.</P>
    <P>The annual report of the Irish Hotels Federation has highlighted the difficult trading conditions under which many hotels now operate.  In 1983 and 1984, 42 per cent only of all hotels in this country made a profit.  In 1984 the average profitability of Irish hotels was a mere 2.5 per cent of turnover and return on capital employed was generally negligible.  Low occupancy levels have contributed to this low average figure, which compares with a figure of approximately 9 per cent for hotels globally.  That further highlights the challenge facing us to expand the holiday season and to create tour packages which will attract tourists during off-peak periods.  For example, in 1984 room occupancy in Ireland was 44 per cent, which compared adversely with the 67.5 per cent occupancy attained on the Continent and the 66.7 per cent in Great Britain. Furthermore, in 1985 monthly bed occupancy rates of 60 per cent were achieved only in the months of July and August.  The average for May was 43 per cent and for September it was 53 per cent.  We will not succeed in filling our hotels in the late spring and autumn if our price competitiveness does not improve.  In the period 1980-85, in cumulative terms, our competitiveness declined by 16 per cent in the German market, 19 per cent in the French market and 15 per cent in the British market.</P>
    <P>Visitors from the Continent are appalled by the fact that Irish prices, particularly beer prices, are 235 per cent above the Community average and Irish wine prices are 320 per cent higher than the average Community price.  We have always urged that a selective tax cut regime should be considered to bring prices into line with those obtaining in other countries particularly in the UK and Northern Ireland.  The motoring tourist from these two regions is crucial if we are to increase our market share.  I have said repeatedly we cannot expect to compete as far as the motoring tourist is concerned with a price differential of up to £1 per gallon in petrol prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> The Exchequer benefits considerably from tourism revenue.  It is clear it would benefit from increased buoyancy in the sector.  In 1985, tourism's share of total gross expenditure on the economic services was £34 million &mdash; 4 per cent for tourism as opposed to 46 per cent spent on agriculture and 43 per cent on industry.  For their investment of £34 million the Government received £386 million in primary and secondary taxation.</P>
    <P>While the Government's tax take from tourism has consistently increased, the public capital expenditure programme for tourism has been declining in current and constant values for years.  Paragraph 13.2 of the White Paper states:</P>
    <P>Capital grant schemes aimed at stimulating investment in the tourism industry have had to be curtailed and they must therefore become increasingly selective.</P>
    <P>This is a retrograde step at a time when the industry lacks the seed capital for investment in capital projects.</P>
    <P>Rather than this negative approach, I would have liked to see the White Paper acknowledge tourism as an export industry and a valuable source of foreign exchange.  As a corollary, tourism should be allowed to participate in all the investment and incentive programmes available to manufacturing industry. Other export services are excluded from VAT and I have repeatedly said that there is scope to apply the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to defined out of state tourism, as is the case with manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>In a situation where the average private sector investment in the Irish tourism industry is only 7 per cent as opposed to 25 per cent in the UK it makes no sense at all to exclude tourism from benefiting from venture capital resources, business expansion schemes and other personal investment opportunities available for other sectors.  This would serve to improve capitalisation in the sector and would help to reduce the present overwhelming reliance on bank borrowings to finance development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> The Government should give serious consideration to increasing the availability of low interest loans for capital investment in tourism.  This would be an act of good faith which would do much to renew confidence within the sector.  Substantial funds available for tourism development at EC level must be tapped effectively. The Government might review the procedures for obtaining such funds.  The system might work more effectively if agencies such as Bord Fáilte and the tourism organisations were in a position to deal directly with Brussels, rather than, as is now the case, be obliged to use as an intermediary the Department of Finance.  The same applies to me.  Unfortunately I do not get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>However, this must not be regarded as as substitute for generating private investment for the improvement of hotel buildings and facilities.  The quality of the product is vital for market development.  As our hotels do not have the resources themselves to maintain and develop their product and standard, the Government must help out by properly funded and worthwhile grant schemes <Col N="1331" /> which will bring about these improvements. The present grant scheme is too small and the grant percentage levels are too small.  After paying consultants to certify work and draw up plans, the hotelier will end up with a grant of about 14 per cent.  He must deduct the grant from his tax allowances so the actual grant is often about 8 per cent to the hotelier. That is not the level of help or incentive that will bring about the kind of investment the hotel industry of the nineties will require to serve Ireland and provide the jobs the young people so badly need. I ask the Minister if, in view of those two elements, he will consider reviewing the scheme at this stage.</P>
      <P>I welcome Bord Fáilte's decision to launch a new subsidised marketing scheme for hotel groups.  The involvement of increased numbers of hotels in tourist marketing both at home and abroad will, hopefully, improve the profitability of many small hotels.  Some hotels have expressed disappointment at the selectivity of the new branding scheme. This can be overcome by consultation and an expansion of the scheme.  The one thing I would ask the Minister to avoid is divisiveness.  The marketing groups should receive more help from Bord Fáilte and everything must be done to ensure that they are not disadvantaged in the market place because of the board's involvement with the scheme.  An assurance from the Minister on this point would be welcomed by the industry and would defuse any element of divisiveness which has existed since the announcement of the new branding scheme.</P>
      <P>The recent ruling of the European Court of Justice that civil aviation falls within the remit of the Treaty of Rome should be embraced by the Government as a challenge and an opportunity.  It signals the advert of a new era of competition in the world of aviation.  For Ireland, it opens up exciting new possibilities of framing a more favourable access transport policy to maximise the number of visitors to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As liberalisation advances, the anti-competition <Col N="1332" /> policy of price fixing between national airlines will be increasingly highlighted.  Rate sharing and price fixing condoned by bilateral agreements and authorised by Government protectionism have consistently flouted the competitive clauses of the Treaty of Rome.  I should like the Government to take a positive, long term view of the implications of this recent European Court decision to make air transport more competitive.</P>
    <P>I repeat my call that national law should not seek to circumvent the declared intention at EC level to provide a multilateral solution to aviation pricing. Our commitment to the solvency and development of our national airline is not in question.  Aer Lingus is vital to our national interests as an island economy. An innovative access transport policy developed specifically with tourism potential in mind is not necessarily in conflict with the long term interests of Aer Lingus.  It requires trust, co-operation and the political will to do the job.  I am convinced that if all three are brought into play good will ensure for the airline and the tourism industry.  That is long overdue.  If the Minister undertakes that initiative he will have my support.</P>
    <P>It is clear, as the Minister pointed out recently &mdash; I was pleased to hear him do so &mdash; that pricing on the cross-Channel ferries needs a healthy injection of competition. It is completely unnacceptable to me that rates on the Irish Sea have been increased by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent above the rate of inflation. I fully support the Minister's view that Sealink and B &amp; I should be asked to review their fare structure between the Republic and England.  In this way the 25 per cent price differential on the Irish Sea, which is to our disadvantage, might be eliminated.</P>
    <P>Regular and competitive air and sea links are essential if we are to maximise our tourist potential.  The failure last year to ensure the continuation of the sea connection between Cork and Britain and its subsequent adverse effects on tourism in the south and south-west underlines the dependency of tourism on frequent and <Col N="1333" /> regular sea links.  Fianna Fáil are fully aware of the importance of the Cork/Wales link and we will do everything in our power to encourage the long term provision of sea links with our nearest neighbour.  As an island economy we must have an expansionist sea-ferry policy.  To do otherwise will be counterproductive and will make a nonsense of trying to restore the UK market and develop the European tourist market. We are the only country in Europe that does not draw its biggest tourist earnings from its nearest neighbouring country. We should redress that.</P>
    <P>As part of an integrated approach to tourism development, and from the perspective of improving the quality of life for all our citizens, it is most desirable to facilitate an expansion of the activities of the Environmental Awareness Bureau which has been doing sterling work notwithstanding its meagre resources.  The environment will be a crucial element in tourist development here in the future. Anything the Minister does in that regard will have the support of all Members. The environment has been neglected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned the environment has been neglected.  We have an obligation to leave the environment in at least as good condition as it was when it passed on to us.  That element of tourism has been neglected in the last 15 years.  We should outline our policy in regard to the environment.  I expect the Minister, following the review by the bureau, to support any recommendations that are put forward and provide any money required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to a statement by a senior figure in the tourist industry, Mr. Conor McCarthy, President of the Hotels Federation.  In April last he condemned the use of the years of failure as a base to extrapolate future trends and the future possibilities of the Irish tourist industry.  It was exactly this defeatist reckoning which inspired the <Col N="1334" /> Government's White Paper.  I do not share that defeatism.  There is a strong growth potential in the Irish tourism industry if the appropriate Government policies are implemented to enable us to penetrate what is a huge and growing market.  We should work to get the tourist brief away from a dependency it has had for so many years in the political sense. It has never had the right political status and was always added on to some other Ministry with the result that it did not have the political clout at the Cabinet table when national Exchequer funding was being shared out.  I recommend to the Minister, and any other administration, to allow tourism stand on its own right.  Until it gets the political clout as an independent brief at Cabinet level it cannot achieve its desired aim as the third largest industry in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for Tourism I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the tourism industry.  As Minister Kavanagh has already said, 1985 was a very successful year for Irish tourism. Overseas visitors numbers increased by 6 per cent on the 1984 figure to a record 1,944,000, just 56,000 short of the two million mark.  The overall out-of-state revenue figure, including carrier receipts and excursionist revenue, was £691 million.  This represented a 17 per cent increase on 1984.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that all our main overseas markets achieved a real term growth in revenue.  The spectacular performance of the North American market, with visitor numbers up 23 per cent to 422,000 and revenue up 29 per cent in real terms to over £190 million, exceeded all our expectations.  The continental European market also performed very well with significant increases in both visitor numbers and revenue from all of the main markets.  The French and German markets in particular showed a much improved performance with revenue increasing in real terms by 26 per cent and 9 per cent respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> Looking ahead to the 1986 season I would have liked to be in a position to say to the House today that Bord Fáilte's original growth targets for 1986 set at the beginning of the year will be achieved. However, I think that all involved in the industry will concede that it will be difficult to achieve any level of growth this year.  Clearly the reluctance of Americans to travel to Europe will have an adverse impact on the level of American business this year.  At this stage it is difficult to quantify the likely impact of the European security problems on US visitor traffic.  I am pleased to say, however, that in the light of the recent Bord Fáilte and industry renewed drive in the US market it is hoped that the effects on Irish tourism will be minimal.  It is reassuring to hear that the two new US airlines operating in to Ireland this year &mdash; Pan Am and Delta &mdash; have had some very positive indications arising from their marketing campaigns.  Overall, therefore, I am optimistic that the combined efforts of Bord Fáilte, and the industry in the US market, will minimise the effect on Irish tourism of the drastic reduction in American traffic to Europe.  At this stage Bord Fáilte anticipate that the level of North American traffic to Ireland will be somewhere between the 1984 and 1985 performance.  Given the circumstances, this performance, if realised, will indeed be a creditable one.  The revenue arising from North American traffic in 1984 was actually second only to last year's.</P>
    <P>As regards our other overseas markets, I am happy to report that Bord Fáilte growth targets for the British and Continental European markets should be achieved in 1986.  In so far as Britain is concerned, the trade are generally optimistic. Carrier and tour operator advance bookings compare most favourably with 1985.  Likewise, trade impressions to date regarding the Continental European market are optimistic and no problems are envisaged in meeting the targeted growth rate of 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>In so far as the domestic market is concerned, 1985 saw a welcome, albeit <Col N="1336" /> small, return to growth.  Bord Fáilte are confident that this growth will be maintained in 1986.  The budget tax concessions, allied to the lower inflation rate, will make holiday packages much more keenly priced for the home holiday taker. Given a reasonably good summer, the outlook must be considerably brighter for home holidays.  The likely performance of the Northern Ireland market is difficult to assess.  However, despite apparent difficulties in that market, Bord Fáilte are hopeful that some growth can be achieved.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I must stress the importance of effective promotion and marketing by all involved in the industry. This message was emphasised most strongly in the tourism White Paper.  It is fair to say that the 1985 overseas tourism performance was due in no small way to the promotional and marketing efforts by Bord Fáilte and the industry.  As the Minister has indicated, the Government in this Estimate propose to allocate over £27½ million to Bord Fáilte for the development of tourism and this will include over £12 million for direct promotion.  I am glad to note the growing awareness within the industry itself of the importance of marketing overseas, and this is most encouraging.</P>
    <P>This year I had the opportunity of participating with the Irish trade in Bord Fáilte promotions in Belgium, Germany and Switzerland.  I saw at first hand the efforts of the board and various sectors of the industry to market Irish tourism.  I was heartened by the numbers of prospective tourists which attended these promotions.  Above all, I was most impressed by the professionalism of those representatives of the industry participating at these promotions.  I have no doubt that they will be rewarded by increased business this year and later.  The clear message from these and promotions of earlier years is that those operators who market their products in the market place are the operators who achieve good results.</P>
    <P>Reductions in the rate of VAT on a range of tourism related products in recent budgets have made Irish tourism <Col N="1337" /> a much more saleable product.  Our VAT rate on tourism is among the lowest in Europe.  This, coupled with our reduced rate of inflation, means that we now offer a much more competitive product.  It should be remembered, however, that rival destinations are also competitively priced and for this reason it is imperative, if we are to secure our share of the growing tourism market, that we market our product in an effective and aggressive way.  The Government are playing their role in providing a favourable economic climate in which the industry can develop but the industry must react positively and with greater effort than heretofore.  It is only through a total commitment to marketing by all involved in tourism that the industry's real potential as an earner of export revenue and a generator of employment can be realised.</P>
    <P>While the North American, British and Continental European markets will continue to be our main markets, we should not be deterred from exploring and developing the potential of other fast growing markets.  The White Paper on Tourism Policy, for example, referred to the potential of new markets such as the Far East and Australia.</P>
    <P>In Australia, where 25 per cent of the population claim Irish ancestry, new opportunities for Irish tourism are emerging. The visit by President Hillery last year and the approaching Australian bicentenary are viewed by Bord Fáilte as opportunities to increase awareness of Ireland in that market as a holiday destination. During the Presidential visit Bord Fáilte arranged a number of promotions in the principal Australian cities and were most encouraged by the interest displayed in Ireland as a tourism destination. Later this year Bord Fáilte, for the first time, intend holding a series of trade workshops in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.</P>
    <P>The board are also actively involved with the British Tourist Authority in promoting business from Australia.  The two bodies co-operate through joint advertising of combined Britain and Ireland holiday packages.  Currently some 300,000 Australians visit Europe, mainly Britain, <Col N="1338" /> each year and more than 35,000 make the short additional trip to Ireland during their stay in Britain.  I am hopeful that this level of traffic to Ireland can be increased significantly through Bord Fáilte's efforts to have Dublin common rated for fares purposes with London and other mainland Europe destinations from Australia.</P>
    <P>Japan is another market with considerable potential for growth.  The volume of Japanese tourist traffic to Europe is growing and, while numbers actually visiting Ireland to date have been small, there is potential for very real growth. A particularly encouraging development has been the inclusion of Dublin in the new common rated air fares for group incentive travel from Japan to western European destinations.  This in effect means that groups coming from Japan to London can pre-arrange their holiday programmes so that they can travel on to Dublin and back to London at no extra cost.  Efforts are also being made to expand the application of the common rating principle for those Japanese holidaymakers not availing of group package tours.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of developing new markets and business, I would like to mention the importance of attracting international conferences to Ireland. Conference business in 1985 attracted 58,000 visitors and generated revenue amounting to £29.5 million.  This represented increases of 3 per cent and 13 per cent respectively over 1984.  I am glad to be able to say that this performance is consistent with the pattern of increased business in this very important sector of the tourism market which has been developing since the mid-seventies.</P>
    <P>The Convention Bureau of Ireland has had considerable success in promoting Ireland as a conference destination.  Over the years they have succeeded in attracting many professional and business conferences to this country and today Ireland is well established in the international scene as an excellent destination for conferences providing good support and back-up services.  The Government in their White Paper have recognised the importance of this fast growing sector <Col N="1339" /> of the market.  Conference business is particularly significant in that in the main it attracts visitors in the shoulder or off-season time of the year thus helping to alleviate the problem of seasonality.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that conference delegates spend significantly more than normal tourists in other market segments due mainly to the fact that their visits are very often subsidised in one way or another, thereby increasing their spending power. Conference business is, therefore, a very lucrative source of tourism revenue.  I would recommend very strongly that Irish business interests and Irish delegates to international organisations continue to do all in their power to encourage such bodies to hold their conferences in Ireland.  I can assure them that Bord Fáilte, through the Convention Bureau of Ireland, will give them every assistance possible to help influence conference decisions in favour of Ireland.</P>
    <P>While promotion and marketing are of vital importance, we must ensure that the physical and operational standards of all products offered by the industry are at least on a par with those available abroad. It is one thing to attract visitors to our shores but we must also ensure that their expectations are not only met but exceeded.  Failure to meet the customers' demands will only serve to undermine Bord Fáilte's and the industry's promotional and marketing efforts.  The Bord's Capital Grant Schemes and the ICC Tourism Global Loan Scheme provide the necessary incentive to the industry to further develop the tourism product. Therefore, I would like to see increased capital investment by commercial interests in upgrading existing facilities and providing a wider range of tourist attractions for our visitors.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has indicated, a provision of almost £4 million has been made available for the board's capital development programme in 1986.  The House will, of course, be aware that the statutory limits on aggregate grant expenditure by Bord Fáilte are set out in the Tourist Traffic Acts.  In that regard it is anticipated that the statutory limits in <Col N="1340" /> respect of grants for development are likely to expire in 1987.  Accordingly, the Department will be commencing work shortly on the preparation of legislation to further extend these limits.  It is the intention to have the legislation introduced in the Oireachtas before the end of 1986.</P>
    <P>I would like again to mention the importance of access transport.  The tourist industry in Ireland is particularly dependent on access transport for future development.  If there is not sufficient and competitively priced access on existing air and sea routes to Ireland there can be no growth for Irish tourism.  I am happy that recently there has been a trend towards more competitive pricing in relation to air fares.  I hope that this is not a short term trend but that it will be continued in the interests of tourism development.</P>
    <P>I want to express my hope for the success of the RyanAir service between Luton and Dublin.  This service offers the best ever instant purchase air fare to Ireland and its success will hopefully lead to an extension of this concept to other cross-channel and European routes.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of air services that I have been investigating is the possibility of developing feeder services from Shannon to regional airports.  It has been stressed to me in recent times that there is a demand among up-market tourists for feeder air services within Ireland to our more popular tourist areas.  In particular the possibility of establishing air links between Shannon and Farranfore and Shannon and Galway is currently being investigated.  I hope to have a report on the viability of possible services very shortly.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the importance and potential of tourism as a significant contributor to the EC's economic and regional development has at last been acknowledged by the EC Commission. However, it is a cause of some concern that the Community, so many years after its establishment, has yet to agree a definitive tourism policy.  Early this year the Commissioner with responsibility for tourism submitted a policy document on <Col N="1341" /> tourism entitled <i>Community Action in the Field of Tourism</i> to the Council.  Member states are currently discussing the document. This document had been eagerly awaited in Ireland as we had for some time been pressing the Commission to bring forward positive proposals for the tourism area.  During contacts with the present and former Commissioner I suggested certain ideas in the hope that to some extent at least they would be reflected in the Commission's proposals.</P>
    <P>I emphasised the need to develop tourism policies which would take account of the needs of the less developed areas of the Community that have little potential for other types of economic development. I also drew particular attention to the very real prospects for expansion of tourism in Ireland and to the assistance that a progressive Community policy would give to expedite this.</P>
    <P>It is apparent, however, on examination of the Commission document that our concerns were not taken into account and that the policies being proposed will do nothing of any significance to assist tourism development in this country or indeed in other disadvantaged areas of the EC.</P>
    <P>What is needed urgently from the Commission is a real commitment to positive policies aimed at spreading the growing economic benefits of tourism much more widely within the EC.  It is disappointing that the opportunity of taking meaningful Community action to achieve this goal has been overlooked in a document purporting to be the framework for future Community policy.  I well understand that there may be opposition in certain parts of the EC to positive policies that would of necessity require some degree of Community funding. This, to my mind, should not deter the Commission from addressing the issue.</P>
    <P>I will therefore be availing of every opportunity to make known our concerns in this matter and to urge the authorities in Brussels to revise their current proposals to take full account of tourism's potential to contribute both to economic growth and job creation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have said, we do not believe that the Estimates and the budget provisions for forestry, fisheries and tourism are adequate to deal with the current situation in these important industries. Neither do I believe the administrative arrangements are adequate.  As Deputy Flynn said earlier, it is regrettable that the Government should group together three very important areas.  It would be more appropriate if we had the administrative and political structures to deal with these matters on an individual basis because each is important.</P>
      <P>For that reason, in putting forward our policies for the next election, Fianna Fáil have set out in their policy document their intention to establish a new marine Department.  We are an island country with huge untapped resources around us and such a Department could ensure that those resources are exploited fully.  That cannot be done in the tinkering that is being carried out at present.  There is overlapping, duplication and fragmentation in all these areas.  It is desirable that we should have an opportunity to establish that new Department which we believe will enable us to exploit and use the enormous resources around us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any debate here on fisheries we have had numerous promises from the Minister regarding a White Paper on fisheries and again this evening we had a further promise from the Minister that something would be done later this year. A number of important reports have been made on the fishing industry and many people have looked forward to the promised White Paper with anticipation and perhaps some apprehension.  At this time there is a new commitment being made to the industry and I will give an indication of what I mean.  I refer to the arrival in Killybegs of our largest fishing super trawler, the 213 foot <i>Atlantic Challenge</i> which has been provided at a cost of £6 million.  This is a sign of the courage and commitment of people like Seamus Tully, Martin Howley and the others involved in that development and it will give hope and encouragement to many fishermen at a time of depression in the industry.  People like Seamus Tully and <Col N="1343" /> others have been prepared to put their money into fisheries development and they have embarked on an exciting project that will encourage the development of the fishing industry in Donegal.  At a time of depression and disillusionment in the industry, it is encouraging to see such welcome signs.  For our part we must encourage that development and provide the necessary incentives to allow people like Seamus Tully to continue with their valuable work.</P>
    <P>The development in question will provide new opportunities and will be an encouragement to others.  The resources are there to be exploited and there is an obligation on all of us to see that is done. Rather than fishermen criticising politicians and <i>vice versa</i>, we must work together to help the industry.  We must not allow the Spaniards, Portuguese or the Norwegians to do the work for us.  We have the capacity and ability that is necessary. We have also some financial backing but what is needed is political action by the Government to encourage investment in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, there are some encouraging signs in that interest rates and fuel prices are falling.  However, I should like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the benefit of the fall in interest rates and in fuel prices is being passed on the the fishermen and those involved in the industry.  I am not satisfied that has been the case.  Crude oil prices have fallen by two-thirds in world markets but that reduction has not been evident here to the same extent.  In addition, there are wild fluctuations in the prices charged from one harbour to the next and this happens in respect of diesel and petrol also.  As a result, motorists and consumers generally are confused and it is obvious that positive Government action is needed.  Unless the industry are prepared to be reasonable and sensible in their pricing arrangements, the Government should reactivate the price control mechanism.  Unfortunately, that mechanism was scrapped by them earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy has been <Col N="1344" /> in operation for some time.  While it is working reasonably well in some areas, there are grounds for disillusionment with the way the industry are operating in other regards.  The Minister referred to the crisis in herring fishing.  We are adversely affected mainly by imports of herring into the Community from third countries.  Already there has been a call for a duty to be charged on such imports to stabilise and rectify the problems in our herring markets.  I would like to hear if it is possible to introduce tariffs or duties on herring from outside the Community because this is destabilising our market.  If that cannot be done, action should be taken to ban the importation of herring into the Community.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that the fishing quota arrangements for all species are inadequate. As regards mackerel we have problems of stock and difficulties in mackerel fishing, but we have a special position in relation to mackerel.  About 60 per cent of our total catch is mackerel and we must get some concessions on our mackerel quota or many jobs will be lost. In any reappraisal of our membership of the EC there must be a case made to have a substantial increase in the quotas for all species, but especially for mackerel.  We have had a number of committee reports, the most important from the Sectoral Development Committee on sea fishing and the aquacultural industry, but we have seen no positive action on the recommendations and there is nothing in tonight's Estimate to suggest the Government will be taking action along these lines.</P>
    <P>Last year we were told that an aquaculture unit would be established in the Department and I am glad that has been done.  We welcome that development. Aquaculture is very important because it can create jobs and revenue can accrue to the State.  We may be able to produce goods which we are at present importing and there will be a possibility for secondary processing of up-market quality products.  This will provide potential job opportunities in isolated communities around our coasts.  I believe the unit in the Department will help to eliminate <Col N="1345" /> overlapping and duplication in that area because at present there are a number of agencies involved in the designation and licensing processes and this is retarding development.  We would like to see this process streamlined and made more efficient.  Perhaps the Minister would take some positive action to fully exploit the potential of aquaculture.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in the salmon fishing industry seem to worsen season by season.  It is regrettable that even at present salmon fishermen are imprisoned because of breaches of the salmon fishing regulations.  Nobody condones the flagrant violation of these regulations but when the salmon fishing industry is in danger of collapse, it is time for the Government to take action to deal with that crisis.  There must be a measure of co-operation between the salmon fishermen, the staff of the regional boards and the conservationists.  You cannot have protection and conservation unless there is this co-operation.  The situation we have seen over the last number of years must be brought to an end and I ask the Minister of State to take an interest in this area, to sit down with the fishermen and try to work out reasonable and sensible and workable regulation to control salmon fishing.  Unless this is done we will not have any peace or prosperity in this industry.</P>
    <P>There is a need for further strengthening of the protection services to meet changing circumstances since Spain joined the Community.  We must take account of the enlarged Community fleet, bearing in mind that almost every day we see flagrant violations of the fishery regulations by the Spanish fleet.  Almost every day at least one vessel is apprehended for operating illegally.  That has to stop.  The Community must provide more financial aid and resources.  A recently published Dáil report indicated that the Community should fund the operation of the protection service.</P>
    <P>We fully endorse the Minister's views to support exploratory fishing.  Boats which do not find it possible to exist within the present arrangement could be <Col N="1346" /> utilised for that purpose &mdash; to get involved in exploratory fishing, to exploit new species and areas and so on.  We have already criticised the failure of the Government to provide the necessary funds to support the research programme by the <i>Lough Beltra</i>, our only fisheries research vessel.  We have heard a great deal about Sellafield and pollution of the Irish Sea, but at a time when there is need for research in this very important area we find the Government cutting back on the allocation for research by the <i>Lough Beltra.</i>  This vessel is inadequately funded.  We say Sellafield should be closed.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to safety at sea. We are conscious of the need to provide a good communications system all around our coastline.  We have seen that there is a risk to the signals on the east and north-west coasts and we ask the Minister to take urgent action to deal with this very important problem.  If the signal is cut off it will create hazards for our fishermen. This week we saw a tragic accident in the Aran Islands with a loss of life.  We will see more of this unless adequate safety precautions are taken around our coastline and the necessary communications network is provided.</P>
    <P>There is a dual strategy needed to solve the problems in the timber industry.  The present structure is not adequate to deal with changing circumstances.  We believe a new commercially orientated semi-State organisation is needed to exploit the potential of our forests.  We also see a need for a very vigorous and intensive drive to increase afforestation.  Land reserved for this purpose is at a critically low level.  Planting targets have not been reached.  Last year we achieved half our target.  We need to reach the target of 10,000 hectares, 25,000 acres, and stick rigidly to that.  We are importing timber; the United Kingdom is importing 90 per cent of her timber requirements and in the foreseeable future the EC will import billions of pounds worth of timber.  Yet we are allowing our planting targets to go into decline.</P>
    <P>We are not meeting the stated objectives and targets set down by successive <Col N="1347" /> Governments.  Thousands of jobs are being put at risk in the sawmilling industry because of the failure to provide adequate timber for that industry. Timber mills are working at half capacity and jobs are being lost every day in the timber area.  We have a huge potential which is not being exploited, and we have the climate and conditions to grow timber at twice or three times the rate of anywhere else in Europe.  Opportunities are there at home and abroad for us.  Is there any reason why we cannot build anything on these at this time?  Time has caught up on us.  I regret that we have not the time to go in detail into all the areas covered by these two Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I take note of what you say and I will be as brief as possible to allow my colleagues to say a few words. I welcome the allocation of almost £26 million by the Government for the promotion of tourism this year.  This is a recognition of the fact that it is one of <Col N="1348" /> our major industries not alone in terms of the revenue it brings to the State but also in terms of employment potential.  I refer in particular to that element of the Minister's speech about the need for greater imagination and flair in promoting what we have to sell and I agree fully with that suggestion.  Greater emphasis should be placed on marketing.  Regarding the German area alone, the indications are that there will be an increase in tourism from Continential Europe this year of the order of 6 per cent, and that is to be encouraged.</P>
      <P>An amazing contradiction is evident at times in our behaviour as a nation.  We are a brilliant people when it comes to writing.  Dublin is the only city in the world which has produced three winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature and that does not take into account James Joyce's contribution to English literature.  We have a wonderful imagination when it comes to writing and we do not make sufficient use of that in the development of tourism which can be a magnificent contribution to the economy if it is properly developed.  I speak in particular about some aspects of our history and civilisation which are very much under-focused by Bord Fáilte.  For example, I spent time in Quimper in Brittany, a city which has a twinning arrangement with my city and I was absolutely enthralled some years ago to see there a presentation in French to a largely continental audience by a sociology lecturer from UCD, a very competent young lady.  She highlighted the old type of civilisation on our west coast, sean nós singing and so on.  The audience were as enthralled, as I was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not purely an abstract, academic or sociological aspect.  Other countries have been very quick to latch on to their strength in such areas.  I call to mind Bob Quinn's television series entitled &ldquo;The Atlantian&rdquo; in which he posits the theory that our culture owes very much to the Greek and Coptic, North African influence. Some older manuscripts indicate that there were Greek speaking settlements or residual influences of Greek culture in Kerry and Mayo.  These are <Col N="1349" /> fairly well documented.  Such things should be highlighted by somebody with imagination in Bord Fáilte, or a division should be set up in Bord Fáilte to sponsor that kind of market in response to some elements of the European population who are interested.  I have met many school teachers, historians and students and I know that very interesting tourist packages can be arranged with that kind of thing in mind.</P>
    <P>I am not talking solely about the promotion of the west coast which Elizabeth Ferris, travel correspondent of <i>The Times,</i> some years ago described on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; as the last piece of unspoiled and the most magnificent stretch of coastline in Europe.  Another part of our history is as yet largely unexploited in terms of tourism.  I am talking about the heritage of our towns and cities. Everybody is aware of the wonderful work the OPW did in the restoration of the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham.  The whole nation takes pride in that as do some thinking people in Europe where recently we won the <i>Europa Nostra</i> prize from the Council of Europe for what was done in that regard.</P>
    <P>I posit the idea to the OPW, the Government and the Minister that other places besides Dublin might get a share of public moneys to do something similar. If I appear to be talking on a narrow basis, I hope the House will forgive me. I am always reluctant to do that, but let me refer to what has been done in my city which is the oldest in the country.  We sent four Danish bishops to Canterbury before Dublin or Armagh even got their act sorted out between them.  Limerick, Waterford, Wexford and other places have a huge Viking heritage.</P>
    <P>The Limerick Civic Trust are a voluntary body set up by interested persons. They are the only such body in this country, although Britain has hundreds of them and they have done marvellous work there.  The Limerick Civic Trust are doing magnificent restoration work on the older parts of the city and I am delighted to compliment this Government on the fact that the Minister in his budget speech allocated £100,000 to the <Col N="1350" /> trust to aid them in that work.  The OPW in conjunction with the Minister for Tourism should allocate some of their resources to such prospects around the country as they did with the Royal Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am trying to respond to the Minister's suggestion that we come up with more ideas.  For example, SFADCo proposed to develop a model Viking settlement in Limerick at Little Island in the older part of the city alongside the English town where a continuum of people have lived for well over 1,000 years.  Documents in The Royal Irish Academy written by a man called Rafer in 1015 and referred to in <i>Lenihan's History of Limerick 1866</i> refer to Vikings living in Limerick.  Rafer was from Iceland and spent most of his life in Limerick city.  I say that because SFADCo wanted to recreate a Viking settlement as was done in York, a magnificent centre, which has attracted a million foreign tourists.  The same should be done in Limerick, Waterford and Wexford, the old Viking cities, which were part of our heritage before they were superseded by the Normans.  I understand that SFADCo have been curtailed from doing this work because of lack of funds.  It is criminally shortsighted to fail to provide money to develop tourist potential which will give employment and make our towns and cities clean and interesting for foreigners to visit and will also give pleasure to our own people.</P>
    <P>I must criticise the Office of Public Works in other areas.  For example, property in Limerick city owned by them is lying derelict and is a reflection on us because it is civic vandalism.  I specifically refer to Rutland Street alongside the Custom House.  The Custom House was built in 1780 but now has no roof on it. It is at the main entrance to the city and I have been assured by way of an answer to a parliamentary question that this eyesore will be taken away.  However, although it is an embarrassment to Limerick Corporation, they cannot touch it because it is owned by the Office of Public Works.  King John's Castle is another example of what I am talking <Col N="1351" /> about.  It was built in 1210, five years before the signing of the Magna Carta by King John, and it is the finest example of Norman castle architecture in the country. Yet it has an unkempt, untidy and dirty appearance because of growth on the walls facing the Shannon.  There are weeds and greenery and the wall is broken.  If the Office of Public Works had any civic pride they would do something about introducing proper symmetry to the walls and giving them a decent appearance because it is the first focal point for visitors to Limerick.  I appeal to the Minister to speak to the Office of Public Works regarding what might be done in towns and cities.  I accept that they do not have much money at their disposal but they should put their own historic property in order.</P>
    <P>I commend the small family homes and farm guesthouses which are making a magnificent contribution to the economy. They should be encouraged because they give the best value for money in Europe. There are high standards laid down by Bord Fáilte and they make a lasting good impression on foreign tourists who never have a word of criticism to say about them.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of some hotels and restaurants. Recently, inspectors from the Department of Health spoke about the serious lack of standards of hygiene and cleanliness in restaurants.  Such restaurants should be closed down unless there is an immediate and visible improvement in their standards.  The kind of report which appeared in the newspapers last week regarding some of the restaurants in the city will frighten off tourists quicker than anything else.  The Minister should look at the possibility of appointing someone with overall responsibility to promote tidiness and cleanliness in our cities. The British Government did this last week.  I do not suggest that we ape them in everything, but this is a good idea. There is no such thing as a dirty city or town, only dirty people and, unfortunately, we are a dirty, careless people. The first principle of organisational development is a recognition of our problems and then dealing with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> Wearing the hat of the chairman of the Joint Committee on semi-State bodies, I wish to state that there is a huge potential for employment in the fishing industry. We are a maritime nation, grossly under-capitalised and under-utilised in terms of creating jobs in that area.  It is absurd to have at least four State agencies &mdash; the ESB, Inland Fisheries, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Bord Iascaigh Mhara &mdash; all involved in the promotion of fisheries. That is a quadruplication of very scarce national resources.  The Government should appoint someone to cut out this wasteful practice and to maximise employment potential.</P>
    <P>I understand that there has been a stampede by foreigners in relation to mariculture developments in our bays and estuaries.  Under EC trading conditions we cannot stop that but we should encourage our own people to get involved in this area so that we will reap the benefits.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that time is limited as so many speakers wish to contribute to this important debate.  It is even more unfortunate that it is a limited debate of three and a half hours. Furthermore, prior to the amalgamation of Fisheries and Forestry with Tourism, we would have had much more time.  This is a retrogade step as far as Fisheries and Forestry are concerned, because they play an inferior role to tourism.  One has to give credit to the fact that Fisheries and Forestry were established with a full Minister but, unfortunately, tourism has now taken over.  I hope that in future <Col N="1353" /> we will have more time to discuss these matters.</P>
      <P>One of the big problems that fishermen and skippers continue to face relates to finance.  The aid package introduced last year was welcomed with reservations, but it only affected those who had ties with BIM.  There are many other people in the industry who have loans from other institutions who are not covered.  They should be included in the same package. While that aid package alleviated the situation at the time and resulted in a better loans performance in some cases, we had a difficult situation last year caused by the atrocious weather conditions and a drop in the price of fish. Consequently this aid package did not have the effect we would have expected. In view of this I would ask the Minister to make a case to the Government to provide more money for BIM to continue aid and cover the vessels that have no ties to BIM.  If finance can be provided for farmers it should be provided to fishermen because their problems are just as serious.  If a boat is repossessed from an experienced skipper who has spent many years at sea, it is sold or the loan is transferred to a fisherman with very little experience.  The experienced man is then lost to the industry and we cannot afford this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the salmon situation, it is a fallacy to believe just because during the short salmon fishing period substantial amounts of money are made by fishermen that they are well off.  It must be remembered that that is the only income they have, fishing in boats from 30 to 49ft., some in boats smaller than 30 ft.  It is wrong that they should be tarnished with making a lot of money illegally. What other industry would ask men to go out and fish, in this technological age, with less effective nets?  The Department can accept fishermen going out with multistrand nets and the new type of net, monoace, and that is not illegal.  Yet they are very similar to the monofilament nets. What we are saying is that we should burn hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of monofilament nets but that it is <Col N="1354" /> quite legal to use monoace nets, which is precisely the same thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have a look at this. We have been saying this every year for the last number of years.  It is only fair that we should give this Minister an opportunity to look at it.  When previous Ministers were asked to look at the situation we were always told that it was much too near the salmon season which did not give enough time to change the regulations and that we should look at it after the season.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that, but one must question the sincerity of it when, year in year out, it is not looked at.  We must grasp the nettle and try to ensure that regulations are drawn up by the Department and by the fishermen's organisations and their representatives.  We are making a very reasonable case and, if bailiffs are to be introduced, the best bailiffs would be the fishermen themselves.  They fully appreciate that they must conserve the salmon.  No fisherman wants to kill off a renewable resource.  This could happen and we will have an illegal situation if we do not do something about it.  As I said earlier, it is all right to use these other nets, but we have the absurd situation where multi-strand netting and monoace netting can be used legally for gill netting and the only difference is that there would be weights on for the gill netting of white fish but not for the other fish. Fishermen then find that they have to prove themselves innocent, which is a complete reversal of common justice.  In a case that was brought to court last year there was a doubt as to what type of fishing was going on.</P>
    <P>It is not popular to advocate this, but it is important to be practical about it and to try to regulate salmon fishing.  There is a fair amount of commitment on the part of the fishermen.  They have invested a fair amount of money over the years in the provision of stocks by way of payments to the Northern Regional Fisheries Board and the other boards.  There is no joy for the fishermen going out during the summer to find that there is a problem of breaking the law and there is that fear there all the time.  The fishermen should <Col N="1355" /> be able to go out and enjoy the fishing and the only way they can do that is by working within the regulations.  But it is not possible to do it because of the amount of that net available now.  On the other hand, the Department of Finance are quite happy to accept VAT and other duties from the sale of that net, admittedly for white fish purposes.  The Minister of State should get together with the organisations to try to resolve this problem, if not for this year definitely for next year.</P>
    <P>There are still serious problems with the Spaniards.  The problem has not been resolved since the Spaniards and the Portuguese became members of the EC. The Spaniards are fishing illegally and it is very difficult to establish the amount of illegal fishing.  A rule of thumb is that some of those large boats can take about £1 million worth of illegal fish from our waters each year.  We had an absurd situation recently where the same vessel has been caught for the fifth time, but there is the loophole whereby the names of the vessels, the skippers or the owners are changed and those people have got off with the minimum fine.  This creates a situation where it pays them to fish illegally because of the pool insurance system that they operate.  They have never denied this.  We have made that allegation on numerous occasions inside and outside this House.  The Spaniards have never denied it and I would go so far as to say that they are being aided and abetted by their own Department out there.  The situation will become increasingly worse after the ten year transition period because we are not developing and we are not encouraging our fishermen to become more involved with the bigger boats which can go out there and mix it with them.  Let me take this opportunity of complimenting Seamus Tully and Martin Hurley on the purchase of their new 213 ft. boat, the <i>Atlantic Challenge.</i> Unfortunately we have not contributed one penny towards that boat.  If we are serious about this transition period and being able to mix it with other European countries we should be looking at the <Col N="1356" /> situation whereby we can help these people by giving them a grant, whether it is of 5 per cent or 25 per cent, and trying to avail of the larger grants from Europe.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the system of grants was changed.  The size of boat was increased from 24 to 33 metres between perpendiculars, but we did it only when we found that smaller boats might be becoming obsolete.  Why did we not go the whole way and try to grant aid the much bigger vessels?  We did not do so when the super trawlers could have availed of this grant aid.  One must be grateful that they can now avail of it as regards lengthening of boats but on condition that they change over to a different type of fishing.  This grant is in connection with new boats and boats being lengthened in which there are not RSW tanks, but dry hold storage, to make sure that the fishermen change over to white fish.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the herring market is serious, with that fish being sold for £4.50 per box as against £28 per box some few years ago.  This is as a result of the opening up of the North Sea and there is very little that we could do about that.  We could certainly try to ensure that the herring coming in from Canada and taking up markets in which we could have engaged in Europe should be subject to duty to try to deter these shipments. It is difficult for us to complain too bitterly in the European context about the herring market if we are prepared to allow the Canadians to ship herring into the community, while we must go to the Eastern Bloc countries looking for markets.  I see no good reason for this, but perhaps the Minister of State may have some answer to it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is still a considerable amount of mackerel in the country because of the difficulties in Nigeria.  We could sell all that mackerel to Nigeria if we were prepared to accept their currency, but unfortunately that currency will not be accepted by banks in the western world.  That is a matter for the people in private enterprise, who should be complimented on their tremendous efforts over difficult months to try to sell these <Col N="1357" /> mackerel stocks.  It is hoped that those efforts will bear fruit and that a market will be secured before the next season. Any help that can be given should be given.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there is no export subsidy for mackerel going to third countries. If that were the case, it would be of some advantage to these exporters.</P>
    <P>There is a ludicrous situation regarding research.  The European quotas of mackerel seem to be based on surveys carried out around the Porcupine Bank and to the south west.  No research whatsoever is being carried on along the west coasts of Ireland or Scotland.  Fishermen have returned from those fishing grounds over the past number of years and their markings have shown vast quantities of mackerel. Mackerel, being a migratory species, may have changed their pattern due to the change in temperature of the water.  This has happened in Canada, where the herring pattern has changed because of the water temperature there. The Community carried out nine surveys and not one of those was off the west coast.  The Minister referred to some surveys off the west coast on mackerel, but that is thanks to the people in the industry, the fishermen and the processors. They are prepared to invest £45,000 to carry out a survey and the Government are not prepared to do so.  When the results of those surveys are made available, I hope they will be brought to the attention of the ICES people, in trying to improve the total allowable catch and our 4.6 per cent quota.  It is hoped that we could strive for a greater percentage of the total allowable catch.</P>
    <P>There are no loans available within BIM for new vessels or for second-hand vessels offered at a low cost.  There is very little BIM can do about this as the only loans available are transfers of existing loans.  This is sad in an industry which should be developing.</P>
    <P>I note that there is no reference whatsoever in the Minister's contribution to Burtonport.  This harbour has developed well over the years, but development has now almost stopped because the larger <Col N="1358" /> boats cannot enter the harbour.  It is vitally important that money be provided out of the next Estimate to dredge Burtonport harbour and extend the existing facilities.  I have not time to go into the commitments given by Roinn na Gaeltachta and the Department of Fisheries, but now we find that the council are to provide 25 per cent of the expenditure.  I throw out a challenge to the Minister that we in Donegal County Council will provide 25 per cent of the cost if the Government will come up with £3 for every £1, which will be available as soon as the Government are ready to move.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the processors and the fishermen.  Over the last number of years, particularly since this Government took office, the industry would have been stagnant but for the investment of these people.</P>
    <P>With reference to the recent report on value for money within the industry, it is unfortunate that there are Deputies who feel too much money is being invested in the industry when judged by the return. They must remember that this is investment in rural areas, largely along the west coast, where the approach should be a social and economic one.</P>
    <P>I shall refer briefly to forestry.  We have great opportunities here for forestry development, opportunities undreamt of by those who saw decades ago the need for a positive forestry approach.  Those were the Fianna Fáil administrations who saw forestry essentially as a national development for national needs.  Now we can look far beyond those needs.  All these opportunities seem lost under the present administration.  In bad times like those we live in, of high unemployment and almost vanished hope, we need an administration which is prepared to seize opportunities to make use of national resources which cry out for development. The Minister should be telling us today, not of the poor progress made in the past year with regard to afforestation but of plans for the future.  These should cover a State planting programme and take account of the opportunities for realistic <Col N="1359" /> and sizeable private afforestation.  Unfortunately, we have not time to develop the theme of a private afforestation programme tonight, but I believe such a programme should supplement State planting and in time could match, and even exceed, that programme in importance. Such a programme needs to be well planned.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to sympathise with the families of the two fishermen who lost their lives recently.  Unfortunately in Donegal, on the west coast, we are only too accustomed to such tragedies. One cannot make any recommendation. It appears to be part of the unfortunate industry that these people must take such risks at times and go out in heavy seas.  All those involved in the fishing industry are saddened by this loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute however briefly to the debate on these important Estimates to us in the west.  I understand there are a number of speakers and I shall keep my comments as brief as possible.  We all agree that the fishing industry have gone through a very difficult period in these past few years.  Previous speakers in previous debates have outlined the causes of those difficulties.  We had rising costs such as the increase in oil prices and also increases in other expenses.  At the same time, the price of the product remained static and on some occasions was reduced.  One can say that a new air of confidence is felt in the fishing industry at the moment.  Matters have sorted themselves out and the trend is now in the other direction.  The reduction in the price of oil and fuel in the past year has been a great help to the fishermen.  There has also been a significant increase in the price of fish.  Confidence is felt among the fishing community.  As Deputy Gallagher said, there was a very good example of that in Killybegs a fortnight ago when the new vessel, <i>Atlantic Challenge,</i> docked there.  The local people invested about £6 million in that boat.  That is the kind of confidence we want to see in the fishing industry.  There is great potential for employment, particularly in the west. <Col N="1360" /> Mention has been made of BIM.  I regret that they no longer have money for boat building or for the purchasing of boats.  There are many young people along the west coast who are willing to become involved in the fishing industry, but unfortunately the board can no longer finance them even though they get grants. The reason is that some of the allocation made to the board is already earmarked. One of the side effects is that there is always the danger that people cannot get finance from the board to purchase boats and therefore they will go abroad and purchase second-hand or older boats. That brings its own difficulties.  I hope the Minister will have a look at this area. Perhaps money would be available in the future to facilitate anyone who wishes to purchase a boat or to maintain the boat he already has.</P>
      <P>Mention was also made of processing. More emphasis should be placed on processing because it can create employment. In order to have a good solid processing industry there must be continuity of supply, especially in the area of white fish.  We cannot depend on supply all the time.  We are at the mercy of the weather and so on.  I am glad to see that the fishermen are meeting this challenge. They are going further afield to make sure that the supply is regular and in order to keep the processors going.  With regard to mackerel, for many years we have been depending on the Nigerian market.  The political difficulties there over the last few years have brought instability into that market.  We are left with stocks of mackerel.  The repercussions are that it is now more difficult to get markets for mackerel.  I hope funds will be available to BIM and to the people who are involved in processing and in the mackerel industry to find other markets in Europe, including eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dog fish is being fished in the north west.  Nearly 2,000 tonnes of this fish has been exported to the UK in the past year from one port in Donegal.  This is a new type of export which had been discarded for many years.  It is now processed in the United Kingdom and is eventually exported again to France and Italy.  I <Col N="1361" /> suggest that there may be an opportunity for an Irish processor to become involved in processing this fish at home, thus creating much needed employment in the west.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture is becoming more important. There are great possibilities and potential in this area, certainly in the creation of employment.  A number of applications are being investigated in the Department at present.  I hope that due care and consideration will be given to the rights of the traditional fishermen in the area.  No installation should be licensed if it interferes with legal commercial fishing in that area.  Any structures that are erected in order to facilitate these fish farms should not interfere with the navigation of boats or with anglers.  I suggest that all licensed areas should be precisely marked and limited in size.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister of State that the synchrolift has been sanctioned and that in excess of £2 million has been made available this year to erect a synchrolift in Killybegs.  It has been expected for a long time.  We are now confident that work will commence shortly.  It will be of great benefit to that port.  There are a number of ports in Donegal.  Deputy Gallagher referred to Burtonport where there is a great fleet. The Minister visited Burtonport earlier this year and he knows the difficulties that are being experienced by the fishermen who use that port.  It needs to be dredged and extended.  There was a serious accident there earlier this year when a boat sank alongside the pier.  I hope something will be done to facilitate the fishermen there.</P>
    <P>Landings in Bunbeg were in excess of one million tonnes in the last year.  Two stages of the development there have already been carried out.  I appeal to the Department of Fisheries or the Department of the Gaeltacht, whoever is responsible, that the third stage of that work should be continued and finished as soon as possible.  Salmon fishing has also been mentioned.  We are now coming into the salmon fishing season.  We all know the difficulties experienced every <Col N="1362" /> year during the salmon season.  This type of fishing has been carried out for many years.  I regret that all the interested parties did not succeed in getting together outside the season when tempers were cool so that we could come up with some sort of rules and regulations which would be acceptable to everyone.  In the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure, in regard to the fishing industry the point was made that it is very important that the co-operation of the traditional salmon fishermen would be forthcoming in any arrangements that are made.  I would support that.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to tourism which is another industry with great potential for the creation of employment. Over the last few years the Government have taken some definite steps to improve the tourist industry.  In 1984 VAT on hotel accommodation was reduced to 10 per cent.  In this year's budget I was delighted when it was announced that VAT on meals is also being reduced to 10 per cent from 1 July.  The Irish Hoteliers Federation made an admission some months ago when they said that four years ago we were the highest taxed tourist industry in Europe but now as a result of Government measures we are the lowest.</P>
    <P>Another handicap on the tourist industry during the last few years was the high rate of inflation.  But with inflation down to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent it should be a great boost to the tourist industry and it should make us more competitive.  I would also like to refer briefly to the forestry industry. There are vast tracts of land in every part of the country which are highly suitable for planting.  It was envisaged to plant 25,000 acres in years gone by and if we could attain that target it would be an investment in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLeonard" hpid="Mr. T. Leonard Mr. T. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words about angling in and around the Dublin area.  I wish to say a word of praise on the valuable work which is now being done by the many angling associations who promote and develop angling facilities in and around Dublin.  These people have done some magnificent work <Col N="1363" /> to promote and develop angling with little or no State assistance.  The huge potential in the Dublin area for the attraction of anglers has not been fully exploited or developed.  The new fisheries authorities have a lot of work to do and I would urge the Central Fisheries Board and the regional board for the Dublin area in particular to publish a few brochures and guides to show tourists and locals the attractive fishing areas around the city where fishing can be enjoyed.  They should also embark on a promotional drive to attract many visitors to the city.  There are millions of such visitors from the UK who enjoy angling.  We in Dublin are only getting a very small percentage of these.</P>
      <P>It would be a good boost to tourism in the region if this business was tapped and tapped fully.  Local anglers, especially young ones, have little or no information available regarding the facilities in the Dublin area.  Many young anglers, in particular, would have no idea where they could fish in and around the capital city. Every type of fishing is available adjacent to the city.  There is coarse angling and game fishing.  Shore and deep sea fishing are also available within a few miles of the city.  I doubt if very many people except those involved in angling clubs know exactly where and what the regulations are operating in these various areas. I want to compliment the Central Fisheries Board on their work to promote fishing on the canals.  Much more of this work is desirable, especially around the city.  I am aware of the potential which is there to develop such accessible fisheries especially suitable for young anglers in the Dublin city area.  In some country areas classes in how to tie flies and other craft work of this nature have been organised. These are skills which are dying out and useful courses could be organised by AnCO and the fisheries board which would interest young people and take them off the streets.  Such courses would be interesting and popular with young people and would develop an awareness of fisheries, wildlife and the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to see more attention paid to this by the Central Fisheries <Col N="1364" /> Board, AnCO, development agencies and others.  There is ample opportunity for interesting, imaginative and valuable schemes in the Dublin area.  I would like to see something positive done especially for young interested anglers.  Very little has been done to provide access to fishing for handicapped persons.  Fishing is an ideal activity for some handicapped people.  However, there are few facilities provided for them and scarcely any access has been provided for them to get to the good fishing stretches.  The fisheries board dispose of hundreds of fishing rods each year which could be given out free to handicapped anglers to encourage them to take up fishing as a past-time.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the present state of repair and facilities of the Dublin fish market.  For years there has been ongoing discussion on the need to undertake major improvements in the market area. It is vitally important to develop and reconstruct the fish market.  Handling and storage facilities must be vastly improved.  I do not believe that the present location should be changed.  It should be kept where it is in the heart of Dublin.  I am satisfied that major investment is needed to modernise the market, improve standards and generally make the market an attractive and efficient centre.  We must ensure that the unique character, the friendly atmosphere and the old traditions of the Dublin fish market are never lost.  It would be a major tragedy if the heart and soul of the Dublin market was lost in modernising the general area.  I firmly believe that it is possible to have a thriving, efficient and hygienic fish market in the inner city without losing the character and characters who make up the market.  I would recommend that proper architectural advice be sought before any changes are undertaken.  The Dublin fish market is part of our heritage and it is possible to utilise this very special area in an efficient manner through careful planning and development.</P>
    <P>Down through the years it has been a noted area for visitors, particularly visitors to Dublin who wish in their tour of Dublin to see the famous old markets, <Col N="1365" /> both the fish and fruit markets.  I would be very reluctant to see either of them moved out of the centre of the city.  I hope to see some action taken in this area and due regard will be had in any development to the preservation and conservation of this historic part of Dublin's inner city.  I will conclude by saying that the Dublin fish market is part of the old area of Dublin and we must ensure that, if we do not modernise it, we never lose the charm and character of this unique centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies who made time for me to get in on this Estimate.  I have promised my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, that I will not delay and let him in as quickly as possible.  I welcome this opportunity to say a few words about the Fisheries Estimate for 1986.  Before doing so let me pay tribute to the excellent work of the former Minister for Fisheries, Deputy O'Toole, who during his three years in office contributed so much to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to congratulate Deputy Liam Kavanagh on his appointment as Minister and Deputy Donnellan on his appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries.  I wish both of them every success.  I should like to thank the Minister of State for having visited Howth with me last week when he impressed the fishermen and others whom he met there.  He spoke to them and, with his knowledge of fishing, assured them of their future in the Howth area.  He spoke also to some of the boatmen there who wished to have a slipway and a pound provided for the protection of their boats.  I am speaking of the people who are the sort of poor farmers of the fishing industry, the people with small boats who need that type of pound for their protection.  I would ask the Minister to consider their request and to make a site available to the Howth Boat Club there.  Naturally I am very pleased at the massive development there has been in the Howth area where £13 million has already been spent.  This has now become one of the finest harbours in Europe. <Col N="1366" /> The fishing industry has now reached the £100 million mark and, with State aid, is forecast to increase further.  It is pleasing to note that all parties in the Dáil are united in their intent to help in every possible way the development of the fishing industry.  We have at least four major fishing harbours &mdash; Killybegs, Howth, Rossaveal and Castletownbere, capable of landing approximately £35 million worth of fish each year.  Howth port lands in the region of £4 million worth of fish each year.  I might suggest to the Minister that more fish processing factories be erected at the main ports as well as factories for the repair of boats, the repair of nets, the manufacture of boxes, engine repair units, storage and warehousing facilities, along with modern ice-making units.  I should like the Minister to consider the provision of the fish auction hall in Howth.  I know Deputy T. Leonard made a good case for retaining the facility in the inner city.  But it costs Howth fishermen a considerable amount to transport their fish to the present auction hall.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider the provision of this facility in the Howth area.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise should be encouraged to invest in such development projects. The Government should encourage such investment in the industry.  I am certain that there is money available for this purpose.  Indeed, I have been advised that a number of commercial banks are only awaiting Government encouragement to become involved in this type of investment.  Successive Governments have blamed the lack of capital for the slow development of the industry.  One might well ask: have they ever attempted to persuade private enterprise to link up with An Board Iascaigh Mhara in this regard?  The Irish Federation of Marine Industries, through their spokesperson, Mr. Joseph O'Driscoll, have pointed out that the fishing industry could create 13,000 jobs on the processing and production side if the Government secured sufficient money from the banks and the investing public to build factories, recondition the present fleet and finance the purchase of a number of large trawlers <Col N="1367" /> located at the larger harbours.  I know that some 350 jobs would be created in Howth if the Government sought the help of investors to develop the industrial estate there, where some 35,000 square feet of land lies undeveloped in the harbour.</P>
    <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should be completely reorganised.  I might suggest that the Government act quickly on the report of the Committee on Public Expenditure dealing with State-support services to the fishing industry.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should no longer be allowed to act as financiers for boat loans. They are not suited to that type of operation and have not sufficient funds at their disposal to deal adequately with it. Rather they should be obliged to operate as a marketing board on somewhat the same lines as An Bord Bainne.  I agree that they should be involved also in the training of young fishermen and should engage in an intensive &ldquo;Eat More Fish&rdquo; campaign not alone on the home market but overseas.  They should be in closer contact with bodies such as Córas Trach-tála in an endeavour to secure additional foreign markets.</P>
    <P>We are told that total employment in the industry was estimated at 13,000 in 1985.  Over the next five years we should aim to create 15,000 extra jobs, doubling the national output to £200 million.  Our 10,000 fishermen are among the bravest of men, hard-working and absolutely competent, but they work in extremely difficult circumstances.  The present system of lending them money requires immediate change and a longer period of repayment is essential.  Better prices for fish must be secured in view of the ever-increasing operational costs.  For example, nets and fishing gear are daily becoming more expensive.</P>
    <P>One must seriously question the repossession of boats from defaulting fishermen. This does not constitute a solution to fishermen's financial problems.  Perhaps a liquidator should be appointed or somebody from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to run the operation for a while, ascertaining whether they can be rescued in <Col N="1368" /> this manner.  That would be of enormous help to fishermen with financial problems.</P>
    <P>I disagree completely with the location of 90 per cent of the staff of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the Dún Laoghaire offices.  It would be a help to fishermen to have full-time area officers in at least 20 ports.  However, the fishermen at Howth are loud in their praise of the area officers who serve them.  Very few fishermen can afford the time or money to visit the Dún Laoghaire offices.  They complain about this.  The Minister should examine that aspect.  I should like to see An Bord Iascaigh Mhara establish modern fish shops all over the country, equipped with freezers, and leasing them to fish traders.  Howth herrings, Dublin Bay prawns are well known worldwide, much the same as is Kerrygold butter. Let us create fish brands worldwide.  Fish has become a much-desired food everywhere. Let us start now and within a short time we could have 28,000 workers in the industry and a vastly improved fishing economy.</P>

      <P>Sílim nach bhfuil sé sásúil go mbeimís ag deileáil leis na trí meastacháin seo le chéile.  Bheadh díos-póireacht i bhfad níos fearr againn, im thuairimse, dá dtógfaí gach ceann acu leis féin.</P>
      <P>It is not entirely satisfactory that we should be debating three Estimates together.  It would be much more satisfactory to take each separately, going through them in greater detail.  It means also that Deputies have a limited time within which to make their views known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might start with Fisheries, which industry is in a serious state at present. Speaking with fishermen along our coasts, I have never experienced so much depression in the industry.  It must be acknowledged that on the west coast we have had exceptionally bad weather which has meant that the fishing fleet has had a very limited time to get out to sea. Throughout most of the spring, except for a period when there was some frost, catches were very low.  We must take into account the hardship fishermen have to <Col N="1369" /> endure and we must provide every facility necessary to keep the industry as viable as possible.  Fishermen with small boats of up to 80 feet have serious problems.</P>
    <P>Since we got away from herring fishing fishermen have not managed to adjust and they do not have the income to which they became accustomed in the past.  Then they were able to meet their bills.  It is strange when we talk about inshore fishing at present to note that the only fishing which has proved possible in the last few years is dogfish and crayfish. These were species which were thrown over board a few years ago.  It is ironic that it is now possible to get as much as £25 a box for dogfish whereas herring would only fetch £8.</P>
    <P>More money will have to be invested in the industry to help our fishermen compete with foreign fishermen.  It is encouraging that so many people are prepared to invest heavily in larger boats which will form part of the fishing industry in the near future.  The only fishermen who have made profits in recent years are those with boats of over 120 feet.  The State will have to look again at the question of financing these operations.  Employment could be generated at home through processing and so on.  This would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>We will be faced with the question of quotas and how much fish we can catch. In 1975 we doubled our quota but to a certain extent it was a doubling of nothing because our quota was very low.  We must ensure that provision is made for our developing industry and see to it that our quotas are increased.</P>
    <P>The provision of £4.75 million for BIM speaks for itself.  It is not adequate.  It is next to impossible for anyone in the industry to get money to invest in a new boat.  The money which has been allocated has already been committed.  That is not satisfactory.  Young people should be encouraged into the industry and adequate finance should be made available to them through BIM.</P>
    <P>Marketing is an old chestnut of mine. While it is true that things have improved, the system which now operates has <Col N="1370" /> obtained for a number of years.  For example, in my local co-operative most of the fish caught go to Dublin for auction.  It means that once the fish leave Achill Sound the price they realise is outside of the control of the co-op.  They have no guarantee that the fish will realise anything worthwhile.  Fishermen tell me that prices have not improved as far as they are concerned, yet a person who buys fish in a shop will pay dearly for it.  Some kind of organisation should be set up which would guarantee that fishermen will be properly treated.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk recently about drift net fishermen and the slaughter of salmon, but we never hear about what is happening in our rivers.  There are fishing companies who have rights on our rivers.  The salmon have no chance to escape.  A net is put across the river, traps are used and so on, but no publicity is given to that.  Everyone knows about the fisherman who risks his life on the high seas to catch a few salmon.  The salmon on the high seas have every chance to escape, but the ones in the river have no chance of escape.</P>
    <P>The position is serious in relation to lobster and crayfish.  The use of tangle nets should be banned.  Only a small amount of fish are taken in by the fishermen and two-thirds of them are destroyed or lost.  Such nets have played havoc with crayfish in particular.  There are no crayfish now in areas where they were once very plentiful.  That is as a result of the use of these nets.  Stocks of lobster are quite low.  It is time that some type of conservation was embarked on.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to improve many of our harbours, but the sum allocated for that work is not adequate.  The fleet in my constituency is expanding but the facilities at Derby's Point are terrible.  When fishermen from other parts of the country try to land it is chaotic.  I find it hard to understand why plans which are prepared by co-ops or fishermen are altered by the Department and the Office of Public Works.  The co-operation that is necessary is not forthcoming from the Department for such work.  We are always told that there is not sufficient <Col N="1371" /> money, but plans submitted by local interests should be implemented over a five or ten year period rather than being altered.</P>
    <P>We have to be careful about where we are going in regard to fish farming.  The industry has a bright future, particularly when one considers what happened in Norway and other countries; but, if it is developed, I hope the interests of local people are taken into consideration.  I hope development in that area by big investors is not to the detriment of individuals who live along the coast.  Income from fish farming could supplement the income of small farmers.  We should encourage development along those lines.  I could say a lot more about this industry but I am anxious that Deputy Sheehan gets an opportunity to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Gallagher for giving me an opportunity to make a contribution on these Estimates and I am grateful to the Minister of State for giving me some of his time.  More time should be allowed for debates on these Estimates.  The sea is man's happy hunting ground.  There are 30,000 different types of fish throughout the world.  In the Far East people eat sword fish, octopus, squid and many other varieties.  In Irish waters there are 40 different types of fish divided into three distinctive categories &mdash; demersal, pelagic and shell fish.  The big Irish trawlers are crewed by 13 men who are on call 24 hours per day.  Those men frequently clock up in excess of 1,000 working hours per week, averaging 80 hours per week for each member of the crew.  It takes 40 mature oak trees to build a 70 ft. timber trawler.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fishing was always treated as a cinderella industry here.  Before we gained our independence Britain, as part of the fruits of being a conqueror, rented the Irish fishing grounds to Spain, France, Holland and Sweden.  Tradition dies hard in those countries and for years Spanish trawlers marauded our fishing grounds along the western seaboard.  In the eighteenth century <Col N="1372" /> a penal duty was imposed on imported salt with the result that the curing industry in Ireland ceased.</P>
    <P>We should promote and extend the fishing industry and explore the European markets, particularly the German market, where there is great potential. We should develop and expand the aquaculture and mariculture industries.  There is great potential for those industries.  I was interested to hear Deputy Gallagher say that the price of a box of herrings was between £1.50 and £2 when a few years ago a box of herrings made £24.  It is interesting to note that in the supermarkets on the Continent one can buy 1 lb. jars of marinated herrings, consisting of three herrings, at between £1.50 and £2 per jar.  We should take a lead from that and build up our export of herring.  The Germans sell herrings in beer, in brine, in cider, in tomato sauce and in wine in all supermarkets on the Continent.  We must ask ourselves how it is that the Germans are able to flood the European market with their fish products and export further afield.  We are not capitalising on that industry.  It is well known that for every person engaged in fishing at sea there should be eight people engaged in fish processing on shore.  We should pay more attention to the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the former Minister for Fisheries, Deputy O'Toole, who played an important part in the development of the fishing industry. During his term of office he sanctioned the £500,000 Schull pier project.  I suggest that a modern ice plant and auction hall be erected at the pier.  The road to the pier should be improved.</P>
    <P>The dumping of fish into intervention by the EC is a disgrace when one considers the number of people who are starving in other parts of the world.  I am amazed that a group of nations as powerful as the EC should operate such a nonsensical scheme.  Why is it that the EC does not purchase surplus fish at a flat price and give it to the people who are dying from starvation in the Third World.  It does not make sense to dump the best food available into the backwater <Col N="1373" /> to be dyed before being returned to the sea.  We should introduce a conservation measure for our shellfish.  We must protect the reproduction stock.  With regard to salmon fishing, there should be dialogue between the Department and those concerned with salmon fishing.  We should ensure that our fish stocks are preserved for future generations.</P>

      <P>Since I was appointed Minister of State with special responsibility for fisheries I have done my best to acquaint myself with all aspects of the industry. When one considers that, as Deputy Sheehan has told us, there are 30,000 different types of fish in the world, one will realise that I have a long way to go. I do not know how many of these species are peculiar to this island.  The number he mentioned is beyond my comprehension. I will have to have a talk with the Deputy to try to acquaint myself further with the fishing industry, particularly the fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time I have been in the Department I have tried to meet as many people in the industry as I could.  I met the chief executive, chairman and members of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the chief executive and the chairman of the Central Fisheries Board, the managers of all the regional boards, the Irish Aquaculture Association, Údarás na Gaeltachta in regard to the aquaculture area, the Southern Inshore Fishermen's Association, the IFO twice, the Irish Fish Processors' and Exporters' Association, the Irish Estuary Salmon Net Fishermen's Association &mdash; they are the draught net people &mdash; the Ros an Mhíl Harbour Advisory Committee, the Western Region Eel Fishermen's Association, a deputation from Clare County Council in regard to the development of Dunbeg Harbour &mdash; Deputy Daly was on that deputation &mdash; and large numbers of people who wanted to talk to me about aquaculture licences.  I paid visits to Ros an Mhíl, Killybegs, Burtonport, Dunbeg, Dunmore East and other centres and have plans to visit a number of other <Col N="1374" /> locations.  I do not think that is too bad considering the short time I have been in the Department.</P>

      <P>In his contribution the Deputy was critical of many things.  It is a pity he did not mention that we are making £2 million available for the synchro-lift in Donegal.  That is being done this year.  It is the easiest thing in the world to be critical of what the Department do.  Deputy Sheehan asked for proper dialogue between the Department and the fishermen.  In the short time I have been in the Department I have seen no problem about dialogue: it is an open house, anybody can come into it with or without an appointment, there is no problem.  According to Deputy Gallagher's remarks you would swear the end of the world was here. Most of his speech was about depression: we do not have big enough quotas, the £4.7 million to BIM is derisory; he talked about money; there is not enough money for harbour development or for marketing. The Deputy spoke about salmon fishermen.  Which side is he on, or is he on any side?</P>

      <P>In 1986 the total amount of money available for the industry is 8 per cent more than last year and that is an indication of the Government's commitment to the fishing industry.  Last year exports yielded more <Col N="1375" /> than £100 million for fish and fish products. That also is an indication that the fishing industry is going somewhere &mdash; it is not all depression as some people are inclined to think.  We have been hearing on television about a new body that might be formed and be as successful as other people may be at elections.  They were not so successful in the last few years. This body is to be known as Roinn na Mara.  I should like to know where did they get the name from.  Was it something that was just plucked out of the air for a particular TV show?  Linked to the new Roinn na Mara would be many other things that would overnight solve the problems that exist in the fishing industry.  It is as well to get down to the fact that only a certain amount of money is available.  During my time in office I will try to get more money from the Government for the fishing industry.  I hope I will be successful particularly in 1987.</P>
      <P>There is reference to the White Paper on the fishing industry.  It will be produced before the end of this Dáil session. That is not an empty promise.  Like other Deputies, I should like to express a welcome to the <i>Atlantic Challenge.</i>  I am sorry I was unable to be present at its launching because I had a couple of other commitments, and I wish the people involved much luck.  I hope others in the Irish fishing industry can see their way to invest in that kind of project.  It was said there was no money from the State for it.  Possibly that is a good thing: it is an indication that there must be a few pounds around in the fishing industry when people can spend £6 million on a boat.  I would like to congratulate all those involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Daly about the exploitation of the waters around our coast.  He said the fall in fuel prices had not been passed on to the fishermen.  As far as I am aware, it has been passed on totally.  Other Deputies, including Deputy Daly, spoke about our fish quotas.  They said we have not adequate quotas from the total catch.  I am informed that the only way we can increase <Col N="1376" /> the total take is to increase the total EC catch.  Perhaps we should renegotiate the whole thing in order to get a bigger percentage of the total catch for Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise I will try. One way to expand our fishing is in the non-quota area.  We should try to catch fish not affected by quotas because it will not be too long until the species now not governed by EC regulations will become subject to quotas.  A number of Deputies referred to salmon fishing and the regulations governing it.  These regulations were introduced by a Fianna Fáil Minister. The man who had most to do with it was Deputy Lenihan.  He was a man of courage, but many of those now speaking on the industry have been speaking like Indians, with forked tongues &mdash; they are trying to keep on both sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies want the facts about salmon fishing I will supply them.  A number of people are using drift nets and they take 85 per cent of the total wild salmon catch.  The total legal catch last year was 1,540 tonnes.  A small number of drift net men took 85 per cent of that catch.  The current salmon fishing season is in operation and I am sure there will be people who will not be entirely satisfied with the manner in which the protection staff will try to deal with our problems.  The Department are trying to ensure that there will be a regeneration of the wild species by allowing enough salmon to get up our rivers.  I am sure Deputies opposite will go along with that. Deputies will be aware that in the last couple of years fishermen used firearms, slash hooks, flares, iron bars and other weapons on the protection staff and I hope those men will control their ambitions and their tempers a little to ensure that the staff can do the job they set out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go along with the opinion of Deputy Daly and others that the way the Estimates <Col N="1377" /> have been dealt with is not the most satisfactory.  Personally, I do not think the three Estimates should have been taken together.  They should have been dealt with individually and adequate time should have been given to people to express their views.</P>

    <P>Tá breis is £19 milliún á chur ar fáil i mbliana do Roinn na Gaeltachta, d'Údarás na Gaeltachta agus do Bhord na Gaeilge lena chaitheamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge. Anuas ar an tsuim £14,496,000 atá i Leabhar na Meastachán, tá soláthar £4,850,000 á chur ar fáil ó fhoinsí eile: airleacan a íoctar díreach as an Státchiste leis an Údarás; £4,750,000 atá i gceist i mbliana; agus iasachtaí as Ciste na nIas-achtaí Áitiúla a cheadaíonn mo Roinnse do thithe sa Ghaeltacht; £100,000 atá údaraithe don bhliain reatha.</P>

    <P>Is cúis sásaimh dom gur tháinig méadú arís anuraidh ar an bhfostaíocht lánaimseartha i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ó Ghaeltarra Éireann/Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá méadú leanúnach bainte amach <Col N="1379" /> le ceithre bliana anuas ar líon na ndaoine atá fostaithe i dtionscail faoi scáth an Údaráis.  Ó 1982 go deireadh 1985 tháinig méadú breis is 16 faoin gcéad ar an bhfostaíocht sin agus ag deireadh 1985 bhí 4,656 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha sna tionscail éagsúla i gcomparáid le 4,405 dhuine ag deireadh na bliana roimhe sin &mdash; meadú de 251 dhuine.  Is dul chun cinn sásúil é sin ag féachaint do na deacrachtaí iomadúla a bhíonn le sárú ag an Údarás chun tionscail fhiúntacha a mhealladh chuig an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ó thús 1986 tá tograí ceadaithe ag an Údarás a bhfuil timpeall 860 post nua sa bhreis iontu agus, cé nach bhfuil ach cúig mhí den bhliain imithe, sáraíonn an figiúr sin an sprioc de 600 post nua a sonraíodh don leathbhliain.  Tá béim ar leith á cur ag an Údarás ar fhorbairt acmhainní nád-úrtha na Gaeltachta agus is comhartha maith ar an dul chun cinn atá bainte amach an líon mór tograí iascaireachta atá ag teacht ar aghaidh.

Agus é sin ráite, is eol dom go bhfuil deacrachtaí airgeadais ag an Údarás faoi láthair agus tá gach dícheall á dhéanamh agam chun an fhadhb sin a réiteach le cinntiú nach gcuirfear bac ar an obair thábhachtach atá ar siúl ag an eagraíocht chun fostaíocht bhreise a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh réiteach ar an bhfadhb sin agam go han-luath.  Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don tuarascáil ar an Údarás ón gComhchoiste den Oireachtas um Chomhlachtaí Stát-Tionscanta Tráchtála a foilsíodh le déanaí agus a rá go bhfáiltím roimpi.

Bhí an-áthas orm, dá bhrí sin, go raibh ar mo chumas méadú sa deontas do thithe nua a cheadú amhail ó 1 Bealtaine 1985. Méadú ó £2,000 go £3,000 a bhí i gceist agus méadú go £4,500 ar oileáin Ghaeltachta amach ón gcósta.  Ina theannta sin, bhíos in ann a fhógairt roimh Nollaig go raibh deontais fheabhsúcháin agus sláintíochta á méadú, agus deontais nua á gceadú chun seomraí breise a chur le tithe cónaithe, chun fuinneóga agus doirse fabhtacha a athnuachan agus go mbeadh deontas £5,500 le fáil chun mór-oibreacha riachtanacha feabhsúcháin agus athnuachana a dhéanamh ar thithe cónaithe a tógadh roimh an mbliain 1940.  Is maith liom go bhfuil méadú mór tagtha ar líon na n-iarratas faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) sa chéad chúig mhí den bhliain seo i gcomparáid leis an tréimhse céanna anuraidh.  Tá soláthar £1,625,000 sa Mheastachán le haghaidh tithíochta i mbliana i gcomparáid le £980,000 anuraidh i.e. méadú 66 faoin gcéad.</P>
    <P>Ó tharla raon níos leithne deontas ar fáil anois agus méadú mór i leibhéal na ndeontas tá súil agam go gcuirfear tuilleadh leis an mborradh atá le haireachtáil sa tionscal tógála sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá tionchar tábhachtach ar fhorbairt na Gaeltachta ag na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin atá á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse agus is cúis bhróid dom mar sin go bhfuil soláthar na bliana seo &mdash; £1.8 milliún &mdash; cuid mhaith níos airde ná an soláthar a bhí ar fáil in aon bhliain le trí bliana anuas.  Cabhraíonn na scéimeanna seo le feabhas a chur ar bhunstruchtúr na Gaeltachta trí sholáthar uisce agus saor-áidí séarachais a chur ar fáil, saoráidí calaíochta a fheabhsú, bóithre a dheisiú agus mar sin de.  Le cúpla bliain anuas ní raibh ar mo chumas, de bharr na géar-chéime airgeadais, ach suim bheag a chur ar fáil do bhóithre: is breá liom go bhfuil ar mo chumas i mbliana an tsuim sin a mhéadú go suntasach agus tá liosta, in <Col N="1381" /> ord tosaíochta, de bhóithre a bhfuil obair de dhíth go géar orthu á ullmhú ag mo Roinnse faoi láthair agus meastacháin chostais iarrtha ar na comhairlí contae cuí.  Tá súil agam gur gearr anois go mbeidh an t-eolas uile agam i gcaoi go mbeidh ar mo chumas na deontais a cheadú.  Tá súil agam go mbeimid ábalta é sin a dhéanamh roimh dheireadh na míosa seo.  Braitheann sé ar chomh luath agus a thagann na meastacháin ó na comhairlí contae.  Tugtar cúnamh freisin chun hallaí pobail a thógáil agus a chóiriú agus áiseanna chaitheamh aimsire ar nós páirceanna peile, pinniúir liathróid láimhe, cúirteanna leadóige agus cispheile a sholáthar &mdash; rud a chuireann, ar ndóigh, leis na saoráidí sóisialacha sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Toole</P>
    <P>Glactar leis go coitianta go mbíonn tionchar nach beag ag comharchumainn i bhforbairt iomlán na gceantar ina mbíonn siad ag gníomhú ach iad bheith ag feidh-miú go héifeachtach, ar ndóigh.  Cuireadh cúnamh speisialta ar fáil do chomharchumainn áirithe cúpla bliain ó shin agus d'éirigh lena bhformhór sin dul chun cinn nach beag a dhéanamh dá bharr sin.  Bhí ar na comharchumainn sin scaireanna breise a bhailiú mar chionúireacht áitiúil den phacáiste tarrthála agus léirigh na pobail éagsúla a dtacaíocht dá gcomhar-chumainn trín mbealach inar infheistigh siad airgead breise i scaireanna.  Ní éir-eóidh le comharchumann ar bith mura mbíonn tacaíocht láidir aige ón bpobal agus is dá bharr sin atá dualgas leagtha agam ar na comharchumainn suim áirithe mar scaireanna breise a bhailiú gach bliain d'fhonn an deontas reachtála uasta a thuilleamh.  Is ar an mbealach seo, le tacaíocht leanúnach ó mhuintir an cheantair, is fearr a bheifear in ann dul chun cinn a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Faoi scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge tugtar deis do dhaoine óga, nach as an nGaeltacht iad, tréimhse a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht áit a mbíonn deis acu teacht isteach ar bhlas agus líofacht nádúrtha na Gaeilge trína gcaidreamh le <Col N="1382" /> cainteoirí dúchais.  Íoctar deontais díreach le mná tí Gaeltachta a mbíonn foghl-aimeoirí aitheanta ar iostas acu &mdash; rud a chuireann lena dteacht isteach, ar ndóigh.  Anuraidh d'fhreastail os cionn 15,600 dalta ar chúrsaí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus rinne 1,340 dalta eile freastal ar chúrsaí Gaeilge i gColáistí sean-bhunaithe lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tá an deontas a íoctar faoin scéim méadaithe agam i mbliana go dtí £3.10 in aghaidh an lae do gach dalta nó suas go £74.40 don ghnáthchúrsa.  Is eol dom go gcuirfeadh na mná tí fáilte roimh mhéadú níos mó fós ach caithfear a aithint go bhfuil géarchéim airgeadais ann agus nach bhfuil sa deontas a íocann mo Roinnse ach cuid den teacht isteach a bhíonn ag dul dóibh i leith na bhfoghlaimeóirí.  Is as na táillí a ghearrann údaráis na gcoláistí Gaeilge ar thuismitheoirí na ndaltaí a thagann an chuid eile den teacht isteach. Tá soláthar £1,170,000 á chur ar fáil i mbliana chun freastal ar an scéim agus ar ndóigh is le teaghlaigh Ghaeltachta a íocfar formhór mór an airgead sin.</P>
    <P>Bíonn cuid de na cúrsaí níos fearr ná a chéile, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh ar mo chumas cuairt a thabhairt ar choláistí i rith an tsamhraidh féachaint an féidir iad a fheabhsú in aon tslí.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge, is scéim sean-bhunaithe í seo chun muintir na Gaeltachta a spreagadh leis an nGaeilge líofa shaibhir atá acu a thabhairt dá gcuid páistí ionas go gcoinneófar an teanga beo bríomhar i measc bunadh óg na Gaeltachta.  Cuireann oifigigh mo Roinne agallamh ar ós cionn 9,000 páiste gach bliain i mbeagnach 200 scoil ar fud na Gaeltachta agus ar a himeall.  Is oth liom a rá go mbíonn titim bheag le haithn-eachtáil ó thráth go chéile sa líon daltaí a thuilleann an deontas seo agus ba mhaith liom an deis seo a thapú chun a iarraidh ar thuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta gan seod seo na teanga a cheilt ar a bpáistí: is trí labhairt na teanga sa teaglach agus sa phobal a chinnteofar go mairfidh an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, áit a mbeidh sí mar fhoinse as a dtarraingeoidh daoine díograsacha ar fud na tíre meanma agus misneach chun leanúint dá n-iarrachtaí ar mhaithe leis an teanga.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> Táimid uile buíoch do mhúinteoirí scoile a chaitheann díogras agus dúthracht le forbairt na teanga sna scoileanna Gaeltachta ach, mura bhfuil a gcion á dhéanamh ag na tuismitheoirí ar leac an teallaigh, ní féidir a bheith ag súil go mbeidh an líofacht ag na páistí a chuirfidh ar a gcumas siúd an teanga a thabhairt don chéad ghlúin eile.</P>
    <P>Is rud tábhachtach é go mbeadh nuachtán tarraingteach Gaeilge ar fáil agus is ar an gcúis sin atá airgead mór á chur ar fáil ag mo Roinnse don nuachtán seacht-ainiúil <i>Anois.</i> Tá teorainn, ar ndóigh, leis an gcúnamh gur féidir leis an Stát a chur ar fáil d'aon chuspóir dá fheabhas é.  Mea-bhraím arís do phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta a riachtanaí atá sé go dtabharfaí tacaíocht leanúnach do <i>Anois</i> trína cheannach gach seachtain.  Mura mbíonn díol maith ar nuachtán bíonn sé níos deacra air fógraí a mhealladh agus ar ndóigh is cuid bhunúsach d'ioncam aon nuachtán an chuid sin de a thagann ó fhógróirí.</P>
    <P>Tá cúnamh ar fáil ó mo Roinnse freisin do thréimhseacháin áirithe Ghaeilge, mar shampla <i>Comhar, Feasta, Deirdre, An tUltach, Agus, An Sagart, An Gael Óg, Tír na nÓg</i> agus <i>An Timire.</i></P>
    <P>Tá an Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge 1983-1986 a d'ullmhaigh Bord na Gaeilge sa bhliain dheiridh anois dá théarma gníomhaíochta agus táthar tosaithe ar an gcéad phlean eile don tréimhse 1987 go 1990 a ullmhú.  Léiríonn na tuar-ascálacha don chéad dhá bhliain den phlean &mdash; tá an tuarascáil don tríú bliain á hullmhú faoi láthair &mdash; gur baineadh amach cuid mhaith de na spriocanna a sonraíodh do na blianta sin.  Is cosúil nár éirigh le Ranna agus Comhlachtaí áirithe Stáit a gcion féin a dhéanamh i ndáil leis na spriocanna teoranta a sonraíodh dóibh don chéad bhliain den phlean.  Is den riachtanas é go mbeadh socruithe sásúla i bhfeidhm san earnáil phoiblí, ar a n-áirítear Ranna Rialtais, comhlachtaí Stáit, údaráis áitiúla agus a leithéidí, chun seirbhís chothrom trí Ghaeilge a thabhairt do gach duine a bheadh á lorg agus go mbeadh sé soiléir dóibh go gcuirfear <Col N="1384" /> an tseirbhís sin ar fáil le fonn agus le fáilte.  Is maith liom gur léirigh an tuarascáil don dara bliain den phlean gur tháinig feabhas ar na cúrsaí seo agus tá súil agam gur fearr fós a bheidh an scéal sa tuarascáil don tríú bliain.</P>
    <P>Tá faitíos orm, áfach, dá ainneoin sin uile, nach bhfuil freastal trí Ghaeilge ón Stát chomh sásúil agus ba chóir dó a bheith agus go bhfuil fadhb mhór ann i gcás na Gaeltachta.  Mura bhfeictear do mhuintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil oifigigh de chuid an Stáit dáiríre faoin nGaeilge, agus go bhfuil meas acu uirthi, is beag fonn a bheidh orthu a dteanga dhúchais a úsáid agus a chaomhnú.  B'fhacthas dom anuraidh nár mhiste an bhunfhadhb faoi sheirbhísí trí Ghaeilge do phobal na Gaeltachta a ionsaí ar an leibhéal logánta agus dá bhrí sin bhunaigh mé dhá choiste faoi chathaoirleach mo Roinne-se, ceann do Ghaeltacht na Gaillimhe agus ceann do Ghaeltacht Chiarraí chun:</P>
    <P>1.  a fháil amach cé chomh fada atá freastal trí Ghaeilge á dhéanamh ag an earnáil phoiblí ar an nGaeltacht, agus</P>
    <P>2.  slite a aimsiú leis an staid sin a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Tá an dá choiste sin, ar a bhfuil ionadaithe ó na heagraíochtaí poiblí is mó a mbíonn baint acu leis an nGaeltacht, i mbun oibre ó mhí na Samhna seo caite agus tuigim go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh acu.  Tá i gceist agam coiste eile do Ghaeltacht Dhún na nGall a bhunú go luath.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh béim ar leith sa Phlean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge ar thábhacht na teilifíse i gcur chun cinn na teanga.  Glactar leis go coitianta go bhfuil gá le méadú mór ar líon na gcláracha Gaeilge ar an teilifís agus cé go bhfuil feabhas éigin le sonrú le bliain anuas tá gá le cláracha den uile chineál thar an raon spéise atá ag an bpobal.  Tá an cheist sin ag déanamh tinnis dom le fada agus tar éis dom an scéal a phlé leis an Aire Cumarsáide shocraíomar ar mheitheal beag oibre a bhunú chun na fadhbanna a chíoradh agus moltaí a dhéanamh maidir leis na slite ina bhféadfar réiteach a fháil <Col N="1385" /> orthu.  Tá oifigeach sinsearach ó mo Roinnse mar chathaoirleach ar an meitheal agus tá ionadaithe uirthi freisin ón Roinn Cumarsáide, ó RTÉ agus ó Bhord na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is as Ciste na Gaeilge a chuirtear cúnamh Stáit ar fáil do Bhord na Gaeilge agus do na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge &mdash; Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Gael-Linn, Conradh na Gaeilge, An tOireachtas, Cumann na bhFiann, An Comhlachas Náisiúnta Drámaíochta, agus do Bhord na Leabhar Gaeilge, Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe, Amharclann Ghaoth Dobhair agus an Gael-Acadamh. Tá áthas orm gur éirigh liom an soláthar sa Chiste a mhéadú i mbliana &mdash; rud a chuir ar mo chumas breis agus 6 faoin gcéad a chur leis an gcúnamh do Bhord na Gaeilge i gcomparáid leis an méid a fuair siad i 1985.</P>
    <P>Tá £170,000 á chur ar fáil i mbliana do Bhord na Leabhar Gaeilge &mdash; méadú de bhreis ar 13 faoin gcéad ar bhunsoláthar na bliana seo caite ach is cosúil go bhfuil díomá ar fhoilsitheoirí áirithe faoin tsuim atá curtha ar leataobh dóibh ag an mbord. Ní foláir do gach foilsitheoir rogha a dhéanamh i dtaobh na leabhair a fhoilseoidh sé ag cur san áireamh an soláthar airgid atá ar fáil dó.  Tá súil agam gur leabhair d'ard-chaighdeán a bheidh á bhfoilsiú dá bharr sin.  Ba mhaith liom go dtuigfí go soiléir nach mbeidh ar mo chumas cur leis an soláthar £170,000 don bhord i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Níl i gceist agam mórán a rá faoin gComhchoiste Oireachtais don Ghaeilge anocht.  Tá sé i mbun oibre agus tá dhá thuarascáil faoi staid na Gaeilge sna Tithe foilsithe aige.  Tá moltaí ciallmhara sna tuarascálacha sin agus tá súil agam go gcuirfear i bhfeidhm iad.  Níl aon amhras ach go bhféadfadh Teachtaí Dála agus Seanadóirí cur go mór leis na hiarrachtaí atá á ndéanamh ar mhaithe leis an teanga tríd an dea-shampla a thabharfaí dá mbeadh níos mó Gaeilge in úsáid in imeachtaí agus in obair na Dála agus an tSeanaid.</P>
    <P>Is le muintir na hÉireann uile an Ghaeilge agus is fíor a rá go bhfuil a bhformhór báúil léi.  Is gá go mbeadh stádas fiúntach, feiceálach ag an teanga i <Col N="1386" /> ngnáthshaol na tíre agus tá obair mhór le déanamh fós chun an staid sin a bhaint amach.  Tá sé mar nós sa tír seo, faraor, an milleán a chur ar an Rialtas, ar an gcóras oideachais nóar institiúid éigin eile má bhíonn ag teip orainn an dul chun cinn a raibh súil leis a dhéanamh.  Is eol dom, ar ndóigh, go bhfuil tacaíocht na ndreamanna sin uile agus tuilleadh nach iad de dhíth ach is é fírinne an scéil go bhféadfadh go leor daoine níos mó a dhéanamh ar bhonn pearsanta dá dtogródh siad.  Tá súil agam gur féidir brath orainne sa Teach seo chun an dea-shampla i ndáil le húsáid na Gaeilge a thabhairt do mhuintir na hÉireann agus iarraim ar an Teach glacadh leis an Meastachán seo mar chabhair chun leas na Gaeilge agus leas na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is maith liom go bhfuil an deis seo agam chun nbeagáinín cainte a dhéanamh anseo anocht faoi na Meastacháin seo ar Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Is é an trua é go gcaithfimid teacht isteach anseo an t-am seo den oíche, Tá mé cinnte dá mbeadh sé níos luaithe sa ló go mbeadh fonn níos fearr ar dhaoine maidir le cibé rud a bheadh le rá acu.  Tá cuid mhaith den mhéid atá ag an Aire agus caithfimid bheith sásta leis ach tá cuid mhór de nach bhfuil sásúil agus tiocfaidh mé ar ais arís a maidir le cuid de na rudaí ba mhaith liom a rá faoi na cúrsaí sin.  I leith an méid atá ráite aige faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta, beidh mé ag caint arís ar an ábhar sin ach ba mhaith liom tagairt ag an bpointe seo do rud atá ráite ag an Aire faoi fheirmeoireacht éisc.  Is maith liom go bhfuil an fhorbairt sin ag dul chun cinn ach sílim gur ceart dúinn foláireamh a thabhairt anseo agus a bheith cúramach. Bíonn amhras orm nuair a fheicim comhlachtaí móra atá fostaithe ag dul i mbun oibre den chineál seo.  Dúirt mé seo sna focla a bhí le rá agam faoin Mheastachán i dtaobh na hiascaireachta. Ba mhaith liomsa a bheith cinnte san fhorbairt seo gur ag muintir na Gaeltachta a bheidh cibé buntáiste a thiocfaidh as an fhorbairt.  Má leagtar an obair amach i gceart, má bhíonn an phleanáil i gceart anseo sílim go bhfuil caoi ann le <Col N="1387" /> cuid mhaith a dhéanamh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta atá lonnaithe thart ar na cóstaí.  Tá cuanta beaga sílim atá an-fhéiliúnach i gcóir na forbartha seo agus tá, ar ndóigh go leor airgid i gceist nuair a thugann duine faoin obair seo.  Tuigim go maith go bhfúil dainséar ann maidir leis an obair féine; d'fhéadfadh siad an méid éisc a bheadh acu a chailliúint in aon oíche amháin agus tá deacrachtaí den chinéal sin ann ach ba mhaith liomsa, nuair a bheadh an fhorbairt sin á déanamh go ndéanfaí cinnte de gurbh iad na feirmeoirí beaga thart ar an gcósta ag a mbeadh an buntáiste sin mar sílim go bhféadfaí go leor buntáiste a bhaint as seo le cur leis an dteacht isteach a bheadh acu ón mbeagán talún agus gur caoi é le feabhas a chur ar shaol na ndaoine sin sna Gaeltachtaí atá thart ar an gcósta agus, ar ndó, ar na hoileáin.</P>
      <P>Is maith liom a fheiceáil go bhfuil órduithe tugtha le tithe úra a thógáil agus le tithe úra a fheabhsú.  Thuig Roinn na Gaeltachta i gcónaí an tábhacht a bhí le tithe maithe a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus nach raibh muintir na Gaeltachta iad féin fuar ná fallsa nuair a ghlac siad leis na deontais sin agus gur fearr na tithe atá i gcuid is mó de na Gaeltachtaí ná mar atá in áit ar bith eile ar fud na tíre agus sílim, de bharr an obair mhaith a rinne Roinn na Gaeltachta leis na blianta anuas le feabhas a chur ar a gcuid tithe, gurb é sin an fáth go bhfuil an scéal mar atá sé.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach tá deacracht mór ann &mdash; tá mé cinnte go dtuigeann an tAire féin an scéal &mdash; sna rialacha a bhaineas anois le feabhas a chur ar thithe, is é sin, go bhfuil sé deacair conraitheoirí cláraithe a fháil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Níl mórán de na daoine sin le fáil agus tá fáth ar leith leis sin, mar nach mbíonn obair sheasta le fáil ag na conraitheoirí sna ceantair iargúlta.  Fágann sé sin nuair atá duine sa Ghaeltacht, agus go mór mhór muintir na n-oileán, ag iarraidh an bhuntáiste atá le fáil anois as na deontais breátha seo agus ag iarraidh úsáid a bhaint astu nach bhfuil siad in ann conraitheoirí cláraithe a fháil.  Ba cheart don Aire an cheist seo a bhreithniú agus í a chur os comhair an <Col N="1388" /> Rialtais agus eisceacht a dhéanamh i gcás na gceanntar iargúlta maidir leis an leagan amach atá ann anois ó thaobh cur isteach ar na deontais seo.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh tuigimid uilig an fáth a tugadh isteach an riail seo.  Tá a fhios againn go raibh daoine a bhí ag iarraidh an dá thrá a fhreastal.  Bhí siad ag tarraingt airgid ar bhealaí eile agus ansin ag obair.  D'aontóinn go bhfuil gá leis an riail seo ach sílim nach mbíonn an scéal chomh dona sna ceantair iargúlta mar nach mbíonn mórán oibre ar siúl agus a bhíonn sna bailte móra agus in áiteacha eile agus, dá bhrí sin, sílim go bhfuil cás an-láidir gur féidir a dhéanamh leis an scéim sin a atheagrú ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta agus go mór mhór muintir na n-oileán.</P>
    <P>D'aontóinn leis an Aire nuair adeir sé go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta ag na comharchumainn leis na blianta beaga anuas le misneach a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus le cuidiú leo dul i mbun oibre ar mhaithe leo féin.  Tá treoir tugtha acu ar fud na Gaeltachta uilig agus táimid go léir buíoch díobh agus bródúil as an méid atá déanta acu.</P>
    <P>San riail sin a thug Roinn na Gaeltachta isteach maidir le scaireanna breise a fháil, arís bíonn deacracht sna ceantair seo na scaireanna breise a fháil mar an chuid is mó de na daoine sna Gaeltachtaí beidh siad ag tarraingt airgid ón Roinn Leasa Shóisialaigh agus ní bhíonn teacht isteach ró-mhór acu.  Bheadh sé deacair acu scaireanna a thógáil agus sílim nach ceart a bheith ró-dhian maidir leis an chuid sin den riail maidir le scaireanna breise a chur ar fáil.  Dá mbeadh sé sásta, cuirfimid i gcás, suim bheag airgid a chur ar fáil, ba mhór an chabhair í sin agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh daoine a bheadh sásta an rud sin a dhéanamh ach nach mbeimís ag iarraidh scaireanna ró-ard.</P>
    <P>Anois, ó thaobh na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge de, tá na scéimeanna seo an-mhaith. Tugann sé caoi do na páistí nach mbíonn deis acu Gaeilge na Gaeltachta a chloisteáil agus feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge arís.  Is mór iad na buntáistí ata sa scéim seo.</P>
    <P>Go minic ní bhíonn smacht mar ba cheart maidir le cuid de na cúrsaí seo.  Tá <Col N="1389" /> a fhios agam go dtuigeann an Roinn é sin go rí-mhaith agus go dtuigeann an tAire é sin go rí-mhaith chomh maith.  Chuala mé &mdash; agus níl mé cinnte de seo &mdash; nach mbíonn an chigireacht chomh dian agus a bhíodh sé san am atá caite maidir len a bheith cinnte de go bhfuil an rud ceart á dhéanamh i gcaoi go mbeadh an buntáiste ceart á bhaint as na cúrsaí.  Níl a fhios agam.  Níl ansin ach rud a chuala mé. B'fhéidir go dtuigeann an tAire féin agus a Roinn na cúrsaí agus ó tharla gur cuireadh an rud sin os mo chomhair, sílim go bhfuil sé de cheart agam é a lua ar na Meastacháin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na tréimhseacháin, is é an trua nach bhfuil níos mó le fáil ar fud na Gaeltachta, agus mar a luaigh mé anseo anuraidh, níl mé lánsásta go bhfuil mórán buntáiste le <i>Anois</i> mar pháipéar do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Ní caitheamh anuas ar dhuine ar bith atá mé nuair a deirim é sin.  Ní shílim gur féidir é a chur i gcomparáid le cuid de na hirisí a bhí le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta roimhe seo agus níl mé sásta leis an leagan amach atá air ná leis an gcaoi a chuireann sé nuacht os comhair an phobail.  Tá siad ag iarraidh aithris a dhéanamh ar na páipéir Dhomhnaigh agus níl a fhios agam cén tairbhe atá sna cúrsaí sin agus ní shílim go bhfuil sé ag cur le díolachán an pháipéir féin.</P>
    <P>Cuirim an cheist arís a chuir mé cheana, an é an Domhnach an lá is fearr leis an bpáipéar sin a chur amach?  Mar chuile dhuine a cheannaíonn páipéar ar an Domhnach tig leis ceithre cinn a cheannach i mBéarla anois, is é sin dá chuid féin agus an té a bhfuil suim aige i gcuid den &mdash; ba mhaith liom focal eile a úsáid ach is dócha nach focal parlaiminte é &mdash; stuif a thagann isteach chugainn ó áiteacha eile.  Tá daoine a cheannaíonn é sin chomh maith agus fágann sé sin go gcaitheann siad £3 nó £4 ar an Domhnach ag ceannach páipéar agus gur beag suime a bhéas acu, b'fhéidir, i bpáipéir eile a cheannach agus tá a fhios againn go gceannódh daoine a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge an páipéar, ach an iad san na daoine a bhfuil sinne ag iarraidh teacht orthu?  Ba mhaith liomsa go mbeimís ag trácht ar dhaoine, b'fhéidir, nach gceann-aíonn páipéar bith i nGaeilge de <Col N="1390" /> ghnáth agus a bheadh ag iarraidh buntáiste éigin a bhaint as páipéar i nGaeilge le feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.  Sílim go mba cheart dom an cheist a scrúdú faoi dháileadh páipéar ar an nDomhnach, go m'fhearr an ceannach a bheadh air dá mbeadh sé á dháileadh lá éigin eile den tseachtain, b'fhéidir i lár na seachtaine.</P>
    <P>Tréaslaímíd uilig le Bord na Gaeilge san obair atá ar siúl acu.  Sílim go bhfuil lán dairíreacht ag baint len a gcuid oibre, go bhfuil fios a ngnóthaí acu agus, cé gur mhaith leo níos mó airgid a bheith acu len a gcuid oibre a chur chun tosaigh, san am céanna caithfimíd a bheith sásta go bhfuil dul chun cinn maith déanta acu agus go bfuil siad ag tabhairt faoi seans a thabhairt do dhaoine a thuiscint cén tábhacht atá le Gaeilge agus cén chaoi ar cheart dóibh feiceáil le úsáid a bhaint as Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an tAire comhchoiste atá bunaithe le scéal na teilifíse agus cláracha Gaeilge a fhiosrú.  Ba cheart dúinn uilig fáiltiú roimh choiste den chineál sin. Táimid ag caint le blianta fáda faoin gcaoi a bhfuil cláracha teilifíse ag dul amach agus gan aird ar bith acu ar Ghaeilge agus ár gcultúr.  Má bhíonn tionchar ar bith ag an gcoiste seo ar na cúrsaí sin agus má éiríonn leo feabhas ar bith a chur ar chúrsaí, is dul chun cinn a bheidh ann agus beimíd ag súil go bhfeicfimíd an dul chun cinn ar mhaith linn a fheiceáil maidir le níos mó cláracha a bheith i nGaeilge agus níos mó aitheantais á thabhairt don chultúr. Tá a fhios againn, ar ndóigh go bhfuil atheagrú déanta le gairid ar fhoireann RTÉ féin, na foirne atá ag plé le cláracha agus mar sin de, agus bheimís ag súil nuair a bheidh siad scáthamh eile in a bpostanna go m'fhéidir go ndíreoidís a n-n-aghaidhthe ar an scéal seo agus go mbeadh, mar a dúirt mé an feabhas a ba mhaith linn a fheiceáil ansin.</P>
    <P>Bímíd ag caint go minic ar theilifís Ghaeltachta a chur ar bun.  Is dóigh liom nach bhfuil a fhios againn go baileach cén costas a bheadh ag baint len a leithéid sin no cén chaoi a b'fhearr an teilifís Ghaeltachta a chur ar bun.  Ach, bhí an staid chéanna ann nuair a bhí Raidio na Gaeltachta á chur ar bun.  D'éirigh go han-mhaith le Raidio na Gaeltachta <Col N="1391" /> agus tréaslaimíd leo agus is breá liom a fheiceáil go bhfuil uaireanta craolacháin breise acu anois agus go bhfuil éisteacht i bfad níos fearr agus níos mó ag pobal na tíre uilig ar na cláracha breátha a chuireann siad os comhair an phobail. Tá, ar ndóigh, easpa foirne ar Raidio na Gaeltachta agus, cé gur mar sin atá an scéal, caithimíd a admháil go bhfuil obair an-mhaith á déanamh acu.  Thug sé na Gaeltachtaí go léir le chéile agus tá blas na Gaeltachta le fáil anois ar fud na tíre uilig i gcaitheamh an lae go léir mórán. Nuair atá na cláracha seo á réiteach ag Raidio na Gaeltachta sílim gur ceart cui-mhniú ar na deachrachtaí atá acu agus feiceáil le cibé tacaíocht is féidir a thabhairt dóibh len a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh chomh héifeachtach agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Os ag caint ar Raidio na Gaeltachta atáimid, tá sinne i gContae Mhaigh Eo fágtha le cuid Pháidín den mheáchan, mar is ghnáthach linn.  Le fada an lá taímid ag iarraidh go gcuirfí stáisiún ar bun in áit éigin i gContae Mhaigh Eo; ní raibh aon achrann faoin áit a mbeadh sé lonnaithe. Tá na Gaeltachtaí scaipthe i gContae Mhaigh Eo, níl éisteacht ro-mhaith go minic ar na cláracha ó Raidio na Gaeltachta i ngeall ar dheacrachtaí faoi leith ach bheimís ag súil nach mbeadh dear-mad déanta orainn ar fad maidir le stáisiún a chur ar fáil agus go bhfuil oiread ceart againne stáisiún a fháil agus atá ag Ciarraí agus áiteacha eile.  Tá pócaí beaga againn atá an-láidir agus sílim nach ceart an chluas bhodhar a thabhairt dúinn an t-am ar fad.  Anois, tiocfaidh mé go dtí an tÚdarás agus obair an Údaráis.  Obair iontach atá á déanamh acu agus ní thig linn a bheith sásta go bhfuil an tacaíocht atá tuillte acu, nó ar cheart a fháil ón Aire le fáil acu.  Nuair a bhí an tAire ag caint anseo anuraidh dúirt sé: &ldquo;Is í an aidhm atá agam mar Aire na Gaeltachta ná go mbeadh an tÚdarás ag gníomhú ar an mbealach is éifeachtaí agus is eacnamúla is féidir chun a gcuid dualgas a chomh-líonadh agus a ghníomhaíocht a chur i gcrích.&rdquo; Lean sé ar aghaidh ansin san óráid sin, ag cur síos ar na ceapacháin a bhí déanta aige agus deireann sé ansin níos faide síos san óráid: &ldquo;Mar is léir ó <Col N="1392" /> dhíospóireachtaí sa Teach seo ní gach uile dhuine a ghlacann leis go bhfuil structúr agus modhanna oibre an Údaráis gan locht.&rdquo; Is dócha go bhfeadfaí an rud céanna a rá faoi eagras eile.  Ag an am gcéanna ní ceart an chluas bhodhar a thabhairt do na tuairimí sin.  Leanann sé ar aghaidh ansin ag caint ar an méid ama atá caite ag an Údarás i mbun a gcuid oibre agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Ach tá an tAire féin ag tabhairt cluas bhodhar don Údarás.  Mar a dúirt mé, tá bród orainn uilig astu mar gheall ar an obair atá ar bun aca le postanna a chur ar fáil.  Tá na baill tofa agus foireann an Údaráis ag deánamh obair thar cion agus ní ceart dúinne, anseo, iad a fhágáil i gcaoi nach mbéidís in ann a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh chomh héifeachtach agus ba mhaith leo.</P>
    <P>Tuigimid uile na deacrachtaí atá ag Údarás na Gaeltachta postanna a chur ar fáil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Tá siad ag iarraidh tionnscail a thabhart isteach go dtí na háiteacha is iargúlta atá sa tír. Tá cúrsaí cumarsáide go dona, tá droch bhóithre le sárú.  Tionnsclaí ar bith a thagann isteach tá a fhios aige céard na deac-rachtaí a bheas os a chomhair.  Cé go bhfuil sé sin ag tarlú tá líon na bpostanna atá curtha ar fáil ag an Údarás ag dul i méid nuair atá eagrais eile agus comhlachtaí ag dul i léig.  Is mór an chreidiúint atá ag dul doibh dá bharr sin.  Nuair a tháinig an tÚdarás i gcomhacht bhí go leor rudaí le sárú acu.  Bhí comhlachtaí a bhí i dtrioblóid agus b'éigin dóibh cuid maith de na botúin a rinne Gaeltarra, ina n-am, a cheartú.  Éacht thar cuimse a bhí san obair a rinne siad, go mór mhór nuair a fheicimíd an droch-phoiblíocht a fuair siad.  Cuireadh cláracha scannalacha amach ar Theilifís Éireann a bhí ag cur méir ar an Údarás agus a bhí ag iarraidh a chur ina luí ar phobal na tíre go raibh rudaí bun os cionn san Údarás agus go raibh airgead Stáit á chur amú.  Níor chuidigh an tAire leis na cúrsaí ach chomh beag.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios ar léigh cuid de na hiriseóirí seo an tuarascáil mhór fhada a chuir an comhchoiste Dála atá ag déanamh fiosrúcháin ar obair na mbord Stáit <Col N="1393" /> amach, ná ní raibh mórán díobh i láthair ag an bpreas agallamh an lá go raibh an tuarascáil seo á cur amach.  San ráiteas a chuir an cathaoirleach amach thosnaigh sé leis na focail &mdash; i mBéarla a bhí sé, agus ní locht ar bith é sin ar an gcathaoirleach nó ar an gcomhchoiste mar beidh leagan Gaeilge le fáil arís &mdash;&ldquo;This in-depth report on Gaeltarra/Údarás includes a review of activities since 1965.&rdquo;&ldquo;In-depth report&rdquo; a thugadh air.  Ceard é toradh an scéil?  Níorbh fhéidir a chruthú go raibh slad déanta ag duine ar bith san Údarás.  Sílim anois, go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar an Aire an cathaoirleach agus na baill eile a caitheadh den bhord sin a chur ar ais ina bpostanna arís agus na státseirbhísigh atá ansin le trí bliana a chur ar ais ina gcuid oifigí.  Le ainmneacha na ndaoine sin a ghlanadh i súilí an phobail tá sin tuillte acú, agus ba cheart go dtuigfeadh an tAire é sin.</P>
    <P>Ach caithfimid an cheist a chur, an bhfuil an tAire i ndáiríre maidir leis an Údarás?  An bhfuil suim aige postanna a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht?  Céard tá á gcoinneáil siar ó bhord lánaimsearach a thoghadh agus a bheidh ag feidhmiú leis na baill tofa a bhí sna toghacháin don Údarás sin?  Cén chaoi gur féidir leis an bpríomhfheidhmeannach nó foireann an Údaráis aon mhuinín a bheith acu as Aire nach bhfuil sásta baill an bhoird a thoghadh ach ar feadh cúpla mí?  An é go bhfuil amhras air i gcónaí go bhfuil airgead ag dul amú san Údarás nó an é nach dtig leis a pháirtí féin a shásamh?  Rud níos measa ná sin, tá an t-airgead atá ag teastáil go géar ón Údarás le postanna a chur ar fáil á choinneáil uathu.  Tá sé ráite go poiblí go bhfuil os cionn sé chéad postanna breise ag fanacht le hairgead ón Aire agus ón Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Mar atá ráite cheana agam, tá sé deacair go leor postanna a chur ar fáil ach is é an donas é nuair nach bhfuil an tAire a bhfuil cúram na Gaeltachta air sásta áird ar bith a thabhairt ar a gcuid iarratas leis na postanna seo a chur ar fáil.  Anois, tá sé ráite anseo aige go dtuigeann sé go bhfuil deacrachtaí ag an Údarás ach go bhfuil sé i gceist aige na cúrsaí sin a fheabhsú gan mhoill.  Táimid ag éisteacht leis sin le sé mhí agus níor tharla sé go fóill. <Col N="1394" /> Is é an chaoi a bhfuil sé faoi láthair go bhfuil an tÚdarás i gcruachás.  Tá an t-airgead ag teastáil go géar uathu.  Tá tograí caillte acu agus caillfear a thuilleadh mura ndéanfaidh an tAire a chion féin leis an scéal a leigheas.  Níl sé ceart nó cóir go mbeadh an tÚdarás fágtha gan an cuidiú atá ag teastáil uathu ina gcuid oibre.</P>
    <P>Séard a tharlós go mbeidh cuid den aos óg atá ag iarraidh postanna anois imeasc an 60,000 go bhfuil an tír fágtha acu agus go mbeadh siad ar shráideanna Londain agus Mheiriceá.  Maidir le saol shóisialta na Gaeltachta beidh hallaí agus páirceanna peile gur tugadh deontais lena dtógáil folamh diomhaoin agus fóirne peile agus iománaíochta fágtha i gcaoi nach mbeidh siad in ann páirt a ghlacadh sna comórtais a ghlac siad páirt iontu le fada.  Beidh máithreacha agus aithreacha na Gaeltachta ag fanacht le fear an phoist ag dúil le litir in áit a bheith ag cur fáilte roimh a gclann féin.</P>
    <P>Tá cúrsaí sách dona sna Gaeltachtaí i láthair na huaire ó thaobh an chaoi a bhfuil na daoine á roghnú maidir le híocaíocht ón Roinn Leasa Shóisialaigh agus is é an chaoi a bhfuil sé duine ar bith atá ag iarraidh cur ar a shon féin ar bhealach ar bith tá na &ldquo;gaugers&rdquo;, mar a thugann siad orthu, anuas sa mhullach orthu.  Má tá cúpla beithíoch aige, má tá currach aige, má tá bád beag aige, má tá sé ag iarraidh beagán a dhéanamh ar thurasóireacht ní bheidh sé i bhfad go dtí go mbeidh na daoine seo sa mhullach air. Níl misneach ar bith fágtha ag muintir na Gaeltachta tada a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leo féin de bharr cuid de na daoine seo. Sílim gur mó an aird atá ag an Rialtas seo ar bheith ag spaisteoireacht ar fud na tíre ag caint ar cholscaradh agus coiscíní do dhaoine óga agus amaidí nach bhfuil baint ar bith acu le cultúr nó le saol na tíre seo.  Is fearr go mór go mbeadh feachtas le rud eigin fiúntach a dhéanamh a ardódh an misneach agus an croí agus an spiorad a theastódh anois leis an tír seo a tharraingt as an staid ina bhfuil sí.</P>
    <P>Caithfimid ceist a chur anseo faoi cá seasaimid maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  Glacaimid uile leis go bhfuil obair an-mhaith <Col N="1395" /> á déanamh ag Bord na Gaeilge, ag na heagrais dheonacha ar fad ach an bhfuil cúrsaí ag trá nó an bhfuilimid ag déanamh aon dul chun cinn maidir leis an nGaeilge a chur chun tosaigh.  Tá daoine a déarfadh i láthair na huaire, cuirimid i gcás, nach bhfuil an díograis céanna ag baint le múineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna is a bhíodh san am atá caite.  Cé go bhfuilimid uile lánsásta leis an obair atá á déanamh sna scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha agus sna naonraí, sílim nach bhfuil caighdeán na Gaeilge nó, mar adúirt mé, an díograis chéanna i múineadh na Gaeilge agus a bhíodh san am atá caite.  Ar chúrsaí don dara leibhéal níl bliain a théann thart nach bhfuil cuid de na scoileanna a bhíodh ag plé le Gaeilge ag druidim.  I mo dháilcheantar féin tá an rud atá ag tarlú maidir le Coláiste Mhuire i dTuar Mhic Éadaigh.  Tuigeann chuile dhuine an obair iontach a rinne an coláiste sin ar feadh na mblianta agus ba mhór an trua é dá leigfeadh an Rialtas don choláiste sin druidim.  Beimid ag súil go mbeidh an tAire agus Roinn na Gaeltachta sásta gach tacaíocht gur féidir leo a thabhairt lena choinneáil slán.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge tá bród orm a rá go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh ag an gcomhchoiste sin agus go raibh sé d'onóir agam féin bheith tofa mar chathaoirleach air. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis na baill atá ag obair go dúthrachtach ag iarraidh dul chun cinn na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais agus i dtimpeallacht Thithe an Oireachtais.  Ba mhaith liom chomh maith mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis an gCeann Chomhairle i ngeall ar an chuidiú atá sé ag tabhairt dúinn maidir le seomraí a chur ar fáil agus, le cúpla lá, fuaireamar amach go mbeidh seomra anois a bheidh feistithe agus a bheidh leagtha amach le cuidiú le baill an dá Thí anseo teacht isteach agus feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge agus Gaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Sin dul chun cinn agus táimid buíoch i ngeall air sin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom chomh maith mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh le rúnaí an chomhchoiste, duine de bhall Roinn na Gaeltachta, <Col N="1396" /> agus bhí an t-ádh orainn go bhfuaireamar an fear sin agus ní thiocfadh linn duine níos dúthrachtaí nó níos fearr a fháil i gcóir na hoibre.  Maidir le forbairt na Gaeltachta sílim go bhfuil gá anois agus feasta ár n-aighthe a dhíriú ar ár acmhainní nadúrtha.  Molaim an obair atá a déanamh ag an Údarás sna cúrsaí seo.  Tá foireann an-mhaith ansin.  Tuigeann na daoine atá tofa cúrsaí na Gaeltachta, céard a theastaionn ón Ghaeltacht, céard ba chóir a dhéanamh maidir leis an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt, agus tá an t-ádh linn go bhfuil ard-fheidh-meannach cáilithe, ciallmhar, gníomhach ag tabhairt treorach.  Tá foireann mhaith oibre faoi a thuigeann céard tá ag teastáil agus sílim má fhaigheann siad an tacaíocht atá tuillte acu go bhfeicimid dul chun cinn i bhfad níos fearr.</P>
    <P>Níl mé sásta, mar tá ráite agam cheana agus ní maith liom bheith ag caitheamh anuas ar dhuine ar bith, ach ó tháinig an tAire seo isteach sílim gurb é an chéad chloch ar a phaidrín bheith go síorraí ag dul i ngleic leis an Údarás.  Níl sé sin sásúil agus ní ceart a leithéid a bheith ag tarlú.  Séard a theastaíonn i láthair na huaire go mbeadh brí agus misneach á dtabhairt don obair atá á déanamh ag an Údarás agus go dtuigfeadh muintir na Gaeltachta iad féin go bhfuil lán tacaíocht á fháil ag an Údarás ón Aire.  Tá an Ghaeltacht ag brath ar obair an Údaráis agus muna bhfaigheann siad an tacaíocht atá túillte acu ní fheicfimid an dul chun cinn gur mhaith linn a fheicéail.</P>
    <P>Is breá linn go bhfuil deireadh leis an droch-mheas a bhí á chaitheamh ar an Údarás agus nach féidir, san tuarascáil seo, an tuarascáil mhór, fhada seo, iad a cháineadh ar bealach ar bith.  Níl ag teastáil anois ach go dtabharfadh an tAire agus an Rialtas an t-airgead a theastaíonn go géar uathu leis na postanna a bhfuil gá leo sa Ghaeltacht a chur ar fáil agus go n-inséodh an tAire é féin, go poiblí, go bhfuil muinín aige as an Údarás agus go bhfuil sé sásta go bhfuil gach uile short ceart san Údarás agus go bhfeicimíd é ag gníomh go héifeachtach mar ba mhaith linn uilig anseo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is é an Meastachán seo <Col N="1397" /> atá á chur i láthair ag an Aire tráthnóna an Meastachán is airde do Roinn na Gaeltachta a cuireadh i láthair ó tháining mise anseo ceithre nó cúig bliana ó shin agus pé tuairim a bhíonn ag duine ar bith eile, sílim go dteaspáineann sé dáiríreacht an Aire agus dáiríreacht an Rialtais i leith na Gaeltachta agus fosta go léiríonn an tAire 'na oráid an dul chun cinn atá déanta san Ghaeltacht le bliain anuas agus le ceithre no cúig bliana anuas.  Ní aontaím ar chor ar bith le daoine a deir nach bhfuil an tAire ná an Rialtas i ndáiríre i leith na Gaeltachta ná na Gaeilge ná dul chun cinn san Ghaeltacht agus mar sin de.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thagair an Teachta Gallagher don chomhchoiste a bhfuil gach uile pháirtí nó beagnach gach uile pháirtí anseo páirteach ann agus ceann des na rudaí a thaitníonn liomsa agus mé ag freastal ar an gcomhchoiste sin ná an comhoibriú atá idir na Teachtaí agus na Seanadóirí atá in a mbaill den chomhchoiste seo.  Istigh san chomhchoiste sin nó sa Teach seo nó taobh amuigh de nuair a bhimid ag plé ceist na Gaeilge, nó nuair a bhíonn daoine istigh ag tabhairt fianaise tá an Ghaeilge ansin.  Tá sé mar pháirt de shaol na tíre seo; ní bhaineann sí le páirtí nó le dream ar bith agus táimid go léir i ndáiríre agus ag iarraidh ár ndícheall a dhéanamh. Sílim gur féidir an rud céanna a rá mar gheall ar gach Rialtas, go ndéanann siad a ndícheall ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeltacht agus leis an Ghaeilge agus nach bhfuil sé d'aidhm ná de chuspóir ag Aire ar bith ná ag Rialtas ar bith deireadh a chur leis an Ghaeilge nó leis an Ghaeltacht.  A mhalairt atá fíor ar fad agus ceann de na rudaí a luaigh an tAire in a óráid ná an dul chun cinn atá déanta san Ghaeltacht maidir le cúrsaí fostaíochta.  Ceart go leor, bhí deacrachtaí mór eacnamaíochta ann sa tír le deich mbliain agus le cúig bliain anuas agus tháinig laghdú ar fhostaíocht ar fúd na tire.  Ní raibh dífhostaíocht chomh hard ariamh agus atá sé i láthair na huaire, ach is féidir a mhalairt a rá maidir leis an Ghaeltacht, nach raibh an fhostaíocht ariamh chomh hard agus tá sé i láthair na huaire san Ghaeltacht agus gach bliain ó tháinig an Rialtas seo i gcomhacht tháining méadú ar an líon <Col N="1398" /> daoine atá fostaithe sa Ghaeltacht agus nach raibh a oiread fostaithe ariamh agus a bhí ann ag deireadh 1985.  Teaspáineann sé sin go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta atá i mbun forbairt eacnamaíochta san Ghaeltacht ag déanamh a gcuid oibre go maith.  Ní fhéadfadh an tÚdarás é sin a dhéanamh ach amháin go gcuireann an Rialtas agus an tAire airgead ar fáil dóibh a chuireann ar a gcumas é sin a dhéanamh agus tá suim mhór airgid curtha ar fáil i mbliana arís.  Bhí áthas orm nuair a dúirt an tAire in a óráid go bhfuil gach aon dícheall á dhéanamh aige féin chun an fhadhb atá acu i láthair na h-uaire a réiteach. Dúirt sé go bhfuil súil aige go mbeidh réiteach ar an bhfadhb sin go hanluath. Ba mhaith liomsa é sin a fheiceáil fosta.</P>
    <P>Ó tháinig an tAire i mbun na Gaeltachta caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil dul chun cinn mór déanta maidir le cúrsaí fostaíochta.  Is dócha ceann de na rudaí is tábhachtaí a tharla ó tugadh isteach an Meastachán anuraidh ná an méadú mór atá ar dheontas tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus deontas feabhsucháin.  Cuireadh ardú ar an deontas tithíochta ó £2,000 go £3,000 agus tá deontas feabhsucháin do thithe sa Ghaeltacht anois chomh hard le £8,000 no £9,000, do mhéadu nó feabhas ar theach a tógadh roime 1940.  Is mór an cuidiu é sin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus tá lúcháir orm a rá go bhfuil na daoine i mo cheantar Gaeltachta féin i dTír Chonaill ag baint an-usáid as an deontas sin.  Ón eolas atá agam i láthair na huaire tá beagnach 300 iarratas curtha isteach ó Ghaeltacht Dhún na nGall ó thús na bliana ó ardaíodh an deontas agus tá mé cinnte go bhfuil an scéal amhlaidh sna Gaeltachtaí eile.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil £1 mhilliún sa bhreis curtha leis an méid airgid do thithe agus d'fheabhsú tithe i mbliana agus tá me cinnte mura leor é sin ag deireadh na bliana go mbeimid in ann tuilleadh a fháil chun freastail ar na daoine uilig a bhfuil iarratais curtha isteach acu.</P>
    <P>Tá scéimeanna feabhsucháin eile fosta agus sílim go bhfuil ardú mór ar an méid airgid a cuireadh ar fáil dóibh i mbliana, scéimeanna uisce agus séarachais san Ghaeltacht.  Tá siad seo an-tábhachtach <Col N="1399" /> agus tá siad ag dul ar aghaidh ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Bhi áthas orm i rith na bliana gur thug an tAire deontas fiúntach do scéim uisce i Leitir Mach an Bhaird sna Rossa.  Cé gur diúltíodh é ar dtús, nuair a rinneadh é a athscrúdú cuireadh deontas de £30,000 ar fáil.  Tá an scéim ar fad ag cosnú £400,000.  Ba mhór an cuidiú an deontas ó Roinn na Gaeltachta chun a chur ar fáil do suas le 200 teach.</P>
    <P>Feicim go bhfuil ardú ar an méid airgid atá curtha ar fáil do bhóithre sa Ghaeltacht. De bharr deacrachtaí eacnamaíochta le cúpla bliain ní raibh sé ró-ard ach tá deontas i bhfad níos airde i mbliana agus tá súil agam go rachaidh cuid den airgid sin, nuair a bheidh sé scrudaithe, do na daoine atá ag brath ar bhóithre isteach go dtí an áit in a bhfuil a gcuid móna.  Tá deacrachtaí móra annsin i láthair na huaire agus tá súil agam go mbeimid ábalta freastal orthu sin.  De bharr na droch-bhliana anuraidh agus an droch-gheimhridh tá droch-bhail ar na bóithre sin agus ón scrúdú atá á dhéanamh ag na cigirí i láthair na huaire tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann freastal ar chuid acu agus iad sin nach mbeimid in ann freastal orthu i mbliana tá mé cinnte go mbeidh an tAire anseo an bhliain seo chugainn arís chun freastal orthu.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, tá ardú ar an méid airgid a bheidh curtha ar fáil do hallaí pobail agus to aonaid mór sin agus inniu nó le cupla lá b'ábhar lúcháire dom go raibh an tAire ábalta deontas £15,000 a chur ar fáil do Chumann Lúthchleas Gaedheal i nDúnaibh fá choinne cuidiú leo as na costais atá le h-íoc acu as an obair bhreá atá déanta acu ar an ionad atá tógtha ansin acu le tamall anuas.  Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh lúcháir ar mhuintir na nDúnaibh an cuiidú sin a fháil.</P>
    <P>Fosta, tá méadú ar an méid airgid atá curtha ar fáil do na Coláistí Gaeilge agus nuair a bhí an Teachta Gallagher ag caint ar na Coláistí Gaeilge thall ansin bhí mé ag smaoineamh ar cheann de na scéalta a scríobh Pádraig Mac Piarais &mdash; agus is dócha gur léigh gach duine sa Teach é &mdash;<i>Eoinín na n-Ean</i> nach dtiocfadh an t-earrach go dtiocfadh na fáinleoga agus <Col N="1400" /> nuair a thiocfadh fáinleoga bhéadh an t-earrach ann.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le muintir na Gaeltachta, ní thagann an samhradh go dtagann na scoláirí, lucht foghlama na Gaeilge.  Bhí scata mór ansin anuraidh, sílim 15,000 aduirt an tAire.  Beidh áthas ar na mná tí go bhfuil ardú curtha ar a gcuid airgid i mbliana arís don dara bliain as a chéile.</P>
    <P>Sílim, mar sin féin go gcaithfimid bheith faichilleach maidir leis na daoine a ligimid go dtí na cúrsaí seo.  Sílim gur mhaith an rud é dá ndéanfaí béal-thriail nó go mbeadh scrúdú de chineál éigin déanta sul a dtéann siad go dtí an Ghaeltacht chun cinnte a dhéanamh de go mbainfidh siad tairbhe as na tréimhse a chaitheann siad ansin.  Is breá an rud go dtig scoláirí as gach Gaeltacht sa tír go dti an Ghaeltacht mar tugann sé deis dóibh eolas a chur ar an dteanga bheo ansin agus ar shaol agus ar chultúr agus air hraidisiún na Gaeltachta agus i mo cheantar féin &mdash; agus tá mé cinnte sna Gaeltachtaí eile &mdash; bíonn fáilte rompu gach uile bhliain.  I dTír Chonaill ní amháin go dtagann scoláirí chugainn ó Bhaile Atha Cliath agus páirteanna eile den tír ach fosta ó Thuaisceart Éireann agus, ar ndóigh, tá deacrachtaí ar leith ag na scoláirí atá ag freastal ar na scoileanna ansin, b'fhéidir, agus ní locht ar bith orthú féin é nach mbíonn an caighdeán Gaeilge chomh hard acu agus a bhíonn ag daoine as páirteanna eile den tír. B'fhéidir gur mar sin atá an scéal agus ba maith liom go ndéanfaí freastal orthu sin fosta.  B'fhéidir nach mbeifí ag súil le caighdeán chomh ard uathu chomh fada agus a bhíonn siad sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá an Ghaeltacht ag brath ar thurasóireacht agus sin an dream is mó i láthair na huaire a thugann airgead isteach, na scoláirí Gaeilge.  Ar ndóigh, bíonn fáilte roimh na turasóirí eile fosta as páirteanna eile den tír agus taobh amuigh den tír agus ba mhaith liom é a lua leis an Aire maidir le duine ar bith a bhfuil teach ósta sa Ghaeltacht aige anois agus atá ag iarraidh é a leathnú agus mar sin de go bhfuil deacrachtaí maidir le deontais.  Sílim an scéim deontas dheireanach a tugadh amach ansin anuraidh <Col N="1401" /> ag an Roinn Turasóireachta go raibh béim ar leith ar chuairteoirí a mhealladh isteach insan tír, cuairteoirí ón Mhór-Roinn agus ó Shasana agus ó áiteacha eile, agus sílim gur chotaigh sé sin deacrachtaí áirithe do Roinn na Gaeltachta ach tá súil agam go mbeidh siad ábalta an fhadhb sin a fhuascailt agus duine ar bith a bhfuil teach ósta aige sa Ghaeltacht agus atá ag iarraidh é a leathnú go mbeidh deontas le fáil aige chuige sin mar, i ndeireadh na dála, is é an rud a dheineann breis cuairteoirí sa Ghaeltacht ná airgead a thabhairt isteach sa cheantar agus fostaíochta chur ar fáil do na daoine óga agus dodhaoine eile.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt fosta do na nuachtáin Ghaeilge agus d'irisí Gaeilge atá anois le fáil ar fud na Gaeltachta, agus tá súil agam, ar fud na tíre gach uile Dhomhnach. Rinne an Teachta Gallagher pointe iontach suimiúil go mbíonn níos mó ná rogha amháin de pháipéar againn Dé Domhnaigh agus go mbíonn coimhlint níos mó ag <i>Anois</i> le cur suas leis.  Ach clúdaíonn siad imeachtaí an Tí seo agus na comhchoistí.  Tugann siad clúdach maith dúinn ó thaobh na nuachta de agus, chomh maith leis sin, tugann siad clúdach maith do nuacht ón nGaeltacht.  Ní chuimhin liom faoi leathanacha mar thagair an Teachta Gallagher dó ach ní shílim go bhfuil sé ag déanamh dochair ar bith don díoláchán mar na páipéir a chleachtaíonn é sin is iad is mó a dhíoltar sa tír seo agus i Sasana agus b'fhéidir nach droch rud ar bith do <i>Anois</i> aithris a dhéanamh orthu.</P>
    <P>Agus sin ráite agam, ba mhaith liom focal molta a thabhairt do pháipéar nái-siúnta eile, <i>The Irish Times.</i> Bíonn altanna acu gach uile sheactain ar a dtugtar <i>Tuarascáil.</i> Bíonn siad suimiúil.  Bíonn siad ilghnéitheach.  B'fhéidir nach n-aon-taimid leis na tuairimí a bhíonn á nochtadh acu.  Bíonn siad conspóideach ach sílim gu bhfuil siad ag déanamh freastail ar lucht labhartha agus lucht léite na Gaeilge agus tá creidiúint ag dul don fhoireann atá i mbun an ailt sin &ldquo;Tuarascáil&rdquo; san <i>Irish Times.</i>  Chomh maith leis sin, níor mhaith liom dearmad a dhéanahm de <i>Scéala Éireann</i> nó don phreas go ginearálta.  Léim féin gach ceann acu.  Ní dhéanaim idirdhealú.  Má tá alt acu i <Col N="1402" /> nGaeilge is fiú é a léamh agus bíonn altanna an-shuimiúla acu go minic sa tse-achtain agus sílim go bhfuil buíochas agus creidiúint ag dul dóibh fosta.</P>
    <P>Nuair atá mé ag caint ar na meáinchumarsáide, ar ndóigh, níor mhaith liom dearmad a dhéanamh de Raidio na Gaeltachta agus ó bhíomar anseo anuraidh tá siad ina dhiaidh breis ama a chur leis na huaireanta craolta.  Anois bíonn deis againn uile, más maith linn Nuacht an Lae a chloisteáil &mdash; muna bhfuil fonn orainn é a fháil ar Raidio Éireann &mdash; is féidir linn dul go dtí Raidio na Gaeltachta agus tá sé chomh maith le páipéar nuachta ar bith mar bíonn míreanna an-suimiúla acu ó thart ar a naoi a chlog ar maidin suas go dtí am lóin agus sílim gur céim ar aghaidh é sin na huaireanta craolta a leathnú.  Tá siad ag cur seirbhís mhaith ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta. Tá siad chomh maith le páipéar nuachta agus tá súil agam go mbeidh tacaíocht le fáil i gcónaí acu sa Teach seo.  Tá rud eile déanta acu, na ceantair Ghaeltachta a thabhairt le chéile.  Tá cuimhne agamsa, nuair a chuireadh Raidio na Gaeltachta ar bun, go mba dheacracht mhór ar dhuine as Tír Chonaill duine as Chiarraí a thuiscint agus b'fhéidir gur mar a chéile é do dhuine as Chonamara duine as Chiarraí ná as Tír Chonaill a thuiscint ach thug Raidio na Gaeltachta na Gaeltachtaí le chéile agus tuigimid uilig anois an teanga atá á labhairt sna Gaeltachtaí. B'fhéidir go bhfuil difríocht san mblas ach is mar an gcéanna an teanga agus sílim go bhfuil an-chreidiúint ag dul do Raidio na Gaeltachta as é sin a dhéanamh.  Tá lúcháir orm.  Ní raibh sé ar eolas agam go dtí gur chuala mé anseo anocht é go bhfuil meitheal oibre anois faoi oifigeach de chuid Roinn na Gaeltachta ag plé le clár-acha Gaeilge chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an dteilifís.</P>
    <P>De na meáinchumarsáide ar fad, sílim gurb í an teilifís an ceann is láidre agus an ceann is mó a bhfuil tionchar aici ní amháin ar shaol mhuintir na tíre i gcoit-inne ach ar shaol mhuintir na Gaeltachta fosta agus caithfidh mé a rá &mdash; agus aon-taím leis na cainteoirí a bhí romham &mdash;<Col N="1403" /> gur beag freastal ata á dhéanamh ag Tele-fís Éireann i láthair na huaire ar an nGaeilge ná ar an mhuintir a labhraíonn an Ghaeilge ach, tá súil agam, nuair a bheas obair an mheithil seo déanta acu, go mbeidh feabhas mór ar an scéal idir seo agus deireadh na bliana mar tá sé tábhachtach go dtabharfaí aitheantas agus a áit cheart don Ghaeilge ar an dteilifís.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh chúrsaí oideachais agus ceann de na comharthaí dóchais is mó a tharla le roinnt blianta anuas &mdash; agus tharla seo taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht &mdash; ná an uimhir de scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha a chuireadh ar bun agus atáthar le cur ar bun ar fud na tíre agus sílim go bhfuil coimhlimt mhór anseo i mBaile Átha</P>
    <P>Cliath agus go minic go gcaithfidh fanacht le dul isteach sna scoileanna seo agus is comhartha dóchais é go bhfuil fás agus borradh ag teacht ar an nGaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus go speisialta anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath agus in áiteacha eile ar fud na tíre.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh gach tacaíocht le fáil ón Rialtas seo agus ó gach Rialtas eile do na scoileanna seo agus do na páistí atá ag freastal orthu agus go mór mhór na múinteoirí atá ag teagasc iontu.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do scoileanna na Gaeltachta.  Tá deacrachtaí san Ghaeltacht i láthair na huaire agus san am a chuaigh thart ón taithí agus ón eolas a bhí agam féin ar na scoileanna seo bhí na páistí ag teacht isteach agus iad aonteangach, an Ghaeilge acu ón gcli-abhán, ach go minic anois san Ghaeltacht tig na páistí isteach agus iad dhátheangach. Go minic, de thairbhe daoine ag teacht isteach san cheantar agus iad ag obair agus gan an Ghaeilge ag na tuismi-theóirí bíonn Béarla ag na páistí ag teacht ar scoil.  Ach ón aithne atá agam ar na múinteoirí san Ghaeltacht tá siad ag déanamh an-obair faoi choinne cuidiú leis na páistí sin a thagann ar scoil an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Rud eile atá ag déanamh freastail ar an cheist seo ná na naonraí atá ar bun ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Ba mhaith liom iad a mholadh mar, áit a bhfuil an fhadhb seo nuair a théann na páistí go dtí na naonraí, bíonn deis acu <Col N="1404" /> eolas agus aithne a chur ar an Ghaeilge sula dtéann siad isteach go dtí an bunscoil.</P>
    <P>Rinne mé tagairt don chomhchoiste Oireachtais agus ba mhaith liom an Teachta Gallagher a mholadh as chomh cóir agus chomh cothrom agus atá sé mar chathaoirleach.  San cúpla noiméad atá fágtha agam ba mhaith liom tagairt ghairid a dhéanamh don tuairisc a chuireadh ar fáil maidir le Údarás na Gaeltachta. Molaim Cathaoirleach an Chomhchoiste a chuir an tuairisc seo ar fáil, an Teachta Prendergast atá anseo linn, agus na baill uile idir bhall na Dála anseo agus an tSeanaid a chuir an oiread sin oibre isteach san tuarascáil.  Tá sé fada agus tá sé cuimsítheach agus sílim go bhfuil moltaí fiúntacha ann.  Mar adúirt mé tá an-obair déanta ag an Údarás sa Ghaeltacht.  Cuireadh airgead ar fáil dóibh faoi choinne sin a dhéanamh agus tá súil agam go ndéanfar sin san am atá le teacht.  Tá moltaí fiúntacha ann agus tá súil agam go mbeidh deis na moltaí sin a chur i bhfeidhm idir seo agus deireadh na bliana.  Comhchoiste a bhain le gach uile pháirtí a bhí ann agus sílim, nuair atá bord chomh tábhachtach leis sin ar bun le sé nó seacht de bhlianta, go dtig linn dul siar agus amharc goidé mar a éirigh leo an obair a dhéanamh i rith na tréimhse sin.  Agus is dócha cé chomh maith is atá an bord is féidir feabhas a chur air agus na moltaí seo a phlé agus a scrúdú; má chuireann siad feabhas ar obair an Údaráis beidh fáilte mór againn rompu uile má chuirtear i bhfeidhm iad.  Mar adúirt mé ar dtús, seo an Meastachán is airde a cuireadh ar fáil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta ariamh agus taispeánann sé dáiríreacht an Rialtais.  Ainneoin an méid adeirtear tá an t-airgead ansin.  Ní raibh sé chomh hard ariamh agus tá súil agam go réiteofar gan mhoill na deacrachtaí atá ag an Údarás i láthair na huaire agus mar a rinneamar le cúig bliain anuas, go gcuirfimid le forbairt agus le fostaíocht agus dul chun cinn san Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Meastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta 1986&rdquo; atá scríofa ar bharr óráid an Aire.  Ceapaim féin, dairíre gurb é óráid na bliana seo caite <Col N="1405" /> a bhí ann.  Beagnach focal ar fhocal ar fhocal an óráid chéanna ach amháin na figiúirí athraithe beagáinín anseo agus ansiúd. Taispeánann sé sin a laghad suime agus atá ag an Rialtas, níl a fhios agam ag an Aire féin, ach cinnte ag an Rialtas, i gcúrsaí Gaeilge, i gcursaí Ghaeltachta nó in aon chúrsaí a bhaineann le nái-siúnachas.</P>
      <P>Anois tá go leor cainte déanta le roinnt míonna anuas ó cuireadh Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge ar bun san Oireachtas.  Mar adúirt an Teachta McGinley agus an Teachta Gallagher tá sár-obair déanta ag an gcoiste agus tá go leor den bhuíochas sin ag dul don Teachta Denis Gallagher é féin mar gur stiúraigh sé an coiste mar chathaoirleach go cothrom agus gur thug sé deis labhartha agus deis díospóireachta do chuile dhuine thart ar an mbord. Tá ár gcion féin déanta againn le caighdeán na Gaeilge, más féidir sin a dhéanamh, a ardú sa Dáil agus sa Seanad, agus b'fhéidir níos tábhachtaí ná sin féin atmaisféar Gaelach a chothú i dtim-peallacht Thithe an Oireachtais.  Is mór an feall, is dócha, dairíre nach n-éiríonn le cuid againn nó nach gcuirimid chuige níos mó Gaeilge a usáid agus sinn ag labhairt i gcúrsaí na Dála go hiondúil &mdash; taobh amuigh de am seo Meastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta féin.  Ach tá an-éacht déanta ag foireann an Tí agus sin iad na maoir, go háirithe, an ceathrar acu a bhíonn go hiondúil san áit a mbailímid mar Theachtaí Dála agus mar Sheanadóirí ár gcuid post chuile mhaidin.  Ba mhaith liom anseo anocht go n-aithneoimís an t-éacht sin agus go molfaimís iad as ucht na hiarrachta atá déanta acu le feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge agus í a labhairt má labhraíonn tú leo ar maidin.</P>
      <P>Creidim dairíre gurab í an chúis is mo b'fhéidir, nach n-úsáideann Teachtaí sa Teach seo oiread Gaeilge agus atá acu nó atá ar a gcumas acu a labhairt, ná an easpa poiblíochta a fhaigheann aon Teachta a sheasann suas agus a labhraíonn Gaeilge.  Níl orainn ach breath-nú ar Ailéar na nIriseoirí anseo anocht le feiceáil an easpa suime atá ag iriseoirí páipéir naisiúnta na tíre seo i gcúrsaí Gaeilge agus i gcúrsaí Ghaeltachta, nach fiú lena bhformhór bheith anseo anocht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> Creidim gurb b'shin é b'fhéidir ceann de na cúiseanna is mó leis an easpa úsáid Gaeilge sa Teach.  Mar tá a fhios againn ar fad go maireann go leor polaiteoirí ar phoiblíocht agus má labhraíonn tú sa Dáil nó sa Seanad, gur maith leat go mbíonn a fhios ag daoine thíos go bhfuil tú ag obair anseo agus ag déanamh iarrachta ar a laghad.  Agus mé ag caint ar na hirisoirí níor mhaith liom ligean don oíche seo dul thart gan chuile ádh a ghuí ar iriseoir amháin a bhíonn san Ailéar go minic agus a thugann an-chothromaíocht ina chuid cainte agus ina chuid iriseoireachta ar Raidió na Gaeltachta do ghnóthaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid, sin é do Mhicheál Ó Muircheartaigh atá tinn faoi láthair, agus tá súil againn go léir, táim cinnte, go mbeidh sé ar ais linn gan mórán moille.</P>
    <P>Tá rud amháin tagaithe ar ais san Ghaeltacht, go háirithe sa Ghaeltacht is mó go bhfuil eolas agamsa air, le bliain go leith nó dhá bhliain anuas agus sin é go bhfuil daoine óga, fir agus mná óga agus go háirithe fir óga pósta, anois imithe ar an imirce arís.  Tá siad ag tabhairt an bháid bháin orthu féin agus tá siad thall i Nua Eabhrac nó i mBoston Mheiriceá nó i Londain nó i mBirmingham. Bhí mé ag cruinniú polaitiúil níos túisce anocht agus sheas Cathaoirleach Bhord Chumann Lúthchleas Gael i gcontae an Aire féin, suas agus dúirt gur shínigh sé cáipéisí do os cionn ceithre scór de leads óga Mhaigh Eo, a bhí ag imirt peile sa chontae agus atá anois thall i Londain agus in áiteacha eile i Sasana. Taispeánnann sé sin na daoine breátha óga atá imithe ceal post a fháil sa mbaile dóibh féin, ach go háirithe daoine óga i gceantair Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh an tÚdarás ar fáil le postanna a chruthú do dhaoine na Gaeltachta agus leis an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo sa Ghaeltacht féin.  O thús na bliana seo, ó mhí Eanáir, tá 607 bpostanna lánaim-searacha agus ochtó postanna páir-taimsearacha ceadaithe ag an Údarás ach gan aon chead acu litir ofrála a chur amach ag na tionsclaithe ceal airgid, mar, mar atá a fhios ag an Aire &mdash; agus ní admhódh sé anseo é &mdash; tá airgead iomlán 1986 le postanna a chruthú tógtha suas <Col N="1407" /> ag tograí a ceadaíodh sa bhliain seo caite. Agus b'fhearr liomsa go mór, dá n-admhódh an tAire é anseo nó taobh amuigh den Dáil, mar láidreodh sé a lámh agus é ag dul ag bord an Rialtais.  Tá a fhios againn freisin, a Chathaoirligh, go gcosnaíonn sé dhá thrian den mhéan chostas sa chuid eile den tír post a chruthú sa nGhaeltacht.  In ainneoin na constaicí móra atá le sárú i gceantair Ghaeltachta ag an Údarás agus ag foireann an Údaráis, tá an líon post anna san Ghaeltacht ag ardú nuair atá sé ag titim sa chuid eile den tír ar fad.  Sin éacht atá déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Ach ní féidir tionsclaithe san Ghaeltacht nó in aon áit eile a chur ar mhéar fhada, ró-fhada, mar imeoidh siad uait.  Ní fhanfaidh siad agus sin é anois, mar adúirt an Teachta Gallagher, atá tar laithe le coicíos anuas. Tá tionnsclaithe caillte ag an Údarás, tá postanna caillte ag muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Thug comhchoiste na Dála a dtuarascáil amach coicíos nó trí seachtainí ó shin &mdash; an Teachta Prendergast a bhí ina chathaoirleach ar &mdash; agus anocht bhí mé ag súil san óráid a thug an tAire anseo go mbeadh sé in ann a chuid tuairimí féin mar Aire Gaeltachta a nochtadh i leith na tuarascála sin.  Ach in ionad sin deir sé linn nach raibh go leor ama aige go fóill leis an dtuarascáil a mheas ach amháin go raibh sé fábharach dó.  Má tá cúrsaí an Údaráis chomh práinneach agus a deireann an tAire go bhfuil &mdash; tá a fhios agam go bhfuil ach creideann an tAire agus tá sé ráite aige go bhfuil &mdash; is aisteach liom nár éirigh leis an Aire i leith na tuarascála is mó agus is cuimsitheach agus is fadbhreathnaitheach a cuireadh ar bun in aon bhord Stáit agus go háirithe in <Col N="1408" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta ó bunaiodh é &mdash; ach a thuairmí a nochtadh ar na rudaí atá sa tuarascáil sin.  An bhfuil an tAire fábharach do laghdú daonlathais ar bhord an Údaráis, mar sin go díreach ceann de na moltaí atá san tuarascáil?  Tá a fhios agamsa go raibh baill de mo pháirtí féin ar an gcomhchoiste Dála seo agus dúirt mé ag cruinniú de mo pháirtí féin nár aontaigh mé go ndeachaigh siad ar aghaidh le polasaí Fhianna Fáil i leith an Údaráis agus i leith bhord an Údaráis nuair a ghlacadar leis an gcinneadh sin ar an gcomhchoiste, mar creidim go bhfuil laghdú daonlathais i gceist.  Bhí go leor cainte faoi thionscail éagsúla agus monarchana éagsúla, i nGaeltacht Chonamara go h-airithe, a bhí ag cailleadh an t-uafás airgid le blianta fada anuas nuair a bhí siad faoi Ghaeltarra Éireann agus nár deineadh aon chinneadh ariamh chun iad a dhúnadh síos do chur ar bhonn airgeadais ceart agus folláin.  Níor deineadh é sin go dtí gur cuireadh an tÚdarás ar bun agus is cuimhin liomsa i 1979, 1980 agus tús 1981 nuair a chuaigh mise thart ag oifigí polaitúila ar fúd mo dháil-cheantair féin agus isteach go gCathair na Gaillimhe agus ag rinncí polaitúila san oíche bhí daoine as an monarchan sin ag siúl suas agus síos taobh amuigh agus placards acu á rá nár theastaigh baill an bhoird uathu, nar theastaigh mise uathu mar Aire, ach sheas baill thofa an bhoird in aghaidh na ndaoine sin, in aghaidh a muintire féin.  D'éirigh leo rud a dhéanamh &mdash; d'éirigh leo na comhlachtaí agus na fochomhlachtaí a chur ag déanamh airgid don chéad uair i 1984 agus arís i 1985.  Na baill tofa ar an mbord a rinne é sin, agus sin éacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá deireadh curtha anois le deontais seirbhísí, creidim, san Údarás.  Níl a fhios agam cé chomh fíor is atá sé sin ach sin a deirtear linn nuair a scríobhaimid isteach thar ceann éinne atá ag iarraidh deontas seirbhíse.  Creidim go dtuigeann an tAire chomh tábhachtach agus a bhí na deontais sin, mar thug siad deontais do na daoine beaga taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht.  B'fhéidir nar chuir siad fos-táiocht ar fáil ach amháin do bheirt nó <Col N="1409" /> triúr ach ní raibh i gceist ach cúpla céad punt agus bhí sé sin an-tábhachtach i gceantair atá an-iargúlta agus a raibh go leor constaici le sárú iontu.</P>
    <P>An rud is deireanai atá ráite leis an Údarás ná go gcaithfidh siad teannadh amach as na portaigh.  Rinneadh an-éacht i nGaeltacht Chonamara le bliain anuas nuair chuaigh an tÚdarás isteach i leith forbairt portaigh nár dearnadh aon fhorbairt iontu le blianta.  Cuireadh na portaígh ar fáil ar léas do mhuintir na háite agus tá siad anois ag baint móna uathu agus, le cúnamh Dé, beidh neart móna acu an bhliain seo chugainn má leanann an aimsear go maith.  Sin b'fhéidir an gníomh is mó agus is áisiúla a deineadh i mo dháilcheanntar ó cuireadh an tUdarás ar bun.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh ar bun coiste idir ranna inmheánach.  Bhí an Roinn Airgeadais air, bhí an Roinn Tionscail air; bhí Roinn na Gaeltachta air, An tÚdarás Forbartha Tionscail, Údarás na Gaeltachta féin. agus SFADCo, agus creidim anois go bhfuil moladh curtha ar aghaidh acu sin chuig na trí Ranna Stáit agus gurb é atá annsin ná nach bhfuil aon airgead le sparáil ag SFADCo nó ag an Údarás Forbartha Tionscail le teacht i gcabhair ar Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Más é sin é an cinneadh, nach bhfuil aon airgead, an bhfuil fírinne sa scéal gurb é an cinneadh atá déanta ag an gcoiste sin ná go dtabharfadh an Rialtas cead d'Aire na Gaeltachta £2 mhilliún a íoc leis an Údarás lena dtógáil as an gcruachás uafásach in a bhfuil siad faoi láthair agus go n-íocfaí é sin láithreach?</P>
    <P>Tá rud amháin ag cur isteach ormsa a chuir an-diómá orm le gairid, agus sin an preas ócáid speisialta a bhí ag ball de Phairtí Fhine Gael, Teachta Dála Ciarraíoch nach bhfuil anseo anocht agus sinn ag caint ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta.  Ní raibh aon am aige teacht ag an preas ócáid speisialta oifigiúil a bhí ag an Teachta Prendergast ach bhí sé in ann dul amach 24 uair in a dhiaidh sin agus preas ócáid féin a bheith aige agus mioscais á tharraingt aige arís agus drochmheas á chaitheamh aige leis an Údarás agus é ag cur i leith oifigeach agus feidhmeannach de chuid an Údaráis atá anois i bpostanna <Col N="1410" /> áirde taobh istigh den Údarás go raibh airgead curtha amú in áit éigin &mdash; agus níl a fhios agam an i gContae Ceatharlach nó in áit éigin eile.  Fair play don Teachta Prendergast, bhain sé na cosa de ar Raidio Eireann an mhaidin in a dhiaidh sin ach tá sé in am ag an Aire na cosa a bhaint de mar tá sé in am a rá leis an dTeachta sin go gcaithfidh sé cur suas nó dúnadh suas.  Má tá fianaise aige anois cuireadh sé i láthair an Aire é agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh an tAire lánsásta pé rud is gá a dhéanamh leis an bhfianaise sin a dhéanamh láithreach.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Teachta McGinley ag caint mar gheall ar dheontais fheabhsúcháin do thithe Ghaeltachta.  Is ceart go leor bheith ag caint ach tá deacracht amháin againn &mdash; agus labhair mé le oifigigh na Roinne mar gheall air agus tá mé ag ceapadh leis an Aire é féin &mdash; i nGaeltacht Chonamara nach bhfuil againn ach fíor bheagán conraitheoirí tógála atá cláraithe agus mar sin níl siad in ann an líon mór oibre is gá a dhéanamh i gcás feabhsúcháin tithíochta a dhéanamh gan b'fhéidir moill fhada, bliain nó mar sin, a bheith ort ag fanacht agus creidim féin i ndáiríre go gcaithfear teacht i gcabhair ar bhealach éigin i gceantair mar sin in iarthar na tíre nach bhfuil na conrai-theoirí cláraithe ar fáil go flúirseach iontu.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil an fhadhb chéanna i gContae Mhaigh Eo.</P>
    <P>Ar bhóithre áise tá poill chomh mór sna bóithre sin sa Ghaeltacht go bhféadfadh feirmeacha éisc a chur ar bun i gcuid acu agus, maidir leis na portaigh de bharr na droch-aimsire tá go leor bóthar ag dul isteach chuig portaigh nach féidir tractor nó fiú amháin trailer a thabhairt orthu agus tá sé an-tábhachtach go gcaithfí oiread airgid agus is féidir, nó go mbeadh cothromaíocht éigin idir na bóithre áise agus na bóithre portaigh agus tá súil agam go mbeidh caighdeán roghnaíochta ar na bóithre i mbliana níos fearr ná mar a bhí sé anuraidh nó más bréag a bhí i <i>Scéala Éireann</i> nó pé páipéar a chuir bóithre Thír Chonaill ar an bpáipéar, ba cheart don Aire é sin a bhréagnú.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na céanna tá an-mhí thuiscint i gConamara faoi latháir agus i gContae na Gaillimhe agus ar an gcósta <Col N="1411" /> thiar i measc iascairí faoi ché Ros a'Mhíl. Dúirt an Teachta Donnellan, an tAire Stáit, as Gaillimh Thiar cúpla mí ó shin go raibh go leor airgid ar fáil&mdash;na milliúin&mdash; le caitheamh ar Ros a'Mhíl agus dúirt an tAire Dukes anseo nuair a bhí sé ag caint thar ceann Aire na Gaeltachta roinnt seachtainí ó shin nach raibh aon suim airgid dá leithéid do Ros a'Mhil i mbliana. B'fhéidir go bhféadfadh an tAire a insint dúinn cé tá ag insint na fírinne?  Is cinnte nach féidir an bheirt acu bheith ag insint na fírinne agus níl mé ag rá gur bréagadóir ceachtar acu.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Cé Larna, tá dréimire agus soillsí treoracha le cur ar fáil; cé Cill Chiaráin&mdash;cén t-am a thosnófar ar an obair?  Tá an t-airgead ceadaithe. Táimid ag súil go dtosnófar ar an obair go luath.  Maidir le Oileán Árainn tá go leor oibreacha speisialta a chaithfear a dhéanamh le go mbéifear in ann seirbhís cheart a chur ar fáil idir Cé Ros a'Mhíl agus na céanna in Inis Mór, Inis Meán agus Inis Oirr.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na coláistí Gaelacha, aon-taím go hiomlán leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta McGinley agus creidim, agus tá sé ráite agam go minic, chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis na coláisti Gaeilge go gcaithfear an rud a dúirt sé, caighdeán nua de chinéal éigin a dhéanamh ar na coláistí sa chaoi nach mbeidh agat in aon rang amháin daoine atá fíor lag ar Ghaeilge agus daoine atá réasúnta maith, go bhféadfaí an cineál caighdeánú a deintear i gcuid de na coláistí Gaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm tríothu ar fad agus annsin go mbeifí in ann toradh níos fiúntaí a fháil ag deireadh na gcúrsaí Gaeilge ná mar atá ann faoi láthair agus an scéim iaraire a chuirtear ar fáil i gcuid de na coláistí go bhféadfaí b'fhéidir cabhair airgid níos mó agus níos forleithne a chur ar fáil le go bhféadfaí an scéim sin a leathnú ar fúd na tíre agus go bhféadfadh páistí as na coláistí Gaeilge ar fad úsáid agus tairbhe a bhaint as sin.</P>
    <P>Tá moladh amháin a aontáim leis go hiomlán i dTuarascáil an Chomhchoiste Dála faoi na comharchumainn agus sin é go bhfuil sé tarraingthe faoi láthair idir an Údarás ar lámh amháin agus Roinn <Col N="1412" /> na Gaeltachta ar an lámh eile agus go bhfuil sé thar am lárnú a dhéanamh ar an tseirbhís do na chomharchumainn, gur cheart iad a bheith go hiomlán faoin Údarás nó go hiomlán faoi Roinn na Gaeltachta ach nár cheart go mbeidís ag iarraidh a bheith ag deighleáil leis an dá dhream mar titeann siad idir dhá stól go minic.</P>
    <P>Ba maith liom, mar a rinne na Teachtaí a chuaigh romham, comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh le foireann an Údaráis mar níl aon dabht faoi an-phríomh-fheidhm-eannach ann a bhfuil a chion fein déanta aige ní amháin taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht féin ach taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht le poiblíocht níos fearr agus níos folláine a fháil do obair an Údaráis. Ba mhaith liom freisin tréaslú le foireann Roinn an Aire féin, daoine a raibh an-deileáil agamsa leo nuair a bhí mé mar Aire Ghaeltachta, agus do Chathaoirleach an Údaráis atá san áiléar anocht agus atá ina iar-Rúnaí ar Roinn na Gaeltachta agus mar a bhí ann le blianta fada.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist amháin agam ar an Aire.  Nuair a bhí mise i mo Aire Ghaeltachta bhí ócáid mhór againn chomh fada agus a bhain sé leis an Roinn agus sin gur aist-ríodh an chuid is mó den Roinn siar chuig na Forbacha.  Bhí sé i gceist ag an am go n-aistreófaí an chuid eile den Roinn siar agus nach mbeadh fágtha i mBaile Átha Cliath ach an aireacht féin.  Creidim go mba pholasaí maith é sin agus go bhfuil sé in am anois breathnú air sin arís agus b'fhéidir dáta cinnte a shocrú le go mbeidh an chuid eile den fhoireann in ann aistriú siar chuig na Forbacha le bheith i gceartlár mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus a bheith lena chéile.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil furmhór na foirne sásta athrú agus mura bhfuil gur féidir, b'fhéidir, aistriú a thabhart dóibh taobh istigh de Roinn Stáit eile agus daoine as an Roinn Stáit sin a chur siar.</P>
    <P>Tá mé cinnte, go bhfuil neart rudaí eile go bhféadfaí a rá anseo anocht ach amháin go bhfuilimid ar fad ag iarraidh an rud is fearr a dhéanamh don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht.  Agus má tá rudaí le rá againn, mar adúirt an Teachta Gallagher, ó am go chéile nach dtaitníonn leis an Aire&mdash;bhí rudaí á rá liomsa nár <Col N="1413" /> thaitnigh liomsa ach an oiread nuair a bhí mise ann&mdash;caithfimid ar fad oibriú lena chéile ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht. Creidim gurb é an rud is práinní anois a d'fhéadfadh aon Aire a dhéanamh ná an £2 mhilliún a chur ar fáil don Údarás le go mbeimid in ann a chinntiú go mbeidh pobal Ghaeltachta againn, go mbeidh tobar Gaeilge connithe beo againn sa nGaeltacht féin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>Díreach cosúil leis an Teachta deireannach a bhí ag labhairt ansin creidim go bhfeadfaimís go léir neart rudaí a rá faoin Ghaeltacht agus cúrsaí na Gaeltachta ach tuigim go maith go dteastaíonn ón Aire agus ó Theachtaí eile teacht isteach agus fágfaidh mé am dóibh siúd.</P>
      <P>Sa chéad dul síos tréaslaím don Aire as ucht na Meastacháin fhiúntachi seo a thabhairt isteach, na cinn is mó dar liom a tógadh isteach ó thaobh na Gaeltachta riamh sa Teach seo.  Agus chomh maith leis sin, rud, b'fhéidir, a déanadh dearmhad air san díospóireacht anseo anocht gurb é seo an chéad Aire i stair na tíre a bhunaigh comhchoiste san Oireachtas ó thaobh cúrsaí na Gaeilge. Creidim féin gur cruthú fiúntach é sin go bhfuil suim an-mhór ag an Aire féin, dar ndóigh, agus ag an Rialtas i gcúrsaí athbheochana, forbartha agus leath-naithe na Gaeilge féin agus na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní nach ionadh chuir sé áthas ormsa, mar Chathaoirleach an Chomhchoiste um Chomhlachtaí Stát Tionscanta Trách-tála, a bheith ag éisteacht le cuid de na focail cineálta agus molta a tháining os na Teachtaí eagsúla faoin tuarascáil a chuir mo chomhchoiste féin amach le déanaí faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Ba mhaith liom a chur ina luí ar an Aire go gcreidimidne sa chomhchoiste sin gurb é seo an tuarascáil is tábhachtaí agus is fiúntaí a deineadh riamh ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta i stair na tíre seo, mar go raibh sé ag teastáil uainn go mbeadh an tuarascáil sin ina cháipéis bunúsach, seasmhach, tagar-thach ó thaobh cúrsaí tionsclaíochta agus na Gaeilge féin laistigh de cheantair na Gaeltachta mar atá i láthair na huaire. Creidim féin go bhfuil na moltaí ann go <Col N="1414" /> sármhaith.  Bhí cúrsaí an Údaráis á bplé againn ar feadh blian go leith in éagmais rudaí nimhneacha a bhí á rá ag daoine éagsúla agus tuigfidh an mhuintir anseo muna dtéim rófhada isteach sa bhealach sin de, mar cúrsaí pearsantachta atá ann agus ní theastaíonn uaim é sin do phlé níos faide anseo.</P>
    <P>Ach, cuid de na moltaí a rinneamar san tuarascáil sin, creidim go rachaidh siad chun sochair do chúrsaí na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta, go mórmhór na cinn áir-ithe faoi Uimhir a Cúig, a dheineann moltaí faoi na córais taistil sa Ghaeltacht féin go mba fiú iad go léir a thógaint isteach agus a lárnú faoi fhoinse amháin, an tÚdarás féin.  Sin é an rud atáa i gceist againn.  I láthair na huaire tá deontais agus airgead á fháil acu ó Ranna éagsúla. Tá CIE ann agus Roinn na Gaeltachta féin agus an t-Údarás, agus creidimid gur cóir iad go léir a bhrú isteach faoi fhoinse amháin.  Sin é an rud atá á rá againn agus tá tagairt déanta cheana féin ag an urlabhraí deireannach ó Fhianna Fáil ansin, An Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn, faoi cheist na gcomharchumann, go mba fiú iad go léir a lárnú faoi fhoinse amháin &mdash;faoi Roinn na Gaeltachta nó faoin Údarás.  Go mórmhór ó thaobh deontais de, bheadh sé sin i bhfad níos éifeachtaí dá bhfeadfaí iad go léir a bhrú isteach le chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá moladh Uimhir a Naoi freisin ansin. Déanann sé sin tagairt don scéim atá ag an Údarás ó thaobh dul chun cinn na Gaeilge laistigh den Ghaeltacht, agus tá súil agam go gcuirfear an méid airgid atá riachtanach ar fáil do lucht an Údaráis chun an scéim sin a chur chun cinn.  Chuir sé díomá orainn nuair a bhíomar ag éist-eacht le baill, idir thofa agus ainmnithe, den Údarás faoin saghas cur isteach a bhí orthu féin de bharr easpa airgeadais go mórmhór ó thaobh na Gaeilge féin&mdash;ní ó thaobh tionsclaíochta de anois&mdash;agus ba mhaith liom a iarraidh óm chroí amach ar an Aire an méid airgid is féidir leis a chur ar fáil don Údarás mar tá géarghá i gcúrsaí airgeadais ann.</P>
    <P>Ceann eile de na moltaí is tábhachtaí agus is praíinní dar liomsa, a rinneamar ná aonad margaíochta a chur a fáil díreach mar atá ag comhlachtaí cosúil le <Col N="1415" /> SFADCo agus an IDA.  Ní hamháin sin ach ta géargá le aonad taighde agus forbartha &mdash;&ldquo;research and development&rdquo;&mdash; ní hámháin do chúrsaí an Údaráis féin nó do comhlachtaí atá faoi bhráid an Údaráis ach do chomhlachtaí eile go bhfuil deontais agus cabhair á bhfáil acu ón Údarás.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom anseo firicí suimiúla a nochtadh ó thaobh cúrsaí an Údaráis. Rinne mé tagairt ghearr anseo cheana féin dóibh níos luaithe san oíche, sa díos-póireacht seo.  Ach nuair a thuigimidne go bhfuil £191 mhilliún á fháil ag an IDA gach bliain agus nach bhfuair an tÚdarás, idir Roinn na Gaeltachta agus an Údarás féin ach £137 milliún bliain thar fiche, tuigeann tú an t-éacht atá déanta ag an Údarás féin.</P>
    <P>Rinne mé tagairt cheana féin do chúrsaí fostaíochta san Údarás.  Ag deireadh na bliana 1984 bhí breis agus 4,000 duine fostaithe ann.  Níor tháinig aon laghdú air sin.  Tá dul chun cinn ann ó shin i leith.  I 1980 &mdash; agus táim ag labhairt go baileach anois &mdash; bhí cailliúint idir na comhlachtaí go léir ann ag baint le b'fhéidir £3.5 mhilliún. Ach i 1984 &mdash; agus arís tá mé ag labhairt go baileach &mdash; tá brabús déanta acu de £100,000.  Tá feabhas mór tagaithe ar an scéal ó 1985.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfeadfadh an IDA nó SFADCo an rud céanna a rá agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon chomhlacht sa tír a bhféadfadh an rud nó an maíomh céanna a dhéanamh. Rud eile, 71 faoin gcéad de gach comhlacht a fuair deontas ón Údarás tá siad siúd ag saothrú agus ag freastal go hiomlán fós.  Ní fhéadfadh éinne eile é sin a rá.  Ní fhéadfadh Fóir Teoranta é sin a rá agus bheadh áthas an domhain orthu dá mba rud é go mbeadh sé ar a gcumas é sin a rá futhu féin.  Dá bhrí sin tá anmholadh ar fad tuillte ag an Údarás agus lán-tacaíocht sofheicthe tuillte acu ón Rialtas agus ó muintir na tíre seo go forleathan as ucht atá á dhéanamh acu ar son na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge féin.</P>
    <P>Creidimid sa chomhchoiste go bhfuil cúrsaí eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta agus cúrsaí na Gaeilge fite fuaite ina chéile. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach, in ár dtuairim, go mbeadh an t-ádh leis an saghas eacnamaíochta tionsclaíochta atá <Col N="1416" /> ann.  Má theipeann ar sin teipfidh freisin ar chúis athbeochan na Gaeilge.  Sin é an baol is mó atá ann.  Tá a fhios agam go maith go bhfuil saghas teirce ann ó thaobh airgid, ach baineann sé sin le gach Roinn nó Rannóg sa tír, &mdash; ach tá cúis faoí leith ag baint leis na Gaeltachtaí agus an Ghaeilge má táimid i ndáiríre faoí athbeochan na Gaeilge.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire, nuair atá seans aige, mionscrúdú ar na moltaí atá déanta ag an comhchoiste.</P>
    <P>Thuigeamar go maith i dtosach báire gach a bhí sa tuarascáil sin, ach i gceann 100 bliain ón lá seo beidh na daoine inár ndiaidh in ann féachaint siar ar chúrsaí tionsclaíochta agus ar na Gaeltachtaí mar atá siad i láthair na huaire laistigh de cheanntair Ghaeltachta, agus tá sé thar a bheith práinneach agus tábhacthach go gcuirfeadh an tAire agus an Rialtas an méid airgid is atá riachtanach ar fáil don Údarás chun a chur ina gcumas aon rud is mian leo a dhéanamh chun socair na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt ghearr a dhéanamh do na meáinchumarsáide, agus tréaslú a dhéanamh faoin deá-obair atá á dhéanamh ag Raidio na Gaeltachta. Éinne a bhfuil deis aige éisteacht le Raidio na Gaeltachta tuigfidh sé go bhfuil na cúrsaí reatha a bhíonn á gcur amach acu i measc na gceann is fearr atá á gcur amach ag aon raidio sa tír seo, áitiúil nó náisiúnta, ach ba mhaith liom a iarraidh arís óm chroí amach ar an Aire bunscrúdú a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí teilifíse.  Nach bhfuil sé go nimhneach, náireach dúinne go bhfuil cláracha teilifíse dá chur ar fáil do mhuintir Ghaeltachta na hAlban ag Rialtas Gallda?  Tá córas Gaedhealg ar fáil ag Gaeltacht na hAlbain, ach níl sin againn sa tír seo.  Iarraim ar an Aire rud éigin fiúntach a dhéanamh faoi sin.  Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Michael D. Higgins thar ceann ar bpáirtí i ndíospóireacht sa Seanad anuraidh, tá sé cruthaíthe go bhfuil córas teilifíse i bhfad níos éifeachtaí, níos láidre agus níos treise ná córas raidió, agus tá tionchar an-mhór ar fad faoin chóras teilifíse anseo.  Creidim ó thaobh na Gaeilge go bhfuil géarghá le córas teilifís Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairtín a dhéanamh <Col N="1417" /> do <i>Anois.</i> Tá sé bríomhar agus creidim go bhfuil an-job ar fad á dhéanamh aige.  Ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an phobal go forleathan tacaíocht so-fheicthe a thabhairt dó.  Mar a dúirt an tAire, muna bhfuil an tacaíocht sin ann teipfidh sé agus bheadh sé sin go fíochmhar ar fad. Tagaim leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta McGinley ag tréaslú do <i>The Irish Times:</i> bíonn alt an-mhaith acu gach seachtain. Tá an-chuid nuachtán áitiúla sa tír a thugann altanna faoin Ghaeilge, díreach mar atá im chathair féin san <i>Limerick Leader.</i> Ba mhaith liom an dea-shampla sin a mholadh do gach nuachtán a bhfuil sé in a chumas amhlaidh a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Rinne mé tagairt cheana don comhchoiste a bhun an Rialtas ó thaobh cúrsaí na Gaeilge.  Cuidím go hiomlán leis an méid atá ráite ag Teachtaí éagsúla faoi chean-naireacht an Teachta D. Gallagher agus an saghas cothromaíochta a bhíonn á imirt aige ansin: tugann sé cothrom na Féinne do gach éinne.  Ceann de na céimeanna is stairiúla agus is tábhachtaí a deineadh sa tír seo ó thús an Stáit, ó thaobh cúrsaí na Gaeilge ná an chomhchoiste sin a bhunú.  Tá géar-ghá le rud éigin folasach so-fheicthe don saghas sin.  Tá sé fánach do chuile dhuine taobh amuigh den Teach seo muna bhfuil dea-shampla so-fheicthe bunúsach á thabhairt againne don tír go forleathan.  Ba cheart dúinn anseo bheith mar ábhar dóchais do na daoine atá ag obair ar son na Gaeilge agus ar son chúis athbeochan na Gaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom cuidiú le Cathaoirleach an Choiste ag iarraidh ar an Aire in aon tslí is féidir leis a chur in a luí ar choiste pribhléidí an Tí seo agus ar an gCeann Comhairle tuilleadh áiseanna a thabhairt dúinn i dtreo, mar a dúirt an Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn, saghas timpeallacht Ghaeilge a chothú sna Tithe seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis na Teachtaí agus leis na Seanadóirí faoin méid atá déanta.  Ó toghadh mise trí go leith bliain ó shin tá áthas orm a adhmháil gur chuala mé níos mo Gaeilge á labhairt san Oireachtas ná in aon áit eile leasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Le cúnamh Dé, beidh mise ag labhairt thar ceann Bhord na Gaeilge leis na daoine atá tofa sna húdaráis áitiúla. <Col N="1418" /> Beidh mé ag cur in iúl dóibh siúd cé chomh tábhachtach agus atá sé do na comhairleoirí dea-shampla a thabhairt in ár gceantair féin.  Tá grúpa stiúrtha bunaithe ag an Rialtas agus tá saothar fiúntach déanta acu ó thaobh leathadh na Gaeilge ag an leibhéal sin.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh triail eile bainte as na seimineáir bhliantúla, mar an ceann a bhí sa Cheathrú Rua agus Daingean Uí Chúise ceithre bliain ó shin.  Tugann sé sin deis do na daoine tofa athfhéachaint ar an dul chun cinn atá déanta acu in a nÚdarás féin.  Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an iarracht sin.</P>
    <P>Nil tuilleadh le rá agam ach amháin tréaslú leis an Aire agus a iarraidh air an méid is féidir leis a thabhairt don Údarás chomh luath agus is féidir, mar tá géarghá le airgead práinneach ann don Údarás i dtreo is go bhféadfaimid an fhostaíocht a leathnú agus na jobanna atá ann cheana féin a chosaint.</P>

      <P>Chomh maith leis na Teachtaí ar gach taobh den Teach ba mhaith liomsa cás a dhéanamh thar ceann Údarás na Gaeltachta, an tÚdarás sin a bhfuil £2 mhilliún de dhith orthu chun tuairim is 800 tograí a chur ar fáil.  Tá timpeall 200 de na postanna sin i mo chontae fein.  Cuireann sé isteach go mór orm go bhfuil brú á chur ar na comhlachtaí sin agus ar na daoine sin dul chuig an IDA agus, chomh maith leis sin, go bhfuil cúpla comhlacht a bhfuil an-bhrú á chur orthu ó Údarás Forbartha na Sé Contae.</P>
      <P>Chuir an tAire ceist anseo: an bhfuil aithne againn ar chomhalcht ar bith; tá aithne agamsa agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an-bhrú á chur orthu.  B'fhéidir go mbeidh siad sin ag cur amach fógra taobh istigh de chúpla lá faoin chomhlacht sin agus tá siad sásta dul isteach sna Sé Contae agus, an taobh eile den scéal, beidh siad sásta fanacht i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall ach an tÚdarás a bheith ábalta a chur in iúl do na daoine sin go mbeidh an deontas le fáil acu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá na daoine sin bréan de bheith ag fanacht ó lá go lá agus shíleamar agus shíl muintir na Gaeltachta go mbeadh an tAire ábalta a chur ina luí orainn anseo anocht go mbeadh sé ábalta fógra a chur <Col N="1419" /> amach go bhfuil an t-airgead sin ar fáil. Muna bhfuil sé sásta é a dhéanamh anocht &mdash; agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé sásta é a dhéanamh roimh dheireadh na díospóireachta seo, b'fhéidir go dtabh-arfaidh sé le fios dúinn go mbeidh an t-airgead sin acu.  Maidir leis an deontas £10 a luaigh sé ó chianaibh ceapaim féin go mba cheart go mbeadh ceangal idir na deontais sin agus deontais tithíochta agus deontais scoláirí.  Tá go leor daoine sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus tháinig go leor daoine abhaile ó Shasana agus ó Alban agus níl an Ghaeilge go líofa acu agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil deontais ar féidir leo cur isteach orthu chuig Rannaí Stáit.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé féaráilte go bhfuil an t-airgead sin, £3,000, de dhíth ar dhaoine chun teach a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht agus ceapaim nach bhfuil sé sin ag cuidiú leis an nGaeltacht ná leis an dteanga.  Tá go leor daoine sa Ghaeltacht nár fhág an Ghaeltacht, nár fhág an tír, nár fhág na páistí an Ghaeltacht, agus níl siad ag fáil na bpuntaí.  An bhfuil polasaí taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht a chuireann bac ar dhaoine iarratas a chur isteach ar dheontas do theach nua?  Tá a fhios agam gur ardaíodh an méid airgid le haghaidh an deontais ó £2,000 go dtí £3,000 ach, chomh maith leis sin, ceapaim gur méadaíodh an líon daoine agus an méid teaghlach atá ag fáil an deontais seo.  Tá go leor cásanna agamsa sa Ghaeltacht agus táimid ag fáil na litreach céanna ag cur ina luí orainn iarraidh ar na daoine sin an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Tá cupla cás agamsa i bparóiste Ghaoth Dóbhair agus dúirt an cigire nach raibh sé sásta os rud é nach raibh Gaeilge ar bith ag na páistí sin ar &ldquo;bulldozers&rdquo; agus rudaí mar sin. Níl a fhios agam cén Ghaeilge atá acu ach tiontaíodh síos daoine mar sin agus b'fhéidir nach bhfuil mórán céille leis sin.</P>

      <P>Tharla rudaí mar sin agus níl na daoine sin ag fáil deontais.  Tá na cigirí ag rá go mbeidh siad sásta dul chuig an teach.  Níl siad ag dul chuig an teaghlach seo.  Ceapaim féin gur polasaí <Col N="1420" /> taobh istigh den Rialtas chun laghdú a dhéanamh ar an méid airgid a bhí le híoc acu.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na coláistí samhraidh agus na mná tí, sílim gur ardaíodh an deontas go dtí £3.10p.  Ní dóigh liom gur leor an t-ardú suarach sin a tugadh do mhná tí na Gaeltachta ach cibé faoi dhíograis agus dhúthracht mhuintir na Gaeltachta, ní dóigh liom go mbeidh mná tí na Gaeltachta sásta na páistí sin a choinneáil.  Ní fiú iad a choinneáil ar an deontas atá á íoc acu ag Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Is dócha go bhfuil eolas níos fearr ag Teachtaí eile ná mar atá agamsa maidir leis na coinníollacha atá ann.  D'iarr an Teachta McGinley ar an Aire cinnte a dhéanamh de go gcaithfí an t-airgead i mbliana ar na bóithre portaigh.  Is cinnte go bhfuil airgead de dhíth ar na bóithre portaigh ach, chomh maith leis sin, tá airgead de dhíth ar na bóithre áise, ní bóithre áise cosúil leis na bóithre áise a rinneadh anuraidh ag deireadh na bliana ach bóithre áise a bhfuil níos mó ná teach amháin orthu sin.  An bhfuil an tAire sásta na coinníollacha sin a athrú?  Nuair a bhí na Teachtaí atá ar an taobh seo ina nAirí Gaeltachta ba hiad sin na coinníollacha a bhí ann ag an am sin.  B'fhéidir nach raibh siad go h-oifigiúil an t-am sin. Bhí an liosta agamsa sa Teach seo agus ní raibh bóthar ar bith ar an liosta sin cosúil leis na bóithre a rinneadh anuraidh.  Ach sin uisce faoi shruth anois. Ba mhaith liomsa go gcuirfeadh an tAire níos mó airgid ar fáil i mbliana agus go ndéanfadh sé smaoineamh ar na hoileáin. Chuir an tAire tuairim is £5,000 ar fáil anuraidh d'Arann Mhór agus idir 1977 agus 1981&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tá a fhios ag an Aire nach féidir le comhairle chontae airgead a chaitheamh ar bhóitre nach bhfuil sa gcontae.  Gheobhaidh an tAire a sheans &mdash; ná bíodh sé ag cur isteach orm anois. Tá airgead de dhíth, ar na hoileáin agus scríobh mé litir chuig an Aire anocht ag iarraidh air toscaireacht a ghlacadh ó na comhairlí contae, ó na Gaeltachtaí go léir <Col N="1421" /> i dTír Chonaill.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh sé sásta caint linn faoi na bóithre agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh airgead de dhíth orainn le haghaidh na mbóithre contae agus b'fhéidir go bhfaghaimid seans cuid de na bóithre seo a fheiceáil.</P>
      <P>Tá airgead de dhíth ar mhuintír na n-oileáin, ar Thóraigh, ar Inis na Bó Finne agus maidir le Tóraigh chaitheamar cúpla uair san Roinn, b'fhéidir, 3 nó 4 mhí ó shin agus chuireamar ina luí ar na hoifigigh fadhbanna agus deacrachtaí mhuintir Thóraigh.  Chuir mise ceist maidir le fordheontas le haghaidh uisce agus chuir mé ina luí ar na hoifigigh chomh tábhachtach is atá sé deontais a chur ar fáil do thuairim is 25 de na teaghlaigh a chaitheann cuid den am istigh ansin sa samhradh agus ar éigean dóibh teacht amach i rith an gheimhridh.  An bhfuair mé freagra an lá sin?  Ar íocadh an conraitheoir a rinne an job sin go fóill? Shíleamar gur déanadh cás thar ceann mhuintir na n-oileán ach tá a fhios agam anois guram am amú a bhí ann ag caint leis na hoifigigh seo agus tá daoine anseo anocht a bhí ansin an oíche sin agus níl mise sásta gur tuigeadh na cúrsaí sin agus cur amú a bhí ann mar sin.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire sásta brú a chur orthu chun freagraí a thabhairt dúinn.  Bhí triúr Teachtaí Dála ón chontae sin ann agus tá mé beagnach cinnte go raibh beirt nó triúr nach bhfuair freagra tar éis an chruinnithe sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, mar adúirt an tAire féin, tá tuairim agus 860 tógraí agus 200, ceapaim, maidir le Dún na nGall.  Shíl mise go raibh go leor daoine gurb fhéidir leo airgead a fháil ón mbanc ach scríobh an tÚdarás chuig an mbanc i gcás amháin ag rá go mbeadh deontas le fáil acu, ach seo an drochscéal, níl na bainc sásta anois na litreacha sin a onórú.  Ní mise atá á rá sin, sin facts ó na bainc, cúpla ceann acu sa chontae. Go dtí sin bhí siad sásta é sin a dhéanamh ach níl siad anois, agus ba cheart go mbeadh an Rialtas sásta an £2 mhilliún atá de dhíth a chur ar fáil chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an tuarascáil ar Údarás na Gaeltachta, aontaím le cuid mhaith de na <Col N="1422" /> moltaí atá ann agus, go háirithe, an ceann faoi aerstráicí agus na báid fharantóireachta; ba cheart go mbéidís sin faoi Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé an-deacair don Údarás brabach a dhéanamh nuair atá seirbhísí mar seo ann.  Tá go leor seirbhísí maidir le CIÉ agus iad sin atá ag cailleadh airgid.  Ní féidir leis na haerstráicí agus na báid fharantóireachta airgeadh a dhéanamh taobh istigh de chúpla bliain, agus tá siad sin ar leabhair an Údaráis mar chailliúint agus ba cheart go mbeadh na seirbhísí sin faoi Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na moltaí ag baint cumhachta de bhaill tofa agus baill eile Údarás na Gaeltachta, mar adúirt an Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn, nuair nach raibh na baill tofa ansin bhí an tÚdarás ag cailliúint airgid.  Anois nuair atá siad ann tá an tÚdarás ag déanamh brabaigh; bhí brabach acu anuraidh agus tá súil agam go mbeidh brabach i bhfad níos mó acu i mbliana.  Táimid ag dul ar gcúl má táimid sásta é sin a dhéanamh.  Tá fios níos fearr ag na daoine sin faoin nGaeltacht ná mar atá ag daoine ar bith eile agus tá comhartha ceiste ansin thar na baill sin. B'fhéidir nár dúradh é sin sa tuarascáil ach ceapaim féin go bhfuil an tuarascáil ag rá go bhfuil na baill sin agus na baill a bheas ag plé le hiarratais faoi bhun £30,000 sásta cuidiú le muintir a bpáirtí féin.  B'fhéidir nach raibh sé sin ann ach ceapaim féin go bhfuil an tuarascáil á rá sin.  Má tá cás ar bith ba cheart go mbeadh na daoine sin sásta a méar a chur ar an gcás sin.  Ceapaim féin go raibh cothrom na féinne le fáil ag gach comhlacht anocht agus ag gach duine a chuir iarratas isteach chuig an Údarás.</P>
    <P>Maidir le forbairt céanna iarraim ar Aire na Gaeltachta arís smaoineamh ar dhreideáil ché Ailt a' Chorráin.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil gantannas airgid ann &mdash; beidh Comhairle Chontae Dhún na nGall sásta airgead a chur ar fáil ach ní dóigh liom go mbeimid ábalta 25 faoin gcéad den chostas a chur ar fáil.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh tú athbhreithniú air sin.  Arís, impím ar an Aire an t-airgead a chur ar fáil le haghaidh an Údaráis agus jobanna a chur ar fáil le haghaidh na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na daoine a ghlac páirt sa díospoíreacht.  Níl ach ceathrú uair a chloig agam le freagra a thabhairt ar na daoine a chuir ceisteanna orm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil daoine sásta go ginerálta faoi chéard atá ar siúl ag an Roinn, an toradh atá ar a gcuid oibre maidir le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus, chomh maith, an toradh atá le feicéail ar obair an Údaráis i leith na Gaeltachta. Bhí an Teachta Gallagher ag caint faoi fheilméireacht éisc agus mhol sé, chomh fada agus a b'fhéidir é, go mba iad muintir na Gaeltachta a bhainfeadh tairbhe as aon fhorbairt a bheadh ar siúl maidir le feilméireacht eisc.  Thiocfainn leis ar an iomlán, ach amháin an méid seo a rá, go bhfuil an-chuid costas caipitil ag baint le forbairt feilméireacht éisc agus nach mbeadh sé ar chumas a lán daoine, ní amháin sa Ghaeltacht ach taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, an t-airgead sin a fháil. Táimid ag caint ar shuimeanna sna milliúin punt.  Anois, chomh fad agus is eol domsa faoi láthair tá dhá dream ag plé leis an obair seo ar bhonn atá an-mhór, ach ar a laghad, is dreamanna Éireannacha iad, agus beidh muintir na Gaeltachta ag baint tairbhe as, cuir i gcás Conamara, áit a bhfuil comhlacht Éireannach, agus comhlacht Gaelach ar a lán bealaí, ba mhaith liom a rá.  Chomh fada agus is eol dom ó thaobh Roinn na hIascaireachta de, áit a raibh mé go dtí cúpla mí ó shin, tá an-suim san obair seo agus beidh iarratais istigh ó dhaoine beaga, mar a déarfá, go mba mhaith leo cineál forbairt bheag a dhéanamh, agus níl a fhios agam go baileach cén saghas teicneolaíochta a bheadh oiriúnach dó sin, ach tá mé cinnte gur féidir leo é a dhéanamh.  I gcionn deich mbliana, tá mé cinnte, a lán de na daoine atá faoi láthair ag iarraidh dul ag iascaireacht &mdash; agus, go deimhin, braitheann sé ar an séasúr, cuir i gcás i 1984 bhí séasúr uafásach dona ag, cuir i gcás, iascairí bradáin &mdash; go mbeidh daoine mar sin ábalta feilméireacht a dhéanamh agus teacht isteach cinnte a bheith acu amach anseo.  Agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh sé sin ag tarlú <Col N="1424" /> taobh istigh de chúig nó de dheich mbliana ar a mhéid.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tithe Gaeltachta, labhair cúpla duine faoi dheacracht conraitheoirí cláraithe.  Aontaím san iomlán faoin deacracht a bhaineann leis seo sa Ghaeltacht agus go háirithe sna hoileain.  Tá Teachtaí anseo a chuaigh chun cainte liom faoi seo le cúpla mí anuas.  Tuigim na deacrachtaí agus rinne mé iarracht iad a mhíniú do dhaoine eile agus is ceist cánach í, mar adúirt an Teachta Denis Gallagher, agus tuigeann seisean an chúis atá leis an scéal mar atá sé.  Ach tá mé cinnte go dtuigeann sé chomh maith go bhfuil deacracht maidir le eisceachtaí a dhéanamh.  Níl sé dodhéanta agus breathnóidh mé air arís le féachaint a feídir rud éigin a dhéanamh ar na hoiléain, ach ní féidir liom tada a gheallúint mar níl a fhios agam cén toradh a bheas ar mo iarrachtaí.</P>
    <P>Maidir le comharchumainn, bhí deacrachtaí mar is eol do na hiar-Airí atá ina suí trasna an Tí uaim.  Bhí deacrachtaí leo le mo linn freisin agus bhí orm rudaí faoi leith a dhéanamh.  Bhí orm comharchumainn a phiocadh amach, comharchumainn ar mheas mé go mbeadh seans acu na cosa a thabhairt leo agus go mbeadh dea-thoradh ar a gcuid oibre agus thug mé tacaíocht iomlán agus tacaíocht airgid dóibh, agus tá ag éirí go maith leo.  Anois, ceann de na rudaí a rinne mé ná gur iarr mé go mbeadh orthu, sul a bhfaighidís deontas reachtála, scaireanna áitiúla a fháil.  D'ardaigh cúpla Teachta an pointe seo &mdash; ní mór atá i gceist, go hiondúil tuairim is deich faoin gcéad den mhéad atá á fháil acu mar dheontas reachtála, is é sin, deich bpunt deontas in aghaidh an phuint i scaireanna áitiúla.  Ní mór é sin ach, mar sin féin, tá cúpla míle punt i gceist in a lán cásanna agus b'fhéidir gur mór an méid é chomh fada is a bhaineann leo siúd.  Anois níl mé ag rá nach bhfaighidh siad an deontas reachtála muna n-éiríonn leo an deich faoin gcéad a fháil ach gearrfar síos beagán é muna mbeidh an t-iomlán acu.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na rudaí go bhfuilimid ar fad ar aon fhocal faoi maidir le comharchumainn go n-éiríonn leo má tá tacaíocht mhuintir na háite ag teacht dóibh <Col N="1425" /> agus ag dul leo.  Aon chás a chonaic mise go raibh sin ann d'éirigh leis an gcomhar-chumann agus sin ceann des na toscaí a bhaineann nó a chuidíonn leis sin.  Má bhíonn airgead an ghnáthdhuine sa gceantar istigh sa chomharchumann, tabharfaidh sé aird air agus coinneoidh sé súil ar cén chaoi a bhfuil obair an chomharchumainn ag dul ar aghaidh agus airgead an chomharchumainn á chaitheamh.</P>
    <P>Maidir le foghlaimeóirí Gaeilge agus coláistí &mdash; agus d'ardaigh cúpla Teachtaí an cheist seo chomh maith anuraidh &mdash; bhí ardú ar uimhir na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge a chuaigh siar agus ó dheas.  Níl a fhios agam go baileach i mbliana ach chomh fada agus is eol dom beidh sé ardaithe arís i mbliana ach níl na figiúirí cóirithe agam faoi láthair.  Anois is scéim an-mhaith é sin agus, maidir lena lán daoine, agus go fiú chaith mé féin cúpla bliain ag múineadh i gcoláistí Gaeilge, is é an t-aon seans a fhaigheann a lán daoine ar Ghaeilge a chloisteáil á labhairt i ngnáth shaol na ndaoine.  Is cineál ábhar teibí scoile go dtí sin é.  Cuireann sé sin leis an meas atá acu ar an nGaeilge chomh maith le fiúntas cainte na teanga chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an bpáiste.</P>
    <P>Chuala mé féin, mar adúirt an Teachta Gallagher, gearán faoi, ní deacracht cigireachta chomh mór le nach raibh aon chaighdéan comónta trasna na tíre, go raibh bearnaí sa rud agus nach raibh caighdeánú déanta ag an gcigireacht.  Tá deacracht chomh fada agus a bhaineann linne maidir leis sin, mar gurb iad na daoine atá ag reachtáil na gcoláistí seo atá i mbun oibre agus atá freagrach as an caighdeánú maidir le cigireacht, agus táim ag ceapadh gurb í an Teachta Máire Geoghegan-Quinn a rinne tagairt do chaighdeánú taobh istigh de rang, go mba cheart daoine atá ar aon chumas a chur le chéile agus daoine a bheadh ar chaighdeán níos airde a chur i rang eile.  Tá anloighic agus ciall ag baint leis sin ach arís is rud é sin a bhaineann leis na daoine atá ag reachtáil an choláíste, bíodh sé ina chomharchumann nó ina dhream áitiúil, agus tá an dá shaghas ann.  Is rud go <Col N="1426" /> mbeidh mé féin, agus mé ag dul thart i rith an tsamhraidh, ag caint faoi leis na daoine atá ag reachtáil na gcoláistí seo, agus má tá deacrachtaí acu beidh mé ábalta iad a phlé leo.  Ba mhaith liom a rá chomh maith le Teachtaí go bhfuil suim acu ann &mdash; agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil suim ag na Teachtaí atá i láthair sa Teach ag an pointe seo &mdash; go gcoinneoidís a gcluasa go talamh, mar a dearfá, agus má fhaigheann siad aon ghearán nó, agus nílim ag iarraidh orthu spiadóireacht a dhéanamh, má tá aon mholtaí acu a cheapann siad a rachadh chun tairbhe do na coláistí agus do na daoine atá ag glacadh páirt sna scéimeanna seo, tá mise sásta éisteacht leo agus iad a chur i gcionn más féidir liom, chun feabhas a chur le reachtáil na gcoláistí seo.</P>
    <P>Anois sula bhfágfaidh mé na comharchumainn tá moltaí eile ar fad ann maidir le go mbeadh an Roinn nó an tÚdarás i mbun comharchumann agus sin amháin. Tá ciall leis sin ach níl sé chomh meascaithe is a cheapann daoine mar tá a fhios go maith ag na comharchumainn céard atá i gceist.  Ní thagann an tÚdarás ann ach amháin nuair a bhíonn deontas caipitil i gceist le haghaidh tógáil áite agus tagaimid i gceist in aon chás eile.  Tá a fhios ag na comharchumainn é sin go maith.  Níl aon airgead á chur amú maidir le na ráitis seo faoi na comharchumainn. Maidir leis an Údarás, dúirt an Teachta Pat `Cope' Gallagher gur cheap sé go rabhamar ag cur ár méir isteach ar dhaoine a bhí ag cur isteach ar dheontais le haghaidh tithe &mdash; feabhsúcháin agus tithe nua &mdash; toisc go raibh na deontais ard agus go rabhamar ag iarraidh bac a chur ar dhaoine.  Níl sé sin fíor.  Is ag cigirí áitiúla atá sé daoine a chuireann isteach ar an deontas deich bpunt a ligean ar aghaidh nó bac a chur orthu toisc nach bhfuil caighdeán sách ard aimsithe acu agus, dá bhrí sin, ní fhaigheann siad deontas.  Agus ba mhaith liom a rá maidir leis sin agus leis an bpointe a chruthú, maidir le tógáil tithe i mbliana go dtí seo, go bhfuil méadú 50 faoin gcéad ar iarratais ar thógáil nua agus méadú 63 faoin gcéad ar iarratais le haghaidh feabhsúchán.  Ní dóigh liom go dtagann sé sin leis an méid atá ráite ag <Col N="1427" /> an Teachta `Cope' Gallagher.  Rinne sé gearán chomh maith go raibh an deontas deich bpunt fite fuaite i ndeontais eile. Sin é an polasaí atá againne.  Má tá polasaí difriúil ag an bpáirtí thall ba chóir dóibh é a rá.</P>

      <P>Ardú ar iarratais, sea. Mar atá fhios ag an Teachta agus iar-Aire, ní chuireann an tAire isteach ar chigirí.  Go deimhin bíonn Airí ag brú ar chigirí daoine breise a ligean isteach de ghnáth, ní ag cur bac orthu, ag teipeadh daoine.  Maidir leis an Údarás ba mhaith liom arís tréaslú don Údarás toisc go bhfuil méadú tagaithe ar fhostaíocht nuair atá sé ag dul i laghad ar fud na tíre le blianta beaga anuas.  Ba mhaith liom tréaslú chomh maith leis an gcomhchoiste agus leis an chathaoirleach, an Teachta Prendergast atá sa Teach, as ucht a bhfuil déanta acu ar son na Gaeltachta agus, go deimhin, ar son an Údaráis, toisc go bhfuil, mar adúirt tú féin, a Chathaoirligh, &ldquo;in-depth scrutiny&rdquo; déanta ar ghnóthaí an Údaráis.  Tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an dtuarascáil seo agus mar adúirt mé i dtús báire, agus ní thógfar orm má deirim arís é, ní raibh deis agam agus ba mhaith liom dá mbeadh deis agam é seo a bheith feicthe agus scrúdaithe go grinn ach bhí mé as baile le hocht lá ó foilsíodh an tuarascáil.</P>
      <P>Anois maidir le airgead an Údaráis &mdash; agus ná cuir i mo leith go bhfuil mé ag iarraidh gan tada a rá faoi seo &mdash; tá sé seo idir lámha agam.  Cheap mé go mbéinn in ann rud éigin a rá faoi anocht, go mbeadh rud réitithe, níl&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>B'fhearr liom dá mbeadh an tAire atá i mbun na Roinne atá freagrach anseo anocht.</P>
      <P>I asked to raise this matter because I tried to raise it by way of Private Notice Question today and also on the Order of Business but I failed in my efforts.  It is unfortunate that it is not possible to raise these matters of urgency during the course of the normal business of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other Deputies attempted to raise this matter over the last few days and we warned that the dispute would escalate if steps were not taken quickly to deal with the problems of the workers in dispute, especially in relation to their problem of getting the corporation or the Minister concerned to enter into negotiations with them.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that there were very serious incidents in the centre of Dublin tonight involving the Garda, the Army and some of the workers on strike.  I understand that some of the workers were batoned during the course of the <Col N="1429" /> disturbances.  It is a tragic occurrence and could have been avoided if talks had been started over the past week.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out today that the request to involve the Army in clearing rubbish from the streets would be bound to escalate the dispute and to harden attitudes on all sides.  I do not claim to know the facts in relation to the violence tonight &mdash; I got a brief report on them and I am not passing any comment as to who was responsible directly or indirectly &mdash; but the Government, the Minister and the corporation could have prevented such incidents if they had entered into negotiations.  It is not clear to me &mdash; although I have my suspicions &mdash; why the Government are so obstinate in their approach to this dispute.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have been entered into with many other sectors of the public service in recent months.  Indeed, in recent days extraordinary efforts were made to settle the agricultural inspectors' dispute.  I fully agree that such efforts should be made, but they should also have been made in relation to the dispute in the Dublin area.  Major efforts were also made in relation to the teachers' dispute and of course they should have been made.  However, I have a very strong suspicion that the reason efforts are not being made to settle this dispute is that we are dealing with some of the lowest paid workers in the public service and that the Government feel they can win.</P>
    <P>It is odd that a Government with a Minister for Labour and for the Public Service, who is a member of the Labour Party committed in policy terms, as presumably Fine Gael are also committed, to free collective bargaining, should be taking an obstinate attitude in this matter.  They seem to think these workers are easy meat, that this is where they can draw the line, that it is a confrontation they can win and that they may be able to recover their composure in the public sector pay area.</P>
    <P>The Government, in defending their position, have argued that the 7 per cent on offer to the general workers of Dublin Corporation is the public sector norm and <Col N="1430" /> that it has been accepted by other groups in the public sector.  However, they have not made it clear that not all the public service have accepted the offer of 7 per cent.  They also did not make it clear that the figure of 7 per cent and the arrangements for paying it were negotiated with workers who are relatively better paid than the people with whom we are dealing in this dispute.  This arrangement was made with officer grade staff and higher civil servants and, in these cases, special payments were also negotiated.  In the case of the general workers in Dublin Corporation we are talking about a straightforward pay claim, the 25th round, with no special awards involved.</P>
    <P>The sum of 7 per cent is being offered over 18 months.  I am not attempting to interfere in negotiations that may, I hope, take place very soon but I want to draw attention to a number of points in relation to the offer which has been made.  As I said, the offer is spread over 18 months with a pay pause of four months and a 3 per cent increase for the following eight months which, in effect, is a 2 per cent annual increase.  The men involved receive a gross basic income of £138 per week.  After deductions for PRSI and PAYE, the likelihood is that the increase would mean £1 extra per week.  It may be fine for higher civil servants to accept a 7 per cent increase over 18 months with pay pauses because they are starting from a much higher base. Percentage increases have always benefited the better paid and discriminated against the lower paid.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation workers are looking for a reasonable increase in real terms.  They are not looking for the earth or saying that the Government must pay beyond their means.  They just want something extra to enable them to pay their way.  Surely the Government must see the justice in the point they made in relation to percentage increases for the lower paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have the power to call in the Labour Court in this dispute.  Last week the Minister, in reply to a Private Notice Question of mine and of Deputy Ahern, said that <Col N="1431" /> the Labour Court had already adjudicated on this dispute.  That is so.  But that is a voluntary adjudication.  It is not arbitration as it was applied, say, in the teachers' case where each side were, in theory at any rate, obliged to accept the offer made by the arbitrator.  In this case it went to the Labour Court and the workers refused to accept the offer made, as they were entitled to do.  But that is not to say that the Labour Court has no further role to play in this matter.  If that were the case there are many disputes which have taken place in the past which would never have been resolved because we would simply have arrived at a dead end on day one.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister have the power to request the Labour Court to take up this issue again.  The unions involved in this dispute have indicated that they are ready and willing to become involved in meaningful negotiations on the outstanding issues.  It is up to the Government to de-escalate this dispute.  They have created the escalation that has taken place and it is up to them now to de-escalate this dispute immediately, tonight, tomorrow morning, as quickly as possible.  Let them bring in the Labour Court and get talks started.  They can do it directly themselves.  They can take the shackles off Dublin Corporation and allow them to negotiate.  Whatever way they choose to do it, it should be done as quickly as possible.  There is nothing to be gained by the Government, the Corporation or the workers concerned in this dispute from the kind of incidents that took place in Dublin city tonight.  I urge the Government and the Minister to move immediately, to get around the table with the general workers of Dublin Corporation, and get the services restored as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. O'Toole) Paddy O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me begin by saying that it is most unfortunate that this strike has gone ahead as it has.  It is true to say that industrial relations in Dublin Corporation have been very good in recent years with no major industrial strike and <Col N="1432" /> very little loss of working days.  This is to the credit of both unions and management and it is a great pity that such good relations are being soured by a strike which is both ill advised and unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The origin of the dispute lies in the claim by the unions involved for £15 per week pay increase under the 25th round, a shorter working week without loss of earnings and an additional two days annual leave.  The claim was lodged in September last at a time then the 24th round agreement still had three months to run and was clearly premature at that time.  Pay guidelines generally had not emerged and the Corporation could not become a trend setter for the public service pay.  This response by the Corporation was not acceptable to the unions who referred their claim to the Labour Court.  Conciliation conferences took place in the Labour Court on 17 January and 6 February 1986.  At the latter conference the Corporation offered the same terms as had been provisionally agreed with other public service unions and which had come to be referred to loosely as the public service pay offer.  This offer would give the Corporation workers a 3 per cent pay increase from 1 May this year and a further 2 per cent increase on 1 January next and a final 2 per cent increase effective from 1 May 1987, making a total in excess of 7 per cent.  This would amount to an average increase for the workers concerned of about £4.65 per week immediately and an average increase of more than £11 per week over the period of the offer.  The unions however rejected the offer and elected instead to put their case to a full hearing of the Labour Court.  This hearing took place on 13 February last.  The court's decision issued on 31 March and it is important that I quote the court finding:</P>
      <P>The Court feels that in all the circumstances the offer made by the Corporation is a fair one and recommends that it be accepted by the Unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court did not recommend concession of the union's claim relating to a shorter working week and additional annual <Col N="1433" /> leave.  The offer made by the Corporation is the same offer that has been accepted by a large body of workers employed throughout the public service.  Other groups of workers are considering the offer.  I might add that the offer was negotiated at a time when the expected rate of inflation over 1986 and 1987 was several points greater than what is generally acknowledged now will be the actual rate.  The offer is therefore looking better all the time and will give the Corporation workers and public service workers generally a significant real increase in pay over the 18 month period involved. Deputy De Rossa's point was that he was appealing for something in the nature of a real increase.  This is, in real terms, an increase.</P>
    <P>Following ballots of their members the unions rejected the Labour Court's recommendation and served formal notice of strike action to commence on Monday last, 26 May.  The strike has resulted in significant inconvenience and a reduction in the quality of life for the citizens of Dublin.  The many areas affected by the strike are water and sewerage services, refuse collection and street cleaning.  On the water and sewerage side Dublin Corporation requested the assistance of the Army to maintain these essential services.  The level of assistance required in the interests of public health and water pressure for fire control was determined following consultation with the local authority.  The Army has been providing assistance to the Corporation from midnight on 25 May under the guidance of the corporation's engineering staff.  The main area of Army involvement has been concentrated on the Ballymore Eustace treatment plant, which is the principal source of Dublin's water supply, and the Ringsend treatment and pumping plant, which is the city's main sewerage disposal facility.  Disruption to the refuse collection and the street clensing service in Dublin city and in south county Dublin is particularly regrettable coming at a time, at the beginning of the summer, when the tourism season is building up to a peak.  I would like to commend the <Col N="1434" /> large number of householders and business people who are disposing of their waste without injury to the environment and to public health either by bringing it themselves to the tipheads or by other arrangements.  I would appeal to those who in some cases are engaging in indiscriminate fly-tipping to act more responsibly in the interests or the community as a whole.  I make a special appeal to business people, especially the owners of take-away food premises, fast food restaurants and so on, to keep the footpaths and roadways adjoining their premises free of litter and other waste.</P>
    <P>I am told that some 4,000 tons of waste are collected and disposed of by Dublin Corporation each week.  In this situation it is only to be expected that problems will arise in some areas as a result of the strike and notwithstanding the best efforts of householders and others.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week, the Government were informed by the Dublin City Manager that the Chief Medical Officer had advised him that a serious public health risk is now arising in both the corporation flats and in Moore Street.  In addition, the situation in these areas is considered to be a fire hazard.  I understand that an approach was made by Dublin Corporation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for assistance from the unions but that Congress felt that it would not be appropriate for them to become involved.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the health and safety of the public, the Minister for the Environment had no option but to seek the assistance of Army personnel in removing accumulated refuse.  As a result, Army personnel began operations this morning.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this strike is both ill-advised and unnecessary.  The unions' claim has been processed right up to a full hearing of the Labour Court which recommended that the corporation's offer should be accepted.  The unions have seen fit to set aside this recommendation of the court in favour of industrial action, at the expense of the citizens of Dublin and without regard to <Col N="1435" /> the financial constraints on the local authority.</P>
    <P>It is not open to Dublin Corporation to offer more to their workers.  It is apparent that the vast majority of workers in the public service recognise and accept that the 7 per cent on offer is the very best which current economic circumstances will allow.  As the Labour Court has said, the offer is a fair one and should be accepted.</P>
    <P>I understand that congress is to be asked to sanction an all-out picket by two of the unions involved in the dispute.  I would appeal to the unions concerned, and indeed to the workers as well, to pull back, even at this late stage, from any action which would further exacerbate the situation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the latest news that I have received from Moore Street, I should like to express my regret that incidents of such a nature would take place where Army personnel had become involved, at the behest of the Government and in the interests of the citizens of this city, in <Col N="1436" /> order to avoid both a fire and a health hazard.  The Government in turn acted as a result of being informed that the accumulation of refuse in Moore Street and in the larger corporation complexes had become a health hazard.  I understand that Army personnel have been obstructed in their duties.  This is unfortunate. I understand that some volume of refuse is now on fire and that the fire brigade are being prevented from entering the area.  All one can say is that it must be viewed with regret, and indeed disappointment, that anybody would engage in that kind of action.  They were dealing with people who were acting in their best interests and in the best interests of the people of the city.</P>
    <P>I appeal to those causing this problem to realise what they are doing, to apply some commonsense, national pride and responsibility, even at this late stage, and to pull back from the precipice because that will do nobody any good.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 6 June 1986.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I outlined in some detail in the House recently the reasons why young drivers are charged more for third party motor insurance. Young drivers incur loadings to reflect their higher risk status.  Furthermore such drivers are usually not in a position to benefit from no claims bonuses which older drivers will have earned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The higher accident rate for young drivers is well documented in the An <Col N="1253" /> Foras Forbartha road accident reports. In addition examination in the past of the loadings applied by insurers to these drivers have shown these to be justified. I have however asked for the position on loadings in general to be monitored by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board which I set up last year.  I am anxious that any type of loadings not reasonably justified on cost grounds should be done away with.</P>
    <P>I am anxious too to improve the position of young drivers, but I have to say clearly that the pool of premium income overall must match the level of claims. The simple fact is that lower insurance costs for young drivers with no change in the underlying claims experience would mean higher costs for other, more mature, drivers.  This should not be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has any particular cases in mind involving young drivers I will be glad to have the details checked out by my Department.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The National Film Studios of Ireland Limited were put into liquidation in April 1982 and sold to SIPRA Ardmore Studios in August 1984.  The studies never reopened, however, because the purchasing company itself went into liquidation shortly thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Regulations have been in operation in Ireland for a number of years which require that certain basic information be shown on the labels of foodstuffs.  The information required to be shown includes, for example, the name of the food, the list of ingredients, the net quantity, a &ldquo;best before&rdquo; date, the name and address of the manufacturer or packer or seller, and other details.  The regulations are intended to ensure that the consumer is provided with a reasonable amount of information about the food he or she buys.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the general level of compliance with these regulations although I am aware that in the case of some products, for example bread, compliance is not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I should point out that apart from the regulations administered by my Department in the area of labelling, separate regulations which also set down some labelling requirements are administered by the Department of Agriculture in relation to a variety of agricultural produce and by the Department of Health in relation to, for instance, foods which claim to be suitable for particular nutritional uses, such as bread for coeliacs or food for diabetics.</P>
      <P>As regards improvements on the present arrangements my Department is currently consulting with interested parties, including the food industry, in relation to discussions which are taking place at EC level and which are likely to result in our requiring even more detailed information on food labels, particularly in relation to ingredients used.</P>

      <P>Pensions are not paid to widowers under the social insurance system at present other than in very limited circumstances. Where a pension is paid to a widow under the widow's contributory pension scheme it is not affected by any other income or earnings which the widow may have.  The provision on the same basis of pensions for widowers would have wide-ranging financial and other implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widowers with dependent children who are in receipt of disability or unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance can receive a &ldquo;housekeeper&rdquo; allowance in the form of an increase for <Col N="1273" /> an adult dependant in respect of a woman who is looking after the children.  Assistance can also be provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to any person who is in need.</P>
    <P>The question of widowers' pensions was not covered in the EC Directive on equal treatment in matters of social security.  Matters not covered in that directive are, however, now about to be considered by the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>The whole area of financial support for single parent families under the social welfare system will be reviewed in the light of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare and whatever decisions are made at EC level.</P>

A step towards that objective was taken by this Government in July 1985 when the benefits were extended to pregnant wives of insured persons.  I am very conscious of the position of women with family responsibilities who work in the home <Col N="1279" /> and I would hope that it would be possible to extend the scheme to all spouses of insured persons.

To make advance beef cow payments in areas of counties which are only part-classified such as west Cork would have meant diverting the Department's computer staff and resources to this task at the expense of delaying by at least a month the payments of ewe premiums of over £30 million in Cork and elsewhere which will commence in a fortnight's time and continue into July.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 90 together.  The post-primary school facilities in the areas specified by the Deputy must be viewed in the context of the decision notified by my Department to County Dublin VEC in April 1986 to approve the following arrangements with effect from 1 September 1986:</P>
      <P> (a)  the transfer of Colaiste Cronáin from Nangor Road to the new building at Deansrath and</P>
      <P>(b)  the transfer of Coláiste Chillian, the all-Irish post-primary school, and the all-Irish primary school to the Nangor Road building.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that approximately 475 pupils will be accommodated in the Deansrath building next September.  The building can accommodate up to 1,000 pupils and it is expected that an enrolment of that order will be reached in due course.</P>
      <P>The Nangor Road building will provide an all-Irish primary and post-primary school campus and will cater for the needs of the Dublin South-West area.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the Teamwork scheme, however, that in order to allow the greatest number of young people to benefit from a temporary employment opportunity, all participants must leave the scheme after they have completed one year's employment.</P>
