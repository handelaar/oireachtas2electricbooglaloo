    <Title>British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) (Amendment) Bill, 1986: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to enable the Minister for Finance to provide up to £38 million in additional equity for the B &amp; I Company.</P>
      <P>The Bill also confers upon the Minister for Communications certain controls in relation to the remuneration and superannuation of the staff of the company, which he may exercise with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the requirement for additional equity arises from the package of proposals from the B &amp; I board for the restructuring of the company which the Government recently <Col N="1746" /> decided to support with Exchequer funds.  All but £100,000 of the existing authorised share capital of the company has already been taken up by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In view of the substantial losses incurred by the B &amp; I in recent years &mdash; between 1980 and 1984 these amounted to more than £43 million and necessitated provision by the Exchequer of more than £30 million in equity capital to enable the company to continue in operation &mdash; the Minister found it necessary to take action to ensure that this state of affairs would not continue.  In May 1985 he appointed a new chairman and managing director to the company with the mandate &ldquo;to take whatever steps are necessary, with the agreement of the Board of the B &amp; I Company and subject to the approval of the Minister and taking account of the need to maintain Irish participation in cross-channel passenger and freight services, to restore the company to profitable operation by 31 December, 1986.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In December last, the board submitted to the Minister their proposals to restore the company to viability.  The board's proposals included: the development of the existing co-operation arrangements with Sealink through a new two-year agreement; the B &amp; I Rosslare/Pembroke service would cease and a new joint car ferry service would operate between Rosslare and Fishguard under a new brand name using a Sealink jumbo vessel; upgrading of on-board services through a combination of capital investment in redesign of the sales area, introducing new skills in catering, retailing and passenger care facilities, either by way of contracting arrangements or direct recruitment; financial restructuring of the B &amp; I involving shareholder investment of £43 million; substantial cost efficiencies to be achieved through reduced manning levels and changes in work practices in all areas of the company's business.</P>
    <P>The board's proposals were considered by the Government who decided that, subject to the enactment of the necessary enabling legislation they would allocate over the next few years £38 million additional equity for the B &amp; I Company, of <Col N="1747" /> which £20 million will be provided in 1986.  This falls short of what the board requested but it represents a very substantial level of investment in present financial circumstances.  This major investment by the Government is contingent on a matching contribution by the board, management and workforce of the B &amp; I towards the restoration of the company to viability.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to continue support for the B &amp; I is an indication of their commitment to maintaining a strong Irish presence in shipping services to this country, which was the main reason why the State acquired the B &amp; I in 1965.  It is not necessary to remind the House that as an island nation our access transport services, particularly those between Ireland and Britain, are vital to trade, commerce and tourism and to our national economy generally.  This major investment by the Government will ensure that a significant share of cross-channel traffic will remain in Irish hands.  This is in accord with the Government's view that, while they welcome external participation in shipping services to and from Ireland, a significant level of Irish participation operating under equitable conditions is an essential ingredient in ensuring the efficiency and quality of cross-channel services.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, £20 million of the £38 million will be provided this year and the remaining £18 million will be phased over the three years 1987-89. The amount and phasing of the further equity injections will be closely related to the overall performance of the company against very challenging profit targets which the Minister has set for them.  Throughout the period there will be detailed monitoring of the company's commercial performance by the Department of Communications.</P>
    <P>In the absence of Government support and other remedial measures, the B &amp; I would have been likely to incur unsustainable annual losses of the order of £10 million.  On the basis of the package now approved, the company are expected to eliminate these losses and for <Col N="1748" /> 1987, the first full year of operation under the new arrangements, to return a profit. I am confident that this can be achieved and that the trading performance of the company will continue to improve in the years that follow.</P>
    <P>What is now needed to ensure the companey's future is a sustained commitment on the part of the workforce to work with management towards the common goal of creating an efficient and commercially viable enterprise.  Indeed the workforce must be commended for their realistic acceptance of the need for change.  These measures will safeguard the 1,400 jobs which the B &amp; I will continue to provide. The board and management of the B &amp; I also deserve recognition for their resolute approach to the very difficult problems facing them.</P>
    <P>Of the 1986 equity injection of £20 million, an amount of £7 million is being spent by the B &amp; I on capital investment. The other £13 million is being used to being the process of restructuring the company's balance sheet by reducing the company's borrowings.  The equity injections over the years 1987 to 1989 will also be used to reduce the company's burden of debt to an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the £7 million capital investment to which I have referred is being spent on vessel refurbishment.  The expenditure is in respect of substantial improvements in the overall standard of on-board facilities.  The sales areas of the car ferries have been redesigned to make them more attractive to passengers, offering as they do far greater comfort and a wide range of passenger facilities, including greatly enlarged duty free facilities, shops, restaurants, bars, a cinema and various other attractions to make travelling across the Irish sea a far more enjoyable experience than in the past.  In addition to the physical improvements to the vessels, a comprehensive programme of staff training is being undertaken to ensure that passengers receive the highest possible standard of service and attention.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I's agreement with Sealink is a two year one but it can be renewed if <Col N="1749" /> considered desirable.  The new agreement will achieve a more efficient utilisation of vessels while providing a better overall service to the customer.  In the past, intense competition on the Irish Sea has led to both companies suffering losses which in the case of the B &amp; I had to be met by the Irish taxpayer.  The battle for market share resulted in an undesirable lowering of standards and led to a situation where the reductions in fares were the only means of attracting additional passengers, leading in turn to greater losses.  Clearly such a situation could not continue indefinitely.  Inevitably fares had to rise to cover costs if the services were to continue.</P>
    <P>On the southern corridor B &amp; I and Sealink are operating a joint service under the banner of &ldquo;Southern Seaways&rdquo;.  Pending acquisition by Sealink of a jumbo ferry, the service will utilise the Sealink vessel, the <i>St. Brendan</i>, year round and will be augmented during the May to September peak season by a second vessel operated by the B &amp; I.  This year the <i>Innisfallen</i> will be deployed for this purpose.  This will provide some short term contract employment for many of the staff on the Rosslare route who are being made redundant.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, there is one point which I feel I must stress.  It must be clearly recognised that the company's future cannot be assured by Government support alone.  It is equally dependent on full co-operation by all concerned in the provision of continuous reliable and efficent service.  I feel sure that this co-operation will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Government's objective for the B &amp; I is to see an efficent and commercially viable enterprise which will provide a vastly improved service for their customers, ensure secure employment for their employees and contribute to the development of tourism and trade and general economic growth.  I see no reason why this objective cannot be achieved.  This Bill heralds a new era for the B &amp; I which will lead in a relatively short time to the emergence of a revitalised self-sustaining enterprise worthy of comparison with the best carriers in this most competitive <Col N="1750" /> sector of transport.  The enactment of this Bill gives the B &amp; I the opportunity to ensure their own long term future.  I am confident the company will grasp that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to indicate the basic Fianna Fáil policy in regard to the B &amp; I as published in the last public policy document, the National Economic Plan, 1983-1987.  Paragraph 22 of that report states:</P>
      <P>The B &amp; I line has been encountering serious financial problems in the recent past.  Some of the principal reasons for these problems are outside the company's direct control, for example, fuel prices, intensive price competition and stagnation in tourism.  Other financial problems, such as the company's high financial charges, stem from the overambitious investment programme undertaken since 1978.  A vigorous commercial approach is the only way for the company to ensure efficient and profitable services.  To this end the company is now restructuring its operations.  The performance of all the company's services is being monitored on a monthly basis and the scope for further economies is being examined. A radical retrenchment and rationalisation of B &amp; I's operations is necessary. Timely and decisive action will be needed to ensure that all services will be operated on an economic basis and the company's cost overheads significantly reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note what has changed since that plan was published.  For example, all services were mentioned in that plan but since then the Cork-Pembroke service has been wiped out.  I have no doubt that Members from Cork constituencies will deal with that matter when they get the opportunity.  The Dublin-Holyhead and Dublin-Liverpool routes are still maintained.  We said that all services will be operated but, in accordance with the plan mentioned by the Minister in regard to operations on the southern corridor, we do not have a ship.  At the <Col N="1751" /> moment the <i>Innisfallen</i> is filling in until the day comes, if it ever comes, when a foreign company will provide a jumbo ship to operate on that route.</P>
    <P>In the course of our plan we mentioned fuel prices and as the House and the world knows the cost of fuel has dropped very considerably since.  This week's issue of <i>The Economist</i> indicates on a year for year basis a drop in the standard crude oil price quoted at 50.3 per cent since this time last year.  Therefore, an aggravating cause of the company's financial problems of 1982 has been removed not by any direct action of the Government, not by any direct action of an expensive consultancy, Zeus consultancy and not by any direct action of the new chairman/chief executive but by world economic factors.</P>
    <P>I considered it better to refer to the position the Minister found when he took office late in 1982 because an attempt has been made in the House, and outside, to indicate that the Coalition were the first to be concerned about the economic position of the B &amp; I.  That is not so and anybody can check the paragraph I quoted to learn what the Government's policy was when the plan was prepared. Also mentioned at that time as a factor contributing to the economic difficulties of the B &amp; I was competition.  I know that &ldquo;competition&rdquo; is a big word in all areas of transport, air, sea and land.  It is a very hot issue but I cannot say that the arrangement made by the chairman and board of B &amp; I in this instance is the ideal one in regard to competition.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, there is a cosy arrangement between B &amp; I and Sealink. Instead of competition we have what is tantamount to a cartel, and this is worrying many people in the transport business, passenger and freight.  We have a 50-50 share of the profits on the Southern Corridor, without a ship.  That is part of a plan.  They have the <i>Innisfallen</i> pending the building of the &ldquo;jumbo&rdquo;.  There is no competition on the Dublin-Holyhead or the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead routes. The customer is not likely to benefit from <Col N="1752" /> this cosy arrangement.  Certain consumer interests have brought the matter to the attention of the EC, the sector involved in the competition theory.</P>
    <P>Those two major sectors in the 1982 Fianna Fáil policy document have been removed in diverse ways in so far as the customer is concerned.  Interest rates have fallen considerably since then and, if we are to believe most recent reports, the tendency will be for them to fall further.</P>
    <P>Those three factors must be taken into consideration when discussing the request by the Government to provide £38 million for B &amp; I.  A plus factor is the present position of the company at the port of Dublin.  The port has been through a period of strikes and disruptions. In the first six months of the pre-Government chairmanship of the B &amp; I board, the then board were directly on target, but this was interrupted and put out of joint totally by conditions in the port, by strikes and disruptions.  That climate has improved, and that is a wind blowing in favour of the company.</P>
    <P>I will refer later to the Minister's short speech in which he made some points which need to be taken up.  I will deal now with the Bill.  There are two major sections in it.  The first proposes to raise the ordinary shares of £1 from 58 million to 96 million.  That is the essence of the Bill.  In his speech the Minister said the required amount would be £38 million, but the board had requested £43 million. The Minister did not make any attempt today to justify the £38 million, nor did he say the extra £5 million petitioned by the board is not available.  I cannot see why the remainder of the amount the board requested for the running of a viable company will not be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is the most extraordinary provision to come before the House &mdash; I will return to this later.  It proposes to arrogate powers to the Minister which he should not have the effrontery to arrogate to himself.  I will be moving for the deletion of that section.</P>
    <P>The next point, referred to in the media yesterday, is that we have not got the 1984 Annual Report from B &amp; I, not to <Col N="1753" /> speak of 1985.  I should like to know what the position is with regard to those two reports.  Before coming to a conclusion as to whether we should make available £38 million of the taxpayers' money to the company we should have those reports before us.  There were rumoured losses in 1984, and in 1985 the rumoured losses were £6 million.  There is talk of a loss in 1986, despite the Minister's indication in his speech as follows:</P>
    <P>... to take whatever steps are necessary, with the agreement of the Board of the B &amp; I Company and subject to the approval of the Minister and taking account of the need to maintain Irish participation in cross-channel passenger and freight services, to restore the company to profitable operation by 31 December 1986.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was referring to the whole of 1986, that is disheartening information. As I said, if the annual reports of the company were available we would know whether there is substance in those rumours.  The profit forecast for 1987 is very insubstantial indeed.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House why it is being asked for this amount of money before all the beating of drums and the bualan sciath but not before a very expensive consultant company had been employed to advise on this plan.  I should like to know why it was wrong at that time to invest £38 million when there was a chance of maintaining certain extra services not now available and employment which has been cut, but it is right now, even though the company are not making a profit yet.  Apropos the consultant firm, I understand the Department will be paying their fees.  Consequently, the House is entitled to know what that firm have done or are doing for the taxpayers' money which they will be getting.  There is a grey area but, with due respect to the Chair, a rule will be quoted telling us that the Minister has no responsibility in this, that or the other regard.  Despite the fact that the House is providing the funds and the equity, there is no way we can get information in certain areas.  We should be entitled to know the value we are <Col N="1754" /> getting for the money we are spending on Zeus investments since it is not the board who are paying but the Department.</P>
    <P>I will proceed now to an examination and criticism of the arrangements that are being put in place with the aid of the £38 million we are asked to provide.  It is important that we get replies here to our questions.  Otherwise I despair of getting any answers.  Now on Second Stage of this Bill I have the opportunity to get replies from the Minister and I shall pursue him until I get answers to various questions that, I regret to say, have been rejected as being outside the Minister's responsibility in regard to this semi-State body.  I would also add that I get the same response in regard to other semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what are the economics of the Dublin-Liverpool run. It is the longest run in which B &amp; I are involved.  Is it making a profit?  It was argued it is important for us to have the short sea route because nowadays customers are opting for the short sea route rather than the long run.  The House is entitled to know what it is subsidising and we are entitled to know the economics of the Dublin-Liverpool run.</P>
    <P>In the plans as announced, various decisions have been made with regard to the Dublin-Holyhead run.  Has the decision been made to move from Dublin to Holyhead so that both B &amp; I and Sealink would operate out of Holyhead?  With regard to Holyhead itself, I understand that the fine provisions at Holyhead have been totally provided by this State during the years.  Am I correct in saying that the facilities available to B &amp; I at Holyhead are not to the same high standard as the facilities provided at Dún Laoghaire?  I have heard criticisms of the marshalling space and the vehicle parking space available at Holyhead.  If we are entering into a cosy arrangement with Sealink, now owned by an American, we should be sure that we know all the facts.  This American is a hard, tough businessman, and more power to him.  He is in the business to make profits and I am quite sure he will ruthlessly cut services on the Irish Sea if he is not making a profit.  That <Col N="1755" /> is his philosophy, but my contention is that we have to watch out carefully in that situation.  There should be an insistence by us, either at Government level or at company level, for reciprocal facilities at Holyhead.</P>
    <P>With regard to the financial arrangements, are we talking about a 50/50 split or does that hold only on the southern corridor?  Two ships are operating now to Fishguard and the jumbo is to come into operation.  Has a 50/50 split been agreed on the Dublin-Holyhead and Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead services or will B &amp; I keep the profits they make on the Dublin-Holyhead run and Sealink keep the profits they make on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead run?</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion I tried unsuccessfully to get a reply to a question regarding the train link to the B &amp; I service.  Again, that is a Government matter, not merely a company matter.  It will require governmental clout to deal with that problem.  I think the trains are geared specially to the Sealink services rather than to the B &amp; I services.  It is not possible to get to London as early on the B &amp; I morning service &mdash; the Dublin-Holyhead-London route &mdash; as it is on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead-London run. That area will be vital in marketing and it is very important.  Marketing will be the top priority in selling the routes and in selling internally on the ships in future. This is an area where we have been weak in the past and we must improve if we want to have a profitable operation.</P>
    <P>What is there by way of consumer protection with regard to the Dublin-Holyhead and Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead routes and also in the reverse direction? Is there anything to protect the consumer? At the end of his speech the Minister mentioned that an increase in prices was necessary to sustain the service. There are severe complaints about the perecentage increase that was added recently.  The argument was used that because of the cut-throat competition fares had fallen very low and, as a result, the service got shabby and things had gone wrong.  It was said this was the <Col N="1756" /> reason for an increase that would be three or four times the inflation rate for 1986. I should like the Minister's views on that. The Minister's speech was very pared down; it was not full of information for the House and for the taxpayer.  I should like to know also if the B &amp; I operation from Dublin to Holyhead is profitable. Of course, that is linked to the answer to the question whether the profits are pooled, as is done sometimes in the case of airlines even though one or other of the parties may carry more passengers.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with the Rosslare area, which I visited yesterday.  To my mind it has potential for great development in association with B &amp; I if we keep Irish interests up front.  When it starts operating the Channel tunnel will change the graph with regard to transport to the end of the century.  The B &amp; I preferably with their own boat &mdash; arrangements do not make any provision for a B &amp; I boat on that run &mdash; will be in line for increased traffic to the Channel tunnel and from there to various parts of Europe.</P>
    <P>The criticisms of the present arrangement are many and varied and it is important they should be put on record. There is an even more punishing cartel from the customers' point of view here because we will end up with one ship belonging to an American, admittedly employing some Irish people.  If for sound, capitalist, economic principles he decides to close it down &mdash; as has happened with subsidiaries of companies in manufacturing industry and for reasons which sometimes have damn all to do with the circumstances existing in this country &mdash; and sell the ship, no Irish ship will be plying the route from Ireland to Fishguard.  If we have invested a good deal of capital in the development of Rosslare by that time, we will be the laughing stock of the transport world with a developed port, it may be a free port, but no ship leaving from it.</P>
    <P>Is the jumbo on or off?  There are rumours in the Rosslare area that that part of the plan is being scrapped, that the proprietors of Sealink are not anxious to have a jumbo sized &mdash; I do not have a definition of that yet &mdash; ship built and <Col N="1757" /> put on that route.  We have no place unfortunately in which to have this ship built since Verolme Cork Dockyard closed.  Belfast, hopefully, might be able to build the ship, although it is likely that they will be too busy to do so from the reports we read in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>As far as train links are concerned, dissatisfaction has been expressed about scheduling in such a way as to get maximum benefit from the train service. Yesterday I got information in the Rosslare area that there was a big improvement in that service and I hope that is correct.  The <i>Innishfallen</i> is operating there together with the Sealink vessel.  It is not an old ship.  Many people are knocking it but it is a 4,849 tonne vessel that was built in 1969.  It is rumoured that the <i>Innishfallen</i> and the <i>St. Brendan</i> will continue to ply that route, and that the idea of the jumbo is scrapped.  If that arrangement is continued, well and good.  If not, I presume the <i>Innishfallen</i> will be put up for sale and will be a realised asset for the company in the near future.  Not that the shipping market and the sale of the 72,000 tonne Panamax, the <i>Irish Spruce</i>, for £3.6 million, gives us any encouragement that B &amp; I will have a great deal of funds if they put the <i>Innishfallen</i> on the market and sell it in the near future.</P>
    <P>Freight was in the news yesterday.  We were told that the B &amp; I freight service was losing money, but I will come back to that point later.  I have had complaints from individual Irish hauliers, and consequently competitors of B &amp; I, that they did not get equal treatment so far as bookings and priorities in return journeys were concerned.  This is a very serious charge.  We are considering voting £38 million to that company and all they are entitled to as a company are the same rights of access to bookings, rates and so on as apply to other hauliers using the service.  I have documentation on this subject.  Naturally there is a serious temptation for B &amp; I to give their own freight priorty but there is no justification for their doing so.  In fact, the reverse is true.  If we are voting money in this House for B &amp; I that money should never be <Col N="1758" /> used to put them at a competitive advantage over other citizens who have invested their money in the haulage business. I have had similar type complaints &mdash; they are usually denied by the company &mdash; with regard to CIE.  A haulier in my constituency said he was sure the State subsidy was being used to give CIE an unfair advantage.  I am using that as a parallel illustration.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the services on board B &amp; I ships.  A decision has been taken to give the franchise to a British company, which admittedly had been operating gift and perfume shops hitherto.  I am sure they are a reputable firm, but we were told initially that Campbell Catering of County Dublin were to get this franchise. I do not know what happened in the meantime, but I should have thought it was an important consideration that an Irish company of proven efficiency should have been given preferential treatment in the award of this franchise.  I have a special reason for emphasising that.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in the debate on shipping in this House earlier this year I carried out a personal survey of what was available on board a Sealink vessel between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead. B &amp; I are taking in a British company to provide these services.  On the Sealink vessel not one single Irish product was advertised on the walls outside the shops. There was no marketing drive with regard to Irish products.  Irish drinks were available in the duty free shop but on the walls six types of spirits were advertised and not one was an Irish product.</P>
    <P>When Sealink was owned by the British Government one could see the logic of that because they were entitled to plug their own products, and one could admire them for that.  Now, though, we have this cosy arrangement business.  We are practically the same company as far as profits are concerned and now the owner of Sealink is not a British citizen.  In those circumstances a new ball game has arisen. The House should direct the attention of the chairman and managing director and the board to this area, particularly in view of the fact that, as the Minister said in his speech, a good deal of money has been <Col N="1759" /> spent on refurbishing those areas of the ships that are plying.</P>
    <P>I examined the gift shops and the jewellery section on board that same ship. Anybody who has any awareness at all will know that over the past ten or 15 years there has been a tremendous advance in silversmithery, goldsmithery, making of souvenirs and making of world class textile products.  A very short walk from this House to the Kilkenny Design Workshops will indicate the range of goods of superior quality available that are manufactured in this country and of a high design.  Not one single piece of jewellery on that ship at that time was made in Ireland.  Most of it was from a Birmingham company that was mentioned. Again we are in this House considering a £38 million investment and we should be asking questions and stiffening the back of people who are involved in this area to see to it that there is a strong Irish products presence on board the ships.  Our young artists have earned a great place.  Anybody who mooches around all the little shops in this city, not to talk of Galway or Cork, will know how many bright young people are involved in this business particularly.  Our medallists have won international recognition. There has been some talk of Ogham Crafts and the Aer Lingus commemorative medal having obtained international awards recently.  Examples of the good work of our wood carvers, our potters and our people involved in textiles can be seen in Kilkenny Design Workshops by anybody who has a few minutes to spare or skips his lunch today.  I do not want to labour that further, but we have made concessions to Sealink with regard to profits etc. and we should demand a <i>quid pro quo</i> across the board.  We have taken job losses in this new arrangement with Sealink and we should concentrate our minds on making up for those job losses by giving work in other areas to other of our citizens.</P>
    <P>When we produced our economic plan to the end of 1987, a paragraph of which I read out, Cork was being provided with one of the services of B &amp; I.  I mention <Col N="1760" /> this only <i>en passant</i> because I am sure the Cork Members will have something to say about this in their contributions to the debate.  However, Munster tourism has been very upset by the fact that a sea link to Britain is no longer provided by any company now.  Again I am sure that most economists would presume to be able to tell us exactly, even if there were a loss on the shipping, what the consequent gain would be in the tourism area.  I mean that I cannot believe it is beyond the capabilities of an economist to tell us how much we would have to get on the roundabouts of tourism to make up for the loss on the swings of transport by boat to the country.  Can that be quantified?  I will not stress that further because, as I say, I expect that Deputy Michael Ahern and others will contribute with regard to Cork.</P>
    <P>The Pembroke facility has been discontinued. There is to be no longer a presence, a trade to Pembroke.  Nevertheless &mdash; I think I am right and I am asking the Minister to say whether I am right or wrong &mdash; there will be a payment to be made on a regular basis to Pembroke for facilities which we will be no longer using. With regard to Pembroke itself, those who have been using it for both freight and passengers have always indicated that the people in Pembroke are delighted to have as customers the B &amp; I company.  It has been remarked time and time again that they made distinct and strong efforts to please and satisfy the customers on that run.  Before the decisions were taken a number of people from Pembroke were in touch with me, and I am sure with the Minister, and they wanted to make every effort possible to retain the service there.  I can see how a decision might be taken to discontinue the service and how Pembroke would want to retain it &mdash; naturally, they are good business people &mdash; but I cannot see how we will be happy to continue to pay money for services at Pembroke and making no use of the facilities provided. I do not know whether private shipping companies could be encouraged to make use of the facilities or whether they would get preference in the use of Pembroke, <Col N="1761" /> but I must say that the people who came over here and who gave me copies of letters which they sent to Mr. Spain, Chairman and Managing Director of B &amp; I, were very anxious to indicate that a profit making run from Rosslare to Pembroke was very much a possibility, and they complained that on occasion the difference between making a profit and making a loss was that space was not available for people who wanted to do bookings when that run was on between Rosslare and Pembroke.  I quote from a copy of a letter to Mr. Spain which was sent to me by the Pembrokeshire District Council:</P>
    <P>... we emphasised the grounds for our belief that the Pembroke/Rosslare route would show a profit turn round of £5.3 million if operated with an available suitable vessel and that this sum was considerably in excess of the £4 million profitability turn round claimed for rationalisation with Sealink on all three sea corridors.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, they were making the strongest possible case for themselves, but I do not think that their submission got the consideration it should have got. I think that minds were already made up, were closed, and, consequently the kind of care and attention that the proposition deserved was not given.</P>
    <P>As I said, I used the ferry to Pembroke &mdash; admittedly there were 50 of our own workers there &mdash; and I found them to be efficient and courteous and anxious to provide a service which is not always the case in regard to our own ships or has not been as far as Sealink were concerned in the past.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate how much money will be provided for Pembroke and as the B &amp; I operation to Pembroke is over, if there is any way in which Irish interests could make use of the facilities so that we would get something back for the money we are bound to keep on paying for some years ahead.  I should like the Minister to indicate how many years that will be.</P>
    <P>We lost 50 jobs at Pembroke and it is a recipe for despair to think that the House is now debating a proposal from <Col N="1762" /> the Minister to provide a sum of £38 million in equity for the B &amp; I in a job cutting exercise rather than in increasing employment especially when unemployment is very high and emigration is getting heavily under way again.  Young people who are studying marine engineering and marine sciences in general in the RTC in Cork and other places are entitled to some positive optimism on the part of the Government with regard to the future of our shipping.</P>
    <P>There were supposed to be 59 job losses if the ferry was transferred from Dublin to Dun Laoghaire.  What is the position in that regard?  The 260 other people who lost their jobs ashore and afloat in the whole exercise cannot be catered for unless developments take place as a result of this investment by the Government in the B &amp; I.  Are there any British redundancies in Sealink?  We have these cosy operations to Holyhead and Fishguard and I should like to know if it was only the Irish company which suffered redundancies.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the new investment in his speech and gave specific examples.  I know a big refurbishment job has been done with a view to improving services.  I have notes here regarding damage to the <i>Wicklow</i> and the <i>Tipperary</i> which happened some time ago.  I should like the Minister to indicate how much of that damage, which is supposed to amount to a substantial figure, is recoverable from insurance and what insurance company provided cover for the B &amp; I at that time.  The 1987 project objective seems to be to make a small profit of £0.5 million.  A contingency fund of £3.5 million was also mentioned.  I hope that means a profit of £4 million rather than the £0.5 million mentioned in various reports and speeches.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to speculate on the possibility of the <i>Innisfallen</i> being sold and that depends on when delivery is taken of the new jumbo, if that ever happens.  I understand there is a new departure in the freight area.  Earlier on I mentioned specific complaints about treatment by hauliers of the freight drivers who are not employed by B &amp; I.  The last <Col N="1763" /> report I got said that the freight service had a turnover of £60 million and assets of £20 million but that it was supposed to be losing money.  What is the position in regard to 1984?  I do not know because the last annual report we got is for 1983. It is not good enough that we do not have a report for 1984 and 1985.  How much money was lost in 1984 in freight?  How much, if any, was lost in 1985?  Perhaps we made a profit but the House would like to know the exact position.  We are buying a pig in a poke in that we do not have annual reports for 1984 and 1985. At one time, as part of the reorganisation of the B &amp; I, it was mentioned that all their trucking operations were to have outside contractors for maintenance which would be a cost reducing factor. Could the Minister give us information in that regard?</P>
    <P>What is the position in regard to the Euro container service in the B &amp; I? There was a proposal in this cosy agreement, of which we are so rightly critical, that the Sealink ro-ro was to be provided with facilities in Dublin ferry port.  Has that happened?  What is the <i>quid pro quo?</i> If we are giving something, are we getting something back?  I mentioned the excellent businessman who now owns Sealink. He appreciated hard bargaining, is a hard bargainer himself and he would appreciate us, as Irish people interested in our own affairs and profits, being just as hard headed and tough as he is.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to individual hauliers standing by in the middle of the night at B &amp; I terminals at Fishguard, Holyhead or Liverpool who feel they have no status.  The B &amp; I effort is an open sesame.  They are fellow drivers but one driver said he was standing around after midnight not knowing whether he would get on the boat.  That is not a proper way to run a business and I should like the Minister to bring that to the attention of the chairman and the board of B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>There were rumours circulating in Rosslare yesterday that the B &amp; I intended to purchase the Irish Continental Line this weekend.  I know there are difficulties in regard to the sale of ICL <Col N="1764" /> and I outlined our party's policy in that regard.  We want ICL maintained in Irish hands, public, private or public cum private. We are not particularly worried about the combination but this profit making company should be retained in Irish hands.  Is any of the money which we are voting here earmarked for the purchase of ICL?</P>
    <P>The figures, when added, are very tight.  It seems that there is no money in this Vote, in this £38 million that we are being asked for.  I would like to know if there is.  Perhaps it is hidden.  If we are prepared to sell the <i>Irish Spruce</i>, a 72,000 tonne dead weight ship, for £3.6 million &mdash; and that is national sabotage or a national scandal &mdash; perhaps we might be able to facilitate the purchase of the <i>Irish Continental Line</i> for a reasonable figure to guarantee that it will remain in Irish hands.  These questions are being asked all the time in transport or shipping by people who have vital interests in that sector.  I am not accusing the Minister of telling an untruth in the House but I am not 100 per cent sure that I got a full answer when I asked him if he had consultants' advice about the purchase of the <i>Irish Continental Line</i> by the B &amp; I.  I wonder if I got the whole truth.  Did Zeus consultants advise the Minister as to whether B &amp; I should purchase the <i>Irish Continental Line</i> or not?  As I indicated earlier, as far as I know Zeus consultants are paid by the Department.  Consequently, we cannot hide behind the excuse that the Minister has no responsibility and that it is the responsibility of the B &amp; I board.  If Zeus consultants are being paid directly by the Minister then we are entitled to know what advice they are giving.  Were there any other consultants asked by the B &amp; I or the Government to advise on the purchase by the B &amp; I of the <i>Irish Continental Line</i>.  We are entitled to the information.  Has the Minister any advice with regard to whether the B &amp; I should purchase the <i>Irish Continental Line</i> or not?  It is an important question, it is a fair question and it is a question to which I am entitled to an answer from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I come now to the section I said I would <Col N="1765" /> come back to, namely section 2, a section which we, as the main Opposition party are opposing <i>rigiditus</i>, absolutely.  We are voting against it because I cannot understand how it is in the Bill at all.  I will read it:</P>
    <P>In determining the remuneration or allowances for expenses to be paid to its officers or servants or the terms or conditions subject to which such officers or servants hold or are to hold their employment, the Company shall have regard either to Government or nationally agreed guidelines which are for the time being extant, or to Government policy concerning remuneration and conditions of employment which is so extant, and, in addition to the foregoing,</P>
    <P>&mdash;This is not just the sting in the tail but a kind of a torpedo&mdash;</P>
    <P>the Company shall comply with any directives with regard to such remuneration, allowances, terms or conditions which the Minister for Communications may give from time to time to the Company with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>That is simply shocking.  I do not understand it.  I do not understand what it is doing in this Bill.  Did the Minister not appoint a very expensive chairman and chief executive aided by a very expensive consultancy firm, and has he not got a board as well as a chief executive and other senior executives in the company to deal with this peculiarly and appropriately company matter?  Why is the Minister usurping the functions of the board and the management of the company?  Is there more expertise in the Department of Communications on industrial relations than is available to the chairman, chief executive, board of management or, for that matter, the Department of Labour?</P>
    <P>It is one of the most ridiculous sections I have ever seen in a Bill in this House. Is the Minister satisfied, for example, that he is not in some way in conflict with company law on the matter?  Surely the members of the board, the chairman and <Col N="1766" /> chief executive must feel uneasy with regard to their obligations.  Surely they must feel uneasy as to what kind of responsibility can be pinned on them by this House or by the employees of the company if this power is being taken as it purports to be taken in this section of the Bill.  I am asking the Minister to withdraw the section altogether.  The appointment of the chairman and chief executive plus Zeus consultants by the Minister was, it is generally believed, a way of getting around the Devlin provisons with regard to salaries for chief executives. Obviously, if this section is put on the Statute Book, no such device will be available to the board or to the employees because the words do not need interpretation but are clear: &ldquo;The company shall comply with any directives with regard to such remuneration, allowances, terms or conditions which the Minister for Communications may give from time to time to the company.&rdquo; So I am asking that section 2 should be deleted from the Bill.  It is an arrogation of power which is fraught with danger for industrial relations and for the status and standing of boards of directors of companies. It has been a tendency in recent times to put a section to this effect into Bills.  It is a graft that will not take; it is a graft that anyway will not produce a great deal of fruit in the field of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word with regard to B &amp; I marketing.  I have mentioned this in the House already.  Special training should be given to the people who have direct personal contact with the public on board Irish-owned ships.  Courtesy should be the theme of intensive courses. I say this because I am conscious that it is not the thing that is uppermost in one's mind when one uses any of the services of B &amp; I, Sealink or ICL.  It is linked into marketing.  Emphasis will have to be placed on customer satisfaction and customer comfort.  I have already mentioned my criticism of the lack of protection for consumer interests due to what is, in effect, a cartel on the Irish Sea.  This is another area that management should concentrate on.  I know of one instance <Col N="1767" /> where a young summer recruit, when a German passenger asked for some information, was told by a member of the staff not to spend too much time explaining, that the less they were told the less he would be persecuted.  That is not an attitude which will develop business for us here; nor will it give us a good reputation internationally for services rendered.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus concentrated very heavily on the idea of the friendly airline.  That is a good marketing ploy. They have made an effort to see to it that their staff live up to that guideline.  They may not always do so, but it is important to have such an objective.  It is important to instil the belief into potential customers that that is the sort of service which is available.</P>
    <P>As far as B &amp; I are concerned, it is important that special courses be given to people who have direct contact with the customers.  They should be properly supervised with customers, to see that that kind of service is available.  Another area to which we should pay some attention is the Eurodimension of B &amp; I, which I mentioned earlier in relation to the challel tunnel.  If B &amp; I purchase ICL it becomes even more important.  I am pleased with what has been stated about the strengthening of B &amp; I management. Nothing but good can come of competent management in a strong position, and I do not mean a fascist or dictatorial position.  They need strong management with objectives, who know where they are going and why.</P>
    <P>Is there any talk of B &amp; I acquiring a controlling interest in the Belfast ferries? These could be linked with the ICL deal, if such a decision is taken.  From reports which I have received with regard to expenditure on the B &amp; I boats, which expenditure is being covered by a section of the money being allocated here, I understand that a reasonably good job has been done.  However, with reference to the Seafort Welding Company who got that job &mdash; and there were complaints that it did not go to a new and smaller <Col N="1768" /> reorganisation in Verolme Cork Dockyard &mdash; there are disturbing rumours that Seafort would not release the refurbished <i>Leinster</i> until the Government paid on the nail, which is an indication of the damage done in shipping circles by what happened in the case of Irish Shipping Limited.  It is a repercussion and captains of ships and sailors say it can still be felt in shipping circles, whereas hitherto the flag and the name connected with any Irish shipping company commanded respect and were more than creditworthy</P>
    <P>An aspect of the Bill to which one must advert since B &amp; I are carrying so much freight &mdash; and I await some information from the reports of 1984 and 1985 and/or from the Minister as to how exactly they are doing in terms of cash at present &mdash; is that Bell's, a substantial freight company, have now been purchased by a Dutch concern.  Again I am pointing out that we must be cautious to make sure that we maintain an Irish shipping influence. CMB of Belgium I gather are now operating, as far as freight is concerned, from Cork.  I am mentioning these matters to point out potential development for Irish companies at this time.</P>
    <P>I must pay tribute to the staff of B &amp; I who earlier invested £300,000 in the company when the company needed such investment.  The Minister for Finance introduced some provisions in this year's budget with regard to workers having shares in their company.  This decision by the B &amp; I workers in the past was an indication of their commitment to their company and is something which we should and could encourage for the future.</P>
    <P>I think I have drawn attention to the fact that the original charter, so to speak, given by the Minister in May of 1985 was that the operation should become profitable by December 1986.  I hope we have not postponed that for a further year.  The co-operation arrangements I have dealt with in fair detail.  Regarding the two year agreement, does this refer to 1986 to 1987 or 1985 to 1986?  I think it is the former, but I should like confirmation on that.  We should watch the new Sealink Company quite carefully.  I am <Col N="1769" /> not in any way denigrating that company, their owner, their activities or their objectives, but self-interest demands that we should watch carefully what is going on.  We should not walk ourselves into a two year agreement which could be used against us by a threat of termination at the end of the two years.  We should keep an open mind, in our own interests.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that the board's proposal originally was for £43 million.  I presume they had justification for the other £5 million.  What was the board's justification?  What were the Minister's reasons for reducing the amount?  Was it the reduction in fuel costs, or interest rates, or what?  Would he let the House know this?</P>
    <P>I am glad of the commitment in the Minister's speech to maintaining a strong Irish presence in shipping services to this country.  Apart from the patriotic ones, there are the practical reasons also.  He said: &ldquo;The amount and phasing of the further equity injections will be closely related to the overall performance of the company against very challenging profit targets which the Minister has set for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am wondering if there are profit targets set by the Minister which he did not mention.  Would he be able to indicate when replying what the target is for 1987, for 1988 and so on?  If he is going to pay out the money over the years 1987 to 1989 and has targets, then the House will be pleased to hear what those targets are, so that the House can keep an eye on the progress of the company with regard to achieving those targets.  He said: &ldquo;The other £13 million is being used to begin the process of restructuring the company's balance sheet by reducing the company's borrowings.&rdquo;  Can the Minister tell us what the company's borrowings are at present?  In the absence of the 1984-85 annual reports we can only make a guess based on what is in the 1983 report which may not be a true reflection of the company's borrowings.</P>
    <P>The Minister devoted a considerable part of his speech to the sales area of car ferries.  I have dealt with that from a different aspect.  I would like the Minister <Col N="1770" /> to commnt on that and to indicate whether he thinks it is worth while to bring it to the notice of the chairman and the board of directors with regard to their future plans and ambitions for the company.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech he said that the battle for market share resulted in an undesirable lowering of standards and led to a situation where reductions in fares were the only means of attracting additional passengers, leading in turn to greater losses.  Clearly such a situation could not continue indefinitely.  Inevitably fares had to rise to cover costs if the services were to continue.  There are people who claim that the rate per mile on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route is too high in comparison with rates for similar journeys in Europe.  If so, we should aim to have competitive rates. When I say competitive rates I mean competitive in contrast to similar journeys to other countries.  We have no competition. This is the danger signal as far as the present arrangement is concerned. I would like the Minister to analyse a little more what he means by &ldquo;to cover costs.&rdquo;  How much of the increase will cover costs?  I think it is 12½ per cent. How much is a make-up for what the Minister states have been losses due to uneconomic cost-cutting in the past?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I support the Bill with the exception of the section which I intend to oppose, and I have indicated to the House that I will oppose and divide the House on it.  I hope the company will become commercially viable, that it will make a profit in the not too distant future. I do not know whether or not 1986 is included.  I do not think it is.  I do not know whether the delphic statement &ldquo;by 31 December 1986&rdquo; means that we are supposed to have a profit in 1986.  I hope the company will insist upon high standards of sales and services on board with a strong eye on Irish interest.  I hope there will be an attempt to give courteous service and that there will be an attempt made to condition the people working in B &amp; I to providing whatever service the customer wants.  There should be an emphasis on that in the future.  People <Col N="1771" /> who have referred the new arrangements to the competition area in the EC should be listened to.  In financial terms we do not want elaborately structured arrangements to be struck out by the European Commission because of competition. With the exception of the section, and that is a very serious exception, we will support the voting of the moneys for the B &amp; I.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I look with a suspicious eye at this Bill which allocates £38 million to the B &amp; I, £20 million of it this year.  As the previous speaker, Deputy Wilson, said we are not in possession of the facts in that we do not have the reports of the last two years, 1984 and 1985.  Therefore, we have to take the Minister's word that this money will be well spent.  It is taxpayers' money and should be put to positive use.  As individuals we are not in a position to make a valid judgment because of the absence of annual reports.</P>
      <P>As a Cork Deputy I look upon the allocation of £38 million to B &amp; I with an envious eye.  When B &amp; I abandoned Cork some years ago we were told the reason was that they wanted to return to profitability and to save the company.  A number of years on we now see that the company are as dependent on Government funding as they were some years ago.  I wonder if there was a need to get out of Cork at that time.  It was a move which has had serious effects on the economy of the whole south western region. The tourist industry went through a traumatic time.  If it were not for the weakening of the dollar in recent years which attracted trans-Atlantic tourists, the tourist industry in the south west would have collapsed.</P>
      <P>There is a complete absence of British tourists in the south west at present.  That is related to the decision made by B &amp; I to get out of Cork some years ago.  That decision came about partly because of the earlier decision to transfer the service to Pembroke.  I am understating the case when I say that was a most stupid decision. I am glad that B &amp; I are now accepting the stupidity of that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> Pembroke is an area which has no proper road infrastructure.  It is miles off the beaten track and is a most unattractive port for any sea-going tourist.  The journey from Britain to Cork has been made all the more difficult because the Rosslare-Cork roads are very bad as far as Waterford.  However, that is all in the past.</P>
    <P>I question the level of accountability that exists in State companies when decisions affecting a whole region can be made.  The company can walk away from that decision many years later and the State is left holding the financial baby. The region is left in a serious condition because of the absence of a ferry link between Cork and Britain, a ferry link which was severed three or four years ago and left Cork without a ferry link to Britain for the first time in over a century. I am glad B &amp; I have admitted that was a mistake.</P>
    <P>I have many questions to ask.  If you want to go to Cork now you have to travel by air.  If we look at the Cork-London and Dublin-London air prices, for an equal distance one pays £24 extra out of or into Cork.  There is unfair competition there by way of another operator.  I regret that local efforts to date in Cork for an alternative ferry run by private enterprise have been unsuccessful but we live in hope.  I am glad the Government have shown a sign of confidence in private enterprise by guaranteeing a certain level of subvention for the ferry in its initial years.  I hope that guarantee will continue into next year and that the people involved will be more successful in 1987 in getting a ferry for the Cork region.</P>
    <P>We have a sinn féin policy in Cork where if the State will not do it for us, we will do it ourselves.  I hope that despite differences of opinion in Cork between individuals we will be successful in getting a ferry for the 1987 tourist season.  This is vital for the whole south-west region, not only for tourism but also for industry because the haulage industry at present are also experiencing difficulties due to the absence of a ferry out of Cork.  The only word of caution and warning I would put out today is that if we are successful <Col N="1773" /> in Cork, and I am sure we will be, in getting and running a ferry as a private enterprise we will not be subjected to unfair competition from a company such as B &amp; I who are State subvented and who can offer attractive temporary offers to squeeze out other opposition.  I will be watching closely when we do get our ferry that taxpayers' money will not be used to squeeze out in an unfair way private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Bill mentions the refurbishment of the B &amp; I vessels.  I hope there will be a role for a new, lean and fit Verolme Dockyard in B &amp; I's plans and that any refurbishing that will be carried out in future years will be carried out at Verolme. I am confident that Verolme will be there again and will be fit, competitive and eager to get business.  I hope that the B &amp; I will make a point of looking with a favourable eye on Verolme.  In the past that was not the case.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed by Deputy Wilson of the possibility of the administration and control of the duty free and catering areas going to a foreign company.  Travelling back on an Aer Lingus flight recently I was very disturbed to see being presented Irish cheese that had been packaged in Britain.  I re-echo the sentiments expressed by Deputy Wilson that we should use Irish goods at all times, where possible.  It is disgraceful that a company such as Aer Lingus, a semi-State company, should be using Irish cheese that is packaged abroad.  This is not a healthy sign and should be questioned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the duty free areas on ships and aeroplanes coming into the country, I want to express serious doubts about the value the public are getting in these shops.  They are getting a reduction in price but they are not getting the full benefits of the elimination of duty.  This should be looked at by the Office of Consumer Affairs because not only are people not getting the value they should be getting but the unfair competition on the part of semi-State bodies such as Aer Rianta, through Aer Lingus, and the B &amp; I in advertising duty free facilities is doing serious damage to business people, <Col N="1774" /> not alone in Cork but also in Dublin, I am sure.  Serious damage is being done to business in our cities because of this unfair competition.  I question it seriously.</P>

      <P>I was going to raise on the Order of Business, but I think this is a proper vehicle by which to do so, the question of the unfair competition on the part of semi-State bodies and the misleading information which is being given out by them.  I will not detain the House too long.  I have received a letter from a constituent of mine who was travelling Aer Lingus to Bristol on business and who visited the duty free shop in Dublin.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for £77.95.  He was stopped by the Customs coming back into Ireland and had to pay VAT at 25 per cent on his purchase.  As a legislator, I am supposed to know the rules of the game, but I did not know that if I bought a watch costing over £68 in a duty free shop or on either an aeroplane or ship coming into Ireland I would have to pay VAT on it.  In <i>Cara</i> magazine a Raymond Veil watch is advertised as costing £99 with the note; &ldquo;save £60 on down town Irish prices&rdquo;.  This is totally misleading information because they omit to show that that watch is liable to VAT of 25 per cent.  Therefore, there is no great saving.  It is unfair competition, it is misleading information and it is a matter that the Office of Consumer Affairs should take up.  It is disgraceful that a semi-State <Col N="1775" /> body should indulge in such a misleading campaign and unfair competition which is doing serious damage to, for instance, the jewellery trade in Cork and in Dublin. As I said earlier, the consumer is not getting the value he should be getting. He is getting a reduction on spirits and cigarettes but the level of reduction is not being fully passed on to him.  It is appropriate to bring this up in the House.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 2, like Deputy Wilson, I would ask the Minister to reconsider his position.  It is to say the least an unhealthy situation where external interference can be brought to bear on a company, even though it is a semi-State company, by the Department of Communications.  I am sure there are very capable people in the Department but at the same time the executives of a company are in the best position to judge what is best for the company.  I may not have agreed totally in the past in relation to B &amp; I in this regard, but with an improvement and a strengthening of the management the company would be best served if total control is left with them. Too often in the past in B &amp; I, other forces and groups have dictated terms within the company.  I hope that is one of the things which has been eliminated. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to reconsider his position in relation to section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill with reservations.  I accept that it is required to assure the future of B &amp; I but I do have the reservations I have already mentioned.  These are in relation to section 2, which I hope the Minister will reconsider and also the role of B &amp; I, especially their role in the past.  Deputy Wilson called on the B &amp; I to look at other ventures.  If the B &amp; I have an expansionist policy, they will have to look at Cork again.  I often meet people who have suffered the journey from Cork to Rosslare, a trip of over 100 miles, then from there on, continuing their journey on bad roads on the other side.  The people of the south-west deserve a better service.  If B &amp; I are going to spend taxpayers' money on new ventures, they will have to reconsider <Col N="1776" /> their position in relation to Cork.  With a proper marketing policy which was not there in the past Cork can be viable.  If private enterprise can do so, provided they are given a fair crack of the whip and not subjected to too much unfair competition, then the B &amp; I, in a revamped organisation with a commitment to Cork, could make a ferry service out of Cork viable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, the purpose of this Bill is to enable the Minister for Finance to provide up to £38 million in additional equity for the B &amp; I company.  We have noted the substantial losses incurred by the B &amp; I in recent years which amounted to more than £43 million, placing the company in a very dangerous position.  I suppose it was necessary for the Government to intervene in order to ensure that there be some link between this country and the outside world.  No doubt the Minister will explain later why £38 million only is being granted and not the full £43 million. Hopefully, the company will be able to make up that £5 million shortfall in the future by way of profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Wilson said earlier, section 2 is a new type of provision, or will be, on our Statute Book, casting doubts on the new management and chief executive of the company.  I believe it does not augur well for the future of semi-State bodies and casts a reflection on their executives. This section should not be included and, as Deputy Wilson stated earlier, we will be opposing it.  Perhaps <Col N="1777" /> the Minister would have a rethink on this matter before the question is put.</P>
    <P>With regard to the granting of the £38 million, it is very difficult for anybody to reach a valid judgment on whether it should be granted because we have not the requisite information available to us to reach such a conclusion.  For example, we have not got to hand either the 1984 or 1985 annual reports, nor have we detailed projections of what will be the future position regarding profits in ensuing years.  Therefore it is guesswork as to whether this is a good or bad investment. It is important that such investment be made to ensure that we have a passenger and freight shipping service between this country and Britain.  From an economic point of view we cannot make a valid judgment on figures not available to us with regard to projections.  There is no reason to believe that a profit will be made in the future.  For many years past projections were made with regard to the B &amp; I and many other companies that did not materialise.  It is important that we be given more information on the background and future projections of the company.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fees paid by the Minister to the consultancy firm, it is important that taxpayers be informed in detail on what this money is being expended, because ultimately it is the taxpayer who will foot the bill and he has a right and entitlement to know.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints over the years about the facilities provided for people using the B &amp; I services, not alone between Dublin and Holyhead but also between Rosslare and Fishguard in comparison with the facilities provided for Sealink.  There have been many complaints to the effect that the train services are more convenient for those passengers using Sealink and that the freight and other facilities provided in the freight area for people using Sealink are better than those for people using B &amp; I.  Such complaints are a cause of concern.  It is important to ensure that the people using the B &amp; I services get equal treatment with those utilising the other services.  It is important also that the consumer be <Col N="1778" /> protected with regard to prices.  The Minister has said that it has been found necessary to increase prices to maintain services, but there has been complaints to the effect that the increases have been greater than needed.  One might pose the question: are the increased prices necessary to maintain the service, to make up for the losses sustained in the past or in order to maintain the day-to-day services? I should like to know whether the present day operations of the B &amp; I are profitable.  I believe there is to be a 12½ per cent increase in prices.  It should be remembered that oil prices have fallen by 51 per cent in the past year.  Both those factors should ensure that the B &amp; I operation will be profitable.</P>
    <P>In Private Members' time last week there was mention of the new Channel tunnel which should result in greatly increased traffic through the Rosslare area.  There has been talk of one ship to operate the Sealink service between Rosslare and Fishguard under the control of a private company operating for profit. However, if a commercial decision was taken to close down that service we would then be in a very invidious position, with no link between the southern part of this country and Britain.  If that were to happen the Minister should ensure that the B &amp; I would be in a position to provide that facility between Rosslare and Fishguard.  The question of the provision of a jumbo ferry is causing some concern.  The port of Fishguard is unsuitable at present for the docking of such a large ship and it would be necessary that the harbour be dredged.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know when that port is likely to be ready or suitable for the docking of such a jumbo ferry.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned there is much dissatisfaction with train links.  The <i>Innisfallen</i> which is plying in the southern corridor, is likely to be put up for sale.  Perhaps the Minister and B &amp; I would be willing to make it available to the group in Cork who are trying to provide a facility between Cork and Britain.  This is vitally important.  The <i>Irish Spruce</i> was sold for a ridiculously low price and it has now <Col N="1779" /> left this nation.  I hope the same fate will not befall the <i>Innisfallen.</i></P>
    <P>I have received many complaints from hauliers who travel on the Rosslare route. They said they do not get equal treatment with regard to booking and so on.  They say B &amp; I give priority to their own business over private firms.  This should not be the case.  B &amp; I are a semi-State company. They receive money from the State to keep them going and they should not be allowed to use their position to the detriment of private firms.</P>

      <P>An arrangement has been made to give a franchise to British firms to operate duty free and catering services.  Why has this happened?  Why was an Irish company not given the catering contract?  No suitable answers have been given to explain these decisions.  It is necessary that answers be given to allay fears that Irish companies are being done down unfairly.  I am sure many Irish firms could provide comparable services at a reasonable price.</P>
      <P>Busloads of people who have travelled from France to Rosslare pass through Midleton each week.  They complain that there are very few Irish products on sale in the Sealink vessel.  They ask why the Government do not impress on the owners of the vessel that this is not good enough.  It is important that we protest if Irish products are not advertised or given equal treatment with other products on this vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago B &amp; I cut their link with Cork.  Since then Cork has not had any sea link with Britain.  This has been a tremendous loss as far as tourism is concerned.  In the past few years there has been much talk about the provision of a boat at least in the summer months to go from Cork to Britain.  B &amp; I were asked for help with such a project but they did not give any.  They felt they would lose trade from Rosslare and Dublin but this is not good enough.  The southern region should have a link by sea with Britain.  One of the reasons why B <Col N="1780" /> &amp; I moved out of Cork was that they incurred great losses there.  They undercut their competitors in order to drive them out of Cork and in doing so they ran up great losses themselves.  This was bad management and has been recognised as such.  Under-cutting to such an extent that one cuts one's own throat does not make for successful business.  It is important that B &amp; I rethink the position in Cork and enable a facility to be provided there next year.  It is too late to provide a boat this year.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I now recognise that it was a bad decision to go into Pembroke.  Brittany Ferries ply successfully between France and Cork.  The traffic between Britain and Cork would be much greater than it is to France.  It is difficult to understand why B &amp; I could not make a success of that when Brittany Ferries can make a success of their run.  A side effect of the B &amp; I closure in Cork has been that there are no freight facilities and the costs incurred by hauliers in the southern region have been greatly increased. Many of the roads between Cork, Kerry and Rosslare are disastrous and were never intended to take juggernauts.  The distance that must be travelled has increased as has the cost of repairs.  The amount of time lost in travelling has also increased.  In these harsh, tough economic times, these extra costs cause extreme hardship to people who are fighting for survival.  If there was a sea link between Cork and Britain those people would be able to stay in business.</P>
    <P>There is great anger in my constituency because the B &amp; I decided to have their ships refurbished in Liverpool.  We are all aware that thousands have emigrated from our region and that many skilled workers in Cobh, Cork city and surrounding areas are idle.  Those workers are capable of carrying out any alterations to ships.  If the Government were concerned about the extent of the unemployment position in that area they should have directed the B &amp; I to carry out the work on those ships in the Verolme dockyards. The B &amp; I executive took a commercial decision to send the work to Liverpool <Col N="1781" /> but the cost has to be borne by the Minister for Communications.  I understand that work on one of the ships in Liverpool was stopped until the Minister issued a guarantee to pay for it.  The failure by the Government to direct that work to Cobh will be remembered by the voters in the constituency at the next election.  People in Cork are anxious to know if the B &amp; I have completely written off Cork.  Have they included the southern region in their future plans?</P>
    <P>I understand that the profitable concern, Irish Continental Line, is to be sold off.  It is important that that concern is retained under Irish control.  Will the Minister direct the B &amp; I to purchase ICL in the event of another Irish concern not being interested?  It would be a shame if that profitable concern, a major link with the Continent, went out of Irish ownership.  We are all aware that in times of crisis private firms, particularly if they are not Irish, do not consider the wellbeing of the country as a priority.  It is ridiculous to think of selling a profitable company to foreigners.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister mentioned a two year agreement and I should like to know if it is his intention to enter into another agreement with B &amp; I after that.  When will that agreement commence?  We must know if in two years time we will not have any say in what will happen on the Rosslare-Fishguard route. I hope the Minister deals with that matter in the course of his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us it is not proposed to give £38 million in 1986 but to give it in the period between 1987 and 1989.  He said that the amount and phasing of the further equity injections will be closely related to the overall performance of the company against very challenging profit targets.  The latter phrase sounds very like Civil Service or consultancy language. Facts are not disclosed but nice English is used to make something look good.  I prefer to deal in facts and figures and I hope the Minister can give us the exact details rather than relying on general statements.</P>
    <P>In the absence of reports for 1984 and 1985 is the Minister in a position to give <Col N="1782" /> us some idea of borrowings by the company? It is important that we should be told that the £38 million we are giving to the company will not have any effect on the company's borrowings.  The Minister should insist on the company having any repair work to their ships carried out in Cork where excellent work has been done.  It is worth noting that the recent ship built for the Naval Service at Cork is in great demand thoughout the world. It is a pity the skilled workforce there are not put to work repairing and refurbishing Irish ships.  I must protest at the decision to send repair work to Liverpool. The Government had the power to direct the company to have that work carried out in Cork where, I have no doubt, it could have been done at an economic rate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill with the exception of section 2.  It is essential that we should have a ferry service between here and the British mainland and I trust the new arrangements will ensure that the B &amp; I will be profitable in the future and will give people using their ships the service they deserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Skelly for facilitating me and allowing me an opportunity at this stage to speak on the Bill.  The reality is that it is a loss funding Bill for B &amp; I.  It constitutes simply the putting of money by the taxpayer into meeting the losses which have accrued in B &amp; I over the years.  I must say at the outset that the speech of the Minister of State this morning was most inadequate and unsatisfactory, and well he should know it.  Almost no details were given, figures were not given, though it was essential that they should have been given in view of the fact that this company have failed to publish any accounts for 1984 or 1985.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister gave us very little information in his very short, skimpy and inadequate speech which glossed over the reality of the position and tried to put a face on something that is pretty frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm for the House to remind itself that only a few months before the <Col N="1783" /> final collapse of Irish Shipping Limited a Bill almost exactly similar was brought before the House.  It was supposed to be the salvation of Irish Shipping, and a substantial amount of money was voted. All that money was lost, plus a huge additional amount.  I wonder are we seeing the same thing here now.  Nobody can be certain that we are not seeing it and it is regrettable, in these circumstances, after an appalling performance by this company over the years, that such an inadequate speech was made by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>In his speech we were given the assurance that throughout the period there will be detailed monitoring of the company's commercial performance by the Department of Communications.  That is great reassurrance for the taxpayers, because one has only got to look at the track record of the Department of Communications in monitoring the commercial performance of a State owned shipping company.  When one looks at this, one is not just entitled but bound to ask what value, therefore, is there in that assurance.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the individuals in the Department.  Their training and background do not enable them to monitor the commercial performance of any company. So far as I am aware there is not a single chartered accountant in the Department of Communications and, on the basis of what has happened in regard to Irish Shipping, this assurance might well have been omitted from the speech.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is little or no hard information in the speech, but one of the few bits of information we can glean is on page two of the speech.  The Minister said that among the board's proposals for the future of this company is the development of the existing co-operation arrangements with Sealink through a new two-year agreement.  That is an ominous development.  I was aware of the existing cartel arrangement but I was not aware that it is proposed to enter into a further one.  If it is, the least we should be given are details of that new two-year cartel <Col N="1784" /> arrangement.  I was glad to hear some concern expressed here today about the existence of this cartel.  I referred to it in a speech to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on 2 May last, and I should like to quote what I said then because I think it is even more relevant now when we know that a further such agreement is being entered into for a further two years.  I said then:</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the policy of promoting a cartel between Sealink and the B &amp; I Line has merited so little reaction from the tourist trade or from industry and commerce.  We know very well, from our experience of the operation of cartels in the air, that having one among sea carriers is a recipe for high fares and inefficiency.  Consumer interests estimate that in 1986 sea fares between Britain and Ireland are almost 30 per cent higher than before the cartel was formed two years ago.  This is unacceptable when inflation is running at 3 per cent for this year.  Fares between Britain and Ireland are now 60 per cent higher than on sea routes of similar distance between England and France.</P>
    <P>I am writing to the Office of Fair Trading in London to draw their attention to the existence of this cartel between B &amp; I and Sealink in the hope that they will exercise the same powers which they exercised last year in bringing to an end similar arrangements between English and French sea carriers on the English Channel.  I think that the Chambers of Commerce should be vigilant in this matter also.</P>
    <P>I concluded:</P>
    <P>Protectionism in transport is of no more value to this country than protectionism in industry would be if it still existed.  Those involved in our transport policy and in our transport companies should learn from the slow and painful lessons gleaned in industry by those who thought that they could stop the clock.  In Irish industry those who were averse to competition and <Col N="1785" /> thought that they could prolong protectionism and inefficiency have long since perished.  Those who sought to become efficient and competitive have survived and prospered.  The lesson is clear for all to read.</P>
    <P>It is very disturbing to find that this arrangement, which already has had the serious consequences I outlined there, in huge fare increases, no competition, inordinately high fares on the Irish Sea, will be continued and perhaps even intensified. We do not know.  All we are told is that there will be a new two-year agreement following the previous one of two years.  We now have the most unhappy position that so far as transport on the Irish Sea is concerned there is a cartel in operation both in the air and on the sea.  Consequently, we have inordinately high fares both in the air and on the sea.  This is extremely damaging to tourism and to industry and employment here.</P>
    <P>In the arrangement that has been described there will be no B &amp; I ship operating from Rosslare, no Irish ship.  It does not matter, because the revenues will be pooled anyway.  I cannot imagine anything more calculated to produce inefficiency than the sort of tragic situation we have had from a similar cartel arrangement in the air.  Instead of encouraging this kind of arrangement, the Government should be stepping in to put a stop to it.  It is their duty to do so because it cannot be other than seriously damaging to allow this to develop and to be continued.  Indeed, the Minister of State in his speech envisages the possibility of this arrangement being extended again at the end of the two year period if, as he said, it is considered desirable.</P>
    <P>The unwillingness to compete and having an artifical cosy arrangement of this kind should not be tolerated, and the Government's and the Department's attitude is entirely wrong.  It is perfectly clear that this kind of cartel arrangement which apparently B &amp; I are being encouraged to enter into is in flagrant breach of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>We are in the happy situation that the <Col N="1786" /> present Competitions Commissioner, Mr. Sutherland, is someone who is strongly of the view that these sorts of practices should be swept aside and that normal competition rules under article 85 and the other relevant articles should be enforced fully.  He might well direct his attention to the arrangement now being entered into.  It is not just potentially damaging: it has already been proved how damaging it is by the absolutely inordinate fare increases over the past two years.  They were entirely without justification, except to pay for the inefficiencies and losses that were built up by the company in question.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of evidence that the Commission are moving strongly against these sort of practices.  Within the past month or so enormous fines, totalling 57.8 million ECUs, were imposed on a number of European firms for engaging in precisely the kind of practice that is now getting official encouragement here. It was said at the time that the high level of fines reflected the Commission's view that market sharing and price fixing were particularly serious violations of EC treaties regarding competition rules.  What have we here but precisely that &mdash; market sharing, price fixing and an agreement not to compete.  This House is asked to give its blessing to activities that are clearly disallowed by the Treaty of Rome, and for good reason.</P>
    <P>It seems to me extraordinary, in a speech introducing a Bill of this kind and providing for another £38 million of taxpayers' money to meet the accumulated losses of the B &amp; I, that no mention has been made of Irish Shipping, and in particular of Irish Continental Lines and their future.  The story going the rounds is that B &amp; I are about to take over Irish Continental Lines.  I have mixed feelings about that.  I suppose it is a good thing if nobody else is prepared to take them over that somebody should and that it should be an Irish company.  However, I hope Irish Continental Lines will not acquire the practices that have apparently been endemic in the B &amp; I for quite a number of years.</P>
    <P>The only light one sees in all of this is <Col N="1787" /> the attitude of the new Managing Director of B &amp; I, Mr. Spain, in trying to come to grips with the appalling problems he inherited when he took on the job.  I should like to congratulate him for his resolute and determined approach, but the fact that it has been necessary for him and his colleagues to do the kind of things they have had to do in the past year is an indictment of what was going on in the company before that time.  Some of the practices within B &amp; I that came to public attention were almost incredible and it is difficult to understand how the previous management could have allowed that situation to develop and continue for quite a number of years.  I wonder what monitoring was carried out with regard to that development over those years?  Why was an effort not made to put a stop to what was happening?  In effect, the B &amp; I were being run by people other than the management who seemed to have washed their hands of responsibility in the matter.  The consequences were enormous losses which the taxpayer is being called upon in this Bill to fund.</P>
    <P>The situation now existing in B &amp; I raises all kinds of questions about the whole matter of accountability in the public service and in State companies. This appalling state of affairs was allowed to arise but that does not seem to matter. The only real consequence is that a Bill is introduced here and all kinds of flowery assurances are given about the future, in almost the same kind of words that were used when discussing the future of Irish Shipping when a similar Bill was introduced in 1984.  Quite gaily, we vote large amounts of public money to fund losses that accrue because of extraordinary ineptitude over a period of years.  If this were to happen elsewhere the consequences would be very different but it seems to be almost taken for granted that some of our publicly owned companies can be run in this way and that it does not matter because ultimately we can have recourse to the taxpayer for large amounts of money to bail out the company concerned.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any alternative to what <Col N="1788" /> has been put before the House.  I do not see any point in closing down the company and having a repetition of the disastrous situation of Irish Shipping.  I see some hope at least in the attitude of Mr. Spain and in the efforts he and his colleagues are making.  I only wish there had been somebody like Mr. Spain in the company several years earlier when the dreadful state of affairs now existing could have been averted.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Minister to tell us the exact position with regard to Irish Continental Lines.  That should have been done in his opening speech.  It is quite unsatisfactory for the House to have to speculate about the whole matter &mdash; indeed, it is unsatisfactory for us to have to speculate about so much.  We are entitled to an explanation from the Minister and from the company for the non-appearance of any accounts for two years, while at the same time they come along looking for substantial amounts of money with not even the most basic form of accountability for their stewardship in 1984 and 1985.</P>
    <P>The most important factor involved is what services will be available on the Irish Sea and at what cost to the consumer. Unfortunately, what is happening is that the services are being reduced.  B and I are pulling out of Rosslare and are allowing the route to be operated by Sealink. They are reducing the capacity they offer for passengers and freight and, at the same time, they are entering into a cartel arrangement that is in complete breach of the Treaty of Rome.  They are reducing capacity, increasing fares, pooling revenue and failing to complete.  The net result for people who have to use these services is that an even worse service becomes available with less frequency and as much higher prices.  That cannot but be damaging to the Irish economy, particularly to tourism and no less so to industry and commerce generally.  That is regrettable, These are the sort of points that should be dealt with in the Minister's reply.  They should have been covered in his opening speech, but the type of speech he made was not good enough.  It was chillingly similar to a speech made in this <Col N="1789" /> House in relation to Irish Shipping only a few months before the final total collapse with astronomical losses, of that State owned shipping company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought this debate would not be very constructive but I am glad it has taken the turn it has.  This reminds me of the debate on the Air Transport Bill when we had more or less the same line up.  At that time I spoke after Deputy O'Malley and followed some of the lines he took, although he was much more trenchant and perspicacious than I was.</P>
      <P>This is a very short Bill with serious implications.  In my notes for my contribution to this debate I have points like trade, Sealink plus B &amp; I equals BA plus Aer Lingus and comment on consultancy. I ask now, as I have done in most of my contributions lately, that attention be drawn to the points I am making so that the Minister will give me a reply. Usually my call is ignored but I would like my comments to be addressed today. I would like my comments to be considered even if in the long run they are cast aside, as usually happens in this House when the numbers game is played. For those who are interested, the numbers game means that the side with the majority wins all the time and the Minister does not have to be too concerned about the form of legislation which is being brought in because he knows it will be carried, regardless of what points are raised in the debate.</P>
      <P>Since I came into this House a few short years ago I noticed that we are famous for passing colossal amounts of money on the nod.  We have now reduced our Estimates debates to about two and a half hours.  Taking away the Minister's contribution and the Opposition spokesman's contribution, we are left with about 30 minutes to discuss an Estimate. Last week an estimate for £272 million for the Department of Defence was passed but many of us did not get an opportunity to contribute.  We also had to nod through the House £80 million for the North Atlantic route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I want to make is that this is taxpayers' money, as Deputy <Col N="1790" /> Allen, Deputy Ahern and probably Deputy Wilson mentioned &mdash; I did not hear all of Deputy Wilson's speech.  In the last few weeks a Bill was brought in here liberalising the haulage business, opening it to all licensees.  The Minister thought this would be wonderful for business, trade and the consumer because the businesses would be more competitive and only the fittest would survive.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind that £29 million was given over the past three or four years to prop up this company and we are now asked for a further £38 million. This company are killing the haulage business.  Other haulage companies cannot compete because the B &amp; I are selling below cost.  I am glad the Government will be bringing in a Bill very shortly to outlaw below cost selling in supermarkets because approximately 5,000 small businesses have closed throughout the country.  One of the most hard working groups in our community are the hauliers, many of whom go into debt, risk their homes and their futures and work every hour God gives them to try to make a profit.  A haulier might invest in a tractor for, say, £50,000 and hope he will not be involved in a crash, or that it will not be vandalised and that he will get enough business to keep him going over the next four, five or six years to pay off this debt. He will repair the tractor himself and he will try to find some place near his home to park it so that it will not be damaged. Then he must compete in the market place, but with whom?  He must compete with B &amp; I, and they take the skids from under him.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I cannot compete with these people on equal terms.  For the last number of years they have made a mess of their business.  They have lost colossal amounts of money.  They are grossly inefficient and the most complimentary thing one could say about the service they provide to their unfortunate passengers is that they provide the nearest thing to steerage class accommodation, the kind of service Irish people availed of when they crossed the Atlantic in the days of the coffin ships, with puke all over the <Col N="1791" /> decks, filthy and appalling cafeteria facilities, inefficiency and so on, but they provide the wonderful facility of gaming and gambling machines on their ships so that seven year olds can play them with their holiday pocket money when crossing the Irish Sea.  A member of the Oireachtas smashed a couple of these machines in a rage over the past year or two because five, six and seven year olds were not prevented from using them.</P>
    <P>This company operate unfair competition and I hope before Committee Stage the Minister will give careful consideration to the points I have made.  What do the B &amp; I charge for container traffic to Britain and back as opposed to other haulage businesses?  If it is proved that they are charging well below what the hauliers can charge, then in order to justify giving taxpayers' money to this company, they should be told to desist from this practice in the future, in the same way it is proposed to forbid below cost selling in super markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the steps he takes to satisfy himself that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions operates efficiently; and if any review of the operations of the office are proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The efficient operation of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is primarily a matter for the director himself.  However, the Attorney General is informed from time to time by the director of matters pertaining to the functions of the director.  Where appropriate the Attorney General informs the <Col N="1792" /> Taoiseach of these matters.  The operation of the system of criminal justice is kept constantly under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach review the efficiency of the operation of the office, and is he concerned that there are continuing long delays in the preparation of books of evidence from that office?  It is now taking perhaps between eight and ten weeks &mdash; I am informed &mdash; to have these books ready and on occasions many district justices become very annoyed about this and strike the cases out.  That has happened on a number of occasions.  Secondly, would the Taoiseach agree that, by reason of the volume of work in the office, it might be prudent to examine the possibility of retaining solicitors and barristers as fulltime employees of the office who would also conduct the advocacy on the prosecutions in court rather than to rely on outside panels to do that?  Thirdly, would the Taoiseach consider that where possible controversy arises, not in cases generally, it might be considered appropriate that reasons be given for a decision by the DPP not to institute a prosecution in a particular case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The adequacy of the staffing is kept under review and additions have been made recently to staff.  I believe the situation is satisfactory at the moment but I will keep it under review in the light of what the Deputy has said and I will make further inquiries as to the alleged delays and the reasons for them and to what extent, if any, they relate to any problems of the kind mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's second question, I have doubts about that proposal but I note the Deputy's suggestion and will take it into account.  The general approach to that at present is probably the better one but I will not exclude the point from consideration, as the Deputy has made it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Deputy's third point, a consistent policy has been pursued by successive Attorneys General before the appointment of the DPP and maintained by the <Col N="1793" /> DPP since then of refusing to give publicly reasons for decisions not to prosecute. This is not due to any reluctance to be accountable for the decisions but to the fact that the policy of giving reasons would inevitably in many cases mean serious damage to the reputation of individuals. I do not believe that one could be selective in this and give reasons in some cases and not in others without creating even far more problems and far more controversy about why in this case the reasons are given and in another case they are not given.  I think the policy pursued by successive Attorneys General and successive Governments and by the DPP in this respect is the only practical policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach have another look at this question of giving reasons?  Take a case such as happened in my constituency, and I am sure has happened elsewhere, where a person has died or been killed in a set of circumstances, papers are sent in to the Office of the DPP and he examines them and makes up his mind on whether to prosecute. That decision he makes on whether to prosecute, will the Taoiseach not agree, is a kind of judicial decision in itself, irrespective of what may transpire afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Being a kind of quasi judicial decision, where a decision was taken not to prosecute, the members of the family of that person who died were, understandably, very distressed and could get no explanation, answer or reason.  In special circumstances of that nature, could some scheme be devised to meet the feelings of the family in such a position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one final supplementary question on a slightly different point.  Will the Taoiseach agree to review the question of the decentralisation of the office to some extent?  Would it be considered that one centralised DPP Office to serve the entire country with communications coming from west, north, south and east <Col N="1794" /> on perhaps relatively minor matters on occasion might not be the best way of doing it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a measure of decentralisation of the prosecution procedures through the existing mechanism, but the ultimate decision must rest with the DPP.  I do not see that you can decentralise the DPP.  He is there under Statute to fill a particular function and he has to be responsible ultimately for the decisions.</P>
      <P>On the question of giving reasons, I readily understand the concern on some occasions when it has not been possible to give an explanation to people who are distressed or upset at the failure to prosecute.  However, the decision not to prosecute is as serious as prosecuting and it is not practical to give reasons for decisions without the danger of serious damage to the reputation of individuals. It must be accepted that the distress and damage caused by departing from that principle will be very much greater than a process of selectivity in regard to deciding to give reasons in some cases and not in others.  That would be the worst of all worlds.</P>

    <P>In the same period the industrial Civil Service, which is not subject to the one in three embargo arrangement, fell by some 700 posts.  The overall reduction in the Civil Service was therefore of the order of 3,900.</P>
    <P>The one in three embargo has been a very effective, if somewhat inflexible, means of reducing the size of the non-industrial Civil Service.  As I indicated recently in the debate on my Department's Estimate, arrangements are in train for the replacement of the one in three embargo by a system under which the overall staffing level to be reached by each Department a year hence will be determined.  The levels to be achieved by end-1986 will, I expect, be fixed soon.</P>

      <P>As there has been a reduction of 3,900 jobs in the public sevice, does the Minister agree that if the present rate continues at the level of the past four or five years, the public service will effectively cease to operate?  If he agrees, could he state at what stage the situation will be reviewed?</P>

      <P>The national plan provides for the continuation of the restriction on numbers entering the public service, at least until the end of 1987.  As I said in my reply, the rather inflexible operation of the embargo has <Col N="1796" /> been changed to a new system to provide for staffing targets which will ensure greater flexibility within Departments.  In so far as reductions are concerned, there are two points to be made.  While these posts have been lost as a result of the embargo, other areas have received additional staff which means that all three posts have not been lost in the Civil Service. Where particular staffing needs arose in the Department of Social Welfare or the prison service, additional posts were created.  The other point which should be made is that as a result of the embargo there is no doubt that there has been a considerable increase in productivity and efficiency within the Civil Service.  If you take into account the overall number, approximately 30,000, obviously there is a point beyond which one cannot go in terms of reduction of numbers.  Essentially we are seeking an efficient and cost effective Civil Service which will do the job as well as possible without imposing undue burdens on the taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>We all probably share those general sentiments.  However, does the Minister agree that he received a number of representations from trade unions involved in the public service and that certain Departments, such as Revenue and Social Welfare are finding difficulty, even taking into consideration the efficiency to which the Minister referred, in carrying on a normal efficient service because of lack of manpower?  Does the Minister also agree that flexibility is required so that the decision to restrict on the basis of three in one is not applied globally to achieve bottlenecks or additional responsibilities that might occur from time to time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some trade unions made their views known on certain aspects of this question and I assure the Deputy that those views are fully considered in the context of the overall constraints which apply.  I am also aware that there are problems and bottlenecks in certain areas.  The Department of the Public Service <Col N="1797" /> endeavour to approach such problems by undertaking reviews of different Departments in relation to their staff needs and by discussing with them the introduction of new technology which might help to ease such problems.</P>
      <P>There is a need for flexibility and that is why the present proposal is to withdraw the current embargo in the Civil Service and to replace it with a staffing target approach.  In finalising details of the staffing targets for Departments and taking into account their particular needs, such as those mentioned by the Deputy, it is obvious that there will be a degree of flexibility.  In the context of the change from the embargo to the staffing target approach, there will be flexibility within the relevant Departments as to which vacancies will be filled.  I accept the point raised by the Deputy in regard to flexibility and I assure him that the new approach will give extra flexibility which will help to solve problems in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that, as a result of negotiations which I have had with the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants, agreement has been reached with that union on arrangements for the implementation of all their outstanding arbitration findings.  The arrangements take account of the special aspects of these findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> The agreement provides that an allowance for certain agricultural officers on beef classification duties will be paid in full in accordance with the arbitrator's findings.  It also provides for the implementation, from 1 May 1986, of certain increases in pay for other groups, including agricultural officers and forester grades.  Any balance of the increases recommended by the arbitrator for these groups will be paid on a phased basis from 1 December 1986, 1 December 1987 and 1 July 1988.  In addition, <i>ex-gratia</i> lump sum payments will be paid on a phased basis over the next four years, commencing in July 1986.</P>
    <P>The agreement is in the context of the acceptance by the union of the other elements in the package of proposals, covering the 25th round and other pay-related matters, negotiated with the Civil Service unions in January last.  The arrangements which I have outlined in relation to the arbitration findings for forester grades and other groups will be implemented as soon as possible after the union signify their acceptance of the overall package.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I would like to clarify a few points.  Do I now take it that the nine grades of staff for whom claims have been put in by the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants will be paid in full and that the only difference is that the period of payment has been changed? Will the full retrospection for the six grades as well as the three who have already been offered a settlement now be paid in full?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the complexity of this group of nine and I am conscious of time constraints.  The increases as recommended in the rates of pay by the Arbitrator would be paid in full over the phased period.  In regard to sums of retrospection so-called &mdash; if the Deputy accepts that as a shorthand description of moneys involved &mdash; six of the nine awards have a phased reduced amount of payment in relation to the amount of retrospection that would <Col N="1801" /> otherwise have fallen due if the Arbitrator's award had been paid in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the complexities of this and I do not know how the Minister will calculate it.  But could the Minister give an idea of the percentage reduction on the full payment of the Arbitrator's award?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give it but I would prefer to give it in writing to the Deputy in the form of a tabular statement because it is of such a complex nature that I do not have that information in ready form.  So as not to mislead the House I would not like to put it on the record of the House now.  But I will undertake to write to the Deputy with the full details.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  The statements put out in the media &mdash; I am not sure if they came from the Minister's office or from the Government's press team &mdash; were very misleading.  To somebody who knows the figures and calculations as well as I do, the figures appear to be either in error or set out to mislead the public.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be implemented in the context of the timetable I set out in my earlier reply as one of the nine awards to which Deputy Ahern referred.  At all times my Department or any Department that I have been responsible for have dealt with factual information in relation to figures as they have occurred.  If the Deputy is referring to anything specific that emerged as misleading information, in his view, from the Department of the Public Service and if he could give me sight of it or draw my attention to it I could give him an answer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The pay and conditions of the public service workers referred to in the Deputy's question are the result of the operation of the process of free collective bargaining over the years.  The services of the Labour Court or other independent adjudication are an established part of this process.  In many instances the present pay levels of workers in this group have, in fact, been determined as a result of Labour Court or adjudication findings.</P>
      <P>The system of free collective bargaining supported, where necessary, by the services of the Labour Court, has long been accepted by both sides as the appropriate method of pay determination for this group of public service workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean that these groups of workers have, over the years and to date, had separate negotiations on their own pay claims or is it the case that the Minister issues guidelines on public sector pay which are then the norm laid down for the workers? Is it the position that percentage guidelines are laid down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1803" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I give an outline? The process of pay determination as it stands here today is subject to negotiation by both sides.  It is for that reason that the Employer Labour Conference are sitting at this moment attempting to find the basis of a solution of a dispute in relation to pay.  There is no imposed pay upon anybody.  Free collective bargaining, with all that implies, is the way in which pay is determined in our economy. As long as I am involved in any Government, that is the way it will continue to be.</P>
      <P>With respect to the category of workers to which the Deputy refers, described as generally on low levels of pay, in the first instance within the framework of collective bargaining it is for their representative organisations to argue direct for and propose a package in relation to their levels of pay.  I should tell the House, and the Deputy in particular, that in the context of the 25th round the package which was negotiated with the general body of unions representing the different categories was negotiated and accepted with reference to its being put to ballot by the officials and representatives of the unions to their general members.  In the first instance I think it is up to the representative workers' organisations and low paid workers to propose an alternative to the package. Should that alternative involve substituting floors of payment, lump sum payments, or flat rate increases as distinct from percentages, then it is up to them to say so.  That has not been the case in the context of the 25th round in the manner in which the negotiations finally concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into any argument on the current dispute. I am particularly interested in the Minister's attitude to the low paid workers in the public service.  I am sure he will agree there are workers whose pay is low and who have great difficulty in managing in these times.  I am sure he will also agree that a general percentage rise does not as adequately recompense low paid workers <Col N="1804" /> as it does high paid workers for general increases in costs, different changes in family circumstances and so on.  In future pay rounds, would the Minister give special consideration to low paid workers in what has now become the norm, where he issues pay guidelines for the public service?  We will not then have one percentage figure given as the norm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not unsympathetic to what the Deputy has suggested &mdash; on the contrary.  However, it would be more appropriate in the first instance if the unions representing such categories of workers were to indicate the kind of alternative to percentage increases, which latter have been the norm in recent years in our free collective bargaining process. Within the spirit of collective bargaining it would be for them, in the first instance, to suggest the alternative they would like to see.  I give the Deputy an undertaking that we would be prepared to look at such alternatives should they emerge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. O'Toole) Paddy O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of persons in receipt of the <Col N="1807" /> undermentioned pensions and allowances are as follows:</P>
      <P>Military service pensions, 1,002; Special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts, 2,245; War of Independence disability pensions, 32; Allowances for widows of War of Independence veterans, 7,163.</P>
      <P>The means test applicable to the special allowances has been relaxed progressively over the years and is now far from severe.  If it were further modified to permit of the grant of an allowance, irrespective of means, every military service pensioner and medical holder, no matter how well off he or she might be would automatically be entitled to the maximum rate of the allowance in the same way as the most needy veteran who had no assessable means.  Such a modification would confer no extra benefit on the most needy veteran and would defeat the whole purpose of the special allowance scheme, which is to assist a veteran who is in needy circumstances.  A means test is essential to ensure that the maximum benefit is channelled to those whose need is greatest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reconsider that decision?  Those people who have been decorated should be considered for a special allowance without a means test.  There are so few left and in view of the service which they gave to the country in former years, we owe this to them.  I implore the Minister not to impose a means test in these cases in future.  I do not agree with him when he says that the means test was relaxed recently.  I do not think that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the reason in my formal reply for the means test being applied, this is, to cater for the most needy people.  If the means test were abolished, they would not gain one iota from that abolition because no means are assessed against them.  I shall give the Deputy two examples.  Many of these people are in receipt of social welfare benefit.  In the case of a single man with an old age contributory pension of <Col N="1808" /> £54.90p a week, the assessment against him is 62½ per week, for the purpose of an allowance.  That is going beyond what might be expected in relaxing the means test.  Another example is a single man with an old age non-contributory pension of £47.70p who has 5p per week assessed against him for the purpose of eligibility for the pension.  The assessments are so low that they do not make any difference.</P>

      <P>The examples I gave referred to people in receipt of social welfare benefit.  I agree with Deputy McEllistrim that these people did give service to the country in their time but many, fortunately, are not dependent on the State.  They have private means.  Any relaxation of the means test would be of benefit only to those who have no need of assistance, whereas those really in need would not gain one iota.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Commencing on 25 May 1986 I made an official visit, extending over a period of six days, to the Irish contingent of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and to our troops in Cyprus.  The visit enabled me to see, at first hand, the conditions under which Irish troops are required to operate. Despite the generally unsatisfactory situation in South Lebanon, I am satisfied that the presence of UNIFIL affords protection and humanitarian assistance to the local population and provides a relative stability and sense of security.  This assessment was reinforced by my visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety and welfare of Irish personnel are a source of constant concern to the Government and we are continuing to monitor developments in Lebanon very <Col N="1809" /> closely.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Irish officers and men serving with the United Nations for their exemplary dedication and courage in performing their difficult tasks.</P>
    <P>During my visit, I availed of the opportunity to have discussions with the Minister for Justice and for South Lebanon and the Commander-in-Chief of the Lebanese Army.  In my discussions, I raised the matter of the disappearance on 11 April 1986 of the Belfast teacher, Mr. Brian Keenan.  I was given firm assurances that they would use their best endeavours to secure his safe release.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Irish troops have every opportunity of fulfilling the mandate which is to bring peace and stability to the area?  Is he satisfied that sufficient national and international pressure is coming from this country to ensure that they are not being deprived of the opportunity through infiltration by other interests in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish troops are not fulfilling their mandate, nor is any other contingent there.  They are not being allowed fulfil their mandate.  We have, on a bilateral basis and also within the international community, protested at the fact that our troops in their peacekeeping role are not allowed to fulfil their mandate totally which is the preservation of the integrity of the geographical area of South Lebanon.  That is not taking place because of the presence of Israeli forces in the security zone and Israeli-backed forces within the area of operation of the Irish contingent known as the South Lebanese Army or the <i>de facto</i> forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that his statement after his visit to the Lebanon indicated that he might not review the next battalion for peacekeeping forces in the Lebanon and that the impression was given that the considerations that would lead to the withdrawal of our services there are purely financial? Judging by the Minister's reply I agree <Col N="1810" /> with him that there is not the co-operation that one would wish to see with the other countries to fulfil their mandate as a peacekeeping force.  I hope that our considerations in withdrawing our help to these countries is not based purely on financial reasons.  Some countries do not meet the levies that are due to the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that I am not responsible for headlines in newspapers.  I am responsible for certain statements which are attributed to me. On the occasion of my return from the Lebanon I said that we were owed large sums of money in relation to this operation in the Lebanon and that a time would come when the financial aspect of our commitment must be taken into consideration. We cannot go on indefinitely providing this facility without getting some recompense in the form of financial aid from the agency who asked us to go there and to whose request we responded generously with our young men.  That matter has been under consideration for some time as, I am sure, the Deputy is aware. It is something about which I am not happy.  We have protested and made representations to the United Nations authorities.  They point out, and rightly so, that they are short of finance because member states are not paying their share into the kitty.  That is the UN's problem but we are the victims at the end of the queue.  I understand that the same problem arises in relation to the other participating nations in UNIFIL.</P>

    <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the cost of ordinary incidental snacks in barracks seems to be at a standard figure throughout the year despite the fact that the consumer cost of the food involved dropped at various times?  This does not seem to be taken into account. Will the Minister review the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Snacks are a discretion-ary aspect of a person's daily intake of food.  The deduction made in respect of normal meals for soldiers living in barracks is £1.57 per day.  This has not been increased since 1983.  It indicates that the level of prices has been taken into account.  A reduction of £1.57 per day is very reasonable in relation to food.</P>

I am sure that not alone would his Department but all statutory agencies, county councils, urban councils, town commissioners, Garda Síochána, the Irish Red Cross and all other agencies would be involved and the nation would be aware of the seriousness of the situation and would be educated in how they should respond to it.</P>

      <P>That is precisely what national fallout day is all about.  As the Deputy is aware, it is done both through television and radio.  We involve the meteorological services, the warden services, the scientific intelligence officers and the message centre staff, the Army observer corps, the Garda Síochána and, as the Deputy indicated, RTE and Irish Lights.  They are all involved in national fallout day, which is a very effective exercise. Yesterday I had a meeting with Civil Defence.  As well as that type of service I suggested that they should look at it on a regional basis on a more frequent level so that we can get instant action.  Everybody is aware of the national fallout day and they are tuned up to it.  What I would like to see from time to time in the regional areas is a test on the ground within 24 hours notice.  That is what it has to be in the event of any such holocaust. I hope that national fallout day will meet with what the Deputy is asking for.  I accept the point the Deputy has made that we have to be very much more alert on the ground with regard to the possibility of any further problems in relation to nuclear fallout.  I am satisfied that Civil Defence are examining this and are very much aware of it.  There will be a different approach in the future.</P>

I should say, however, that the Defence Forces are maintained and equipped at an appropriate level to meet the demands made on them.  They are highly trained in modern weaponry and techniques and there is a planned capacity for an escalatory response should the prevailing circumstances so require.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to say that I do not necessarily want to give any undue weight to this report, but would the Minister not consider it important to acquire a copy of the report and respond to it in view of the fact that it may well be used as part of a policy making process by the NATO countries? This institute is a NATO related body, according to the press report.  They have made a number of serious claims in relation to our security.  Would the Minister indicate whether he is prepared to respond to the report?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that I will be getting a copy of the report and, having read it, responding to it, if I feel a response is necessary.  In relation to the context in which the report appeared let me say the Government's <Col N="1815" /> defence policy &mdash; this would colour a response if a response was to be made &mdash; is based on military neutrality outside of any military alliances and it is directed towards preserving the sovereignty of the State.  That policy was reiterated as late as 1982 by the Government.  If we approach the question of the contents of this report in that context it puts us on a fairly solid footing.  It is up to us to take the appropriate steps within the context of our neutrality to make sure that we have sufficient strength to look after ourselves. I accept that, no matter what a country of this size may have in weaponry and equipment, circumstances could arise that we could not meet.  We all realise that, but in normal day to day operations I am quite happy that the Defence Forces are capable of doing their job.</P>

      <P>I am not, and I do not wish to be seen to be, questioning the prepardness or otherwise of the Defence Forces in this matter.  I am simply concerned about the political implications of the report, which is entitled <i>Europe's Neutral States: Partners or Profiteers in Western Security</i>.  This report refers to all neutral states in Europe, not just Ireland. According to the press reports, a number of serious points are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to place the thing in context.  The report says that we have no modern air defence surveillance system, no formal declaration of Ireland's security policy and, most important of all, that neutral states in Europe must adjust their security policies to present conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that there are political implications in that.  The Government should respond to them so that there are no misunderstandings in <Col N="1816" /> relation to our position.  Would the Minister agree that the Government will do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, indeed.  I do not wish to comment on the report because I have not seen it.  All I can say is that the Government's view and policy is not to become involved in defence alliances. For example, in the context of EC membership there is no factual or legal provision in the Treaty of Rome for any defence involvement by us unless we change our policy.  I do not propose to do that.  Therefore, the Deputy and the House can be assured that there is no change in our basic policy and that we will act in a neutral and independent manner in dealing with any reports which come from any source in relation to our defences.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has used this opportunity to reaffirm his confidence in the capacity of our Defence Forces to maintain our neutrality.  Does the Minister not agree that, when allegations such as these are made which cast doubts on the adequacy of our Defence Forces to maintain that neutrality, it is important that they be refuted?  Some years ago, Dr. O'Brien accused our Army of not being capable of holding the town of Newry for a day.  It remained unanswered for a long time.  That is no help.</P>

      <P>As I made clear over the past few days, I fully support Army involvement once requested by the chief medical officer of the city.  But would the Minister agree that to involve the Army is a very serious matter and can be done only in circumstances like these, based on health grounds, which was a right decision. Is it not very wrong that the Army are placed in a difficult position, as they were on Thursday last, when it was well known in advance that adequate arrangements had not been made for them to carry out the duty they had been properly asked to perform?  Would the Minister tell the House who made the arrangements? Who allowed them become so public?  If he is concerned about that matter will he ensure that such shabbiness does not recur, placing the Defence Forces in such an awkward position?</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy agrees with the decision made by the Government in these circumstances, at the request of the Department of the Environment, who were acting at the behest of the chief medical officer.  As the Deputy and the House will know, the Army become involved at the request of the Government, not the Minister involved, who take a decision if they decide that circumstances warrant it.  In this case we decided that it did and I am glad the Deputy agrees with that.  The detailed arrangements for the time and strength of their involvement, who will assist them, all of that is, or ought be, done at official level.  The fact is that, in this case, the Army were not allowed to carry out the work they were put there to do because of severe provocation by both striking workers and non-members of the Dublin Corporation workforce, people from outside.  In the circumstances it was decided that the best thing to do, in the interests of peace, was to withdraw, come back at a more appropriate time and carry out the task which they did very adequately.  I should like to thank them <Col N="1818" /> publicly for having done so.  It is very important that the Army be available for that kind of purpose.  But in saying that, I hope their services will be used as infrequently as possible because they should not be called on too lightly.</P>

I can tell the House that the troops were drawn from the Curragh Command, that there were over 500 involved in total in different areas of activity in the counties mentioned.  I might say this was not the first time that exercise has taken place, as the Deputy well knows.  In 1985 there was one of the same proportions in the Castlebar area of County Mayo.  It is a worthwhile exercise and results in our troops getting to know areas and also allows them to put into practice the theory they have learned in relation to their functions.

      <P>The formulation and application of public sector pay policy is a necessary activity of Government.  It is the function of individual Ministers to ensure that this policy is implemented in the areas of the public sector for which they have responsibility.  The statutory responsibility for the approval of pay rates in local authorities rests with the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>My concern is to ensure that there is adequate co-ordination of policy in relation to the remuneration of all public sector employees.

In the particular instance of the present dispute to which the Deputy might be referring both sides went to the Labour Court.  There is a Labour Court recommendation in relation to the dispute.  I have no problem about giving increased flexibility to local authorities.  I would favour such devolution if at the end of the day the Minister responsible for the co-ordination of pay policy is in a position to continue to exercise that duty.

      <P>Before the adjournment I remarked on the unfair trading advantage which the B &amp; I have over private hauliers. Previous speakers remarked on this. Perhaps the Minister might comment on it when he is summing up.  There is no more important person in the State than the person in business who is trying to make a go of it.  It is grossly unfair to expect him to compete with semi-State companies which are subsidised by the taxpayer.  It is not in line with Government policy.  We are not trying to give a stick to semi-State bodies with which to beat the private sector to death.</P>
      <P>I maintain, and can supply evidence to the Minister if he wishes, that the B &amp; I are taking container loads for a minimum of 16 per cent below the average cost the most efficient haulier or operator with the keenest prices can offer.  We are spending a lot of money to enable the B &amp; I to do that.  It is not fair competition and must be stopped.</P>
      <P>A Bill is being introduced to ban below cost selling.  This practice must be tackled in the same way.  Either the private hauliers must be subsidised or else the portion of the subsidy which goes to maintain that part of B &amp; I's business must be cut back.</P>

A reasonable rate for container traffic, 40 foot trailers, coming from London would be £650 while B &amp; I charge £490 which is 30 per cent below it.  I reckon that 10 per cent or 15 per cent would be a reasonable margin.  The rate from Birmingham would be £575 as opposed to £420 and from Manchester it would be £500 as opposed to £360.  They are good examples of reasonable rates considering the volume of traffic.  In those circumstances B &amp; I completely undercut although the company, as demonstrated by the Minister and other speakers, incurred massive losses.  As well as being a burden on the State, and the taxpayer, in an effort to survive the company are putting other people out of business.</P>
    <P>With unit load traffic in normal circumstances most hauliers do not try to compete with B &amp; I any more.  They have given that up.  It is not on, because B &amp; I charge so little and they own the ships.  The hauliers concentrate on groupage or part load traffic because they are more efficient and they have better facilities for that.  We are pouring more money into this slow moving, inefficient giant.  The figure involved is £38 million and we do not spend a lot of time debating such small amounts of money but the money is being given to a company which in the competitive area cannot stand on their own feet or compete with private business concerns.  Is the Minister asking members to support such a concern?  Is he asking us to prop up an inefficient company who operate unfairly against taxpayers?  Is that Government policy and, if not, will the Minister make some changes before he returns here for Committee Stage?</P>
    <P>B &amp; I are geared for unit load and it is easy for them because they own the ferries.  The rates charged by the company are unrealistic in the haulage business. Those rates should be considered in conjunction with the fact that B &amp; I operate a cartel with Sealink.  What will happen to the prices later?  What chance <Col N="1865" /> has a private haulier?  I regret that I do not know the number of people who operate in that business but I am sure that, following the passage of the liberalised licensing regulations thousands more will be involved.  That legislation was introduced in an effort to make the business more competitive and to give a better service to the public.  On the one hand we have opened up the haulage business, but we have closed it in another area.  If the two concerns operating a cartel on the Irish Sea decide to increase the prices when the officials of the Department say targets are not being met, they will increase the charges to the consumer.  What comeback has anybody using those services?</P>
    <P>From the research I have carried out I discovered that most hauliers do not try to compete with the B &amp; I.  It is fair to say that B &amp; I are running at a loss with container traffic because they could not make a profit charging unrealistic rates. If the company are being deliberately run at a loss, we do not have any business subsidising them.  If they were standing on their own and there were no other equally deserving citizens depending on that mode of transport to Britain and the Continent, I would have sympathy for the company but because their actions are damaging native companies and causing job losses, like Aer Lingus with their cartel, I am opposed to it.  The company are preventing tens of thousands of people from using their services and do not permit businesses to operate fairly.</P>
    <P>I am slow to agree to that amount of money being given to the company without making such comments.  I hope those comments will not be ignored although I predict that they will, as usual. If Mr. Alex Spain is as good as we think he is &mdash; I have no doubt that he is first class in his field &mdash; I am sure he will answer my questions.  Is the House prepared to subsidise a loss-making section of the B &amp; I and remove the unfair competition element from the subsidy?  Is the House prepared to say it is costing £x million to enable the company to operate an unfair haulage business that is damaging many concerns in the country?  The <Col N="1866" /> Department may have that information but, if not, it should be possible to get a report from the consultants on that.  It should be an easy job to do I hope we will get a report on it.  B &amp; I are keeping their rates down to an unrealistic level for unit loads and that is not on.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Road Transport Bill recently I mentioned those points but they were ignored. To ignore such points is not only an insult to the House but it is not serving the electorate well.  We should not honour this payment unless all the problems are tackled.  Do we want to have lame-duck semi-State companies?  I am not sure if the powers that be, the Department, would know a bargain if they saw one and I do not think we have got a bargain here.  We must realise the enormity of the problems but, once again, the poor old taxpayer will have to pick up the bill.  By allowing the cartel to operate I have no doubt that the charges will rise.  If the company are to stand on their feet they will have to increase their charges.  The partnership between B &amp; I and Sealink has not been brought about just for the sake of rationalisation. This is a convenient way of pooling the revenues of the two companies. It is the same system as that operated between BEA and Aer Lingus &mdash; they have done it for years.</P>
    <P>If the company manage to spend the £7 million on improving the service and the comfort of passengers they will do something worth while.  Irish men and women, especially those in the lower income group, people who have been forced to use that service or who on principle would not use Aer Lingus when travelling back and forth to Britain, have been treated down the decades like cattle &mdash; any old system did.  I hope the new approach will succeed in getting rid of all the undesirable aspects of the B &amp; I service and that we can get rid of the fiddles that went on all over the place: friends and relations could wink at members of the staff and after handing them a fiver they would not pay their fares.  That was not done rarely but frequently on a large scale.  An awful lack <Col N="1867" /> of work ethic existed there and in other semi-State companies where they knew they had security around them and did not have to respond as they would have in a private enterprise.  Control was exercised by the Seamen's Union over jobs and franchises, everything from operating the catering to the bars and the duty free arrangements.  I hope that can be sorted out.</P>
    <P>I am not too sensitive about the British company having got the catering arrangements but, having travelled extensively for 20 years, I have never got a decent meal in any British establishment, in any hotel, airport or any vessel operated from Britain.  They just do not know anything about good food or good service.  Their prices may be better but they will not be able to provide a better service than we could have done.</P>
    <P>I do not share the concern some Deputies expressed about the consultancy.  I suppose it was necessary to get around the Devlin Report on pay restrictions. You will not get consultants from the private sector coming in to take on tasks like this for the amount of money we could pay them because of restrictions.  I do not think that is a big problem if it succeeds in turning the company around. However, it pains me to come into the House &mdash; by the way, very few do &mdash; when we are engaged in nodding money through in the order of tens of millions of pounds: we seem to think we do not have to take it too seriously when it is not acutely affecting constituency matters.  I would point out that this is a major political decision brought about by the sensitivity of the company we are dealing with and the numbers of people employed: they amounted to 2,100, dropping to 1,700 from which about 500 were later knocked off, bringing the numbers down to 1,200.  It is amazing how these political decisions are made when we have to make them and how that can be turned into a virtue by the Minister of the day telling us what he is doing, using the first person a dozen times in a short speech in which he is demanding a return, demanding profits and demanding close monitoring and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1868" /> There are other decisions to be made, all relating to jobs and economics, which require political action, but that action is not forthcoming, and when it comes it does so very slowly from any Department.  It is a slow job to try to get any Department to expend money on creating jobs.  The sheer frustration is either driving people to emigrate or give up the ghost altogether.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a political decision forced on the Government, but I object to having clouded in that decision a large amount of taxpayers' money to prop up elements of a business that would not stand up on their own.  At the same time there is an unfair assault on other businesses trying to operate in the same field.  I cannot repeat often enough that this is wrong, and we should take cognisance of that.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the pensions element of the Bill now &mdash; I will wait until Committee Stage &mdash; but I should like to ask the Minister a few questions.  Has this provision anything to do with the Irish Shipping saga?  Is it to give future Ministers a way out?  Is it to prevent pay-outs like the £60,000 given to former directors or executives of a crumbling company? What is it for?  It could be to ensure that a situation like that which occurred in regard to Irish Shipping employees will not recur.  By this section will the Minister be able to make his own decision and pay-out in such circumstances, or is it to prevent having to pay out?  I will leave it until Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House so I will conclude shortly.  I understand the necessity for bringing in consultants in order to turn the company around.  An executive of the company could not be paid adequately to undertake such a mammoth task unless he could find some way of by-passing the Devlin Report on pensions.  I wish the consultancy and the company well.  I hope the company will recover.  I think it is unfortunate that we should be instigating a breach of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome by creating a cartel which will rebound on the consumer and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I do not think I will offend anyone if I say that most of the passengers who use <Col N="1869" /> B &amp; I are paying their own fares out of taxed income.  It is not acceptable that we should allow irregularities to occur or allow the company to operate against their customers by charging higher fares. There is not much scope to discuss that aspect because so little information has been given to us this morning.  I do not know why there was such a lack of information in the speech on Second Stage: perhaps it was an oversight.  I note that three officials from the Department are in the House supporting the Minister.  I have gone through the Minister's speech several times and I have read the Bill but I have not got answers to the questions that were raised.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the same situation has arisen with regard to other semi-State bodies such as CIE and Aer Lingus.  In those cases even greater amounts of money were voted through the House on the nod.  I have always found it very difficult to go along with that line.  I hope the Minister will ensure that more information is provided between now and Committee Stage.  I do not want to be taken for an &ldquo;eejit&rdquo;.  Every time legislation like this comes before the House, I feel I am being taken for an &ldquo;eejit&rdquo;, for a fool.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is Parliament and we are supposed to have power.  In the past few months I had the audacity and temerity to question an amount of £20 million that was given in the form of grants and loans to the State.  I asked the question if we were getting value, what were the strings attached and what was the purpose of the borrowing.  We must not forget the old saying that you get nothing for nothing in this world.  The people who gave us the money come from the country that coined the phrase, &ldquo;there is no such thing as a free dinner&rdquo;.  Yet, I was verbally assaulted by the Minister concerned even though I was only carrying out our job in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know much more about the performance of the company involved in this case.  Even though the intention is good, I do not find it satisfactory <Col N="1870" /> that the company will be monitored during the next three years to ensure that we get value.  I am telling the House now that we are not getting value, have not got value and are not likely to get value in the future.  If the Minister has any considered reply to that I should be anxious to hear it.  There have been redundancies among the employees of the company and they have suffered and customers have been ripped off.  They have got bad value for the fares paid; customers and hauliers have got bad service and a rough ride across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Up to now the company have been a total disaster.  A rescue package was put together; the company are now operating and I wish them every success.  Nevertheless, we must take a close look at what we are trying to do here.  We are told the choice is between rationalisation and survival or else carrying on as before and going the same way as Irish Shipping.  We are told there is a surplus of shipping capacity on the Irish Sea routes, that too many ships are chasing too little business. I will not deal with the question of the move to different ports.  I will leave Deputy Andrews to deal with that matter and to decide if that is a bonus.  Even if there is a move from the North Wall ferry port to Dún Laoghaire, it is still in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide an additional £38 million in equity for B &amp; I and that comes out of the proposals put forward by the board in respect of restructuring.  The losses incurred by the company between 1980 and 1984 amounted to more than £43 million and necessitated provision by the Exchequer of more than £13 million in equity capital. The Minister took action to ensure that state of affairs would not continue and that is how we came to have a new chairman and managing director and how Zeus came into operation.  The only safeguard we have that it will not continue to falter in the future is that the company will be monitored.  Does that mean if they run into difficulty another Bill will be introduced here, looking for more money?</P>
    <P>I am worried about the effect on trade <Col N="1871" /> in the private sector where most of the firms concerned are small businesses.  I know that B &amp; I are competing with all of those companies.  Companies who export by way of container traffic have to compete with a major undertaking like B &amp; I.  People in small firms engaged in this work have spent a lifetime in the business.  Many of them are mortgaged to the hilt and they hope to survive in the business for a few years.  Yet, along comes the representative from B &amp; I and takes the business away.  Even when small firms manage to get business they do it for a song.  Many of them drive from here to the Continent and earn little, if any, profit.  Some of them work only to cover their costs and to make repayments on their vehicles.  It is grossly unfair but we are aiding and abetting this company. We may not be doing it intentionally but I have set out the facts and they are on the record.  I hope there will be a response to what I have said.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the proposals submitted by the company. He referred to co-operation with Sealink and the two-year agreement.  I do not like it because the result is that the Irish consumer will have to pay again.  The Rosslare-Pembroke service has ceased, and the ferry will come onstream when they get the other vessel.  I cannot comment on that and I will leave it to other Members to do so.</P>
    <P>As regards the upgrading of on-board services, people are crying out for such a move but whether it will be successful I do not know, although they will probably continue to serve paper cups of tea made with tea bags.  It will still be like travelling steerage class, although maybe a little better than the cattle ships which left from the North Wall.  There will not be dung on the floors but there will be lots of other stuff in its place.</P>
    <P>They are looking for £20 million for 1986 and the Minister says the decision shows the Government's commitment to maintaining a strong Irish presence in the shipping service.  He went on to say that such transport services are vital to trade, commerce and the economy.  I do not <Col N="1872" /> believe this is helping trade and commerce, and the service would need to be upgraded if it is to have an impact on tourism.  The company's efficiency leaves a lot to be desired.  They were never efficient, and I do not know if we will ever manage to change that.</P>
    <P>Are the company on target to produce a profit in 1986?  We are handicapped here by a dearth of information.  The Minister referred to a lowering of standards which supposedly resulted from the battle for a market share on the sea, but as far as the trade figures are concerned, that is blatently untrue because costs could not have been lower.  Therefore, the fact that they are subsidised would not have had any effect on standards. There are a number of questions to be answered.  The B &amp; I have cost the hard pressed taxpayer a great deal of money already.  If I had 5 per cent of that money per annum over the next ten or 15 years I could create 3,000 or 4,000 jobs: they have 1,200.  As I said earlier, I do not believe they would recognise a bargain if it hit them in the face.  This applies to all semi-State companies.  I often put forward proposals to the Government but it is painful the way they are treated.  It is almost impossible to get a decent response.</P>
    <P>This not well thought out and very ill prepared submission is now before us and we are asked to say yes to granting this company a huge sum of money.  We are told not to worry because the Government will keep an eye on things and everything will be all right, but we know that is not so.  I am not happy with this. It is not fair and I do not believe it will benefit anybody.  Unless we keep digging our hands in our pockets over the next few years and unless we continue to allow the taxpayers, the traders, the tourists and the travellers to be ripped off, this company will not be a success.  I would have preferred this Bill to have been better thought out and all these points to have been taken into consideration.  I will discuss these matters in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise <Col N="1873" /> a number of points.  As regards section 2, I fear possible interference by the Government in industrial relations and cutting the ground from under the board of management and the work force of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited.  Perhaps the Minister would clearly indicate in his reply exactly what the section means.  I may be misinterpreting it and if I am, the Minister might tell me.  The Explanatory Memorandum is of no assistance whatever.  It says:</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides that in determining the remuneration and conditions of employment of its staff the Company shall have regard to Government or nationally agreed guidelines or Government policy and shall comply with any directives in these matters which the Minister for Communications may give with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
      <P>At first reading that appears as if the Government will have a direct role in negotiations between the board and the workforce.  For my part, that is a very bad proposal but perhaps the Minister would deal with it.  We will vote against that section if it means what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said these measures would safeguard the 1,400 jobs which the B &amp; I will continue to provide. If for no other reason, we would be anxious to support the Bill because one thing this country cannot afford is to throw another 1,400 people onto the dole queues.  While I agree this is an expensive rescue operation, nevertheless, it is maintaining the jobs of 1,400 people and for that reason alone it is not a bad move. The £38 million sought will go towards the refurbishment of various B &amp; I vessels. I wish the chief executive, the chairman and managing director, Mr. Alex Spain, well in his endeavours.  He appears to be a leader and a man of considerable courage.  When the crises were at their worst, he was at his best.  He was always willing to present his case on behalf of the organisation he now leads.  That is a singular quality of leadership and I pay tribute to him on that account.  I also wish to pay tribute to the workforce and hope <Col N="1874" /> that both the chief executive, Mr. Spain, and his staff will, make a new beginning and, in their joint interests, salvage what is after all a good operation if not a profitable one.  We hope it will now enter into profitability as predicted by Mr. Spain on the radio yesterday.  I wish him and his company well.</P>
    <P>With your permission, Sir, I will refer to a matter which relates to proposals for a unified car ferry terminal as between Sealink and B &amp; I.  I presume now that a certain document is public property on the basis that it was produced to public representatives in Dún Laoghaire Town Hall yesterday at 4 p.m. by Mr. Hayes of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Let me make it very clear that I have nothing but the highest respect and regard for Mr. Hayes who is doing a very difficult job well.  The letter is addressed to the Councillors of Dún Laoghaire Corporation and dated 5 June 1986.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made with the Town Clerk, Mr. L. Byrne for the Board's General Manager, Mr. R. M. Hayes, to address a meeting of Dún Laoghaire Corporation on Tuesday 10 June at 4 o'clock in the Town Hall. The subject of the address will be the Board's proposals for a unified car ferry terminal for Dublin.  I enclose for your information a document prepared for the Board in this regard.</P>
    <P>That is why I say now that this document has not the aura of confidentiality about it, so I feel free to quote from it and to mention it, I believe for the first time in the Dáil.  It was ably dealt with by the Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire Corporation, Councillor Harvey, yesterday when it was presented by Mr. Hayes to them.  Again I pay tribute to Mr. Hayes for having the guts to come, in the nature of things, into the lion's den and present his proposal for what can only be a death blow to an area like Dún Laoghaire.  He had a great deal of courage to do what he did and he must be respected in that regard but there I leave him.</P>
    <P>This document suggests a unified car ferry terminal/Port and Docks Board.  Is the Minister aware of such a document? <Col N="1875" /> If not, would he be good enough to bring himself up to the date with the document and its proposals and its costings?  The effect of a unified car ferry terminal in the terms envisaged by this document would have a disastrous effect on Dún Laoghaire in many respects.  It will have a catastrophic effect if Sealink are withdrawn from Dún Laoghaire and put into unity with B &amp; I in Dublin port.  I am demanding of the Minister now that that does not happen and I remind him that there are four Coalition Deputies in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire and that the proposal before me which was presented to Dún Laoghaire Corporation last night would have a horrendous effect on trade and tourism in Dún Laoghaire. As I say, I met the Dún Laoghaire Tourist Association on Thursday last.  I know that the Dún Laoghaire Chamber of Commerce, the traders, the hotel and guesthouse owners and everybody in the Dún Laoghaire area are strongly opposed to the prospect of Sealink being brought into Dublin port.  If there is to be a unified car ferry terminal, let us have it in Dún Laoghaire.  In the eyes of this Government Dún Laoghaire has reached second class status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the B &amp; I proposal, that B &amp; I should go out to Dún Laoghaire rather than the other way around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but this is a proposal from the secretary of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  We welcome the B &amp; I proposal, of course. B &amp; I see the wisdom of their proposal, but it is interesting to note that the first paragraph in the document before me states:</P>
      <P>A unified ferry terminal to serve the Dublin area has been put forward recently by shipping interests.</P>
      <P>I would like to know whose those shipping interests are on the basis of what the Opposition spokesman has said.  The quotation continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> Dublin Port and Docks Board recognise that rationalisation of routes and services is the order of the day and that plans recently announced indicate closer co-operation between B &amp; I and Sealink.  One consideration arising from this co-operation is that the Dublin area should have a single car ferry terminal rather than two as at present, One in Dublin and one in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a single car ferry terminal, I am putting this Government and the four Government Deputies in the constituency on notice that the place for that car ferry terminal is Dún Laoghaire and nowhere else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are Coalition Deputies in Dublin, too, if that is to be the criterion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There are indeed. I am going to give the criterion.  The criterion is that the people of Dún Laoghaire, the traders, the hotel and guesthouse owners and the shopkeepers want Sealink to be retained in Dún Laoghaire and, if there is to be any question of unification, let Dún Laoghaire be the place where these operations are unified.  Only recently hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent on very prominent hotels in the Dún Laoghaire area, on the Royal Marine Hotel, Fitzpatricks Hotel in Killiney, Kelly's Court Hotel and the Victor Hotel and many thousands of pounds were spent on guesthouses in the area, all in anticipation of the growth of the harbour, and here it is proposed by the very esteemed and respected secretary of the Port and Docks Board in a document, certainly if not by him then on behalf of the Port and Docks Board, that there be a unified car ferry terminal for the Dublin area situated in Dublin port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party rejected that proposal on behalf of the people of Dún Laoghaire and we will raise it as an issue in the next general election.  In the last local elections we set out our plans for the future of Dún Laoghaire in the context of <Col N="1877" /> B &amp; I and of Sealink and we will not renege on those promises.  They are there as a matter of documented and ascertainable fact, as a matter of history.  The document before me has generated shock waves and worry and concern amongst the various organisations and individuals as I have just outlined.  It is not good enough to make proposals of this nature without having regard to the effect they would have on the various organisations and individuals in the area where they are guaged to cause the most hurt.</P>
    <P>Let me make another point in this regard.  Again I am quoting from <i>Unified Car Ferry Terminal,</i> the production by the Dublin Port and Docks Board:</P>
    <P>The Board is confident that in consultation with B &amp; I and Sealink a modern terminal conforming to the requirements described above can be provided in Dublin Port.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Wilson is correct in the information he has given the House, namely that B &amp; I want to come to Dún Laoghaire, that does not measure up with the statement in this document.  Of course we welcome a unified car ferry terminal in Dún Laoghaire.  We welcome B &amp; I and we welcome Sealink, but another piece of wisdom in this document is worth repeating.  It deals with freight and financial viability.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Car ferries must carry freight to achieve financial viability so that if B &amp; I transfer to Dún Laoghaire freight volumes would double immediately. This explosion of freight would have a most damaging effect on a residential suburb and high amenity area. Freight and passenger car vehicles would almost certainly spill over on to approach roads resulting in heavy on-street parking and hazardous traffic problems.</P>
    <P>Did the authors of this document, well intentioned as it is, regard or take account of the views of the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire and all those other bodies in the Dún Laoghaire area in the context of that statement?  Are they aware that <Col N="1878" /> there is to be a by-pass through the Black-rock area which would carry the volume of traffic envisaged by the placement of B &amp; I and Sealink in Dún Laoghaire? I reject that thinking.  I reject also the following thinking, again from this document:</P>
    <P>No difficulty is anticipated in financing the project.  Construction costs are estimated at IR£4 million for a unified terminal at the present ferryport location and IR£7 million for a new terminal at North Wall Extension. Throughput figures indicate that annual port revenue would be about IR£3 million.  A package of borrowings can be arranged, some short-term from the commercial banks and some long term from pension funds and similar sources.  Appropriate grant aid would also be sought from the Government.</P>
    <P>I hope that that does not include the Irish Shipping pension funds because, having made a mess of Irish Shipping, B &amp; I and Sealink are also under serious threat.  Is the Minister aware of such a document and, if not, will be ensure that the House has full knowledge of it before he responds to my question?  Is it the Government's intention to unify the car ferry terminal in the Dublin Port and Docks area to the shock and devastation of the Dún Laoghaire region?  There have been car ferries in Dún Laoghaire for over 150 years, including the link with Holyhead which has been in existence for so long.  People arriving in Dún Laoghaire see a beautiful entrance to the harbour and we envisage a mesh of amenities and light industry in the context of the type of proposition here, especially in regard to Sealink.</P>
    <P>To set the atmosphere and the background for the type of future we envisage for the Dún Laoghaire area in the context of B &amp; I and Sealink, I should like to refer to the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 10 June 1986.  It said that up to 1,000 new jobs will be created if Dún Laoghaire Corporation's plans for a marina cum marine estate come to fruition.  The borough manager, Mr. Kevin O'Sullivan, said that the corporation hope to reclaim over 60 <Col N="1879" /> acres of land in the west pier area of the harbour and transform it into an enterprise centre for marine related industry. He added that discussions are taking place with the Office of Public Works, financial institutions and the EC to ensure that the £15 million development will go ahead within months.</P>
    <P>The plan involves the creation of a 600 craft marina, the setting up of a harbour village with marine related industry, a conference and exhibition centre plus other tourist attractions in the west pier area.  Mr. O'Sullivan explained that hundreds of workmen would be employed in the construction stage of the new development with potential for 1,000 permanent jobs in the new industry.  That is why this report has come as a bombshell to the Dún Laoghaire area because of the suggestion that Sealink might be removed from Dún Laoghaire harbour to unify the car ferry terminal in Dublin port.  We reject this out of hand as it was rejected by the members of Dún Laoghaire Corporation last night, led by their very able and outgoing cathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>In the context of what the borough manager said &mdash; a man of great ability and probably one of the best borough managers in the country in regard to efficiency, co-operation and general approach to local government &mdash; about the marina and all its various additions, there has been almost a unanimous rejection of the proposal to bring the unified car ferry terminal to Dublin Port.  If there is to be such a terminal, why can it not be in Dún Laoghaire?  The cathaoirleach of the borough council, according to this report, claimed that proposals by Dublin Port and Docks for a unified ferry terminal would spell disaster for Dún Laoghaire.  So say all of us.  Under the proposals, the board hope to accommodate both B &amp; I and Sealink and a new, multi-million pound 20 acre terminal in Dublin Port.  However, when the ports general manager, Mr. Robert Hayes, presented a report to the council last night, the cathaoirleach claimed that the Port and Docks Board were not able to <Col N="1880" /> look after the present problems, whatever they may be.  He then outlined the reasons for Sealink being retained in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>My contribution on this Bill is to expose the report, not to undervalue it or to personalise its authors, but just to make a case for the retention of Sealink in Dún Laoghaire.  If there is to be a unified car ferry why can it not be in Dún Laoghaire?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the fact that the Minister for Finance intends to take up an additional £38 million in equity in the B &amp; I.  I see from the Minister's speech that this amount falls somewhat short of what the board requested.  The reality probably is that it is somewhat short of what the board may require to carry out their task in a proper manner. I am a little fearful that we may be making the mistake of inadequately capitalising the firm.  If we leave the firm in an over-tight financial position, it puts them at a hopeless disadvantage in trying to organise their commercial activities in a proper manner, if they are bogged down by heavy interest and heavy debt.  That may be a reason for not putting more public money into it but if the decision is taken to do that, it should be done properly and adequate funds provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a grave mistake and would prejudice the £38 million which will be put in if the amount is inadequate, which I suspect it is, to put the company on a proper, viable commercial footing.  We could easily prejudice that money by not making it sufficient.  There is a tendency to undercapitalise semi-State firms which applies not only to the B &amp; I but to many other semi-State industries.  We complain about them and say they are not pulling their weight and not making profits, but very often we hedge them in with so many restrictions that we take from them the freedom and viability to act as normal commercial enterprises.  We expect them to provide services on a social basis &mdash; which is right and proper &mdash; but we also expect them to be economic in doing so.  The effect of providing uneconomic social services is that they run up heavy <Col N="1881" /> debts.  This compounds the problem because they have high and increasing interest charges to meet.  CIE are a case in point.  These semi-State companies get bogged down by ever increasing debt, even interest repayments not being met. Yet we expect them to fulfil a social role as well.  We cannot have it both ways and we have to face up to this fact.</P>
    <P>In this case here with the B &amp; I, for example, it sounds fine that we put in £38 million in money but when one looks at it further, from the Minister's speech we see that in actual fact the bulk of that simply goes towards reducing, not eliminating, the company's borrowings and, of the first instalment of £20 million, which is the lion's share of the input, only £7 million is actually available for the really worthwhile aspect of it, the capital investment to improve the company.  The remaining £13 million simply goes towards reducing the company's borrowings. I just hope it will be sufficient to reduce the company's borrowings by a sufficient amount to leave them viable and commercial so that their remaining debt and the servicing of the interest on it will not so weaken and emaciate the cash flow of that company that it will render them over a period of time, nonviable. If it is to work out that way, we would be better off to put nothing in at all and forget the whole thing.</P>
    <P>One can fall between two stools.  One can be cheeseparing and begrudging and say they have requested a certain amount of money, that we could not go along with all of that, but we can put in some intermediate amount, thereby thinking we are meeting the case to some extent. That is a grave mistake.  What ought to be done in these situations is either go the whole hog and do the job properly, give them all the money required to enable them to be competitive and commercial, or else do nothing, say that the whole thing is too much, that we cannot afford it and we are not going to do it. But to fall in between the two, to give some but not enough is the worst of all options.  I do not know whether or nor that is the fact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> I have to admit that I am not an accountant and have not had the opportunity to examine the accounts of the B &amp; I in tremendous detail.  Even if I did examine them, they would probably be in accountancy language and difficult for a layman to understand.  But I smell a rat and it causes me some concern when I see the comment in the Minister's brief: &ldquo;This falls somewhat short of what the board requested.&rdquo;  That is the word the Minister used.  I have a strange suspicion that the more accurate word there might be perhaps &ldquo;required&rdquo;.  They should get what is required to enable that company to proceed in a commercial manner, to get up and going and provide the service in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>It concerns me that only a relatively small amount of money, £7 million, is going to actually go for the real benefit of improving the nature and the operation of the business.  That causes me some little concern and I just hope that the sums have been correctly done and that very great care has been given to the requirements of the company and their needed cash flow and that the allocation of £38 million will enable them, from their profits and cash flow, to cope with the remaining interest debt they will have to meet.</P>
    <P>Certainly substantial reinvestment capital is needed in that firm.  I have used their services over the years on very many occasions and certainly the standards that have been applied on those ships hitherto have left a lot to be desired.  There is no doubt about that.  They have compared very unfavourably with other vessels on other channel routes between England and France and so on.  The standard provided there left a lot to be desired.  One saw the duty free facilities, for example, which ought to be a very major money spinner if used properly.  People just walked away; the facilities were so poorly organised that one could not take advantage of them and a great deal of cash flow must have been lost.  That is just to pick out one item.  The food arrangements were pretty poor too in comparison with other vessels.  The £7 million, I suppose, will go a fair way towards improving that <Col N="1883" /> situation but I hope we are not going to cheesepare on this and get the worst of both worlds.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of the Bill that I must admit I view with some concern. This concerns sections 2 and 3 of the Bill dealing with the remuneration of staff and superannuation.  Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>In determining the remuneration or allowances for expenses to be paid to its officers or servants or the terms or conditions subject to which such officers or servants hold or are to hold their employment, the Company shall have regard either to Government or nationally agreed guidelines which are for the time being extant, or to Government policy concerning remuneration and conditions of employment which is so extant, and, in addition to the foregoing, the Company shall comply with any directives with regard to such remuneration, allowances, terms or conditions which the Minister for Communications may give from time to time to the Company with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>The point must be made about this section that it appears to ignore the fact altogether that there is an existing comprehensive agreement between the union in this firm and the company, using the available conciliation machinery. Indeed, the unions negotiate here on a free collective bargaining basis and this has worked effectively in the past.  For example, only 14 days have been lost through industrial disputes in this company in the past 18 years.  This is surely an admirable record and one which no legislation should seek to override. Section 2, if enacted in its present form, would abolish free collective bargaining and would allow the Minister to override all the decisions of the board of directors.</P>
    <P>This ministerial power would appear to contradict the sentiment, if not the letter, of the industrial White Paper published by the Government in 1984.  This paper stressed the point that directors of semi-State companies must be in a <Col N="1884" /> position to offer remuneration in line with the best private companies in order to attract the best possible personnel to top positions in the semi-State or State service.  It seems to me that there is a bit of an anomaly in the thinking behind these two sections which are, of course, a crucial part of the Bill.  It puts the Minister in a controlling position so far as remuneration is concerned.</P>
    <P>One has to ask oneself whether the employees of the B &amp; I and, indeed, of other semi-State companies, where this concept of ministerial control and influence in wage levels is concerned are to be regarded in rank as civil servants.  The Bill proposes to tie them to national guidelines, to Civil Service guidelines, and to be bound by the levels of wages that apply in national agreements or would be subject to directives in like manner to the rest of the public service. But the problem is that, when it comes to the crunch, they do not have the advantages the Civil Service have, for example, security of tenure in their posts, and did we not see what became of the workers in Irish Shipping?</P>
    <P>The Minister is saying these employees come in at the same rank as civil servants; they are to be bound where their wages and earnings are concerned by the national guidelines and by national pay agreements, but they have a disadvantage in that they will be subject to that control and free collective bargaining taken away from them but, so far as security of tenure in their job is concerned, that is another matter and they are as subject to the loss of their job as the unfortunate workers in Irish Shipping.  I do not see why this one item of control should be vested in the Minister where the commercial administration of a semi-State body is concerned.  Why single out the question of workers' remuneration particularly in a company where, from the information given to me, it has worked so well all these years?  Why single out this one item of wages control and national directives on wages and actually write it into the Bill?</P>
    <P>I do not say there should be no accountability by the board of directors of this <Col N="1885" /> semi-State company and, indeed, of any semi-State company.  Accountability must be a key factor for boards of all State or semi-State companies or indeed any board handling public funds.  However, one has to draw the line between accountability and commercial responsibility. I hope the Minister will have a look at this and bear in mind the recommendations of the Government's own industrial White Paper policy when enacting the sections on the remuneration of staff, and also have regard to the outstanding record of the unions and management with their experience of free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>This question of accountability is very important and I fully accept it is right and proper that the Minister and Government should have an eye on what investments are being made, know exactly what is going on and be fully apprised of the uses to which public moneys in those firms are being put.  I fully accept that.  We have seen all too sadly what has happened on a number of occasions recently when that degree of watchfulness lapsed and the troubles that ensued.  However, that is different from saying that the viability and freedom of action of a board of directors running a commercial concern to negotiate their wages and staff agreements with the members of their firms should be subject to ministerial controls and particular wage guidelines.</P>
    <P>It is very important in semi-State companies, as in any commercial undertaking if it is to be a success, that the best possible people, particularly in the upper echelons of management, should be employed.  If one wants to make a success of a commercial concern, particularly where competition exists or one is trying to promote business, one must have good top people there who know their job. One must be in a position to make it worth their while to stay in the company so that one does not lose these people to the private sector, which is not hidebound by directives or Government guidelines. All too often in the semi-State companies and Government services across all levels we find that the first class people with <Col N="1886" /> the expertise and initiative to produce business and results are weaned away from the public service to the detriment of that service and are taken up readily enough by private enterprise, where their work is recognised, and the companies are prepared to pay them for it.</P>
    <P>The rationale of taking a commercial company such as the B &amp; I and trying to write into a Bill provisions which will rigidly control wages and salaries of the workers, including the upper echelons who are and will be crucial to operating and manipulating very substantial assets which belong to the people of Ireland, seeking to put an artificial element into the control of those salaries, seems highly dangerous.  It could result on a number of crucial occasions in the loss of key management and key staff who could make all the difference between B &amp; I being or not being a sound, viable commercial company that could produce profits and very worthwhile jobs for the country.  It is inappropriate to have such controls.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and not single out this one item of wages to be used as a rope around the neck of the company when they are seeking to attract and keep important members of the staff, without whom possibly the whole project could not continue on a viable basis.</P>
    <P>By all means have arrangements and provisions organised with the company that the Minister can see what is going on, what investments are being made and how money is being spent.  He should have an input there.  That is right and proper, but the reason for singling out this one item escapes me.  It could put this whole very worthwhile project in jeopardy and should be re-examined.  As a generality, I do not like the idea of such restriction on wages being written into a Bill with a view to its operation in any semi-State body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning the Minister outlined the different proposals between himself and the board.  He spoke about B &amp; I and Sealink having arrangements for the Rosslare-Fishguard route and of a proposal for a new Sealink jumbo <Col N="1887" /> vessel.  As a Deputy from Wexford, I am especially interested in Rosslare, as are all Wexford Deputies.  It is a major tourist attraction and an important advantage in every way to Wexford in particular.  It is often described as the gateway to Europe.</P>
      <P>The Minister's remarks about a two year agreement makes one ask what will happen when that agreement ceases. What will happen if Sealink pull out of that agreement?  Will B &amp; I have a ship of their own to operate that route, or will we all have to travel to Dublin in order to cross the sea?  The Minister mentioned the Government's commitment to maintaining a strong Irish presence in shipping services to this country.  One has only to go back a few months to see the Government's attitude towards Irish Shipping Limited and to the present position of ICL, which is undecided.  There is much rumour and innuendo but no concrete solution has been put forward to the difficulties of ICL which were the profit making section of Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
      <P>The Minister later speaks about the £7 million capital investment and the need to improve the sales area and making travelling across the Irish Sea far more enjoyable than in the past.  As one who has travelled three or four times a year for the past number of years, I would welcome any improvement on the ships travelling across the sea.  The passenger in years gone by was not treated in a very reasonable way by the shipping companies. I agree with Deputy Skelly who referred to the ships as more like cattle trucks.  They were not very comfortable or up to date and did not take the well-being of the customer into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Mr. Spain and the consultancy company, one would have to accept that it was better to have a consultancy company put in than a receiver or a liquidator.  At least Mr. Spain has made some effort to solve the problems of B &amp; I.  We all accept that action had to be taken to correct the problems there.  The on-going losses could not have been allowed to continue.  One must still <Col N="1888" /> wonder about the vagueness of the present situation.  There have been no annual reports published for 1984 and 1985.  What are the actual losses of B &amp; I at present?  It is strange that this House is asked to support a £38 million investment for B &amp; I when we cannot get reports, facts or figures about losses and so forth.  It is difficult to make a real judgment on the merits of this investment. There has been talk about £7 million capital investment, but obviously £31 million is being put in to cover borrowings in other areas of B &amp; I activity.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out, the continuation of B &amp; I is certainly in the interests of the national economy and of tourism.  One hears many politicians saying that the future for job creation lies in tourism.  It is essential that we should have adequate shipping facilities.  We are talking about £38 million of the taxpayers' money.  We hear much talk about not wasting that money.  Here we are asked to support a £38 million investment without being given the entire picture behind what the Minister has in mind.  I am only a short time in this House but when Bills come through authorising the spending of taxpayers' money, I wonder if it is always being spent in the right direction and in a proper manner.  Is the taxpayer being taken into account?</P>
    <P>The arrangement between B &amp; I and Sealink about which the Minister has talked is, I fear, developing into a cartel arrangement with price increases.  On the Rosslare to Fishguard route at the moment, judging by the number of complaints that I and other politicians receive, the consumers are not totally happy with the price increases which have come about since this arrangement came in.  At the end of the day it is the consumer who will suffer because of lack of competition and of control over such a cartel.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister how he intends to protect the consumer?  Many people regard the fare from Rosslare to Fishguard as the dearest in Europe.  It is important that the whole area of consumer protection be looked at.  B &amp; I and Sealink should not keep increasing their <Col N="1889" /> prices because the people using those services are ordinary taxpayers.  Deputy Skelly also mentioned this point.  In the forties, fifties, and sixties many people had to leave the country through lack of jobs and opportunities.  They are the people who use the service when coming home in the summer, at Christmas or for bank holiday weekends.  We have a duty to ensure that their interests are protected and that the price being sought are reasonable and fair.  I do not expect B &amp; I or Sealink to make massive losses. They operate to make a profit, just as any enterprise should; but they should not be allowed hike up their prices and completely monopolise the route.  At present people maintain that the prices are 25 per cent above what they should be.  I do not know how accurate that claim is or if it is correct.</P>
    <P>We have heard much talk about fuel prices in recent times.  The reason prices were increased was because of the high cost of oil.  Yet we have had a 50 per cent reduction in crude oil prices.  This should result in fares remaining static, if not reduced, rather than being increased. Taking into account the losses which B &amp; I incurred and the fact that Sealink is now being run by Mr. Sherwood, an American who is also interested in making profits, prices should at least be maintained at a reasonable figure.</P>
    <P>We should look at the financial arrangements between B &amp; I and Sealink. Are the profits shared on a 50-50 basis or are they leaning in favour of Sealink?  This House, which will be asked to support the spending of taxpayers' money, and the public have a right to know what interests B &amp; I have in this? Will they make a profit?  Some people maintain, and again the Minister should give us clarification on this, that Sealink are getting the greater share of the profit. The suggestion has been made by different people, both inside and outside this House.  One would also wish to know the marketing arrangements.  At present there seems to be difficulties in relation to hauliers getting space on ships and availing of the services.  These difficulties were not there when they travelled by <Col N="1890" /> Sealink or B &amp; I as individual ships. There is a general complaint from hauliers at present.</P>
    <P>To spend money on the development of shipping is worthwhile and is certainly a welcome change for this Government. We must also spend money in the development of the services connected with shipping.  Rosslare is an area where there is great potential for development, not alone in the interest of Rosslare Harbour and Wexford but also in the interest of the State.  It is the fastest developing port in Ireland.  We have had the minimum of expense in that area.  We have had a lot of piecemeal development over the last nine or ten years.  Yet it has developed and over one million passengers a year go through Rosslare.  It is a major tourist area and is the main route into this country for tourists.</P>
    <P>There is talk about a jumbo ship which will be owned by Mr. Sherwood and Sealink. One would question the position in relation to this ship.  Rumour has it that this ship will not get into Fishguard unless the port is dredged.  This would cost about £8 million.  Who will invest £8 million in the dredging of that area?  Will it be Sealink or will it be a joint effort between B &amp; I and Sealink?  Will there be two ships operating in that area and no jumbo ship?  What would happen if a jumbo ship breaks down?  Would we be left without a service in the Rosslare area?  That would not be in the best interests of the country or of the development of tourism. I do not know whether or not it is a good idea to have one person controlling the shipping route from Rosslare as is happening at present.  What will happen if Sealink pulls out of Rosslare and decides to operate somewhere else?  The country would be left high and dry.  That area should be examined by the Minister to see if it is a feasible proposition.  The best industrial relations in the country exists in Rosslare, with people there who have years of experience.  There has never been a strike there.  They think that a jumbo ship would not be in the interests of the whole development of Rosslare, of Wexford and of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned the <Col N="1891" /> problem in relation to freight hauliers. There are some cowboy hauliers in Ireland. But last night in Wexford we met a number of legal hauliers who are concerned with priority being given to hauliers operating with B &amp; I.  They feel that they are not getting a proper service. They are left stranded at ports awaiting travel space and opportunities to get in or out of the country.  I am sure the Minister is very much aware that the hauliers are operating on the minimum of profit at present.  Some of them have invested so much money in the past few years in new tractor units and new trucks, and trying to compete with Northern Ireland hauliers and cowboy hauliers, that they find it almost impossible to make money.  B &amp; I should not be allowed to cast the hauliers to one side.  Hauliers should be given an equal opportunity of getting space on their ships.  The Minister should look at this area because B &amp; I are continually denying all this.  Those hauliers have experience of what is happening and they are very angry and frustrated. B &amp; I are entitled to 50 per cent of the space for the transportation of steel, peat moss and so on, but the hauliers are being left to one side.</P>
    <P>The cartel arrangement has also meant increased charges for hauliers who contend that they have increased by 12½ per cent on what they were before the new B &amp; I-Sealink arrangement came into being.  They have made representations to us to find out the reasons why such increases have taken place.  Because of a reduction in fuel prices they had to hold their prices at a reasonable level, and reduce them in some cases because of competition, They cannot find any reason why they should have to pay a 12½ per cent hike.  This is the figure given by the hauliers association.  It is not my figure. The Minister should spell out whether there has been an increase in charges and the reasons why.  He should try to give a reasonable answer to these people who are feeling the pinch and finding it difficult to make a decent living.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the sales areas on the car ferries have <Col N="1892" /> been redesigned in order to make them more attractive.  One would have to question why Irish companies have not got the franchise for catering and also for the duty free shops.  British companies have been engaged to provide these services. There is a lot of public disquiet and concern among Irish companies as to why they were not engaged in these areas. They are entitled to an explanation.  Were they too expensive?  Were they not up to standard?  Were they not capable?  If the arrangement between B &amp; I and Sealink is on a 50/50 basis, we are entitled to have our share of Irish products on those ships. There should be a sales drive to sell Irish products.  If Sealink are now owned by an American, we should be able to do a deal so as to ensure that Irish products are sold and marketed.  They may be available on those ships but if you travel on those ships you do not find a sales pitch for Irish products.</P>
    <P>Mr. Spain seems to be a very capable man.  He is on a very high salary.  People will contend he is entitled to that.  I am sure that if Mr. Spain were approached and asked he could work out a sales deal for Irish products.  We have drink, jewellery and other products being produced in this country which are recognised as top class world wide.  We should be in a position to ensure that out products are sold and marketed on those ships.  Many of our major companies have gone into receivership, liquidation or gone out of existence completely.  We have a duty, if taxpayers' money is being spent in B &amp; I, to ensure that Irish products are given a fair chance and opportunity to compete with other products on board these ships.</P>
    <P>Rosslare again figures in the ICL situation. The Minister should tell this House if B &amp; I intend to purchase ICL.  Yesterday, I was in Rosslare and rumours were rife that B &amp; I intend to announce on Friday that they are going to purchase ICL.  That may be only a rumour or a suggestion from people.  It is important that ICL be kept in Irish ownership.  In one of today's national newspapers &mdash; and we cannot always believe what they tell us &mdash; there was a reference to an Irish consortium purchasing ICL.  Therefore, <Col N="1893" /> we have different rumours and suggestions. At the end of the day, it is important that ICL should remain in Irish ownership.  It is a profit making section of Irish Shipping.  They have many good workers who are committed to working for this country.  It is important to Rosslare and the country that we ensure ICL are kept in Rosslare and in Irish ownership.  I would like the Minister to spell out quite clearly what his intentions are in relation to ICL.  While it is the liquidator's problem and he has the final say, it is important that on an issue which is vital to the general economy the Minister should also have a say to ensure that ICL are kept in the right hands and not given away to foreign owners who will cream off massive profits.  This is one of the areas the Minister should seriously consider.  I have said this on a number of occasions in this House and I will continue to say it until such time as we have an Irish owner for ICL.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 2 I agree with Deputy Taylor to a certain extent.  It has become the norm for different Ministers to write wage controls into a Bill.  There has been a very good working relationship in B &amp; I as other speakers have pointed out.  There have been few strikes in the company and it is not necessary for any Minister to write into a Bill that wages will be controlled.  We should leave it to the unions and the conciliation boards to deal with wages in the best interests of the workers and the semi-State company involved.  It is becoming a common practice of the Government to write in wage controls in Bills that go through this House.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope the Minister will respond in a positive way to some of the suggestions and comments which were made.  Clarification is needed in some areas.  I hope there will be some definite decision in relation to ICL and that they will remain in Irish ownership in Rosslare working for Wexford and the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Ag cuidiú leis and leasú seo, in contributing to the Bill, described as an amending Bill, I am fascinated to find that our translators could not put suitable <Col N="1894" /> Irish on the British and Irish Steam Company Limited.  Rather, they put it in the English form and repeated it in the second language which most of us use in our daily lives notwithstanding the fact that Gaeilge is the official language.  I am disappointed with that aspect at the outset.  If this Bill was coming in as a leasú we should have changed the title of the company from what it used to be because &ldquo;it ain't what it used to be&rdquo;.  The British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited could easily have been translated or changed.  Then, we would have been able to put an Irish term on the new title of this company.  &ldquo;The British and East Coast of Ireland Company&rdquo; would have been a more suitable title.  Bearing in mind the doubts being expressed by people in Rosslare, one could almost call it the British and Dublin-based company because slowly but surely that is what is happening to the B &amp; I.  Not alone has it departed from the south and south-west coast and gone to the east coast, but there are fears being expressed that it might be centralised in Dublin.  One wonders if anybody in the Government or the Department took into account the Eastern Region Development Organisation report or the joint submission to the Government by the various regional development organisations and their comments on the ERDO report, which are relevant to this debate.  It is relevant to refer to what is happening on the east coast.  It is not happening just now with the contraction in the operations of the B &amp; I to operate out of Dublin only.  I shall deal with the departure from Cork later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to use extracts from this submission to illustrate that this Government are continuing to centralise anything in or around Dublin.  Of course, that was demonstrated by the Taoiseach recently when he considered it more appropriate to keep open the coffee shops in Dublin than do anything for the rest of the country. The Government have taken no notice whatsoever of this fine report published by the ERDO.  For example, it is predicted in the report that, even without further immigration the proportion of the <Col N="1895" /> State's population is likely to rise within the next 25 years.  It is said that this is of serious concern to other regions because it signifies for them a declining share of the State's population and the possibility of a declining share of the national resources.  Therefore they say the ERDO report presents a challenge to Government to take positive measures to make regional policy effective in the national interest.</P>
    <P>There is mention of the regional policy review of 1972 in which it was said that the Government were anxious to make regional policy more effective and to aid the development of the economy as a whole.  At that time the strategy envisaged by the Government included development in Dublin to be such as to accommodate the natural increase in its existing population.  The objective was to have strong urban areas to counter regional imbalance by, among other things, providing elsewhere some of the qualities which make Dublin so attractive a centre for population and employment. It is still the view of RDOs outside the eastern region that the 1972 statement should reflect Government policy, providing valid aspirations for the regions seeking to develop their potential to the full.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill take no account of the warnings contained in that report.  The ERDO report pointed out that Dublin city and county gained almost 23,000 net immigrants between the years 1971 and 1981 and that the region as a whole gained over 59,000.  It was contended, therefore, that the problems of further flows of immigrants could not be ignored.  The principal assumption in the ERDO settlement strategy was made in the absence of effective Government measures to control the growth of Dublin and the east region and to positively tap latent potential growth in other regions.</P>
    <P>I contend that what has happened and is happening in the case of the B &amp; I is central to those observations of the ERDO report.  Indeed, they went on to say that air pollution, crime, vandalism <Col N="1896" /> and traffic growth contributed to a general downgrading of the quality of life in the eastern region.  It is hardly necessary for me to elaborate on the matter of vandalism and its cost in the Dublin area, in the eastern region and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The RDO's in their conclusion, were satisfied that there was urgent need for a Government response to their submission because they contended that, if existing trends are allowed continue, it would be to the economic and social detriment of the eastern and other regions of the country.</P>
    <P>The NESC report, No. 81, on the Designation of Areas for Industrial Policy, stated that the historical trend of the growth of the eastern region relative to other areas is undesirable, primarily from a social viewpoint but also from an economic viewpoint.  The Taoiseach himself is reported as saying that the development of regional policy is long overdue.  He said that at the Dublin Crisis Conference of February 1986.  The RDOs agree.  They consider that Government regional policy should be instrumental in effecting planned and balanced growth of the country as a whole and should incorporate effective measures for this purpose.  All of what I have to say henceforth will have a distinct bearing on those comments.</P>
    <P>In the course of his introductory remarks this morning the Minister had this to say:</P>
    <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to enable the Minister for Finance to provide up to £38 million in additional equity for the B &amp; I Company.  The Bill also confers upon the Minister for Communications.</P>
    <P>&mdash;in association with, I am sure, the Ministers for Finance and the Public Service&mdash;</P>
    <P>certain controls in relation to the rumuneration and superannuation of the staff of the company, ...</P>
    <P>That is an extraordinary turn of events, but it is beginning to crop up in every Bill coming before the House, even the <Col N="1897" /> SFADCo one of yesterday.  It seems to me that in future trade unionists and the trade union movement in general, the employers, boards of management and personnel managers will have no function in deciding the remuneration and superannuation of employees of semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I wonder do the Labour Party, who assume that they represent the workers and trade unionists &mdash; and, of course, they do because they collect the political levy, it is mandatory on them to subscribe to that political levy &mdash; realise what their Government are doing?  Do they realise that this levy being subscribed by all the members will be used for something other than the negotiation of conditions of employment and remuneration, which has always been one of the principal planks of the trade union movement? Always they have negotiated conditions of pay and work on behalf of their members.  How can the Labour Party allow this Government decision to be included in the provisions of Bills introduced in this House, so that in future they will be Ministers who will decide such matters?  In this case there are three Ministers involved, the Ministers for Finance, Communications and the Public Service.  On the day of reckoning I leave it to the workers and trade unionists to judge for themselves who will be their future negotiators, who will be responsible for negotiating their pay claims and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his introductory remarks had this to say:</P>
    <P>In view of the substantial losses incurred by the B &amp; I in recent years &mdash; between 1980 and 1984.</P>
    <P>I will make a more detailed submission on that and will give the losses for each year.  In his speech the Minister also referred to:</P>
    <P>... substantial cost efficiencies to be achieved through reduced manning levels and changes in work practices in all areas of the company's business.</P>
    <P>There is no reference to the loss of 400 jobs, nor is there any reference to the <Col N="1898" /> jobs which were lost when B &amp; I withdrew from Cork.  There was no compassion shown to those people.  There is a very interesting point made by the Minister.  He stated:</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to continue support for B &amp; I is an indication of their commitment to maintaining a strong Irish presence in shipping service to this country ...</P>
    <P>It has already been stated that a Bill similar to this one was introduced before Irish Shipping was scuttled.  When I see something like this I am reminded of that. How can we have a strong Irish presence in shipping services when Irish Shipping was scuttled?</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>There is no need to remind the House that as an island nation our access transport services, particularly those between Ireland and Britain, are vital to trade, commerce and tourism and to our national economy generally.</P>
    <P>Further on he states: &ldquo;... They welcome external participation in shipping services&rdquo;.  Are we to take it that every last piece of shipping is to be handed over?  If they are left in power we could expect that to happen, but thankfully the day is drawing near when this Government, who in their time closed everything down and caused the Irish flag to be hauled down in various parts of the world, will be thrown out of office.  I have no doubt where they would be heading otherwise.  They would scuttle the B &amp; I. The hallmark of their operations was to close everything and liquidate everything at the first sign of trouble.</P>
    <P>It was stated that the board and management of the B &amp; I deserve recognition for their resolute approach to difficult problems.  I am not sure that statement is correct.  As a Corkman I do not agree with that statement.  Perhaps they deserve recognition for their services out of Dublin and Rosslare, but no Corkman will compliment them for the treatment they meted out to Cork.  Perhaps they were merely carrying out Government <Col N="1899" /> policy.  If they were, I shall have to reconsider my position.</P>
    <P>The decision to change from Swansea to Pembroke was a mistake.  That heralded the beginning of the end of the ferry service from Cork to the UK.  There is more to crossing the Irish Sea than just the crossing.  Account must be taken of how people get to the ferry on one side and how they get to their destination after they leave the ferry on the other side. What was in Pembroke when the B &amp; I went there?  There was a promise of infrastructural development.  It suited the thinking in the B &amp; I to go up to the overloaded east coast, in order to copper-fasten the service from Dublin.  People were not enthusiastic about using the ferry to Pembroke because there was an inadequate road structure there to take them to the various parts of England and Wales that they wished to go to.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that the bulk of the £7 million capital investment is being spent on vessel refurbishment. Where is that refurbishment being done? This Government have sat by since 1984, when they closed the dockyard in which they had a 49 per cent stake.  They will not acknowledge the efforts being made to reopen the dockyard to meet the repair needs of the shipbuilding industry.  The Minister had the audacity to state that the bulk of this money is being spent on vessel refurbishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refrain from using that word because of the context in which it was used at one time.  I am pleased the Minister referred to the dockyard because otherwise the Chair would have insisted that I confine my contribution to the B &amp; I.  However, by telling us that <Col N="1900" /> the refurbishment of those vessels would be carried out in foreign shipyards the Minister has given me that opportunity to refer to the Cork dockyard.  To their eternal disgrace the Government have not made any effort to encourage the reopening of the dockyard in Cork.</P>
      <P>At our Ard-Fheis in 1985 I made a commitment that on Fianna Fáil's return to Government I would ensure that the yard would be reopened and a shipbuilding programme embarked upon.  It is a disgrace that the Government have allowed repair work to go to foreign shipyards. I should like to refer to the P31, subsequently named <i>Eithne,</i> the pride and joy of that dockyard and the last vessel to be built there.  In November 1984 we suggested to the Government that the vessel should be constructed at the dockyard and sold as a fishery protection vessel around the world, but what has happened since?  Vessels based on that design are being built in places like Singapore, the Far East, the Middle East and India.  The Government leased the design of that vessel to those shipyards on the condition that they are paid £1 million for each ship built.  However, the workforce that had the skill to put the first P31 together are idle in Cobh and surrounding areas.  The Government should have insisted on the refurbishment being carried out in Irish dockyards.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  The Government should have made an effort to reopen the Cork dockyard and helped the workers who lost their jobs, and the local authorities, in their efforts to reopen the yard.  Is the Minister aware that 250 of the workers who lost their jobs have indicated their willingness to contribute at least £1,000 of their redundancy money? All we want is a commitment and encouragement from the Government, but all our pleas have fallen on deaf ears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that the new agreement will achieve a more efficient utilisation of vessels while providing a better overall service to the consumer. What is the Minister talking about?  What consumer is he referring to?  Is he referring to people who live in the Dublin region?  Is he considering those who have <Col N="1901" /> to travel from places like Dingle by train to Dún Laoghaire to get the ferry to Britain?  I do not think so.  The tourist trade is very important for the south-west region which has suffered greatly from the economic position in the country. Cork had the dubious distinction of being the black spot following the closing of traditional industries, but we have great tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>A short time ago the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, suggested that Cork people should do something for themselves, that if there were such a response it would be recognised by the Government. Is the Minister of State aware that a group of Cork people, and the local authorities, are prepared to negotiate with the liquidator for the take over of the dockyard? Is he aware of the response by the Government to that initiative?  The least the Government should have done was to acknowledge that effort and give whatever assistance was needed.  In the case of the Cork dockyards we were only talking about £2 million but the Government could not see their way to give that money.  They have not responded in a meaningful way to the initiative taken by people in the south west who suffered so much as a result of factory closures and so on.  Those people were anxious to develop the tourist industry but they needed a direct shipping link between Cork and the UK.  The Minister, Deputy Mitchell, will recall that public representatives from the south headed a deputation that met him to discuss that link. Those representatives took a back seat at that meeting and allowed the exporters, the tourist interests, and even the taximen, to make their case.  They were determined to provide an alternative sea link to the B &amp; I which had gone to the east coast but, following all the dithering and uncertainty, we were told we would be receiving only £300,000.  That money was received too late in the year to be effective, long after the plans had been published.  The efforts of the local people were scuttled in the same way as Irish Shipping were scuttled.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister of State <Col N="1902" /> referred to the battle for the market share.  This is unbelievable.  He said that reductions in fares were the only means of attracting extra passengers.  If that is the criterion by which B &amp; I are running their operation is it any wonder they have found themselves in this position?  I said earlier that there is more to the running of a service than just the sea crossings between two termini.  How is it that the Minister this morning did not indicate the other means by which passengers could be attracted than by lower fares?  I will not say that the arrival of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, is timely, because a few moments ago I mentioned his name.  Perhaps he was listening on the monitor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been quoted in his daily paper down our way as saying that if Cork people showed initiative and did something for themselves the Government would respond.  I agree that any group of people anywhere need to show some initiative, enterprise, innovation, if they ar to get a response in a positive way.  I have cited two examples of the Government not acknowledging initiative and drive by Cork people, by the workers and the local authorities in Cork, who tried to re-open the dockyard. The response of the Government was negative.  A delegation representing exporters, the tourism trade and others came to Kildare Street with an initiative but the Government's response was so late that when the decision came to provide a ferry in 1984 it was not effective. We are not short of initiative in Cork; we are not short of people who want to do something.  It is said that actions speak louder than words, and Cork people have indicated that they are prepared to take initiatives.  However, the Government responses to their initiatives have been too late or non-existent.  If groups of people with good intentions go a certain distance, their ultimate success always requires that the Government, the local <Col N="1903" /> authority, the IDA or some other body charged with responsibility must acknowledge the efforts made locally.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of his speech the Minister said: &ldquo;It must be clearly recognised that the company's future cannot be assured by Government support alone.  It is equally dependent on full co-operation by all concerned ...&rdquo; I could not agree more &mdash; it is one of the few positive statements in the speech.  The Minister said it was equally dependent on full co-operation by all concerned in the provision of continuous reliable and efficient service.  I am not sure whom the Minister was talking about when he said &ldquo;all concerned&rdquo;. Was he talking about the employees of B &amp; I or the people who would be of tremendous help if they had a service in the south west region?  Would it not be nice for the Minister to know that the people from Cork who came here to talk to the Minister for Transport were 100 per cent behind the effort?  The Minister and the Government would have the response the Minister is looking for, but this must be a two-way operation. It cannot be one-sided, and it cannot be emphasised sufficiently that B &amp; I were incorrect in their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last paragraph of his speech the Minister said that the Government's objective was to ensure secure employment for B &amp; I employees and to contribute to the development of tourism and the trade and general economic growth. What area of the country was the Minister talking about: was it Dublin 4 and its environs?  Is this a Government for the Pale?  Surely if one talks about the development of tourism, trade and general economic well-being he must include the south west region.  Was the Minister seriously talking about the whole country when he made that statement?  The Minister should have been honest and truthful enough to say that he was talking about a limited area and not give the impression that the £38 million being provided for B &amp; I was for the benefit of the whole country.  Let us face it, it is not when you ignore an area the size of the south west &mdash; a colleague expressed <Col N="1904" /> reservations about the south east.  As I said, there should have been a new title to the Bill but that did not happen.  We will deal with the matter as presented to us.  I am sorry that the Minister of State has left the House because I should have liked to tell him about the initiatives we took in Cork.</P>

      <P>I am glad I have the attention of two or three Ministers.  They may think my contribution is hitting too hard, but they have heard nothing yet.  I have no doubt that the Minister and the Government are aware of a report presented on the Cork-Swansea summer service for 1984.  It was prepared at a cost to the people of Cork by the firm of Touche Ross and Company, Chartered Accountants, doing the job the Department should do.  We were obliged to have this job done because we tried unsuccessfully to get the message across to the Minister by way of deputation and delegation.  Eventually, we decided it was best to get professional people to talk to other professional people in the Department and through them to an uncaring and unheeding Government about a ferry link for the south coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to read the entire report but I realise it would be superflous because I know the Department, the Minister and the Government have got the report.  Nevertheless, there are significant elements I shall quote but I will not do so out of context.  The report was <Col N="1905" /> prepared by Touche Ross and Company from information supplied by the Cork Harbour Commissioners, Associated British Ports and Irish Continental Lines Limited.  The following documents were the main sources of information: Swansea to Cork via &ldquo;Emerald Gateway&rdquo;, an appraisal prepared jointly by the Harbour Commissioners and Associated British Ports and Swansea and Port Talbot Docks, produced in 1983, a copy of which I have here.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the Minister I shall quote some interesting extracts from that document to prove to him and to the Government that the people in Cork have not just been sitting back, that we have not come up here cap in hand to this miserable, broken down, inefficient, inadequate and leaderless Government. When we come forward with a case we have it well prepared, well documented and researched.  It is obvious that some of my colleagues on the opposite side have no influence with their Government to help in this matter.  This bankrupt Government have one ambition for Cork, namely, to close down everything at the first sight of trouble.  They will keep Bewleys open but they will close everything in Cork, including Egans. Also used in preparation of the document was a report by Irish Continental Lines Limited on the Cork-Swansea service produced in November 1983 and a report by the same company on the Cork-Swansea summer service for 1984.</P>
    <P>For almost 160 years direct passenger freight services have operated from the port of Cork to UK ports.  In that time records indicate that there was a thriving shipping service in and out of Cork which laid the foundation for economic development in subsequent years.  It was vitally important for an area like the south-west to have that outlet for its many agricultural products and the by-products from the tanneries.  Regrettably in subsequent years the port was used for a purpose we did not like, namely, the emigration of our people.  They took the boat at Penrose Quay and subsequently at Tivoli when it was moved further down the harbour. It was a useful link for our kith and <Col N="1906" /> kin and it enabled them to dock in Cork when they returned on vacation from their workplaces in Manchester and London.  These people worked throughout the year for the one or two weeks they spent at home and they used the ferry until B &amp; I decided to concentrate their efforts in Dublin and on the east coast.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister spoke about the development of tourism, trade and economic growth.  How can we have those things in the Cork region without an adequate shipping link to Britain where markets are available, although they may not be available to the same extent as formerly because nowadays our higher costs in respect of energy and taxes mean we cannot be competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> producers in the UK.  However, that is no reason not to acknowledge the efforts of the people of Cork to replace a ferry link with Britain that has been foresaken by the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>We are asked to approve the expenditure of £38 million and other provisions in this Bill.  I do not accept some of the provisions and I will not discuss them again.  Deputies from all over the country are expected to give unqualified and unrestricted support for this measure. Whatever we do, we are not expected to make any unfavourable comment.  The Minister said it is awful having to listen to me.  I am sorry for him or for any other Minister, but it is my duty as a Cork Deputy to pursue these matters on behalf of my constituents without losing sight of my commitment to the national interest. I do not want to be misquoted or misunderstood, but the national interest is as much my concern as the local interest.  In considering this Bill I will of course take into account the national interest.  I want to lay emphasis on the regional interest of the south-west.  What was embarked on by the B &amp; I in the south-west region was unacceptable to me, to put it very mildly.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of this report dealt with the market.  Of crucial importance to the viability of a Cork/Swansea service is the size and share of the market it may reasonably hope to attain.  Prior to the <Col N="1907" /> move by the B &amp; I from Swansea in 1979, the Cork/Swansea service had a market share of approximately 13 per cent and 10 per cent respectively of total accompanied car and total sea passengers between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I have facts to back up what I am saying.  This documentation on the &ldquo;Emerald Gateway,&rdquo; Cork to Swansea, is already in the Department.</P>
    <P>If the B &amp; I were carrying out Government policy, then the Government are wrong and they must accept responsibility for what has happened.  I will not allow them to shirk that responsibility by saying that the board of B &amp; I did this, that or the other.  Either the Government are responsible or they are not.  It is fair to say that this Government have been irresponsible in many areas and that adding another item to their list of irresponsibilities will run off them like water off a duck's back, because they do not appear to be one whit sensitive to the constructive criticism which has been levelled at them since they came into office.  The best defence they have is that they are paying for what happened between 1973 and 1977.  If Government Deputies think that will work outside the chapel gates they are in for a surprise, because they cannot get away from the fact that out of the last 13 years Coalition Governments were in power for more than eight years.  It mistakes were made, if there were misjudgments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am talking about the misjudgment of the B &amp; I in leaving Cork.  If this Government felt mistakes had been made it was up to them to correct those mistakes, if they had the ability to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was talking about the &ldquo;Emerald Gateway&rdquo; and the market.  The market share reduced significantly after the move to Pembroke and the introduction of the Rosslare service.  Both harbour authorities and Irish Continental Lines believe that a peak summer service could attract <Col N="1908" /> a market share comparable to that achieved previously on the route, provided a suitable vessel was made available.  That belief is based on the following facts. First, the Irish Tourist Board data indicate that 48 per cent of all United Kingdom sea visitors to Ireland originate in the south-east and south-west regions with an additional 8 per cent originating in Wales.  The port nearest to these regions for crossing to Ireland is Swansea &mdash; 207 miles from London by motorway with the same distance from Liverpool, and 85 miles from Bristol compared with 144 miles to Pembroke.  Second, the Irish Tourist Board data indicate that 53 per cent of United Kingdom visitors to Ireland are destined for the south and west regions, to which Cork provides the ideal gateway.</P>
    <P>Maybe the Minister's job is not so easy listening to me and you, Sir, may be getting bored stiff but I think I have an easy task proving the dreadful mistake the B &amp; I made, a mistake which has been compounded by the approval of this Government and by their non-activity in ensuring that a sea link with the United Kingdom was re-established out of the south-west.</P>
    <P>Another Cork Deputy contributed to this debate this morning.  I will be charitable and say that pious platitudes are of no significance to the needs of Cork and the south-west region.  In respect of visitors from the Irish Republic to the United Kingdom, the British authorities state that from 1980, 68 per cent of such visitors were from the south-east, the south-west and the Welsh regions.  The service would draw natural support from the Munster area; but this Government, this B &amp; I, tell all these people who know their job that these visitors must travel via Dún Laoghaire or stay at home.</P>
    <P>I have here a detailed monthly analysis of car and passenger numbers travelling by sea to the United Kingdom in 1981, the latest figures available.  I want to put on record the monthly passenger movement by the sea in 1981, a short time before the B &amp; I pulled out.  It would be significant if I dealt only with the months April to October, the peak period, the <Col N="1909" /> period which, if properly used, managed and serviced by the B &amp; I, would more than provide sufficient revenue to maintain an all year service.  The number of passengers in 1981 were: April, 204,000; May, 178,000; June, 207,000; July, 355,000; August, 520,000; September, 268,000; and October, 185,000.  Associated accompanied cars in the same period were: April, 32,000; May, 28,000; June, 32,000; July, 55,000; August, 79,000; and September, 42,000.</P>
    <P>I have read those figures as an indication of the case being made for the provision of a ferry link out of Cork.  The projected figures of 21,700 cars and 107,000 passengers for the summer service are the equivalent of 12.7 per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively, of the sea traffic between the Republic and the UK for the same period.  To attain this market share the main thrust of the marketing effort will be to highlight the advantageous locations of both Swansea and Cork, the former in relation to the principal segment of the UK market, that is the south-east, and the latter in relation to the prime Cork-Kerry tourist region. It will stress that the route is tailored to meet the needs of the travelling public as opposed to a route designed to suit the operator.</P>
    <P>The aspect of it that I have just mentioned of attracting additional passengers will not succeed if we are to consider only, as this Government seem to be doing through B &amp; I and through this Bill, using a route designed to suit the operator.  That is too limited, too confined in its context.  The service from Cork to Swansea has direct access to the UK.  Think of the motorway via Swansea and the countrywide rail access independent of demand generated by local ferry services.  This service thus minimises long, tedious, expensive inland journeys to reach destinations.  I have already referred to this.  I am saying it because this report is with the Department, and why they have not reacted positively to the submission is beyond my understanding, limited though that may be.  All the facts, figures and details are there.</P>
    <P>If we want to attract business to a ferry <Col N="1910" /> we will have to get away from the idea that the ferry is run for the operator of the ferry, and that is what is contained in this Bill.  We must take account of the people, the passengers whom we hope to attract to the ferry.  Will anybody in the Government or amongst their advisers indicate how you sell a ferry service from Rosslare to the UK or from Dublin to the UK to the people of west Cork or the Dingle peninsula, those who are away and want to come back and those who are in those areas who might like to visit their sons and daughters and members of their families who had emigrated and who are again emigrating in recent times? Then think of the motor journey along mainly county roads that are falling apart at the seams, along secondary roads that have not been maintained to take account of the volume of traffic on them.  We expect passengers to drive those unsuitable, rough miles to get to a ferry boat, to come up from Dingle or any part of the south-west, any part of Kerry, drive through Cork, go through Waterford and Wexford to Rosslare.  We expect to sell that sort of ferry service to the people of the south-west after they have passed the emerald gateway now down at Ringaskiddy. What kind of thinking is this from Government and the Department?  What kind of thinking is this from the people who advise the Government and Department to allow such a situation to occur?</P>
    <P>Take the people who come in on the Dún Laoghaire ferry at night who, mind you, are very lucky if they catch the last train that night.  It is so long since I travelled on it that I am not sure of the time but I think that it leaves at about 8.40 p.m. I have travelled on it with people who came off that ferry and were lying across their cases and their sleeping bags, travelling, travelling, travelling, and all to accommodate a short sea connection. There was not a cup of water available on that train for our tourists, for our own people returning via the ferry system organised by B &amp; I with the approval of this Government.  On one occasion when I was on that train &mdash; I think it is necessary to mention a specific event &mdash; but for the <Col N="1911" /> fact that the guard on the train had a flask of tea with him, somebody who had become ill would have had nothing available for comfort or refreshment and the Minister talks about selling this service to passengers of the B &amp; I who are going south.</P>
    <P>When that train gets to Limerick Junction, has the Minister considered how passengers for Limerick city will reach home that night?  The Minister talks about the development of tourism, trade and general economic growth.  What nonsense. Who does he think he is talking to when he produces a Second Stage contribution along those terms?</P>
    <P>I regret it if the Minister of State had some difficulty in listening to what I have to say on this Bill and if that is why they are changing the guard.  I do not intend to be personal but I must make my point.</P>
    <P>The service we were supporting and emphasising should be there was, as I indicated, concentrating on the peak summer season and emphasis was placed on the importance of the travel trade to the success of the service.  The significance of the B &amp; I switch to Pembroke is central to the decision that was eventually reached.  I could go into further detail about how the figures were juggled to prove that Cork was not viable if I had the time, but I have not.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the duty free goods that were available on the boats plying the Irish Sea and the handy little bookkeeping exercise that was done to show we were losing on the Cork route and that the Dublin route was the one to use.  That was another reason given to pull out B &amp; I.  I might have time to go into that in more detail.  We have the facts of a nice little hoo-ha of bookwork all to prove that a ferry out of Cork by B &amp; I was not viable.  My job, whether at cost to the Government or not, is to make a damn good effort to prove that the decision was incorrect and that we should have a ferry link with the UK out of Cork.</P>
    <P>Let me talk about the facilities available at the ferries.  I will talk about Swansea as distinct from Pembroke.  The <Col N="1912" /> ferry complex at Swansea was completed in 1969 and comprises a tidal berth of 450 feet in length served by one of the largest shore bridges in Britain, 250 feet by 20 feet plus walkways which can be raised or lowered to a range of 42½ feet.  Vessels drawing up to 16 feet can be accommodated on all tides and can lie on the berth most of the time throughout the year. Ample swinging space is provided.  The terminal ashore has a large backup area, purpose built for freight, passengers and cars.  Existing facilities include a fenced freight compound, car park, marshalling areas, reception, customs hall, passenger, baggage, etc.</P>
    <P>Cork is a much larger and more sophisticated terminal, which the B &amp; I decided to abandon.  Cork has a much bigger ship capacity, 31 foot depth at low tide, a double lane link span and a modern terminal building equipped with catering facilities, a spacious car and freight compound and, in addition, a lay-by berth to cater for clashes of arrival times and unavoidable delays.  We provided for everything in our design of that terminal. Nevertheless, the B &amp; I by their decision pulled out of the terminal and the Government did not tell them to get back in, that the terminal was worth operating. They should have been told to run a service to the UK but the Government did not have the wit, nerve or political clout to tell the B &amp; I what to do.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I asked the Government for £38 million to service the port of Dublin and Rosslare, although I understand there is a doubt about retaining Rosslare.  However, I do not want to take part in the rumour-mongering in regard to Rosslare because we are more concerned about the facts concerning Cork.  The complex at Ringaskiddy has been paid for by the taxpayers over a number of years.  Admittedly it was shelved for a short period by two Coalition Governments but we encouraged them to take the dust off it and get on with its development.  When we came back into power we ensured that as much work as possible was done to finish the development of the terminal. We also brought in a plan for a road network which is far superior to anything <Col N="1913" /> at Pembroke.  Therefore, the ferry service, so badly needed, should be operating from Ringaskiddy to Swansea.</P>
    <P>To provide an adequate service on the Cork-Swansea route which assumes ten hours' sailing, a ship containing approximately 500 bays with car spaces in excess of 200 units would be required.  Through our initiative and through these reports made out for the Government, we envisaged that the ship would be chartered for 98 days, including six days for delivery and redelivery before and after completing the service.  We even went into fuel consumption which, of course, with the drop since in the price of energy and oil, would have an even more significant impact in the provision of a ferry service now.  The fuel consumption of a chartered vessel would be equivalent to that of <i>St. Patrick II,</i> using mainly intermediate fuel oil rather than diesel.  We had gone into that much detail to help the Government in their decision-making.  The decision, however, did not go our way because the influence of other areas and people bore too strongly against the Cork area, even two years ago, and the bias against Cork continues.  We even suggested that catering and duty free facilities would be supplied on board in accordance with normal practice.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the report deals with the finance required in order to operate the proposed service and on the basis of the assumptions underlying the financial projections which are on pages 8 to 10.  It is hardly necessary for me to read them out when this information is already known to the Minister, the Government and the Department.  Nevertheless, it appears that a maximum funding requirement of £569,000 will arise, peaking at the end of June.  That referred to the year of the report.  It is proposed that the promoters of the venture will provide up to 50 per cent of the peak requirements by way of equity and loan finances in the initial stages of the venture.  How much more do the Government want from Cork? Those people were prepared to put up 50 per cent and yet the Minister said last week that when Cork got off its behind the Government would respond.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> The day is gone when the Minister will continue to insult the people of Cork without a response from Deputies in the area, especially on this side of the House. We put up with that for so long in a peaceful way in the hope that encouragement and conciliation, rather than confrontation or attack would work but the type of insult to which I referred will not be tolerated any longer.  The Taoiseach further insulted me by saying in answer to a question here that he had no involvement in the saving of Egans, Patrick Street but that it was essential to keep a coffee shop in Dublin open.  If that is their attitude, our kid glove approach up to now is over.  It will not be the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog from now on.  I was at pains to restrain myself in the face of the insult offered by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, to the people of Cork in regard to responding to their needs.</P>
    <P>I have outlined what we gave the Government in relation to a ferry and what we prepared for them at our own expense in Cork.  We got commitments from people, and the Minister of State and the Government will rue the day that such a remark was made.  It is said that an animal known as the elephant never forgets.  I can assure this Government that I know a &ldquo;Lyon&rdquo; that does not forget. The report goes on:</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the balance of funding be provided by financial institutions and that promoters could be repaid their contribution after completion of the service.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the timing of cash inflows and outflows within individual months could have the effect of greatly varying the projected figures. Accordingly, funding facilities somewhat in excess of 50% of peak projected requirement will be sought.</P>
    <P>When it was sought, what was the response?  This Government hesitated and did everything but what was required of them to encourage initiative, and when the commitment came we had banner headlines from the Government Deputies about a marvellous effort.  About a <Col N="1915" /> month ago that was again referred to as an enormous boost to Cork, but it came so late that it was no use to us.  The &ldquo;Lyon&ldquo; has forgotten something but he has been reminded.  When we were trying to get this ferry service restored to Cork &mdash; and I have an exact photostat copy of what was said for use in the next election campaign &mdash; one Deputy still in this House, a member of Fine Gael, indicated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to refer to another document, an apraisal of the entire matter of the B &amp; I and so forth, prepared jointly by the Cork Harbour Commissioners and Associated British Ports, Swansea &amp; Port Talbot Docks entitled, &ldquo;Swansea-Cork, the Emerald Gateway&ldquo;.  In the introduction it is stated:</P>
      <P>This presentation is probably unique in at least one respect.  Two port authorities in different countries had sought to identify a marketing opportunity for a profitable shipping service and have then handed over their marketing information to third parties to exploit the project.</P>
      <P>The reason for this is not lack of faith in carrying theory into practice but an awareness that, whilst ports are best operated by experienced port authorities, shipping services are best operated by experienced shipping companies. Both ports have already backed their judgment by heavy investment in terminals and associated facilities &mdash; and are prepared to consider further investment in conjunction with an appropriate ship operator.</P>
      <P>That ship operator should have been the B &amp; I but for their abandoning of the ferry link from Cork to the UK.  The introduction goes on:</P>
      <P>Even at this stage of the presentation, it cannot be stressed too much that the ports concerned are not interested in a &ldquo;lame-duck&ldquo; operation, struggling from crisis to crisis, but in a fully viable project which will bring profit both to the operator and themselves, and produce a standard of service to satisfy the customers of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the kernel of the problem.  We are neglecting the standard of service needed to satisfy the customers and that is a mistake.  I will come later to the amounts of money they lost from 1978 onwards.  The major aim is the provision of a ferry from Cork to the UK.  The age old problem for the shipowner is whether <Col N="1917" /> to go for the shortest sea crossing, thereby minimising his costs, or to locate his service as near as possible to where his main flows of cargo are generated and destined.  That is the key element of this operation.  To be fair to the shipowners, they have to look at that aspect.  Like most things in life, the best answer is often a sensible compromise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, due to the restriction on time I shall not have the time so necessary to go into some detail about the serious difficulties confronting our agriculture industry at present.  On the basis of what was said in this debate last night one will readily recognise that both sides of the House see agriculture facing what must surely be the most serious crisis ever in the history of that industry.  Agriculture has always been the backbone of our economy and it is no different today.  The agricultural output and its importance to the balance of trade and the revenue earning capacity of its exports have kept us afloat for very many years.  We have come to a stage, regrettably, where the industry threatens to go under.  Its capacity to provide the financial wherewithal and the economic output to generate jobs in processing and manufacturing must be grieviously undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times media speculation on the serious fodder difficulties afflicting small farmers in the west and the midlands has not been sufficiently emphasised. The difficulties last summer with the saving of fodder had very serious repercussions on stock last winter and the spring of this year.  That has culminated in huge numbers of stock dying at the <Col N="1919" /> back of the ditches or in housing facilities. For the farmers involved, this is a loss from which they will never recover.  In addition, we have had very bad spring weather continued into summer, which has meant that the capacity to save fodder is very inhibited.  It has been recognised that for too long many small farmers have depended solely on hay as a source of winter fodder and, given the weather conditions to which we are subject here, that obviously is not the best option.  If we examine the structural difficulties which apply in many of these farms, we find that because of insufficient cash flow and because of the geography of the farms it is simply not possible for the farmers to move into silage making as the main source of winter fodder.  Nonetheless, there is a possibility there for many owners of smaller holdings to change over to silage if they had the money to do so.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to discuss this very serious issue.  We would not be having this debate this evening if we had a Government with guts that would have made an effort in the last three years to get what they could for Ireland in Brussels.  Instead, they have damaged our image over there accepting what was thrown to them.  That was evidenced from the package accepted by the Minister for Agriculture some weeks ago.  The Germans objected to that package and they have been given a bonus in recent days, but there was a complete sell-out by our Minister for Agriculture.  I do not know if there was some wheeling and dealing done behind the scenes.  As a result of his acceptance of the package many thousands of farmers and their families will feel the pinch even more than in the last three years.  The President of the IFA has done more for farming than the Minister and the whole Department put together. Were it not for him, the Minister would <Col N="1920" /> have been asleep for the last 12 months. He had to be kicked into action.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us he had got a great deal for us.  He had to return six months later to try to fix the matter up.  We are the laughing stock of Europe.  Our image is damaged in Brussels. Any schemes made available to us and fought for by Fianna Fáil Governments were dumped by the present administration &mdash; the lime subsidy, the A I subsidy, the farm grants. This is the Government that now tell us they are worried about the farmers.  They have not shown that in the last three years.  There is a danger of the beef intervention system being thrown to the wind at the fall of the year.  How could anybody have any confidence in the Government with the way they have handled the whole situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a sell-out as regards grain. Grain growing in this country in another year will be something that we will dream about, despite all the investment put into it by farmers, both in machinery and drying plants.  We will be importing thousands of tonnes of second grade grain. More job losses will occur along the way. <Col N="1921" /> The Minister accepted the whole package as if he had not a tongue in his head.  He should have walked out and rejected it, as the Germans did.  He would then have got something.</P>

      <P>There was an 8 per cent drop in the price of cereals.  It will be a bad day for the country if all those in the grain industry are put out of business, and it looks as if there is no other option. The Minister is not worried about them. He says he is going around the country looking at the problems, but he is passing by very speedily in his State car and not speaking to the people concerned.  That is what he did when carving out the disadvantaged areas.  On occasions he and his officials got lost in the fog on the hills. He was very careful, however, to stay on the Waterford side and did not come to Tipperary or to Cork.  It is a great asset to have a State car, because one can get all the perks, as outlined by my colleague last night.</P>
      <P>The high interest rate charged for long term borrowing is a scandal.  The banks and lending institutions have ripped off the farmers.  They are trying to sell them out behind the scene, nice and quietly, and the Government are sitting back and saying nothing.  There is a lot of waffle about cheap money being available; but, when one examines the small print, very few people will qualify for that.  The same applies to the farm grants.  It is a fraud. The farmers have been codded for three years.  A lot of western waffle is all that we have got from Minister Connaughton. He is the greatest waffler who ever came into this House.</P>

      <P>First, it is important that on an occasion like this all the emotive rhetoric we heard here last night is taken out of the debate.  I heard a Deputy in the middle of a high-flown debate &mdash; he was not speaking but flying &mdash; say that because things are so bad with the farmers some of them are leaving their houses in the dead of night to get out of the country.  That is the greatest codswallop I ever heard.  I deal with facts.  I want to nail a number of comments which were made last night.  Every farmer in Ireland is only too well aware of what is happening but for some strange reason there are Deputies in this House who either do not understand or do not want to understand what is happening.  The famous retreat <Col N="1923" /> from Irish agriculture by this Government is a favourite ploy of Fianna Fáil.  I will give some interesting figures to show what is happening.</P>

      <P>As mentioned by Deputy Noonan yesterday, in the region of 25 per cent of the FEOGA budget goes to farmers.  In 1984, £645 million was made available on the market support side.  In 1985, the figure was £837 million.  It is most important to tell the House where that money went.  Suckler cow grants, calf schemes and so on amounted to £143 million in 1984 and £153 million in 1985.  Many people believe that export subsidies are of no use to farmers.  If they did not exist our exports to the third countries would be at a standstill.  In 1984 they were worth £324 million to Irish agriculture.  In 1985 that figure had risen to £357 million. Losses on the sale of intervention products which were bought by the Department amounted to £142 million in 1984 and £215 million in 1985.  That is an indirect subsidy to agriculture.  To take all those figures together in 1984 the total figure was £694 million and in 1985 it was £893 million.</P>

      <P>Some people got their answer in Athlone.  It is important to remember that the Government will always stand by the people at the bottom of the pile, the people who are struggling to make a living.  Most farmers can see this for themselves.  Within the constraints of the financial position any Government would like to do much more.  In the unprecedented situation we now find ourselves in the Government cannot be faulted for what they are doing.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the Euro loan.  This is something on which Deputies on all sides of the House have been shouting about for years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Euro loan is very important.  When circumstances were outside their control many people borrowed money at relatively low interest rates.  We all know what happened. As a result of rising inflation and interest rates, they found themseves in a difficult position.  The Government have seen fit to ensure that there will be money made available at about 8½ per cent to 9 per cent to those borrowers.  This is important for those people, who are basically the leaders in the agricultural arena and who saw fit to borrow when times were better than they are now.  Most of the banking groups will have the relevant information early next week.  I want to say to any farmer around the country who believes he is in a very tight financial position that he should speak to his bank manager or the manager of his local ACC.  This is a very important step for people in that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is old hat, but it can never be said often enough.  It amazes me why more people do not make silage with the <Col N="1928" /> climatic conditions we have in this country. Recently, I introduced the farm improvement programme which I am glad to say, is going extremely well.  Leaving that aside, it was felt an added incentive should be brought in to ensure that as many people as is humanly possible could be got to make silage even at this stage.  We have introduced a new range of grants.  As Deputies are aware, there is now up to 45 per cent at current up-to-date costings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that three years ago inspections in the severely disadvantaged areas were carried out in the months of October, November and December.  Many people had to hold on to their cattle in order to make sure that they had the cattle for the headage inspection.  This caused a glut at the end of the year.  They lost more than they gained.  The system has now been so organised that last year we were able to have the inspections in the month of August.  Hopefully, we will be able to do as good, if not better, this year.  That is vitally important for very small farmers in the severely disadvantaged areas.  The ewe premium grant will find its way to farmers at least six to eight weeks earlier this year.  That is a positive approach by the Government.  We fully understand the problems which beset agriculture at present.</P>

For some strange reason &mdash; this is something which appears to have been peddled around mischieviously &mdash; people are beginning to say that the Government said: &ldquo;ah, we will pay £70 or £100 on the beef cow and there is none of it coming.&rdquo;  I want to categorically state that the biggest single amount ever payable to the beef cow sector will be paid this year.  The £32 is being increased to £70.  If we add the cow suckler premium, which is about £27, the headage payment of those in the headage areas and the calf premium, it is way over £100.  It is our belief that it is important we have a very strong beef sector, particularly in the suckler section.  We will put our money where our mouths are.  We are putting £11 million of somebody's money into the system in order to add that extra incentive for the small beef cow producer. Basically, they are all very small producers.  I sincerely hope that they will react favourably to it and that we will build up the numbers fairly dramatically over the next few years.</P>
      <P>Anybody who will point a finger and say that that is bad policy by the Department of Agriculture is only a begrudger.

They will undoubtedly <Col N="1931" /> be of major advantage to the farming community over the coming 12 months. We cannot but recognise the extremely difficult situation the farming community have gone through over the last year, conditions which were totally outside their control.  I want to compliment the Minister for Agriculture on his efforts to try to alleviate the very serious situation farmers faced over the last number of months.  It is important to note the number of schemes the Minister introduced to alleviate this very difficult situation. First, there was the nitrogen subsidy scheme, later the silage subsidy scheme and then the Shannon Valley aid scheme, referred to last evening by Deputy N. Treacy.

      <P>The feed voucher <Col N="1932" /> scheme was one of the best ever introduced and constituted quite an amount of aid for needy farmers thoughout the length and breadth of the country.  As the Minister has said, the new EC loan will help to ease the burden on many farmers endeavouring to meet high loan repayments. All of those aids are to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I also want to welcome the new grant scheme which will play a major part in alleviating the difficult position of many farmers <i>vis-à-vis</i> housing for their cattle or who want to carry out reclamation and drainage works.  It should be remembered also that in the difficult time experienced in the months of March and April the Government made available Army transport to the farming community to transport fodder from one region to another.</P>
      <P>It is very easy to be critical.  I listened to many people opposite.  All they have done is jump on the backs of farmers who have been experiencing extreme hardship in recent months.  They have not put forward one constructive proposal but rather have knocked everything the Government have done.  I shudder to think of the day that party might be in Government when the farmers will be seeking guidance from them.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned a number of schemes in operation. I appeal to the Minister to examine the possibility of having payments made as soon as possible under all of those schemes. The early payments made on the sheep subsidy and beef cow schemes were welcome.  I know the Minister said he would arrange to have the headage readings taken earlier, which is to be welcomed also.  Very often farmers had been forced to hold on to cattle, ending up with a glut at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues to examine the possibility of having all western areas included in the provisions of the severly disadvantaged <Col N="1933" /> scheme, one way in which we can substantially increase the income of the farming community.  Farmers have experienced enormous difficulties caused by the extremely bad weather, losing all of their winter feed last year.  Indeed, because of the very bad spring, many will have no hay for the coming year.  These are realities that must be faced.  Perhaps the Minister and his colleagues would ascertain what can be done to extend the provisions of the headage payments scheme, not alone in regard to an extension of the areas covered by its provisions, but also the possibility of increasing the payments themselves.  I believe that is one way in which we can get the EC to pick up some of the costs suffered by this country as a result of the bad weather. We cannot and should not under-estimate farmers' difficulties.</P>
    <P>One could not speak in this debate without referring to the difficulties of many farmers <i>vis-à-vis</i> financial institutions. We must examine what can be done to alleviate the pressure on many farmers, caused by their having borrowed money at relatively low interest rates some ten years ago.  Because of the way the money market went they now find themselves paying interest rates almost double those obtaining at the time they borrowed.  Very many such farmers are no longer able to meet such commitments. I very much resent the implication of the Opposition that that is the fault of the Government.</P>

The Government might usefully meet the lending institutions to ascertain what could be done in order to have farmers treated more sympathetically and, wherever a rescue package can be devised, that should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might refer to one part of the country, the subject of discussion here last week, that is, the Shannon valley.  Farmers there are unique and distinct from any <Col N="1934" /> other section of the farming community. Very many of them still have their lands flooded and are facing into their second year without any income whatsoever. Special assistance will have to be made available to them and urgently.  Some of those farmers had to sell off their stock last August or September rather than endeavour to continue to feed them. Some cattle are still being fed indoors with very expensive concentrates.  Many such farmers borrowed money from the creameries or banks and are now encountering major financial difficulties. Indeed, they could not have foreseen the possibility that their lands flooded in August last would remain flooded on 1 June 1986.  I appeal to the Minister to ascertain what can be done to alleviate the difficulties of approximately 3,000 farmers in that region embracing four or five counties.  A public meeting was held in Athlone on Friday evening last when this matter was discussed.  I notice the total absence in the House this evening of Opposition Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is now in operation what is known as a realistic assessment system which is causing major problems and hardship for many families.  The Minister and his colleagues might ascertain what can be done to alleviate the hardship caused to many of those farmers as a result.  For example, some of them were assessed on their 1984-85 income.  That no longer obtains because many of those people who were assessed as having an income of, say £2,000 from land in the year 1984-85 have ended up without an income in the year 1985-86 because of the continuing bad weather conditions.  I appeal to the Minister to see what can be done to give greater assistance to these hard pressed farmers.</P>

      <P>Whatever about the Minister of State not understanding the plight of farmers in the west at least Deputy Naughten understands it.  He has been speaking to our motion for the last ten minutes.  Perhaps he might do the decent thing and vote with us later on.</P>
      <P>We are talking about the plight of farmers in the west and the 1986-87 fodder crisis.  There is a genuine emergency in farming west of the Shannon.  Unless remedial action is taken and Government support is given, famine conditions will exist for animals and crippling poverty will return to the farming community in the west.  Unprecedented hardship is now widespread and, with no long term forecast for better weather, farmers are depressed about the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a totally inadequate response to the fodder crisis last year, particularly as far as sheep farmers are <Col N="1936" /> concerned.  There are no reserves of fodder.  Cattle and sheep are in bad condition. Thousands of them have died.  Hill sheep farmers suffered untold losses last year.  There were big losses in calving and lambing due to malnutrition and lack of fodder.  The fodder which was available was not of good quality.  Losses incurred as a result of dead animals are three times what they should have been in a normal year.  These are the facts.  The Minister of State being from the west should know the position and should not continue in the negative way in which he has been speaking.</P>
    <P>Growth is six weeks late this year.  Farmers have used the fields usually reserved for hay and silage to feed their starving cattle.  The cattle should have been taken off these fields many months ago.</P>
    <P>The tillage position is just as disastrous. Crops were not sown because of bad soil conditions and those that were rotted in the fields.  There was sunshine today in the west.  If it does not rain before midnight it will be the first day in nine months that they will not have had rain.  The feed cost for farmers for the first five months of this year was 75 per cent more than in the same period last year.  Hay worth £1 million had to be introduced into that area.  There has been a decrease of 7 per cent in milk supply and creamery cheques are not sufficient to pay bills.</P>
    <P>There are poor prices for cattle at present.  On average there is about a 16 per cent reduction in cattle prices.  Farmers are despairing and are selling off stock to provide food for their families. They have no disposable income with which to buy the fertiliser they need. Purchases of fertiliser have fallen by 20 per cent compared with last year.  Farmers' debts have increased by one third over the last year.  You are responsible for what remains of the Irish Land Commission.  The Land Commission are owed £3 million by farmers.  You have not done anything to help them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards cattle headage payments as far as Sligo and Mayo are concerned £8.3 million was paid out in 1985.  The EC rules would have allowed £20 million to be paid out had the Government taken the initiative to provide the extra few millions which would have generated that extra revenue.  That is the kind of money which is needed.  It would allow farmers to provide food for their families and the necessary fodder for their livestock.  Why is the Minister denying farmers the rights they have under EC legislation?  The vehicle is there and the Minister only has to use it.  Money is urgently needed now in order to buy fertiliser to minimise the fodder shortage next winter.</P>
      <P>The Minister should make the necessary arrangements for an increased headage grant payment this year up to the maximum available from EC sources. The silage subsidy of £5 per tonne for the first 40 tonnes should be continued.  A nitrogen fertiliser grant of £35 per tonne should be introduced.  That would be short term aid.  In the long term the Minister should introduce a decent grant for silage slabs.  A decent grant system should also be introduced for cattle housing which would help to defray the cost of materials.  Such a grant is available in another part of the country.</P>
      <P>We heard further bad news this evening. The bacon industry merger which was to take place in the west has been scuttled by the Government.  They have refused to fund the merger and the rescue package put together by Fóir Teoranta. It would have cost £4.5 million.  The Government can rescue Bewley's cafe in this city but they cannot save the livelihood of 800 workers in the bacon factories of the west.  That is the kind of thing we mean when we talk about Government mismanagement of the economy.  There is need for the Government to examine their conscience.  Their priorities are all wrong.  The pig takes second place to coffee and buns as far as the Government are concerned.  Surely it is time for a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy Naughton talk about unemployment assistance. <Col N="1938" /> Let us remind him and the Government that it was Fianna Fáil who introduced the notional assessment scheme.  It was of great aid to small farmers in developing their properties and increasing productivity. That scheme was ended needlessly by the Government.  It is like crying crocodile tears to talk about restoring something which the Government the Deputy supports did away with in the recent past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no mechanism for increasing the allowances to be paid due to the extraordinary difficult and severe cash downturns in farm income.  If farm incomes are reduced by 20 per cent, why cannot the assistance be increased to compensate for that?  It is unjust and unfair to a section of the community who work seven days a week, 12 months of the year in a hard and difficult industry when they are treated so shabbily by the Government.  Fianna Fáil introduced the small farm development plan.  This allowed small farmers to develop and get full benefit from the EC money which was available to them.  In 1965 Fainna Fáil introduced unemployment assistance based on the notional system.</P>
      <P>The Government have acted disgracefully in dealing with agriculture particularly in the west.  They scrapped the farm modernisation scheme, the artificial insemination scheme, the lime subsidy and drainage schemes.  They took away medical cards from farmers and are responsible for the return of emigration to one in every three families in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have no right to say they have any answer to the farming crisis, in particular as it affects the west and the areas I represent.  They have done the dirt on the bacon curing industry and are throwing 800 people onto the dole queue in Counties Roscommon, Mayo, Sligo and Limerick.  That is disgraceful when they could find plenty of money last week for coffee and buns in this city. <Col N="1939" /> They cannot find £4½ million to protect the jobs of 800 people in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers were affected in many ways over the past 18 months. We had a bad spring and summer in 1985. As a result not as much hay or silage could be made as would be made in normal circumstances.  It was followed by a bad winter and a late spring with grass and growth generally six weeks behind.  That resulted in heavy losses of cattle and sheep in rural areas.  In south Kerry farmers lost many sheep and cattle.  There were heavy losses of sheep in mountain areas in south Kerry, particularly during the lambing season.  Were it not for the headage grants and the sheep subsidy premiums, those sheep farmers would be out of business today.</P>
      <P>The disadvantaged area scheme should be extended to include the 12 western counties.  I see no reason why all of County Kerry is not declared a severely handicapped area.  If, as reported in the newspapers, Germany succeeded in getting EC Agriculture Ministers and the Council of Ministers to have half of that country designated as a disadvantaged area at a cost of £25 million to the EC and £25 million to the German Government, why is it that our Minister for Agriculture does not press for an extension of the disadvantaged area scheme in Ireland? People cannot understand why many areas were omitted originally.  In south Kerry parishes such as Listry, Ballyhar, Firies, Gurrane Mountain and areas near Farranfore were not included, although there is nothing there but bogland and it is safe to graze cattle and sheep for six months of each year.  In my view those areas qualify in regard to height over sea level, nature and quality of the soil and the small number of dwelling houses in the areas occupied by those engaged in non-agricultural activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question but that the continued bad weather is causing problems on most farms.  Land normally not grazed is now being put aside for sileage and hay.  The yield will be much lower this <Col N="1940" /> year, about six tonnes this year compared to nine tonnes in other years.  A second cut will have to go to in late autumn if Irish agriculture is to survive over the coming winter and up until April next. The Government should monitor the position in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Many dairy farmers who are caught in regard to super-levy conditions are in serious difficulty.  Farmers who are half way through their development programmes are in serious trouble, particularly if they have borrowed money to pay for buildings, stock and drainage.  How can such farmers meet repayments if they are programmed by the local ACOT office to produce 30,000 gallons of milk but are limited to 15,000 or 20,000 gallons?  Such farmers cannot attain their realistic targets of maximum milk production from their farms.  Many farmers who had their herds wiped out in 1983 by TB and brucellosis are in serious difficulty.  What quotas are they allowed?  Surely they should be allowed a quota based on their peak year prior to 1983?</P>
    <P>I should like to give an example of a typical case, that of a farmer near Killarney who has been caught under the super-levy system.  That farmer prior to 1982 produced more than 20,000 gallons of milk, but between 1982 and 1983 he had a TB problem in his herd and he had to get rid of some of his best animals.  That year he produced about 8,000 gallons of milk.  In 1984 his herd was completely wiped out by brucellosis and last year he started milk production again but was given a quota of 8,000 gallons.  In 1979 he had produced 22,000 gallons; in 1980, 19,000; and in 1981, 15,000; but for this year his quota has been reduced to 12,865 gallons.  Is it fair to restrict a farmer who was carrying 30 cows in 1983 to such a quota?  There are many farmers like that Killarney farmer.</P>
    <P>Concrete proposals to eliminate animal diseases were put forward to the Minister by farmers and their organisations, but I do not think they were taken seriously by him.  I have heard allegations about the damage being caused by badgers. There is proof that badgers carry diseases such as TB and brucellosis.  The <Col N="1941" /> Minister should listen to the farmers who are well versed in those matters.  He should ask the Wildlife Section of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to grant permits to farmers to destroy badgers in certain circumstances.  Many farmers are furious with the Minister because he is not doing anything positive in this regard.  I appeal to him to treat this matter as urgent.</P>
    <P>In my view there should be a minimum quota of 25,000 gallons for super-levy purposes.  It is not the small farmers of Ireland, who supply less than 25,000 gallons per annum, who are causing problems in regard to intervention.  The large multinationals in Europe are responsible for the milk and beef mountains.  The Minister should seek an exemption from this super-levy in respect of the first 25,000 gallons of milk supplied by Irish farmers.  He should put that proposal before the Council of Minister of Agriculture. Farmers cannot avail of the grant-aid offered to them by the Government because, due to their financial circumstances, they are unable to put up the balance of the money required to carry out their programmes.  Farmers are unable to avail of loan facilities for similar reasons.  Our farmers never experienced such problems before.</P>
    <P>I am aware that many farmers will not receive a milk cheque until August due to the bad harvest in 1985 and the bad spring this year.  It has been necessary for many of them to borrow heavily and get feed on credit from creameries and co-ops. How can such farmers avail of loan facilities to carry out development programmes?</P>
    <P>The motion is timely and was well presented. Agriculture is in a disastrous state and requires a comprehensive package of emergency measures.  Thousands of farmers are facing serious financial difficulties, and in some cases bankruptcy, because of the reduction in milk prices and output, the loss of livestock and the failure of crops.  The Minister should do something positive for the farming community, particularly those who cannot avail of grant-aid or loan facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed at the response of the Minister and the Minister of State to our motion.  If one tossed their comments together one would find very little comfort for our farmers.  Minister Connaughton insisted on talking in millions, but what would those millions mean to a farmer who is looking at dead stock in his fields?  The Minister claimed that many schemes were introduced recently, but I should like to remind him about the AI subsidy scheme, the calf heifer scheme, the farm modernisation scheme, the farm retirement scheme, the western drainage package, the reduction to An Foras Talúntais, the reduction to ACOT, the reduction in the amount allocated for disease eradication, the reduction in calf premiums and the abolition of the Land Commission. All of these had a vital role in agriculture. I support fully the motion before the House and sincerely hope that we will have support from the Government backbenchers. I know from speaking to them that they are disgusted at the Government's performance since 1982.</P>
      <P>In 1982 we had fixed prices and unlimited quantities of produce.  Today we have disastrous prices and very limited quantities.  I have never seen such depression and hopelessness among the farming community.  I have never seen such a demand from the agricultural community for leadership and commitment. Farmers are facing grave financial penalties if they exceed quotas.  They are receiving tax bills by the score in what is regarded as the worst year ever.  They are being treated like criminals by the banks who in the late seventies offered money as if there would be no tomorrow.  Young would-be farmers are again taking the emigration ship in large numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC appreciate that the Irish Government are anti-farmer and weak and therefore are taking advantage making the Irish farmer pay the penalty for the offences of the bigger nations who import at will from outside the EC.  We in Fianna Fáil believe that agriculture here has come close to a point from which there will be no return.  It appears to us <Col N="1943" /> that we are the only political party who still recognise that agriculture is the basis of our economy, that half of the Irish work force, 500,000, are employed directly or indirectly in the industry.  If the foundations of that industry are shaken, so will the jobs of those 500,000 people.</P>
    <P>The big crisis in agriculture today is the low level of income which has reduced the purchasing power and the investment potential of Irish farmers.  This has a major impact on the economy as a whole. If farmers' purchasing power is reduced, all agri-related businesses throughout the country will be affected.  There are many examples of this: small building firms have gone to the wall, farm machinery sales firms, drainage machinery, tractors, etc, are going out of business.  The farm management survey of An Foras Talúntais shows that three out of every five farmers have incomes of less than £100.</P>
    <P>In 1985 when average industrial earnings were £9,000, the average farm income was £4,900.  The low level of income has come about because of an anti-farmer bias in the Cabinet, an attitude clearly displayed by the Minister for Labour in the Dáil recently in answers to questions by Deputy Browne and me.  He implied that all the difficulties in Ireland were related to the fact that farmers refused to pay rates.  We had the suggestion from the Minister for Agriculture that milk prices for farmers were a little too high.  For his information, Irish farmers get the lowest milk prices in the EC: last year we received 12 per cent less than the average paid to our European counterparts and 17 per cent less than Danish farmers.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that Irish farmers will respond to leadership.  Since 1973 the growth rate in Dutch agriculture was 50 per cent.  In the same period Ireland was second in the EC with a growth rate of 43 per cent, but today it is difficult to have the heart to invest or to produce. At every hand's turn the Government are killing off the incentive and the will to advance.  It was tragic to read recently of the trauma being suffered by farmers who <Col N="1944" /> had lost all or most of their cattle in the bad weather.  They were kicked out on the road by the lending institutions.  Many of those farmers now have suicidal tendencies. It is a sad day.</P>
    <P>The only answer coming from the Minister for Agriculture and the Cabinet is a deafening silence and callous carelessness. How many times must we repeat that the agricultural industry here is not only about farmers?  It concerns every citizen in the nation, and everything possible must be done to ensure that the flight from the land of young would-be farmers is halted immediately.  It is a well known fact that per head of the population more people from farming stock are emigrating than in any other sector.</P>
    <P>It was frightening to look at pictures in last week's issue of <i>The Farmers Journal</i> of cattle in houses for nine months, with zero grazing, with machinery bogged to the axles, destroying the land for years to come.  It is not surprising that young people do not want to stay on the land.</P>
    <P>The Government's answer is a mickey mouse scheme.  Last night the Minister for Agriculture suggested that there would not be a necessity to apply for planning permission for silos.  I do not know if he has taken over the role of the planning officer in other counties but he certainly has not in County Wexford, because I was on to the planning office there today and I was told that if I applied for permission to lay down silage slabs or a building of any kind I would have to wait for the same time as anyone else.</P>
    <P>It is real help the farmers need &mdash; genuine meaningful commitment.  Irish farmers now owe the banks and other lending institutions £1.7 billion and a further £0.3 billion to the co-ops.  The Government's answer is a renewed vigorous tax campaign among farmers who are barely subsisting.  An Irish farmer who borrowed £50,000 six years ago would now have paid £28,000 in interest.  His Dutch counterpart would have paid £16,000.  Real interest rates here are at 15 per cent, the highest ever, considering that inflation is between 3 per cent and 4 per cent.  There has been a loss of £150 million since January this year because <Col N="1945" /> of the effects of bad weather.  If you couple this with the £300 million the Government have withdrawn from agriculture in the past four years it makes very bad reading.</P>
    <P>Milk production this year is down by 30 per cent and, with poor prospects for the remainder of the year and no hope of recovering losses, it is possible that our milk quota will not be reached and we will suffer the consequences.  Such a situation could be averted by a solid plan of action, with cheap money made available.  The £100 million Euro loan is bound up in red tape.  Solution of our problem would cost £2 billion.  This effort by the Government is only a token gimmick and the farmers can see through it.  It is interesting to note that the Government are not taking any risk because they are charging an extra 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at this loan.  It comes at 4½ per cent interest to be paid to Europe, 2 per cent bank handling charge, 2 per cent Government risk and 0.75 per cent reserve asset costs.  If all that is totted up it comes to 9.25 per cent interest, and with the prospect of interest charges falling next week it makes the thing a complete laugh.</P>

      <P>I am saying it to the Minister tonight.  The failure of the Minister for Agriculture to get a reasonable package for our farmers this year spells disaster for cereal growers, for milk producers and beef farmers.  The pig industry is dying fast.  The horticultural industry is in a shambles with £13 million worth of tomatoes imported last year. The acreage of tomatoes dropped from 360 in 1982 to 224 in 1985.  It was the duty of the Minister for Agriculture to fight for our farmers, but he agreed to a package that even the German Minister voted against.  Deputy Deasy was working on instructions from his Government, the Government of farmer haters.  His vote was a disaster for Irish farmers.  Was the <Col N="1946" /> great reception the Anglo-Irish Agreement got in Europe part of the deal?</P>

Last year milk production was down by 7 per cent, not 30 per cent as stated by the previous speaker.  Quoting figures like that does untold harm to the way people think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the farmers who are in difficulties today borrowed money in the period 1977 to 1980.  However, because of the way the then Government were running the country their income decreased by 52 per cent.  They were the first band of farmers who were helped under the rescue package produced by this Government when they came to office.  It was proposed by them in 1981, was shelved by the Opposition in 1982 and was reintroduced by the Government in 1983 for the 2,000 farmers concerned.</P>
      <P>Because of the six weeks late growth this year and the vital importance of the next three months to deal with the fodder problem, it is essential that all the financial institutions should give money to farmers to help them get over the period.  It is not true to say that the problem exists only in the west of Ireland.  It affects farmers in other areas also; I am happy the Minister will reapply to have large areas, including north Meath, included in the severely disadvantaged areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak for small dairy farmers in my constituency.  I was present when the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, told them in Cavan that a good deal was achieved for them in Europe, <Col N="1948" /> that Europe had a problem of overproduction and that the West Germans, who paid much of the bill, were unwilling to continue to do so.  This defeatism did not impress farmers who had been encouraged to increase production and who have been beggared by fodder costs.</P>
      <P>During the week the Minister spoke to us <i>The Economist</i> indicated that butter sales to Russia would cost the EC $200 million.  Some 80,000 tonnes came from West Germany; 11,000 tonnes came from Britain and only 9,000 tonnes came from Ireland.  That was the context in which that Minister spoke to small farmers in County Cavan.  On 31 May <i>The Economist</i> reported that West Germany agreed to compensate their farmers for EC reductions in prices and the EC obliged by allowing West Germany to reclassify nearly half its farm acreage as poor areas eligible for higher levels of support.</P>
      <P>Farmers who had been encouraged by us to vote for entry to the EC on the strength of the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy have been betrayed. So, too, have the industries that died so that the CAP could live and so that a market of 320 million could be made available for German cars, Italian shoes and women's wear from France, Germany and Italy.  All these industries in this country died so that the CAP might live, but now the CAP is being killed by the incompetence of this Government.</P>

      <P>While our industries died, others grabbed the industrial bag and now we are being robbed so far as agriculture is concerned.  I put two points bluntly to the Minister.  We have no <i>crédit agricole</i> here.  We should make some financial provision for farmers who have mortgaged their monthly creamery cheques until the end of 1987 in order to buy fodder for their stock for this season.  The co-ops, though knowing the danger, have allowed them to mortgage their cheques for the future year.  Let the Government come to their aid: they will not fail the country.  My second point to the Minister is that the Government should have the <Col N="1949" /> guts to do what the Germans have done. They should see to it that all the 12 western counties are classified as severely disadvantaged areas.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> For the benefit of the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, we repeat that this Government have withdrawn the sum of £200 million from Irish agriculture since they came to office.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Neither the Minister nor his Ministers of State responded to the crisis in agriculture.  It was only when we put down this motion that the Minister visited the affected areas.  Last night the Minister gave us a detailed account of money paid under various schemes, but these were normal payments and have no bearing on the crisis facing the Irish farmer at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I opened the debate last night I stressed the main points &mdash; the crisis in agriculture and the need for Government action.  In support of his amendment the Minister gave an account of the weather conditions.  He gave a repeat account of the EC price agreements, and the now familiar dodging of the cave in on the 3 per cent reduction in the milk quota.  He gave an account of the imbalance in the <Col N="1950" /> milk sector.  He told us about the Euro loans and we got detailed figures of farm incomes, but he made one worth while suggestion.  He said the country might by co-operation, improve the fodder supplies this year, but nowhere did the Minister or his Ministers of State deal with the crisis in farming.  He repeated the list of actions the Government took since last summer at a cost of £22 million, but those actions were taken many months ago. That money is spent.  That money was to deal with the autumn 1985 crisis, not the spring crisis.  I got the strong impression that the Minister was unaware of the real nature of the crisis, or if he is aware of it, then his Government colleagues are holding him back and are not allowing him to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>Last evening I said what the Government should be doing.  I suggested that this Government should reintroduce the subsidy on fertilisers and limestone and the AI subsidy, they should increase the disadvantaged areas and the headage grants, and substantially increase the Euro loan scheme.  For these reasons, we should look for the help of the EC at once.  I want to stress the attitude I firmly believe the Government should have taken in their approach to the EC.  They should not approach the Community with the begging bowl in hand.  The facts are there for all to see.  A hard headed professionl body like the EC should have no difficulty in recognising a genuine crisis when it is presented to them.  The Community should recognise the crisis and their obligation to Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>The Government would only have to point to the aid given recently to German farmers to bring the Commission and the Council of Ministers to a realisation of their obligations towards this country. German farmers were granted huge sums of money from the EC to make up losses of income which they suffered last year. Looking at the treatment of German farmers and comparing that with what is happening to Irish farmers, we see an outstanding example of the real divisions between member states.  German farmers were given Community money and money from the rich German Exchequer <Col N="1951" /> to make up income losses.  Did German farmers face the same difficulties Irish farmers faced in the past 12 months?  Are there stories in German newspapers of cattle dying of starvation, of the German Army having to rush to the aid of those farmers with supplies of fodder, of starving animals having to graze this spring's meagre grass thereby leaving no grass for silage for the coming winter?  I will not elaborate on this further because of a lack of time but our Government could use the German case when putting our case. We should be able to put a case which would be immediately accepted and acted upon if only the Government were to take action.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies from different parts of the country gave detailed and impressive accounts of the state of farming in different areas.  Their accounts must have impressed the Minister.  I am sure Government Deputies have given him similar accounts of how they see the crisis in farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £9,242,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Energy, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for my Department is relatively small.  Even with the addition of the Supplementary Estimate which I am also moving to-day, it amounts to only a small fraction of one per cent of the total Estimates for the Public Service.  However, the relative importance of the role of my Department bears no relationship to its quite small demands on the public purse &mdash; demands which, I should say, are offset many times over by the contributions which, together with its agencies, it makes to the revenues of the State.</P>
      <P>I should like, therefore, first to comment briefly on the Estimate itself and then go on to outline, in more detail, the role which I see for my Department in the existing energy supply situation and its principal activities in fulfilling this role. Finally, I propose to comment on the circumstances which gave rise to the specific provision which is made in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1959" /> Deputies will note that the original Estimate for the year is just short of £9.25 million and shows an increase of £101,000 in net expenditure over the outturn for 1985.  An important factor in keeping the net increase so low is the estimated increase of £547,000 in the Appropriations-in-Aid, mainly because of increased receipts for hydrocarbon exploration licences.</P>
    <P>The current Estimate shows an increase of £428,000 in gross current expenditure, with increases in 12 subheads totalling £597,000 being offset by decreases in subheads totalling £169,000.  Apart from the increase of £151,000 in the provision for salaries and wages, subhead A1, the increases are fairly evenly divided among the current provisions.  The three capital services show an overall total increase of £220,000 with increases in subheads P &mdash; FEOGA, Western Aid Electrification, £421,000 and N &mdash; New and Renewable Sources of Energy, £71,000 being offset by a decrease of £272,000 in subhead M &mdash; Bord na Móna &mdash; Grants for Private Bog Development.</P>
    <P>I should like to address the question of energy policy.  When this House debated the Energy Estimates almost a year ago it took place in a reasonably stable international environment for energy, which had prevailed for some time.</P>
    <P>Energy policy, however, has to cope with the unexpected and maintain continuity over a long time frame.  This is because of the key role of energy in our economic and social lives and the large investments needed to supply and deliver energy as well as the long time span needed to bring about fundamental change in the structure of energy supply and consumption.</P>
    <P>The last 12 months have been dramatic in the energy markets.  The decline in crude oil prices and in the price of oil products since last December is of major significance to the economy.  Unlike the upsets in energy markets in 1973 and 1979, the immediate impact of these changes is likely to be beneficial to the economy.  It will be useful also to reconsider <Col N="1960" /> the thrust of energy objectives and energy policies in the light of the lower oil prices now prevailing.</P>
    <P>The most striking aspect of that fall in oil prices has been its magnitude.  Quotations for spot delivery of crude oil have been fluctuating between $10 and $15 per barrel, depending on the basis taken, and this represents a fall in dollar terms of the order of 60 per cent with respect to the beginning of 1986.  The price of netback crude, however, is somewhat higher, reflecting rather firmer prices for oil products than would be indicated by spot crude quotations.  The impact of lower crude prices has impacted differentially on different products.  The decreases have been greatest for heavy fuel oil which is available to bulk purchasers at less than half the price payable only six months ago.</P>
    <P>The fall in oil prices has been accentuated by the rise in the value of the Irish pound against the dollar.  As oil is traded internationally in dollars, this strengthening of the Irish currency against the dollar has compounded the price fall in Irish currency terms.  Indeed, it is noteworthy that there has been weakness in the dollar price of oil over the last few years.  The reduction in the value of the dollar alone would have reduced the cost of oil by about 25 per cent even if the price of oil remained unchanged.</P>
    <P>This reverses the position of previous years when most of the non-dollar currency countries, including Ireland, experienced increasing energy prices. While this fall in oil prices is mostly beneficial and is to be wholeheartedly welcomed, it has nevertheless within it the seeds of major problems in the long run which have to be recognised and provided for.</P>
    <P>Just as the repeated sharp increases in oil prices in the seventies had profound negative effects on world economies, there are now expectations that the current fall in price will stimulate an increase in economic growth, a reduction in inflation and in interest rates and possibly a period of more stable exchange rates, all of which could lead to a recovery of <Col N="1961" /> international trade and a containment of the growth of unemployment.</P>
    <P>A recent OECD report estimates that growth will improve by 1 per cent in 1987 as a result of the price fall and this, together with lower inflation, provides Governments with an opportunity to tackle the persistent growth in unemployment as the major macro-economic problem of our time.</P>
    <P>A key question relates to how long the oil price will remain low.  Opinions vary substantially on this matter.  Those who believe that oil prices will rise to the $18 &mdash; $20 region by autumn or year end point to the fall in production in the non-OPEC zone.  They also point to a growth of demand, particularly in gasoline consumption in the US as the summer approaches, and they also appeal to seasonal rebuilding of stocks increasing the demand for OPEC oil.  These factors, it is argued, could lead to progressive firming of prices.</P>
    <P>There is however another school of thought.  These experts believe that oil prices have been at an artifically high level over the last ten years.  They believe that the precarious cartel that is OPEC has been broken apart by the inexorable economic laws, and that prices of the order of ten to 15 dollars in real terms will be with us to the end of the century.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to arbitrate between these two views.  A clear lesson of developments in oil and currency markets is how volatile and unpredictable they are. This underlines the logic that informed the energy policies and strategies that have been pursued by the Government over the past three years.  Those strategies have designed an energy supply system that is robust in relation to changes in the supply and availability of a particular form of imported energy &mdash; oil.  It has developed the supply system for gas, electricity, coal and turf with a view to increasing the options for consumers and introducing more competition into energy markets.  This system also enables substantial switching to be made from one fuel to another as temporary shortages and supply crises take place <Col N="1962" /> and, on the other hand, enables advantage to be taken of over-supply situations and attractive prices in particular fuel markets, without having an excessive dependence on any particular fuel as was the case with oil in the past.</P>
    <P>Since the energy crises of 1979-80 our dependence on oil has been reduced from over 70 per cent to under 50 per cent, domestic energy production has more than doubled &mdash; from under 20 per cent to over 40 per cent and the efficiency with which we use energy has improved by 17 per cent &mdash; that is, we consume less energy now than in 1979 to produce a gross domestic product that has increased by 14 per cent over the years.</P>
    <P>This change has been brought about by a sustained capital investment and diversification and conservation programmes. Now that oil prices have fallen to well below the levels ruling in 1979 the question must be addressed as to whether this considerable effort was needed and is still worthwhile.  The same question is at present being studied in most other countries and in the EC and the International Energy Agency.  Undoubtedly, the drop in prices will, in the short term, reduce the return on investments in energy saving and diversification but this could be expected to be offset by the benefits of lower overall costs and increased economic activity.</P>
    <P>The energy market developments have proved a very significant factor in encouraging economic activity in neighbouring developed countries, and in Ireland. When the oil price falls there is major benefit to oil importing countries such as our own and those of our major trading partners.  There is a major loss to net oil exporters.  It was recently estimated by the OECD that a $15 per barrel price decline would benefit net oil importers, something of the order of £100 billion. In Ireland depending on the length and duration of the price decline, and the speed at which it trickles through to the economy, a benefit of £300 million to £400 million might be anticipated.</P>
    <P>These benefits will accrue in a variety of ways but, in particular, through a lower inflation rate and thus a higher value of <Col N="1963" /> real disposable income in the hands of consumers.  The rate of inflation may be reduced by 1 per cent and 2 per cent below what it would otherwise have been in Ireland due to the fall in oil prices.  There will, of course, be a substantial reduction in the cost of oil imports.  This may be counterbalanced by a tendency to buy more heavy fuel oil given its attractive price in bulk use at this time.  Lower oil prices will, of course, have a negative impact on indigenous energy producers such as Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis Éireann.  If these bodies are to compete in the market place their profits will, of necessity, be reduced.</P>
    <P>What are the implications of all this on energy policy objectives and strategy?  In the final analysis energy policy has two key objectives&mdash;first, ensuring availability of supplies of fuel and, second, securing those supplies at the minimum cost consistent with security of supply considerations. All the other policy objectives are really derived from these.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years this Government have consistently pursued policies which make us well placed not only to take advantage of the current position in energy markets, but also to adjust more smoothly to any reversal of existing favourable trends in the energy markets. There have been major investments in the energy supply system.  Large sums have been invested in diversifying and expending the electricity generating network.</P>
    <P>The first stage of Moneypoint coal fired generating station has been commissioned and the second and third stages are reaching the final phase of construction. Bord na Móna's third development programme has been almost completed and further money has been made available to the private bog development grant scheme, the natural gas network has been expanded, new and renewable energy programmes have been pursued and energy conservation programmes have been continued.  These policies will continue to be pursued.</P>
    <P>The major long term concerns in the present situation of low energy prices are <Col N="1964" /> that the effort at energy saving and diversification by consumers and industry would taper off and that exploration and development by oil companies, which has been cut back sharply, would result in fewer discoveries in the higher cost prospects in non-OPEC countries.</P>
    <P>As regards oil price levels, it is appropriate that I make mention of the performance of the Whitegate oil refinery. The continued operation of the refinery is periodically the subject of public criticism, sometimes of a rather selective kind.  It will interest Deputies, therefore, to know that for all but four months of 1985 the prices of ex-Whitegate products were below those of imported petroleum products and that, taking 1985 as a whole and making allowance for the cost of stockholding at Whitegate &mdash; stocks which would in any event have to be held and paid for in this country regardless of whether we operate Whitegate or not &mdash; the operation of the refinery made a small but significant positive contribution to the economy.  In other words it saved rather than cost us money in 1985.  More recently savings to INPC in crude oil purchases have been passed on to the consumer and have contributed very significantly to the recent sizeable reductions in the consumer prices of both petrol and gas oil.</P>
    <P>I would now like to review the proposals for oil and gas exploration.  I am sure the House will agree with me that 1985 proved to be an important year in the area of hydrocarbon exploration.  While actual drilling activity was maintained as in earlier years, the results from two of the 1985 wells were very encouraging. Early in the year, BP drilled a well on Block 48/18 in the Celtic Sea which, on test, flowed gas at a rate of 13.2 million cubic feet of gas per day.  Later in the year, Gulf drilled on Block 50/6, also in the Celtic Sea, and testing operations on that well in January of this year produced oil flows of 2,074 barrels of oil per day and gas flows of 1.3 million cubic feet per day.</P>
    <P>Technical data arising from both of these discoveries are being examined by my Department, in consultation with the <Col N="1965" /> companies involved, in order to establish what further work is required in relation to those discoveries.  It is of interest in relation to 1985 that the Britoil well in Block 35/19 in the Porcupine Basin was the deepest well ever drilled in the Irish offshore.  Unfortunately, it was dry as were other wells drilled by Arco and ESSO in the Celtic Sea basin.</P>
    <P>I believe that 1986 will also make an important contribution to our on-going exploration programme.  We expect that up to ten wells will be drilled this year &mdash; more than has been the case for a considerable number of years.  Already, Hydrocarbons Ireland have completed a well off the coast of Wexford; at present, Charterhouse are drilling in the Kish Bank basin offshore Dublin, while Marathon are working on the first of a number of wells to be drilled in their leased acreage in the Celtic Sea this year.  Other companies are also in the final stages of preparation for drilling operations during the year.  This continuing interest in the hydrocarbon potential in our offshore is extremely encouraging.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, wells drilled in the present oil price climate reflect obligations already entered into by the various oil companies, obligations which must be honoured by them, even though some might wish to defer some of their commitments. However, the companies concerned have the offsetting benefit this year of steeply reduced drilling costs &mdash; brought about by the fall-off in exploration world wide &mdash; and they know that now is an appropriate time to explore, as commercial discoveries this year or next would be coming on stream at a time in which significant rises in price might reasonably be expected.</P>
    <P>The recent dramatic fall in oil prices creates difficulties for exploration.  In simple terms it means that cash flows in 1986 are less than half of what had earlier been calculated, and a number of oil companies have in consequence announced significant budget cuts.  The industry can be expected to become even more selective than hitherto in taking on exploration commitments but an area such as the Celtic Sea &mdash; where deposits have been <Col N="1966" /> proven to exist and the environment is less harsh than in other areas &mdash; should retain its attraction.  Any discoveries made there can be produced by using conventional and low-cost technology. Furthermore, the fall in drilling costs to which I have referred above has manifested itself quite dramatically in areas such as the Celtic Sea; wells can now be completed at less than 50 per cent of what they would have cost a year ago.  The existing work commitments offshore Ireland, including those arising out of the Third Licensing Round ought to ensure a resonable level of exploration activity offshore Ireland during the next few years.</P>
    <P>However, we must now start to look beyond work arising out of existing commitments and if a prolonged period of low oil prices has a continuing adverse effect on the willingness of oil companies to explore I believe that it is in the Irish interest and in the interest of the oil companies and the western world in general, that exploration should continue throughout this period of lower prices.</P>
    <P>The prospect of increased long term reliance on OPEC supplies is a problem that all oil consuming countries must view with some considerable apprehension. While a continuing high oil price is of course the best incentive to exploration, other ways must be found to keep up the momentum so that discoveries will be in place to ensure continuity of supplies and avoid an excessive and possibly damaging rebound of prices in the future when existing producing fields begin to reach exhaustion.</P>
    <P>In April last year I introduced changes to indicate how reliefs for marginal discoveries would operate.  In the light of the effect of current prices on exploration activity, I am considering what further steps can be taken in present circumstances to encourage exploration in the years ahead without unnecessary impairment of the overall national interest.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna had a bad year in 1985 due to the very wet weather.  They lost production valued at about £50 million and had to ration supplies of briquettes <Col N="1967" /> and sod peat during the winter.  Fortunately, their high stocks policy for milled peat enabled them to maintain supplies to the ESB and to manufacture record quantities of briquettes.  The shortage of briquettes in winter was due mainly to increased demand in the cold wet summer of 1985.</P>
    <P>The board managed to avoid laying-off permanent workers but in doing so had to make a major &ldquo;act of faith&rdquo; that the workers would in turn help them to offset the financial consequences of 1985 during 1986 and subsequent years, given suitable weather.</P>
    <P>The capital estimate for Bord na Móna for 1986 is £9 million.  This is for continuation of the third development programme, which is coming towards its end.  I should tell the House that the ESB and Bord na Móna have recently agreed a contract covering prices and quantities of peat supplies for the next three years. This kind of stable relationship is good for both organisations.</P>
    <P>The provision at subhead M is for £1.2 million for the private bog development grant scheme under the Turf Development Act, 1981.  Up to the end of 1985 a total of £5 million has been approved or spent in this scheme affecting 850 development schemes which are estimated to have produced 2 million tonnes of peat. The scheme was reviewed in detail recently and the results achieved were clearly satisfactory.  Employment has been generated in disadvantaged areas and a small industry supplying turf extraction machinery has been established.  The additional output created by the scheme has displaced substantial quantities of imported fuel.  Consequently, it has been decided to continue the scheme in its present form until 1987.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board's non-voted capital expenditure for 1986 will be of the order of £160 million.  This represents a decrease of 25 per cent on the 1985 outturn of £213.6 million and reflects the continuing trend of reduced capital expenditure by the board as the Moneypoint generating station nears completion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1968" /> Because of favourable trends in oil prices and interest and exchange rates and because of the savings accruing from increased coal fired generation it was possible to grant reductions in electricity prices of 6.2 per cent on average to industrial consumers and 3.9 per cent on average to commercial consumers from 1 April 1986.  The domestic consumer also benefited from these favourable trends with a 5 per cent reduction in electricity bills for all domestic consumers from 1 September 1986.  The domestic night rate was reduced by 13 per cent from 1 April 1986.  I will, as I have previously indicated, keep the situation under review and can assure the House that any opportunities which may arise for further reductions will be availed of.</P>
    <P>The provisions for expenditure on generating capacity in 1986 will be £81 million. The major portion of this expenditure will be on completion of the Moneypoint generating station in County Clare.  Approximately £75 million will be spent at this location.  The balance of £6 million relates to residual expenditure on the completion of the board's new national control centre.  Spending on premises and general equipment is down to £3 million in 1986 from £4.8 million last year and relates mainly to the purchase of computer and other related equipment.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by the ESB on transmission and distribution projects will amount to £76 million in 1986.  This includes £6 million for the completion of the 400 KV lines from Moneypoint and £14 million for the maintenance and extension of the existing transmission system.  Expenditure on distribution projects will account for the remaining £56 million in 1986. This expenditure is required to maintain an acceptable level of service to existing customers and to strengthen the electricity distribution network for the connection of new consumers.</P>
    <P>The sum provided in the Vote this year for the western package electrification scheme is £1.43 million.  The aim of this scheme is to improve over a ten-year period the viability and competitiveness of farms in the western region through <Col N="1969" /> the extension and improvement of electricity supplies.</P>
    <P>Eligibility is in accordance with EC Regulation 1820/80.  Those who qualify for aid must be principally dependent on agriculture for their income.  The State and the EC each contribute 40 per cent of the cost of connection, the remaining 20 per cent being borne by the beneficiaries. To date, 3,046 applications have been approved under the scheme at a total cost of £6,844,485 and it is anticipated that a further 693 farms will benefit under the scheme in 1986.  I have recently carried out a review of the scheme and I have put forward for approval by the Commission certain proposals which are aimed at improving and extending it.</P>
    <P>These proposals included the extension of the number of new connections, as the maximum number of such connections had been reached.  As a result of my direct intervention with the EC Commission, they have now agreed to this proposal in advance of their consideration of the complete review of the scheme.</P>
    <P>So far as gas is concerned the major events were those relating to the Dublin Gas utility and the maintenance of supplies to its many thousands of customers. I have already explained in reply to various debates and questions in this House, the reasons which led to the decisions taken by the Government in this matter.  I am quite satisfied that I and the Government have properly discharged our responsibilities to all the parties concerned, including the general public.  In view of formal threats of legal proceedings which have been received I am somewhat constrained in making further comment in justification of the actions which we felt obliged to take, but I hope that this freedom will not be denied to me for too long.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know the remit of the receiver is to place the company on a viable economic footing in anticipation of nationalisation and, until his full report has been received I am unable to give a firm indication as to the future sequence of events.  As I indicated in reply to a Private Notice Question recently, it is <Col N="1970" /> the intention to ensure payment to all creditors where the claims, whether in respect of work or services carried out are valid.  Other measures have also been taken to stabilise the situation and I hope to be able to keep the House informed of significant developments as they unfold.</P>
    <P>Moving on now to the position regarding the other existing town gas utilities, I am pleased to state that preparatory work on the gas pipelines to Limerick and Waterford is commencing this month. The work will be completed by late autumn and the pipelines will be fully operational by year-end.</P>
    <P>A decision in principle to supply natural gas to Clonmel was taken in July 1984.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That was just a pre-election stunt.  However, some difficulties arose in discussions between BGE and Clonmel Corporation in agreeing certain details of the project and these, together with the recent developments on the world oil market, necessitated a further examination of the project.  I would expect, however, that these problems can be ironed out quickly.</P>
      <P>The extension of the natural gas network to Kilkenny has been approved formally by the Government.  Appropriate arrangements will be concluded by BGE for the early supply of natural gas. In 1985, BGE, at the direction of Government, acquired the shares of Cork Gas Company which is now a fully-owned subsidiary of BGE.  A major overhaul and re-vamp of the Cork Gas Company has commenced and will be completed this year, the intention being to protect that company's customers and to bring about a turnaround from pervious years' loss making performances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the EC's decision to provide assistance for a gas development programme in the north-east and Border counties, an analysis of gas supply projects in that area is currently under way. As I have already pointed out, further extension of the network will be dependent on economic viabiity, having regard <Col N="1971" /> to the large amounts of capital required to construct the pipelines, to the available markets, the limited life-span of existing resources and the alternative options available to us.</P>
    <P>During 1985, Bord Gais Éireann delivered approximately 85,000 million standard cubic feet of natural gas to their customers.  This represents the equivalent of 2 million tonnes of oil and reflects a saving of over £300 million on our annual oil import bill.  On top of this, BGE surrendered £80 million of their profits for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my 1985 Estimates speech, those who advocate &ldquo;give-away&rdquo; policies by BGE pay less than due respect to the considerations which ought to apply in the management of this important, and limited, resource.  Government policy is based on the sound principle of maximising the returns to the people as a whole and we cannot be deflected from that policy in present circumstances as any further supplies of natural gas, after the depletion of the Kinsale Head field, be they indigenous or imported, may well be dearer but are very unlikely to be cheaper.</P>
    <P>There is an increase in the energy conservation allocation for 1986, £42,000, in comparison with the 1985 outturn. Although achievements made by an energy conservation programme in improving energy efficiency are not easily quantifiable, there can be no doubt that it has helped to stimulate public awareness in this whole area and has caused the adoption of energy efficiency improvements that would not otherwise have been made.  Therefore, the money spent on the energy conservation programme is worthwhile and is more than paid back in terms of the benefits to the economy as well as to energy users.</P>
    <P>Energy conservation has a number of benefits.  It improves the energy supply position by reducing the quantity of energy required to do a particular task; also, energy efficiency is a cost saving for the energy user.  On a national basis, energy savings reduce dependence on <Col N="1972" /> imported fuels and benefit the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>The energy conservation programme is designed to create continuing awareness of the benefits of prudent energy management.  The programme consists of a range of advisory and information services for industry and for the public, audit services for industry and for the public sector, and grants for detailed audits and feasibility studies by consultants.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the allocation of £151,000 for new and renewable energy sources which will be used to continue the Government's policy of assessing and where appropriate, encouraging the development of our indigenous renewable energy resources as an alternative to imported fuels.</P>
    <P>The two main areas for concentration are wind and hydro power.  In 1984 the Department entered into a windpower demonstration contract with the EC under which the EC agreed to contribute £158,000 over a two and a half year period. This money is being used to contribute to the costs of monitoring and maintaining five of the Department's windmills and of making any modifications which are considered necessary.  Because of a number of problems encountered with both the windmills and the monitoring equipment, the programme has been delayed and the results will not now be known until at least 1987.</P>
    <P>In late 1981, the Department held a national small scale hydro demonstration competition.  In all, over 80 entries were received and grants totalling £98,800 were made to 13 of the entrants.  The performance of three of the installations grant-aided is being monitored and it is hoped to have the results of this monitoring programme by June or July this year.</P>
    <P>In October last the Department published a report on the potential of hydro power in Ireland.  This survey, which took three years to complete, identified over 3,500 sites which are suitable for development, and information on 568 sites with a potential of 10KW or greater is included in the report.</P>
    <P>To highlight the report's findings it was <Col N="1973" /> announced that the Department would be drawing up a new demonstration scheme.  It is planned to announce final details later this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to other new and renewable sources of energy, in particular solar, biomass, geothermal and wave, the Department from time to time give grant assistance to projects undertaken in these areas by private individuals, universities, semi-State bodies etc.  It is hoped that by doing this a certain level of expertise can be maintained in this country.  It is also the Department's policy to assist where possible, attendance at various conferences both at home and abroad, dealing with all relevant areas of new and renewable sources of energy.</P>
    <P>In relation to mining, people are well aware of the events that have taken place. I have to report that Tara Exploration and Development Company Limited, which has a 75 per cent share in Tara Mines Limited, has been acquired by the Finnish company, Outokumpu Oy.  The State will retain its 25 per cent shareholding in Tara Mines.  I anticipate improved co-operation with the new shareholders in the development of the ore body. Regretfully, the completion of the agreed arrangements for the takeover of Bula Limited by Tara Mines Limited did not come to a satisfactory conclusion.  The circumstances surrounding this failure were a matter of grave concern to the Government.</P>
    <P>The House will be well aware of the steps taken by the Government in relation to the nuclear industry, in particular in relation to our concern with regard to Sellafield and events which took place in the wake of the Chernobyl accident.  At a meeting on 6 June 1986 between the Attorney General's office and the EC Commission's legal service the Commission agreed that they have competence under the Euratom Treaty to take the initiative to set up an inspection force.  We are now awaiting Commission initiatives.  The Government will be pressing to ensure that these initiatives will be prompt and effective despite the lack of belief by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Reynolds will agree <Col N="1974" /> to allow me 30 seconds in relation to the Supplementary Estimate.  Deputies will be aware that on 5 December 1985 I informed the House that the Government had decided to conclude an agreement with Chevron under which the Whiddy Oil Terminal will come into State ownership, with Chevron paying $44 million to the State in consideration of the release of its obligations to rebuild the damaged jetty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Next Tuesday, cash on the nail.  That agreement has now been signed and transfer of the relevant assets to the State is imminent.  The terminal at Whiddy Island will be handed over to the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, as the State's agent, who will be responsible for care and maintenance of the facility. It is necessary to put the corporation in funds for this purpose since the care and maintenance of the Whiddy facility cannot be funded from the corporation's only current source of revenue, the sale of petroleum products from the Whitegate Refinery at cost recovery prices. Consequently, I propose to move a Supplementary Estimate for £450,000 so that payment can be made to the INPC to cover their care and maintenance remit at Whiddy during 1986.  Such payment will cover not only normal care and maintenance operations throughout the remainder of the year but also certain once-off works necessary to make safe the facility subsequent on removal of the remaining quantity of crude oil from the tanks.</P>
      <P>I trust this brief outline of the main areas of activity of my Department has adequately illustrated the importance of the functions involved despite the relative smallness of the Vote which is well under £10 million.</P>
      <P>I recommend this Estimate to the House, as well as the Supplementary Estimate which I propose to put to the House following on their agreement to the main Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to indicate to the Minister and the House that I accept the Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate for £450,000 so that he can put the Whiddy Oil Terminal under care and maintenance.  I do not propose to go into the details of the Whiddy Oil Terminal because other Deputies on both sides of the House want to contribute.</P>
      <P>I must compliment the Minister on the fine face he has put on the operation of his Department for the last year.  Indeed, it is no different from what he endeavoured to do last year.  When one examines at close quarters the way in which various issues have been handled by the Minister and his Department, one could not accept his presentation here this evening. It is an unacceptable way of conducting our business that we have to rush an Estimate through in very short time.  That is the way the Government order their business.  I know you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle can do nothing about it; neither can I and I am not so sure that the Minister can.  I am beginning to wonder if he has half the input into the Government he would like people to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's handling of Dublin Gas was atrocious and inept.  I deplore the lack of information given to this House. When I asked the Minister if he had given guarantees or comfort to the banks to renew the funding of Dublin Gas &mdash; and the Minister will remember what he said &mdash; within a matter of days he had an instrument laid before the House and in the Dáil Library to the effect that the bankers to Dublin Gas were to be guaranteed approximately £27 million.  It is regrettable that that sort of information should be withheld from the House.  It was clear to me that the banks would not renew funding in relation to Dublin Gas if they did not receive such guarantee. The Minister gave less than honest answers to me in the House last week, which surprised me because normally he is forthcoming with whatever information is available to him.  I put it to the Minister that his handling was not in the <Col N="1976" /> best interests of everybody, that he did not carry out his statutory responsibilities under the agreement drawn up.</P>
    <P>There was application made to the Minister under a hardship clause in which he became the final arbitrator in any dispute between Dublin Gas and Bord Gáis in regard to price whenever that issue arose.  The Minister failed to honour his responsibilities under the agreement and took no action despite the fact that, under its terms, he should have acted within a month.  The Minister allowed the matter to ride for another month and then sent it back.  I cannot accept that the difficulties of Dublin Gas, known from August 1985, were not acted upon till such time as the Revenue Commissioners came in looking for their money.  The matter was sparked off by that incident, the Revenue Commissioners having been kept quiet for a short period.  I shall be surprised if we do not see serious legal implications arising from the way in which this matter has been handled &mdash; I hope not &mdash; but I shall be surprised if there are not some.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the role of the receiver in Dublin Gas.  The receiver was put in by Bord Gáis to protect theirs and the taxpayer's money.  We had the earlier decision of nationalisation which turned out not to be nationalisation for some two weeks.  It finally became nationalisation after many Cabinet meetings and many arguments among Ministers over it.  This is more of the misrepresentation of fact to which I have referred.  What is the role of the receiver in Dublin Gas?  Perhaps the Minister, in summing up this evening, will let me know.  A receiver is appointed to do a job, to collect the money for the people who appointed him under their debenture.  Then we had the Minister and the Government saying: everybody will be paid.  If everybody is to be paid I might ask: what is the role of the receiver?  Is he there as a chief executive, seeing that the chief executive resigned, or what is his role since all creditors will be paid?  It is a very expensive way of replacing a chief executive if that is his only role and I cannot see any other for him.</P>
    <P>If we are to make preparations for <Col N="1977" /> nationalisation, if that is the genuine intent of the Government &mdash; I accept in good faith what the Minister has said here on numerous occasions &mdash; then I might suggest that the appointment of an administrator would be more appropriate. The Minister knows he would have no problem in introducing a short Bill in the House, in the same way as he did in relation to the PMPA Insurance Company, the ICI, appointing an administrator to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>After three and a half years I am delighted to hear the Minister say that preparatory work has commenced on the gas spur lines to Limerick and Waterford. I will remind him that in October 1982 a decision in principle was taken to do just that.  Yet three and a half years later we are finally getting down to starting the job.  One might well ask: why three and a half years later?  This Department could have made a significant contribution to the alleviation of our economic problems over the last couple of years which were in the way of getting things started or done in order to reduce unemployment numbers.  But because of some ideological paralysis which has afflicted this Government since the resignation of Deputy Cluskey, there has been no movement, or any there has been, has been at a snail's pace.  Many important decisions in the energy area have not been taken, have been side-stepped or whatever.</P>
    <P>That protracted decision in relation to the extension of the gas spur lines is one I shall never understand.  If the Government were short of momey they could have formed a joint venture with private enterprise.  A year and a half ago I told the Minister that he was pursuing a programme of nationalisation of the gas industry.  I remember his response clearly. It was: would I credit him with that visionary intelligence?  Since that time Cork Gas Company has been nationalised. A private sector consortium was involved with Limerick Gas.  They were pushed out of the way and Limerick Gas was nationalised.  The crucial problems in Dublin Gas were known to the Government last August and their failure <Col N="1978" /> to take action on them indicates that they wanted to nationalise Dublin Gas from day one.  They have succeeded with the first step, but I hope they are not in Government long enough to see it through to the final stage.  I am not convinced that nationalisation is the best way for the people to benefit from our natural resources.  A marriage between private sector management and State ownership is a better proposition.</P>
    <P>As regards the appointment of a receiver, it was a funny appointment because I would not credit the people who were appointed with the necessary expertise to handle such a major job.  However, the Minister makes his own appointments. That is his business.  I wait to see if they are a replacement for the chief executive or what.</P>
    <P>The takeover of Tara has been completed by Outokumpu Oy.  I welcome them into Ireland.  They are a very good company.  Our State companies have a lot to learn from the way in which such companies are managed in Finland.  I am amazed that the Minister did not mention the position in relation to Bula.  Will they be taken over by Outokumpu Oy?  Have any meetings been held with them in relation to the takeover?  When will something be done about it?  Is the receiver expected to do an impossible job? He is expected to sell the assets at Bula without having a State mining lease in his possession.  The receiver should be in a position to offer anyone contemplating buying the mine a complete package.  If the receiver is not in such a position it could deter people from becoming interested in it.</P>
    <P>As regards Ballingarry Mines, the replies which I received from the Minister to questions I asked about it clearly indicate that he is not concerned about disputes which might arise in relation to the lease, and so on.  The Minister was in a position to issue a new licence to Ballingarry Mines.  I should like the Minister to confirm that because a deputation I met last week had a different idea of it.  Does the Minister have to wait for an end to the legal actions which have been taken in Canada?  Has the Minister's approval <Col N="1979" /> been sought or is it mandatory to seek it before any lodgment of a mortgage deed is raised against a State mining lease?  If his approval was not sought, is it valid at this stage?  Can the position in Ballingarry be sorted out now?  Can we have a new State mining lease?  What are the problems involved?  The workers want to see the mine opened.  They are entitled to every assistance from the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I did not hear any reference made to interesting finds in the Leinster coalfield. As regards oil and gas exploration, I am delighted that wells are being drilled.  The vast majority of these arose out of the second licensing round and not the third one.  The third licensing round has been a disaster.  Not one new company has come in under this round.  This licensing round was advertised last year before anyone knew that the price of oil would fall.  The closing date was extended for six months and even at the end of that time there was no new company offering. Surely that is a clear sign that the licensing round failed.  Why was that?  It is easy to talk when price levels are low and it is easy to make up excuses for having a low level next year.  Not long ago the Minister said that two or three wells would be the order of the day for the next year.  That does not surprise me.  Why did Chevron pull out?</P>
    <P>We have pursued a policy which was drawn up in 1975.  It may well have been right at that time but it is not right today. The Government should not hold on to the sacred cow of taking up to 50 per cent of any reserves which are worth developing. Such a stipulation does not attract people and was a contributing factor of Gulf Chevron pulling out of here.  As I have said before, 50 per cent of nothing is still nothing even after 11 years.  If ever there was a time when the economy needed a shot in the arm it is now.  I am not in a position to say what the facts are in relation to oil and gas finds off our coast, but I am in a position to say that it is bloody well time that we found out how much is there.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister before if he had <Col N="1980" /> examined the possibility of early production systems in the Celtic Sea.  I pointed out to him that there were a lot of new technological developments in recent years.  I am aware that early production systems created certain problems and caused damage to the reserves in some areas in the North Sea, but surely this is an opportunity to try out the new technology and find out the amount of oil that exists.  I am aware of a turnkey operation system which, for a capital investment of $55,000 per day, can extract 20,000 to 30,000 barrels daily.  That represents an extraction cost of between $2½ to $3 per barrel, the cheapest that can be obtained anywhere.  I do not know if Saudi Arabia can extract oil at a cheaper rate than that. It is worth investigating that system.  The country needs a shot in the arm.  It is time the Minister realised that the individual who is casting Indian signs on our oil and gas exploration terms should not be allowed to halt the onward march of the nation at a time when we need a contribution to get us out of our difficult economic state and reduce our unemployment. What is the Minister's view on this?</P>
    <P>The terms set are for two blocks and they do not have to be passed on to the next two blocks.  The oil industry are well aware that the terms, and taxation, are a movable feast.  They have been moved in the North Sea and elsewhere and the oil industry expect them to be moved here. However, we must prove that we have oil in commercial quantities.  If we have it we can be stronger in our approach, but at the moment we are in a weak position.  Ireland is losing badly as a result.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, gas has been found by BP but I am not aware of the extent of the discovery.  Will any company in its right mind explore for gas here when we have failed to develop the market in the past three and a half years.  It is three and a half years since the pipeline arrived in Dublin but we are still involved in the preparatory work to give a spur line to Limerick and Waterford.  I note that there are still problems in Clonmel but I am delighted that the gas is to be piped to Kilkenny.  Will the Minister explain <Col N="1981" /> his decision to extend the gas supply to Kilkenny?  Time and again when I suggested that extension I was told that it could not be done.  When the Chief Executive of Bord Gáis appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies he said he had analysed Kilkenny and although Smithwick's Brewery was available then he said it was not economic to extend the pipeline to that city.  Smithwick's have gone but for some unknown or magical reason it is now economic to extend the pipeline to Kilkenny.  I cannot understand that.  I have been accused of doing assessments on the backs of match boxes but at least if I carry out an assessment I will know if I am right or wrong; I do not come up with a different result each time. The move may have been political to save Deputy Pattison's seat.  I hope Dundalk gets the same treatment later.</P>
    <P>The Government bungled the North of Ireland decision by leaving it hanging around for too long.  I am not blaming the Minister for that because the present Minister for Finance was responsible. That Minister could do with the money that would be accruing from that now had he pursued that scheme.  However, he messed it around for so long that it was thrown out.  Will the Minister say if the Government are prepared to put the North-South link on top of the priority list for funding under the US aid package we are expecting?  It is the most suitable project for that aid and is one that would give practical demonstration of North-South economic co-operation.  That deal failed because of economic circumstances but if the Yanks want to put money into a scheme to make it viable I cannot think of a better project.  Will the Minister give a commitment that if such aid arrives &mdash; it appears that the extradition problem is tied into it in the US &mdash; that project will be put on top of the list?</P>
    <P>I am sure Members from the Dundalk region will make their own case for an extension of the pipeline to Dundalk.  I cannot understand the delay in taking up the 23 million ECUs in accordance with the regulation made in late 1985.  If that <Col N="1982" /> money is left there long enough somebody else will take it.</P>
    <P>I will not spend much time on Sellafield or the Nuclear Energy Board.  I accept in good faith what the Minister has said, that the inspectorate to inspect the safety regulations and the monitoring of Sellafield will be put in place.  I have my reservations about that but I am prepared to accept what the Minister has said.</P>
    <P>The advice I have been given with regard to this is that under the Euratom Treaty a committee can be set up but it is only empowered to carry out an audit on what happens to all raw material.  It does not have any power to insist on safety regulations being put into place.  If the Minister says that can be done I will accept it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Nuclear Energy Board I should like to state that I do not think they are competent to advise on the health aspects of radioactive fallout.  We will have to appoint experts to advise on health.  I am glad the Minister is providing money and staff for the board and that we will be in a better position to monitor another disaster, if it occurs.  It is unfortunate that the record of Sellafield, and other nuclear stations only 60 miles from here, is such that we cannot sleep well at night.  The Minister should bear in mind the grave concern that is gaining momentum here in regard to health and the environment.</P>
    <P>Development of a market for gas is needed if we are to encourage more gas exploration off our coast.  It was encouraging to hear of the reserves found initially in the BP well off the south coast but until our market is developed we cannot expect people to be interested in exploring for more gas.  The Government should make a decision that if we have an abundance of gas we will export some of it.  I accept that it is not a great proposition but if I was involved in exploration I would have to know where I was going to sell a product before I would spend a fortune trying to find it.  There is no market at present and if it had been accelerated as I had intended, the position would be different today.  If we can get the North of Ireland gas deal back into <Col N="1983" /> place it will be one way of expanding the market.  However, we will need that scheme when the downturn in relation to gas supplies to Moneypoint takes place.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister confirm that there is no question of proceeding with stage 4 of the Moneypoint plan.  Some ESB officials are saying that a certain amount of work on stage 4 will take place and I should like to know if the Government have decided to proceed with that stage.  Is the Minister aware of a serious problem that has developed in relation to pumps at Moneypoint, whether they were put on the Shannon estuary bed or on the sea bed?  I understand that £1 million was spent on that project but the pipes are corroded and £1 million has gone dow the Swanee.</P>

      <P>It may be the Atlantic but the Minister is in a position to find out.  I wonder if the Minister is aware that some people down there do not have much regard for the way work is proceeding.</P>
      <P>I should like to turn to the old chestnut of the contribution the drastic change in oil prices could make to our economy.  I welcome any reduction in energy costs but with the benefits that are flowing into the ESB as a result of the fall in oil prices and the value of the dollar, it is clear that the board are doing well.  The Minister may argue that the board have a large debt and that is the way to bring it down.</P>
      <P>The penalties being put on the economy of the country by the Government's energy policy are unbearable. In the next three to six months there will be evidence of how tight and competitive Irish industry will have to be.  Many indigenous industries are suffering severely as a result of the exchange rates <i>vis-à-vis</i> the púnt, sterling and the German Mark.  I am very familiar with it and its effects on many sectors of Irish industry.  It is no wonder that Irish industrialists are looking for any slight benefits they can get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1984" /> With the benefits flowing into Government coffers, the money they are saving in servicing the national debt because of exchange rates and the dollar depreciation and the benefits from the crash in oil prices should suggest to the Government that they should look at the imposition of a £16 a tonne tax on ESB hydrocarbons. In private industry the tax is only 50 per cent of that and the time has come to reduce the ESB rate by half and put them on level pegging.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the £25 million rates levy on the ESB.  I was the Minister who introduced that at £10 million.  Now it has gone to £25 million. I believe the ESB should pay rates: they are a public utility like Dublin Gas and others and they should make their contribution. I may be proved wrong, but I do not believe that £25 million is equitable. It is a tax put on at random by the Department of Finance &mdash; it does not represent anything.  No matter how we examine it, the ESB's levy is one-seventh of the total commercial rates paid throughout the country.  The ESB premises do not represent one-seventh of the rates bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can smile away.  The ESB at that time were given an opportunity to prove what their position would be to me and to the Department. They were to prove whether £10 million was excessive.  I have not been in a position to know what they did since.  The amount has gone from £10 million to £25 million.  In my view it is too high and, if it is, the ESB should be allowed to prove their case.  It is a bone of contention and it is one other imposition added to energy costs.</P>

I asked the Tánaiste to look carefully, with deep consideration, at my proposition to integrate Forestry with Bord na Móna. Both bodies have a great deal in common. They both acquire bad land for development. Bord na Móna have a lot of machinery which could do much forestry work at times of the year when Bord na Móna work is low and work in the forests is high.  Development of rural areas is common to both bodies.  Bord na Móna should be taken out of the area they are in.  Without such an amalgamation, afforestation can never be developed properly.  Bord na Móna are a good, commercially oriented body who can do the job, and both bodies could give a lead if they became a well organised development corporation.</P>

      <P>These Estimate debates are becoming ridiculous.  Last week we had the Defence Estimate.  The Minister and the Opposition spokesman made speeches and I and the Leader of the Opposition had to divide 22 minutes.  We were passing an Estimate for £270 million. We have the same position tonight. A number of Deputies want to get in, but the Minister came in with a 27-page speech and raced through it and did not give anybody an opportunity to contribute.

      <P>Estimate debates are about how the respective Ministers are running <Col N="1986" /> their Departments, whether they are good managing directors and getting the best value possible for the taxpayers' money.  These are occasions when the Legislature can ask for accountability from Ministers.  Tonight, because we are talking about energy and natural resources we should be given time to deal with the main subjects under discussion.  The main feature of this Estimate is its contribution to job creation from exploitation of our natural resources.  I would like to bring up many serious questions but I will not be able to do so.  Therefore, I will go straight into the problems I am most interested in.  They relate to oil and mining exploration, with references to the nuclear situation.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer first to the disappointing amount of time given by the Minister to the Tara Bula position, to which Deputy Reynolds referred.  The Minister gave it 12 lines in his 27 page speech, more or less wishing it well.  Perhaps that is all he could do in the circumstsances.</P>
      <P>The continuing non-development of the Bula ore body is a national scandal. It is the richest lead and zinc ore body in Europe and one of the finest in the world. Successive Governments are to blame for this neglect.  I referred to this during the debate on the National Development Corporation Bill last November and at Question Times in the past months.  It is now clear that the failure to adopt the £100 million bankers trust plan was a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bula company has worked hard for many years to bring the plan to fruition.  I referred last November to the 11th hour intervention by the Canadian Tara interest. Their offer to take over by assuming £22 million of the debt was designed to thwart the implementation of the bankers trust project.  The intervention by the Canadian Tara interest was obviously not genuine but a ploy.  The spectacle of the chairman of Noranda refusing to meet the Taoiseach last autumn was an insult to our soverignty.  The public should be told that to date £1.75 billion worth of ore has been exported by Tara but the <Col N="1987" /> Exchequer has received only a miserly pittance of £300,000.</P>
    <P>The questions I put down but did not get answers to related to this matter.  On 4 June I extracted some figures from the Minister.  This is the company that now lays claim to the Bula deposits, and I say that if they want it they must pay for it. The directors of Bula are to be applauded for their courage and persistence in standing up to this foreign multinational, despite the taunts of some politicians here, some of whom have blatant vested interests.  The executives of Tara boasted that the State would never get a penny from Tara and that they intended to liquidate the Bula directorships.  Such taunts have a ring of truth about them and should not be ignored.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Collins, castigated unnamed mining interests for subverting the interests of the State in Bula.  The lengths that Tara have gone to to block the Bula development are legendary.  To quote the Minister, they are not consistent with the conduct of a guest company in Ireland.  The Minister saw fit to order an investigation of Tara in 1984 and I believe that the consultants' report which resulted should be laid before the House.  If the Minister does not want to proceed now with a separate Bula development, he is duty bound to ensure that any amalgamated arrangement is based on fair and commercial terms.</P>
    <P>In this regard I see some hope now that the Finnish group Outokumpu Oy have taken control of Tara.  It is known that these people are held in high regard technically in the mining industry and that they have been very bullish about an independent Bula development in the past in which they were prepared to invest substantial funds.  With their having control of Tara's mining facilities now, they should have no problem in coming to a realistic accommodation with the Bula people, who are Irish, who have put everything into this country and who have been very badly treated.  The Irish taxpayer and the State would have benefited enormously had the Bula operation got <Col N="1988" /> off the ground with the form of agreement that was in mind and in the light of the amount of money the State invested in the mine.</P>
    <P>The only obstacle to a sensible solution in the past has been the greed of Tara and the pursuit of revenge and personal vendettas that have no place in business, especially where such a valuable natural resource is involved.  We are playing around with the people's money.  I am sick of this saga and I will not let go until there is some benefit to the taxpayer. However, I am not very confident or optimistic that will happen in view of the record to date.</P>
    <P>The whole episode has its origins in the original attempt by Tara to fool an old man in the early seventies.  The behaviour of the banks towards the Bula directors has been a disgrace.  Foreign banks should realise they are using the money deposits of the Irish people for lending in this country.  The money should be loaned for productive enterprise and once loaned it should not be withdrawn precipitately.  I can think of no better use for the money of the Irish people than a mining project with jobs, export values, added value and so on.  The recent pursuit by the banks of the Bula directors through the courts warrants official scrutiny. As a lawyer and businessman, I cannot see the justice of banks lending to a company for a mining project, then suing the guarantors before planning permission is received, and now apparently threatening these people's homes, while not moving at all against the company that has the primary responsibility.  In America that is called going after the chicken feed.  It is ruthlessness at its very worst.  Such unscrupulous behaviour by foreign banks &mdash; sometimes, I fear, in cahoots with the foreign mining interests &mdash; and using the money of the Irish people must be stamped out.</P>
    <P>I have serious concern about the ore reserve position at Navan.  Recently I put down some questions to the Minister on this subject and I am not altogether happy with the replies so far received.  I shall be putting down further questions and I ask the Minister to ensure that they are dealt <Col N="1989" /> with fully and frankly and without evasion.</P>
    <P>I am a Member of Parliament and I am asking serious questions.  We are talking about a lot of money.  I mentioned a figure of £1.75 billion.  Recently I asked the Minister to confirm if the approximate figure of 20 million tonnes of ore reserve is the correct one in respect of the lead and zinc ore body at Navan but I was told the Minister has no official responsibility to the Dáil in relation to that matter.  We are talking about a State mining lease.  There has been evasion regarding this matter, but I am not saying the Minister is responsible.  If I took the figure of 20 million tonnes and worked on the same basis as I did in the other instance, I would get a figure of £2.5 billion.  The Bula reserves are estimated at between 20 million to 25 million tonnes; and, taking the figure of £2.5 billion, I would end with the colossal sum of £7.3 billion.  We must not forget that, as a Parliament, we have responsibility in the matter.  Are the Irish people to be ripped off entirely by all these goings-on? Tara have been true to their word.  They said they would never pay a penny and they have not paid a penny.  They have looked after their own shareholders.  I should like confirmation of the amount of ore and money taken out by Tara.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I should like to congratulate Mr. Conroy on his success to date in his prospecting operations in County Laois.  It is early days yet, but it shows that Irish people have a real role to play in the country's development.  The Department of Energy should foster initiative in the area of natural resources, be it Bula, Conroy or the Irish oil exploration companies so that we will not be totally reliant on foreign interests in this vital area of our economy.</P>
    <P>Many jobs could have been created. After the money was put in place we were within three months of creating 480 jobs at the Bula mine and we had a prospect of getting back the £9 million the State invested.  In addition, the Irish investors, who put in £14 million of their own money, would have had the prospect of getting their money back also.  It is certain <Col N="1990" /> that the country would have benefited and not foreign multinationals who do not give two damns about this country or anyone in it.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from an editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 11 October 1985 which made the following comments:</P>
    <P>Obtaining information about the present situation would strain the combined abilities of the KGB and the CIA: secrecy seems to be the watchword, with the result that the public knows very little about what is happening.</P>
    <P>The editorial also stated:</P>
    <P>If this were a semi-State organisation much could be said about it.  Nevertheless the point must be made that part of our mineral reserves which could be generating an income for the country (and for individuals) lies untouched many years after the land over it was acquired.  This is where the real tragedy of Bula lies.</P>
    <P>I should like to know that my right to this information will be respected without having to resort to other methods of getting it.  In the same way, my anger was not directed at the Minister when I asked questions about the Chernobyl accident. I had not expected that massive resources would be lined up to cope with the kind of accident that had happened for the first time.  I accept that matters will improve, that I shall get answers to questions in the future and that we will be better prepared.  I accept that the Minister is in a position of not being able to do much about it and that the only advice the Nuclear Energy Board probably could give him if he phones from Tralee in the event of a dreadful tragedy, would be to say to him, &ldquo;They are dying like flies up here, Minister.  Keep your head down and get into your bunker&rdquo;.  I hope that in the future we will be better prepared.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of my speech tonight has been concentrated on jobs.  I hope what I said about mining can be extended to other areas of exploration for the <Col N="1991" /> benefit of all the people to whom I know the Minister is committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Estimate.  In the brief time available to me I should like to raise a few issues with the Minister in the hope that he will reply to them.  He mentioned the increase in the money available for the FEOGA western aid electrification scheme.  This is very welcome because that scheme has been of great benefit to agriculture.  I raised this issue a few times with the Minister, particularly as regards new supplies for new houses in the west. The Minister told me in February that provision for 1,500 connections was made under the new supplies heading.  That was the target which had been anticipated by the Department and by the EC Commission.  He said he would be looking for an extension from the Commission, which I understood he got. I also raised the difficulty of second family dwellings.  Since 1973 these dwellings have not been included under the scheme for subsidised electricity connections.  I also raised the difficulty relating to the farmer whose sole income is from the farm but who is also in receipt of income assistance or some other social welfare benefit.  Perhaps the Minister would give an indication whether there will be more flexibility on the part of the Commission in those two areas.  Now that the scheme has been extended, perhaps the Minister could tell us how many more applicants will be allowed into the western electrification scheme.  My understanding is that the limit of 1,500 applications had been exceeded and that a number of applications had been approved which, until the Minister made his announcement, would not have been eligible for this subsidy.  I hope from what the Minister said tonight and from his reply on 29 May that these people will be able to benefit from this extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that the Minister should tell us how many more people will be allowed this subsidy because people in rural Ireland get massive quotations for their capital contributions for electricity <Col N="1992" /> connections.  I have written to the Minister about a number of my constituents who got quotations from the ESB for approximately £1,000 for electricity connections. In recent weeks we have been talking in this House about the reduction in electricity prices but we sometimes forget about the people who have to pay to have electricity installed.  This is a problem in many rural and isolated areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister said electricity prices for domestic consumers would be reduced by 5 per cent from September, but I am disappointed that with falling oil prices these prices have not already been reduced.  I hope the Minister will not rule out the possibility of an early reduction in electricity prices for the domestic consumer.</P>
    <P>In a motion debated recently we highlighted the case of the price of electricity for industry.  The fact that there will be a reduction in the price of electricity is welcome but we are still very much out of line with our competitors in Europe and this is having an effect on competition and trade.  The recent figures given by the CII show that our prices are about 18 per cent higher than in the rest of Europe. For the more intensive firms this differential could be as high as 40 per cent.  That is a very heavy load for a company to bear, especially a company which is either trying to provide steady employment or to create extra jobs.  Because of high electricity prices we are losing jobs. The Minister will have to reduce electricity prices to industry further.  We do not want a repeat of what happened two years ago when firms told us the cost of a year's electricity was as high as the annual wage bill.  The ESB have raised the question of the Government levy and the tax on fuel oil.  I hope the Minister will reply to the points which have been made about these impositions because we will continue to have this gap between Irish and European electricity prices as long as these impositions are in existence.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question of private bog development.  In the Estimate we see a reduction of 20 per cent on the 1985 figure.  That is very disappointing especially at a time when stocks of fuel are low <Col N="1993" /> nationally.  Last year we had atrocious weather and very low supplies of turf were available.  We should be in the process of producing more natural resources through the use of our bogs, through the private development scheme, and through Bord na Móna production.  I had hoped more money would be made available in the Estimate for private bog development and that Bord na Móna would increase their harvesting both of milled peat production and peat briquettes.</P>
    <P>Last year small farmers lost out because of the weather but many small private turf producers also lost out.  I understand a submission has been made to the Department about a rescue package for these producers.  They have given great employment in their areas and have invested in machinery which is not allowed grant assistance &mdash; swamp dozers and swamp diggers which are very useful in preparing bogs to turf extraction.  The Minister might give some indication whether this type of machinery will be allowed for grant assistance.</P>
    <P>It is very disappointing to see in the last report issued by Bord na Móna that the Derryfadda/Ballyforan peat briquette factory has to make an exceptional interest payment of £4.5 million. When one sees such a high figure for interest repayments on a project which has only reached the stage where the site is cleared and lighting standards have been provided, I think it is a very sad indictment of this Government.  The annual report mentions that expenditure on the project included capitalised interest of £9 million, and amounted to £29 million.  That is the type of expenditure we are talking about but we have nothing to show for it.  Yet Bord na Móna are making interest repayments of £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister for the fact that this project was reviewed on a number of occasions.  &ldquo;Reviewed&rdquo; means &ldquo;postponed&rdquo;, unfortunately.  The present Minister for Finance reviewed this project on the first occasion in 1983.  Since then it has been reviewed by the Government. We are told this is an ongoing <Col N="1994" /> review.  What exactly is an ongoing review?  Recently we had a meeting of Galway and Roscommon County Councils with five officials from Bord na Móna to try to get information about this project and they said the review had been completed last April.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can give some indication of what the Government will do now that the review has been completed by Bord na Móna.  I am disappointed that in this area of my constituency very close to where I live 100 people have been laid off at Derryfadda. To my mind this prejudices the whole review.  We saw 200,000 tonnes of milled peat transported over very bad roads to the ESB stations at Shannonbridge and Blackwater.  The whole idea of Bord na Móna developing there and of farmers giving away their bogs for as little as £25 an acre in the expectation of jobs has come to nought because of what has happened since 1983 when this project was reviewed.  I ask the Minister how any one can justify £4.5 million being paid in interest repayments for a project which has been suspended since 1983 when the Government gave an indication to the House of their intentions on this project.</P>
    <P>I commend what has been mentioned in the Estimate concerning the development of alternative energy and particularly the question of hydro electricity.  If we were to develop our hydro electric sites we could effect considerable savings.  It is important that we continue to support hydro power.  The Minister in his reply to a question I raised on 29 May told me that the potential for saving on imported fuels could be up to 50,000 tonnes if all the sites were developed.  I understand that EC support is available for what we call water power, hydro power.  There is a great market not only in this country but as far away as California for turbines.  That area could be promoted further.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed at the Minister's reference to the nuclear power question. He talked about his concern.  I have no doubt about his concern, but the Government's concern is questionable. <Col N="1995" /> They are too complacent on the whole question of nuclear power.  I refer not only to the motion on which we divided in the House but also to the fact that we have not yet confronted the British Government on the question of the closure of Sellafield.  I welcome any initiative taken at European or international level on this but it is important that this question be taken up directly with the British Government because we know what arose from the fallout at Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for some of the good news in the Estimate, particularly the increase in FEOGA grants, but I am disappointed that some questions which he had not time to raise were not raised adequately in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am pleased to be given an opportunity to speak on this Estimate but, like other Members, I deplore and am frustrated at the shortness of time.  Deputy Noel Treacy has asked me to give him five minutes of my time.  I thought I would have 15 minutes and I agreed readily to give him five minutes of my 15 minutes so that constrains me further.  It is grossly unfair even to the Minister to ask him to deal with his Estimate in such a brief time.  He would benefit from the views expressed by various Members of this House especially on issues which affect their constituencies. This is a very important Estimate because many of the points and issues raised here, such as Sellafield, Chernobyl, Bula Mines, natural gas, Moneypoint and solid fuels, are topical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time available to me I would like to refer to two matters the Minister mentioned in his Estimate speech which concern my constituency. The first is Ballingarry Mines.  Unfortunately we are only too well aware of the chequered history of the very fine anthracite mines in Ballingarry in the north eastern portion of my constitutency. Indeed, it would be remiss of me <Col N="1996" /> if I did not avail of this opportunity to convey to the Minister and to this House the utter frustration experienced by the miners in that area at the mine having closed down for nigh on two years.  We are reliably informed that approximately 3.7 million tonnes of top class anthracite are available there for mining, worth in the region of £200 million to £300 million. In 1967, 360 miners were employed there and shortly before the closure the employment figure was from 120 to 150. We have there a fully qualified workforce &mdash; miners by family tradition.  Their fathers and grandfathers were miners. With the closure of the mines they have no other form of employment in the immediate vicinity.</P>
    <P>We have seen the programme &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; about the abuse of public funds. Indeed, the abuse of IDA and Fóir Teoranta funds is only the tip of the iceberg. I thank the Minister and his Minister of State, Deputy Eddie Collins, for meeting deputations on two or three occasions from Ballingarry Mines and showing their concern.  Unfortunately, the closure of the mines is totally outside the Minister's compass but I urge him to use his powers to see that these mines are re-opened immediately.</P>
    <P>One matter that emerged from the deputations I have referred to is the absolute necessity for new legislation in regard to mining.  There are grey areas in this instance.  The legal advisers and the receiver were unable to answer questions in regard to the lease.  A person claims to be the mortgagee in possession of the lease and apparently that has prevented the re-opening of these mines.  I urge the Minister to consider the introduction of new leglislation in respect of mines so that what has happened in this instance can never be repeated in Ballingarry or any other coalfield or anthracite field in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There was a very cursory reference to Clonmel.  I am pleased that a decision was taken in principle to provide natural gas to Clonmel.  However, that decision was taken virtually two years ago and there has been no further development in that area.  Again I urge the Minister to <Col N="1997" /> get Clonmel Corporation and Bord Gáis Éireann to sit around a table to thrash out the remaining few obstacles in the way of giving a natural gas supply to both domestic users and industrial developments in Clonmel and its hinterland who are willing and able to use this facility.</P>
    <P>Those are the two points I wish to mention and I hope the Minister will give them attention.  I conclude now to give Deputy Noel Treacy five minutes of my time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noel Treacy.  He has five minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sincerely grateful for the opportunity to make a contribution on this very important Estimate.  I cannot understand why it could not be taken on a Friday for a full day in order to allow Deputies an opportunity to debate it.</P>
      <P>This is a most important Estimate and the Minister is responsible for one of the most important Departments.  We are not passing on full value for money to the consumer and not taking into account the fuel price reductions.  Indeed, the Minister said that such reductions had been very significant last year throughout the world, which should ensure that ESB prices would be reduced to manufacturers and consumers as soon as possible because manufacturing costs here put us at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> foreign competitors. The Minister must ensure that we are able to compete in the marketplace. The cost of energy is abnormally high and reductions should be passed on on a regular, significant basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £421,000 for western aid electrification is very small and I am very disappointed with the criteria used by the Department of Energy in assessing applications.  The ESB are directing people in the west to get an ESB connection while their applications are pending and, although they are forced to sign a document, the Department of Energy will not make a decision on a pending application.  Such people may live in disadvantaged areas and may have to get a connection from their parents' house <Col N="1998" /> next door and there are a number of people who cannot afford to pay the abnormally high prices charged in rural areas for connection.  I ask the Minister to direct his Department to adopt a more sympathetic approach in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt and I are very disappointed at the failure of the Government, the Department of Energy and the Minister to direct Bord na Móna to go ahead with building Ballyforan briquette factory. There has been constant procrastination in this regard over the past three and a half years and were it not for the pressure applied from the Opposition, especially from our spokesman, Deputy Reynolds, Deputy Kitt and me, we would not know where we stand.  At least we now know there is no commitment from the so called socialist wing of the Government to direct the Department to help to create jobs in the west which would enable us to produce the products so badly needed for the creation of energy. Farmers in east and mid-Galway and south Roscommon who have given away their bogs for very small money to Bord na Móna on a basic guarantee that they would be put into production have not had such promises honoured.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in the interests of the west, to direct the Ballyforan factory to go ahead because £7.5 million has already been expended there.  Bord na Móna cannot have it both ways.  They cannot continue to acquire large tracts of bog for small money, hold on to them and so prevent other people from going ahead with development of sod peat or other energy products.  They are rejecting grant applications for peat production and other bog development and will not develop what they have on hands.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer particularly to Attymon bog where there is an obvious need to produce sod peat.  It had a quota of 26,000 tonnes for 1986.  It produced 34,000 tonnes in 1985 but, due to the inclement weather, there is no hope of producing that amount this year.  The Minister should demand special auxiliary sod peat production from Bord na Móna by way of the sausage machine which would be allowed to develop alongside the Lilliput <Col N="1999" /> machinery which exists in the bog at present.  He should demand this immediately and not wait until 1987 or longer to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have expressed regret in regard to the time allotted to this debate, I presume by agreement between the Whips representing the major parties.  I agree with the sentiments expressed and I would be willing, if more time were available, to discuss this important Estimate. My personal conviction is that we will not see a more satisfactory system in force until a general review and reform takes place in this institution and in the political system.  I assume we will have to wait a certain time before that takes place.  I would welcome a review of political and public institutions which would allow more time for the consideration of Estimates, teasing out the issues involved under each individual subhead and a thorough review of Government policy to which Opposition Deputies and, indeed, Government backbenchers are entitled. We will have to shift the balance of the responsibilities on each Deputy and on Ministers from constituency work to more concentration on legislation and investigation of Estimates.

      <P>The Deputy is very predictable. I am somewhat at a loss in relation to an inference that an order was placed before the House in relation to giving a letter of comfort to the banks as far as Dublin Gas are concerned.  The only order of which I am aware was one relating to ensuring that the provisions of the Companies Acts relating to the receivership would be brought into force. That was the order laid before the House. There was no question of any other order or guarantee in that regard being laid before the House.  I answered the Deputy <Col N="2000" /> quite clearly and there was neither prevarication nor any attempt to mislead him in the last couple of months in relation to the directions given.</P>

      <P>The receiver was appointed by BGE, not by the Government, and the objective, which is being carried out, is to maintain the business as a going concern and to ensure that supplies of gas are maintained without interruption to the many consumers of the company and to put the company on a viable footing.  Deputy Reynolds seems to maintain that if he were in office he would have found other ways of doing it, but we seem to agree on the principle in relation to ensuring that Dublin Gas Company are made a viable company.</P>
      <P>I also reject the Deputy's insinuation that I did not carry out my contractual obligations under this agreement.  I carried out all the contractual obligations placed upon me under the agreement and also my statutory obligations as Minister for Energy.  Over the past few weeks I have answered many Parliamentary and Private Notice Questions on this subject and, because of the threat of legal actions pending, one must be constrained in replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Skelly mentioned Tara Mines.  There seems to be a certain degree of insinuation on all sides of the House in relation to vested interests of parties or Deputies in this episode.  I stated categorically in this House in the past that on becoming Minister for Energy I approached the whole mining question with an open mind.  My interest then and now is to ensure that we get the maximum benefit <Col N="2001" /> for the people from the natural resources which exist onshore or offshore.</P>
    <P>That is the overriding principle on which I approached any negotiations which took place in relation to the mining question and I felt I was not holding a brief for any party other than for the taxpayer generally in the discussions that took place.  Outokumpu Oy, the Finnish mining company, have acquired 75 per cent of the shares and are presently assessing the total Irish mining position. This company have a very successful track record with a strong possibility of playing a very successful role in our economy.</P>
    <P>In regard to Bula, the receiver is about to invite bids for the ore body.  There is no doubt but that Outokumpu Oy are interested.  But I assume they will study carefully the documentation being made available by the receiver, which is available to all interested parties. Whether or not they will be successful if they make a bid remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds asked if the receiver selling the Bula ore body is doing so without a State mining lease.  There is no question of such a lease as the minerals in question are privately owned.</P>
    <P>The question of Ballingarry Mines has been raised by both Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Griffin.  Both Deputies are aware of my own concern in this matter. I am aware that the receiver is publishing, on 16 June, notices inviting offers for the Ballingarry Mines.  There are legal questions which have to be resolved and these can only be resolved in the medium term by the receiver.  Deputies are aware that where there are legal uncertainties the matters have to be resolved and, as doctors differ, so also do lawyers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds asked if it would be possible to go ahead with the gas pipeline to Northern Ireland.  I said in this House last October that the offer to Northern Irealnd of supplies is still on the table.  It is obviously something that will be considered in the context of any US aid which is forthcoming under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  But we have to accept that the ball remains firmly in the court of the British Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds queried the economics of the Kilkenny project and the decision-making process which was engaged in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>An examination of that project took place some time ago and on the basis of that examination I felt that to carry out my duties as Minister responsible in a responsible manner, I could not allow that project to go ahead, given the capital costs that were envisaged at that time.  Subsequent to that a firm of international consultants were engaged to review that project and they have succeeded in drawing up a project which has substantially reduced the capital cost of the project and a combination of the reduction in the capital costs plus an anticipation of good market penetration in that area of the distribution of natural gas now make that project for more viable than the one which I rejected and which could not have been recommended to this House two years ago.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;chestnut which is, to say <Col N="2003" /> the least, a complex question.  It is easy to say the ESB should not be paying over £20 million in rates and that £10 million is nearer the figure that was settled upon some years ago.  The valuation officers in the Department of the Environment are looking at a realistic valuation.  I am not admitting to this House, in case anybody thinks so, that the present figure is unrealistic, but I think it is worth while to get a realistic assessment of the rateable valuation of the ESB properties.  All Deputies are aware that if £24 million is taken out of one Estimate it will have to be looked for elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Bord na Móna made a submission to me which I am examining. I certainly would subscribe to the basic tenet of what the Deputy was saying because there is obviously a fair degree of complement between the activities of Bord na Móna and the forestry activity. The Forestry Review Group have had a submission from Bord na Móna.  The recommendation does not include a role for Bord na Móna but I do not see that as the last word.  I am having the matter examined and I believe we will be able to make some progress in that area.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive study of early production systems for marginal fields has been undertaken and I expect that to be published in the near future.  I am aware of the dangers of early production systems, but we have to take in all the factors involved and then make a decision on the best evidence available to us whether the early production systems would be the appropriate systems.  The Deputy can be assured that the correct <Col N="2005" /> decision will be made taking into the account the various risks involved and the overall interests of the State.</P>
      <P>Let me clarify something for Deputy Reynolds in regard to the nuclear situation because there seems to be still some doubt.  I have said to the House that what the Irish Government have been seeking from the European Commission at a number of meetings which have taken place is the establishment of a community, health and safety inspection force and this force would be able to determine the safety of nuclear installations within the Community.</P>
      <P>In the course of our discussions in this House in the last number of months Deputy Reynolds in particular, and I believe his Leader also, appeared to raise a doubt as to whether the Commission had competence to appoint such a force.  I want to repeat and make very clear to the Deputies, in case it is said that I am claiming something has been established which we have not actually achieved, that the Commission's legal service agreed on a meeting on 6 June last that they had competence under the Euratom Treaty to take the initiative to set up such an inspection force.  I believe that to be a major step forward with regard to what the Government are seeking and we intend to press forward with that objective in the best interests not only of the Irish people but of the peoples of the European countries to ensure that such a health and safety commission is established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of questions which, unfortunately, I have not time to deal with.  I thank Deputies for their co-operation. We have been very limited on time in this Estimate but I can assure Deputies that if they want to discuss the questions which they raised with me over the coming few days I shall certainly be available and readily willing to assist, either in regard to their own constituency areas or in the overall national interest.

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the threatened closure of Wexford Cutlery Limited, Enniscorthy.  He has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  I should like to divide my time with Deputy Yates. Wexford Cutlery Limited have been part and parcel of Enniscorthy town for many years.  They are now in serious difficulties, with a threatened loss of approximately 20 jobs.  The news of the company's troubles has brought an air of despondency and gloom to the people of Enniscorthy town.  Over the past few years unemployment has ravaged this town and there are at present 2,000 people unemployed in the area.  Many of these are <Col N="2007" /> young people who never had the opportunity to work.  In percentage terms, we are away above the national average. This is an unemployment black spot and repeated calls from Deputy Yates and myself to the IDA and other Government agencies for priority action to solve the problems of the area have been more or less ignored.</P>
      <P>Wexford Cutlery Limited have at present 40 people employed, but tomorrow evening 20 of those will be let go in what has been described as a temporary lay-off.  Unfortunately, temporary lay-offs usually become permanent these days.  This decision stems from lack of orders.  The 20 people being let go are mainly in the cutlery area of the business. It is appalling that the only company in Ireland manufacturing stainless cutlery cannot be viable and successful.  Something has gone seriously astray in the market.  There are a number of reasons for the problems now facing this company. A major export order to a leading UK company was recently cancelled, despite every effort by management to get the decision reversed.</P>
      <P>The Irish markets have been flooded with cheap imports from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and in recent times China, without tariffs or embargoes of any kind being imposed.  It is impossible for Irish products to compete pricewise.  The company management point out that a piece of cutlery such as a spoon can be landed here from those countries for the same price as Wexford Cutlery Limited would have to pay for the raw material to produce such an item.  The Minister and the Government must seriously consider making it extremely difficult for such cheap imports to get into this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey carried out two years ago showed that if cheap imports of cutlery were banned from Ireland a total of 800 people could be employed in the industry in Enniscorthy town or in related industries throughout the country.  The Minister should at least make it much more difficult for such importations to take place in order to protect Irish jobs.  He has a vital role to play in ensuring that all <Col N="2008" /> Government agencies purchasing cutlery do so from Wexford Cutlery Limited.  At present Aer Lingus, the Department of Defence and CIE occasionally, purchase from this company and that business is appreciated, but other Government Departments do not even make an inquiry.  One must question why.</P>
    <P>Hospitals, hostels and areas connected with health boards are in the market and large amounts of cutlery are purchased from time to time.  The same applies to prisons, State owned colleges and other Government institutions.  These orders never go to Wexford Cutlery Limited. It is obvious that these purchases must consist of cheap imported material.</P>
    <P>There is also CERT, a body involved in areas relating to catering and one must ask where they are getting their cutlery supplies at present.  I ask the Minister tonight to give a commitment to contact those agencies, encourage and, if possible, direct them to purchase from the Wexford firm and help to save the jobs of Irish people.  There is nothing illegal about coming down in favour of Irish workers and the protection of their jobs.</P>
    <P>Another area relates to the multinationals and even the Irish owned supermarkets and retail outlets.  I know that Deputy Yates has a particular concern about below cost selling and so forth. These people do not seem to want to know about Irish products and certainly do not want to know about Wexford cutlery, a supreme quality product.  Dunnes Stores, Tesco, H. Williams and Quinnsworth do not carry the product. They give no choice to the housewife. They sell the product which will make most profit for them.  Supermarkets are in business for profiteering, and, in some cases, racketeering.  We must call on the supermarkets to give the Irish housewife at least the opportunity to buy a good Irish cutlery set and not just the cheap import.</P>
    <P>Waterford Glass Limited and Galway Crystal have engaged Wexford Cutlery Limited to produce particular products for them which have been very successful. In that section there are 15 people employed and I am happy to say those <Col N="2009" /> jobs appear to be reasonably well protected. Wexford Cutlery Limited appreciate the work done by these two very reputable firms.  If their product is good enough for Waterford Glass Limited and for Galway Crystal, it is surely good enough to be on the shelves of the supermarkets and to be purchased by Government agencies.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to use his good offices to ensure the survival of this company. Enniscorthy cannot afford to lose these jobs.  We are on our knees now as far as unemployment is concerned.  I am not being political tonight and have divided my time with Deputy Yates.  We are concerned about Enniscorthy and about unemployment in that town.  In housing estates there are young people who have never had an opportunity to work.  It is criminal that the only Irish stainless steel company cannot be viable and profitable, with protection for jobs. I ask the Minister to take an interest and ensure that this company, which carries on a traditional industry, can still employ people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Browne for allowing me some of his time in this limited debate, and the Ceann Comhairle for being good enough to allow the matter to be taken on the Adjournment.  Unfortunately, this is the second occasion in the lifetime of this Dáil that this enterprise has had difficulties. Previously it was Viners Cutlery which went into receivership.  One of the important things about Wexford Cutlery Limited is that is has been taken over by local enterpreneurs who are not fly-by-nights and who are very committed to the future of this business.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne referred to the quality of the product.  I can speak from personal experience.  Having been married recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I received a large quantity of Wexford cutlery and can speak very highly of its quality.  The situation is extremely serious, as Deputy Browne has <Col N="2010" /> said.  I hope that these lay-offs are only temporary.  I understand that the firm have been stockpiling for some time. When they recently reviewed the financial position they realised that because of the limited sales they could not carry on indefinitely.  This resulted in these lay-offs. The Minister should ensure, firstly, that the State agencies, the Irish Goods Council and Córas Tráchtála, through their exports &mdash; they have substantial exports to the UK &mdash; are assisted in every way possible in relation to their marketing dilemma.  As Deputy Browne so rightly pointed out, there is also the question of State purchases.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to look at the question of cutlery for the Army.  This is handled by the Department of Defence. Each year in April or May a tender is advertised for a major contract which involves a couple of months work for this firm.  The tenders are placed around June and the work and the delivery take place in July.  We are already into the middle of June and the tender has still not been advertised.  I am glad that the Department of Defence picked Wexford cutlery because of its high quality and its strategic position in this sector.  I ask the Minister to take up this Army contract with the Department of Defence to ensure that it is brought forward and advertised immediately and that Wexford Cutlery Limited is given priority for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to Mr. Tom Williams and other shareholders in the firm.  They invested much money in it but have not made any.  They are continuously putting money into the company.  I also wish to pay tribute to the workforce. There is a very good industrial relations record here.  They are workers of a particularly high skill and deserve every support. I would ask the Minister to see what scope there is within Foir Teoranta to give the necessary resources by way of equity capital to this company if they are rearranging their finances.  I would also ask, as I understand that the Industrial Credit Corporation is a creditor, that there would be no panic reaction, that the current review which is taking place <Col N="2011" /> and the trading operations would be sympathetically looked at and that there would be a positive and constructive outlook towards the future.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Browne when he said that health boards, hospitals, Aer Lingus and any other State firms should be assisted with their purchases of cutlery. I wish to underline the point he made about the overall context of unemployment in Enniscorthy because of this. Recently <i>The Echo,</i> a famous local newspaper, went into receivership.  It is indicative of the problems of Enniscorthy that we are talking about a lay-off of 20 people.  In Castlebar and Cork people talk about lay-offs of 200 or 300?  We are in such a desperate position in regard to employment that a shedding of jobs at this level is very severe indeed.  Last week Deputy Browne, myself and other Oireachtas Members met Mr. Pádraig White. We asked, because of the needs of Wexford and in particular Enniscorthy, that the embargo on advance factories would be lifted.  It was agreed by the IDA that if there was one area in the county where it could be lifted it would be Enniscorthy. There are 18.8 acres of land there for a 20,000 sqare feet advance factory.  The IDA were very sympathetic.  If the policy is not to build any more advance factories and just place projects in the existing advance factory space, then because there is no advance factory in Enniscorthy that means industry will go elsewhwere.  We have the lowest industrial base and therefore our needs are greater.  I specifically ask, as well as the question of designation which I do not have time to go into at present, that this measure for Enniscorthy would be looked upon very sympathetically.</P>
    <P>We are not trying to make an alarmist situation out of the position in Wexford Cutlery Limited.  I believe that it has a positive future.  I understand that other cutlery businesses, through contacts in Sheffield and in England generally, are experiencing the same decline.  It is not any problem or fault of Wexford Cutlery Limited.  It is an overall decline.  Perhaps stainless steel cutlery is somewhat of a <Col N="2012" /> luxury, given the recessionary position in relation to disposable incomes.  Therefore, because this company is doing nothing wrong there is no reason why they should not get full State support.  If there is a complacent attitude and if it is left to the vagaries of the market, then I fear, as Deputy Browne does, that the temporary position may turn into a semi-permanent or permanent one.</P>
    <P>I ask that Córas Tráchtála, who recently clinched a deal with a major retail outlet in the UK for the export of this very fine cutlery, which is simply not moving off the shelves, would get assistance towards further contracts in that area.  The Irish Goods Council should try to identify dumped imports from non-EC countries.  We are not talking about a free trading environment within the EC.  We are talking about dumped cheap labour imports from non-EC third countries.  France or some other country would have technical trade barriers or some way of hindering imports. The Irish Goods Council should be asked to promote this fine Irish production.  The necessary financial State agencies, Fóir Teoranta and ICC, should take a positive outlook in this regard.  The overall needs of Enniscorthy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the IDA should also be taken into account because of this very bad and depressing news for this town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Browne and Deputy Yates, I fully appreciate the importance of Wexford Cutlery Limited in the industrial scene in Enniscorthy and in County Wexford. I was concerned about the recent news.  Regretfully, I do not have much information to offer the House concerning the cause of the company's current difficulties or precisely what steps its management propose to take in the immediate future.  The company's workforce have been put under protective notice.  This came as a surprise not only to me but also to the State agencies, including the Industrial Development Authority who, as I understand it, were not given any preliminary warning in the <Col N="2013" /> matter.  I am not in any way implying that the decision to put the workforce under protective notice is a precipitate decision; nor is it necessarily a bad omen for the company.  It may be a procedural decision taken by the promoters on good advice. However, it is not for me to say.  Given the local background of the promoters, I am sure that they are fully satisfied with this course of action and that they are acting in a very responsible manner. However, to my knowledge the relevant State agencies have not yet been approached.  Certainly, the IDA have not been approached, nor were they approached at an earlier point in time, to see if there are solutions to the problems.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions in this House I have asked industry to be forthcoming in coming forward to State agencies in order to identify the problems being faced by them.  Sometimes it is not possible, even with State agencies assistance, to get solutions to a company's problem. I appeal again that the relevant State agencies be approached.  In relation to the case before the House tonight I will get in touch with the State agencies and their responsible Ministers with a view to seeing what can be done to ensure the continuation of this company.  The company manufacture cutlery products and they have had a difficult history over the past ten years.  Their future seemed to have been assured back in 1975 when they were acquired by Viners of Sheffield.  Unfortunately, that venture did not work out, due to trading difficulties in the UK.  Indeed, a receiver was appointed to the parent company.  This led to a takeover of the assets by a consortium of local interests headed by a local businessman and included some of the former management and the extablishment of Wexford Cutlery Limited in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period since then this local group have made strenuous efforts to secure the company's future through, <i>inter alia,</i> diversification into new product areas. With assistance from CTT, they have been endeavouring to develop new markets both at home, where Waterford Glass were mentioned, and in the UK. <Col N="2014" /> where, unfortunately, in 1985 they lost a substantial export business when a particular customer whom they were supplying experienced unforseen difficulties. Deputy Yates raised the question of the Department of Defence tender.  This tender will be put out in the near future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the problem of competition from inports, there is no doubt that the level of imports from the People's Republic of China have grown substantially in recent years.  This was from a very modest base in 1983 and is more than offset by compensating decreases in imports from South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan.  Nevertheless, the action open to Ireland to restrict imports is fairly limited, particularly having regard to Ireland's responsibilities not only as a member of the European Communities but also as a member of GATT. If it can be demonstrated what imports from these sources represent the nub of Wexford Cutlery's difficulties I will arrange to have the matter examined within by Department to see if a sustainable case for some form of quantitative restriction on imports from some of these sources can be made and pursued by my Department.  It will be open to the firm to approach the EC Commission if they are concerned about low cost imports or dumping from outside the Community. That is something which will have to be pursued in a formal manner.  However, before I depart from this point I would like to mention that a cursory examination of the import statistics would seem seen to suggest that the bulk of our imports in the cutlery area come from the UK and, to a lesser extent, from other member states of the European Communities. Of course, we are severely restricted in what steps we can take to curtail these.  If we have open markets, we have to offer an open market to our partners.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of job creation in County Wexford, the Government, through the State agencies, have been addressing this question.  I am pleased to draw the House's attention to the announcements which were made recently by my Department concerning <Col N="2015" /> the establishment of three new manufacturing projects which will result in the creation of 250 new jobs in County Wexford over the next two years and which will lead to substantial extra job opportunities in later years.  One of these plants is Wenaas, which have been set up in the former Bergman factory in Enniscorthy. The Wenaas project is the second major success of the IDA in 1986 for County Wexford.  Earlier this year, Snap Tite, a US company, finalised plans to establish a plant on the Wexford Industrial Estate which is projected to employ 100 people in 1988 in the production of hydraulic hose couplings.</P>
    <P>In the small industries sector, the local IDA small industry board approved 18 reports for County Wexford during 1985 with a job potential of 124.  At year end, 14 of these projects were up and running and 45 people were already employed. For 1986, the IDA have 21 small industry projects of which nine, with a job potential of 109, have been approved.  The indications are that the target of 21 projects will be achieved.  I will bear the points made by the Deputies in mind.  I <Col N="2016" /> am not quite sure of the role which the Irish Goods Council can play in monitoring imports.  I am aware that they have a statutory function in which they have been very successful.  This is a very complex area.  We are members of the EC and of GATT and these put a constraint on us.  We must bear in mind that we depend on other countries opening their markets to us in order to allow our goods and services to have the possibility of exporting to them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion and adverting back to Wexford Cutlery Limited and the fact that the serious problems of the company have now only come to my attention, in effect, we will be arranging through my Department for the relevant State agencies to examine the situation at the company as a matter of urgency to see what can be done to ensure the continued operation of the company and the protection of the employment which they provide.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 June 1986.</P>

      <P>The numbers of staff recruited to the Civil Service for the past three years is as follows: 1983 (estimate), 1,140; 1984, 617; 1985, 1,375.  The 1983 figure excludes recruitment to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the form of a tabular statement which, with your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As regards recruitment policy, while the Government remain committed to reducing the size of the Civil Service, they are concerned that worthwhile job creation initiatives should not be neglected.  The highly successful schemes of job sharing and career breaks which they have introduced have resulted in the provision of some 1,700 extra jobs in the Civil Service at minimal or no extra cost. Also 1,000 school leavers were taken on in 1985 as temporary clerical trainees for the purpose of giving them work experience over the period of a year.  This latter programme will be continued on the same scale and the 1986 intake of trainees will take place later in the year.  It is estimated that, apart from the intake of trainees, recruitment to the Civil Service will be of the order of 1,000 in 1986.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service whether he believes that the present arrangements and structure of Government Departments are those most appropriate to modern needs and demands; and whether he proposes any major review in this area, in view of the fact that this essential structure has remained virtually unchanged since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <P>The allocation of functions to, and the organisation of, Government <Col N="1831" /> departments are continuously under review.  The White Paper on the Public Service, <i>Serving the Country Better,</i> was laid before each House of the Oireachtas in September 1985.  In the White Paper, the Government announced that where Departments have a sufficiently large volume of purely executive work, Ministers will be enabled by legislation to transfer such work to separate offices &mdash; which will have full responsibility for discharging it effectively.  The first such executive office to be established following this decision will be the Social Welfare Services Office.  The intention to establish this office was announced by the Minister for Social Welfare last November.  The Public Service Development Bill, which will be introduced shortly, will provide a legislative basis for the making of the necessary orders for this purpose.</P>
      <P>It was also announced in the White Paper that the Minister for the Public Service, in consultation with any other Minister concerned, will examine areas of overlap and duplication in the public service and advise the Government accordingly.  The necessary legislative powers to enable the Minister for the Public Service to discharge this function effectively will be provided for in the Public Service Development Bill.</P>

      <P>As Minister for the Public Service I &ldquo;control&rdquo;, to use the Deputy's word, only the pay of civil servants, though I also have statutory responsibility, invariably involving a second Minister, in a number of other areas such as the Garda Síochána with the Minister for Justice and the Defence Forces with the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all these groups the completion date for the 25th pay round, with a small <Col N="1832" /> number of exceptions, is to be 30 June 1987.  The exceptions consist in the main of public servants whose pay is specifically related to certain industrial groups. The only significant group of this type as far as numbers are concerned are those grades in Government Departments, about 2,000 staff in all, whose pay has been linked to workers in the construction industry.  The 25th round for these staff, following on a Labour Court recommendation for the construction industry, is due to end on 31 December 1986.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 31 to 33, inclusive, together.  The Geological Survey of my Department carried out certain studies of the ore reserves of Bula Limited in 1980 and 1981.  No such studies of the ore reserves of Tara Mines Limited were carried out by the survey.  The survey did not break down the Bula reserves into proven and probable categories which, I presume, is the categorisation sought by the Deputy.  Following are details of the proven and probable geological ore reserves of Bula Limited and Tara Mines Limited as at 31 December 1985, as furnished to me by the companies.  Whilst the figures in respect of Bula Limited also reflect the position as on 31 March 1986, the Bula mine not being in production, the figures in respect of Tara Mines Limited are not available beyond 31 December 1985.</P>

In June 1983 the union changed the restructuring claim to a basic salary claim.  The latter claim is the subject of the outstanding arbitration finding.</P>

    <P>As a result of negotiations which I have had with UPTCS, agreement has been reached with that union on arrangements <Col N="1843" /> for the implementation of all their outstanding arbitration findings.  The arrangements take account of the special aspects of these findings.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides for a pay increase of 6 per cent for forester grades with effect from 1 May 1986.  The balance of the increase recommended by the arbirator will be paid on a phased basis from 1 December 1986, 1 December 1987 and 1 July 1988.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Government contracts procedures allow for both open and selective tendering for supply contracts to Government Departments. While the invitation to tender by open advertisement is adopted in most cases, there are instances where it is more practical to invite tenders directly from a predetermined list of firms.  Selective tendering or restricted tendering using lists are appropriate to specialist areas where an open invitation to tender would almost certainly result in excessive administrative costs and time delays.</P>
      <P>In certain areas therefore, lists of suitable firms have been drawn up from which tenders are invited.  Advertisements are placed in the press regularly inviting firms to apply for inclusion on such lists.  The lists are frequently revised so that they embrace the maximum possible number of suitable firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be impractical to dispense with this form of tendering.  My Department will shortly be issuing a comprehensive document on Government contracts procedures which will regulate tendering for Government business in <Col N="1845" /> such a way as to promote open competition and the encouragement of new and previously untried firms.  It is intended-that the new procedures will be published so that they will be available to all potential suppliers to Government Departments. It is hoped that this unprecedented step will be of benefit to firms in promoting a better understanding of tendering requirements and thereby result in greater openness in the Government contracts area.</P>

      <P>The main reasons for the arrears are:&mdash;</P>
