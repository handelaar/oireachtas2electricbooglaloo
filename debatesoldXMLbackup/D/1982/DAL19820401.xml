      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 2, 1 &mdash; Order for Second Stage followed by all Stages &mdash; and 7 (resumed).  By agreement business will be dealt with as follows: Supplementary Estimate for Industry and Energy, which is being introduced today, will be disposed of today; proceedings of all Stages of the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill, 1982 will be brought to a conclusion today; proceedings on the Second Stage of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1982, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at noon, while all remaining Stages which have not been disposed of at 5 p.m. shall be brought to a conclusion by one question which shall be put by the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Environment. The Dáil at its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 28 April.</P>

      <P>The Government have acceded to the Opposition's request to bring in a further three months stay of execution by way of a Temporary Provisions Bill on the rent restrictions legislation. Since the sense of urgency which genuinely existed yesterday morning when the Minister for the Environment <Col N="1212" /> introduced the Bill no longer exists, is it necessary to dispose of all Stages of the Private Rented Dwellings Bill today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the sense of urgency is as great as ever.  This is very much a fallback position.  In my view it is essential that this legislation go through both Houses before 25 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard what the Taoiseach said, but is it the Government's intention, within the normal conventions as were indicated in January this year, to suggest that the President might refer the main Bill to the Supreme Court?  If not, I do not believe that urgency exists.  The House is genuinely concerned at the difficulty in arriving at a just form of legislation in this very complex matter.  As the Minister said, this is the fourth attempt at providing legislation in this complex area.  In my view we are doing ourselves a disservice in trying to take all Stages today since the Government have acceded to the Opposition's request for a further stay of execution for three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have thought there would have been common ground on this.  It is absolutely essential that we get all Stages of the main Bill today.  It is not in our competence to say whether the President would refer the Bill to the Supreme Court.  From our point of view it would be infinitely preferable if he did not and the substantive Bill could come into operation straight away and the tenants would be protected from 25 April. It is only in what we hope is the unlikely event of the Bill being referred to the Supreme Court that the temporary provisions measure is being brought in to cover the intervening period after 25 April and ensure that the tenants will not be left completely defenceless.  There is no guarantee about the validity of the temporary provisions we will be introducing today.  One way or another, commonsense and prudence demand that we get the two Bills through before 25 April. I appeal to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already given the Taoiseach an undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I appeal particularly to the Labour Party to see the very serious dangers that are looming here.  Unless we behave with extreme circumspection and caution we could have a position where, after 25 April, tenants would be totally unprotected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider shortening the Easter Recess of 28 days in order to deal with this Bill?  There are a number of very important amendments which should be discussed by the House and we are not getting the time to do it.  Apparently, we are taking a month's holiday.  Would the House not be more responsible shortening that period to discuss the Bill properly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal course of events that would make sense, but in this case it does not, because we have a very difficult situation with the Seanad.  We have to get the Bill through the Seanad next week.  Therefore there is no point having this Bill put through the Dáil after Easter.  We must get it through this House today and through the Seanad next week &mdash; and even then it is a tight schedule &mdash; so that it will be in operation before 25 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to get into a dispute with the Taoiseach nor do I dispute his parliamentary experience, but the House will agree that this is the fourth attempt to get legislation in this complex area.  This is not simple legislation and we should not rush all Stages of the main Bill through this House if we can avoid doing so.  If we cannot avoid doing so, the Labour Party will co-operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If we pass the first Bill which is to cover the next three months, surely the same sense of urgency does not exist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it does.  This Bill we are introducing today does not affect that urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are we passing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very much a fallback expediency, but it is no more than that.  What is essential is that we put the Bill through today and that it go to the Seanad next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We wish to co-operate with the Government in this regard.  We hold a brief for the tenants in the main and we will do everything possible to facilitate the legislation, but in return we would expect the Minister for the Environment to go as far as possible in accepting the majority of the amendments we have tabled.  If we must have this foreshortened Committee Stage today we will expect substantial co-operation in relation to our amendments.  If the Taoiseach, without prejudice, can give some kind of assurance on those lines, we shall act responsibly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that some of the suggestions of the Labour Party would cause extreme difficulty in terms of the timetable we have, but what I would offer &mdash; and perhaps this could be discussed between the Party Whips or with the Leaders of the Parties if necessary &mdash; is that the House agrees to the procedure of putting both these Bills through as quickly as possible in order to safeguard the situation and that afterwards we could meet and decide what amending legislation, if any, would be desirable and would meet the wishes of the different parties.  In other words, to safeguard the present situation we would like the Bill that we have put forward to go through and become law and then after Easter we could look at the legislation and agree between us perhaps to an amending Bill in order to satisfy the doubts held by different sections of the House in regard to the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I agree with what has been proposed, but with one exception.  The Taoiseach seems to take the view that it would be preferable that the Bill be not referred by the President to the Supreme Court.  I respectfully suggest that, in view of the fate of the other two Bills and that at best in view of the amount of uncertainty which hangs over this Bill, it would be more preferable &mdash; this may not be the right phraseology &mdash; to encourage the President to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court for a decision so as to put the matter beyond doubt now rather than to have it hanging over for perhaps years to come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily disagree with that, but I think the Deputy will appreciate that the question of whether the President refers the Bill to the Supreme Court is one for himself.  I was only expressing my personal opinion that from our point of view the ideal situation is that the Bill be passed today in this House and in the Seanad next week and that it then become law rather than its being upset by the Supreme Court either by reference or by a subsequent challenge.  Falling short of that, I suppose Deputy Fitzpatrick is right.  It is almost inevitable that it will be referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> One way or another it will end up in the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the only reason for my expressing a preference for non-reference is that if the Bill is referred to the Supreme Court we will be relying, not very happily, during the period of referral on this rather tenuous Bill that we are passing today to save the situation. However it would be better that the main Bill become law and, perhaps, be challenged subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be concerned that we would not get into a discussion here on the merits of reference.  This is a matter that the President at his discretion must decide, having heard the Council of State.  It would be a mistake for us here, <Col N="1216" /> whatever our views may be &mdash; and these views may differ individually rather than on a party basis &mdash; to enter into public discussion on the matter of referral.  To do so could make the task of deciding on what to do more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's second formulation of his position is preferable to his first.  He seemed to be expressing something of a particular view.  We are all agreed that what would be best would be that the Bill be constitutional, but the question of what is the best way of handling the matter should be left to the President on the advice of the Council of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it, then, that we can proceed with these two Bills on my firm undertaking that after Easter we will meet at whatever level is decided appropriate to discuss the question of amending legislation to the main Bill for the purpose of trying to meet as many points of view in the House as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but without prejudice to our trying to debate amendments today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the House will comply with the normal legislative process and that the various amendments that have been tabled will be given proper consideration since it is desirable obviously that they be included in the Bill as it goes to the Seanad next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All I would say to that is that it be subject to practicalities.  What most people have in mind is some alternative by way of the District Court.  Our argument is very strong that there just is not time between now and 25 April to set up some form of satisfactory mechanism. In the meantime we must rely on the District Court.  But we are prepared, once this Bill becomes law and the situation is saved, as it were, <i>pro tem,</i> to <Col N="1217" /> consider all other alternatives for dealing with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Taoiseach's offer in the spirit in which it is made and I am grateful for it.  We can now proceed to look at this Bill again after debating it today, but the action that the Opposition side will take in respect of individual amendments will be determined, naturally, by the response of the Government.  If there are areas in which we are of the opinion that the Government could reasonably accept amendments, we will reserve the right to press those amendments without prejudice to the subsequent discussion of how we should proceed with the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but all the time bearing in mind that, if in our view whatever is involved is impractical in terms of the timetable available, that does not end the matter because it can be returned to afterwards by way of amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are we so restricted to April 25?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is in existence a saving piece of legislation which freezes the situation until 25 April.  That piece of legislation expires on that date and that is why we must have new legislation before then; otherwise, tenants will be totally at the mercy of landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach any intention of including on the Order of Business an item for the purpose of establishing an Oireachtas Committee to deal with the problems of marital breakdown and, if so, when he intends doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of an all-party committee is under consideration and is something that can be discussed. It will form the basis of discussion between myself and the leaders of the opposition parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The first intimation I <Col N="1218" /> had of the Supplementary Estimate regarding the budget for Whitegate was when I came into the House this morning. The decision on Whitegate was taken by the last Government, but the money being allocated should be debated here because there arise important and complex issues in terms of our energy policies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, could I ask the Taoiseach when we can expect the legislation to put the Irish National Petroleum Corporation on a statutory basis which is now of urgent concern?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, this is a financial accounting contingency.  The urgency was explained by the Taoiseach.  As the Deputy knows from his own experience, the sale of the premises of the Irish Refining Company at Whitegate must be finalised tomorrow.  For that reason the money must be made available.  The Deputy will have ample opportunity, as promised, to discuss this matter after the Easter recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the £10 million is required for the capital purchase of the premises and for the improvement of the buildings and installations.  I did not understand that this £10 million was part of a subsidy arrangement.  I understood it was to operate purely as a capital purchase and to improve and refurbish the requipment. I am at a loss to know where the subsidy comes in under this heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of a subsidy.  I am merely repeating the normal form of words for the introduction of a Vote.  This is the form of words used in these circumstances.  As the Deputy knows, the money is for the purchase of the refinery which was finalised on 12 March by my colleague the Minister for Industry and Energy who could not be here this morning, its refurbishing and its continuance until it goes <Col N="1221" /> into production some months from now. That is the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate for £10 million.  The reference to the subsidies is the normal terminology used in the introduction of such Estimates, no more and no less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have agreed to give the Minister the Supplementary Estimate on the nod.  I want to put it on record that the previous Government, of which I was a junior Minister with responsibility in this area, decided to purchase the Whitegate Refinery primarily because of the strategic value of the refinery in the context of our energy needs.  We did so after we received reports from consultants and experts within the field of energy.  The decision of the refining company to close the refinery last spring or early summer was unfortunate in the context of overall energy policy.  They did it for ulterior motives and for motives not necessarily beneficial to Ireland.</P>
      <P>After a deep examination of the problems and the advantages and disadvantages &mdash; and we should realise there are disadvantages in regard to the operations of the refinery &mdash; the previous Government decided, on balance, to purchase the refinery and up-date it.  I will leave the question of the long-term development of the refinery until we get an opportunity to debate the issue.  The decision was correct.  It was taken by the previous Government under Deputy Garret FitzGerald and with the support of the then Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy O'Leary.  One cannot ignore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is a new subhead in the Industry and Energy Vote which provides £10 million to meet the £5.9 million purchase price plus the cost of the continuing in existence of the refinery over the coming months and the carrying out of the refurbishing programme to get the refinery back into production at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; over this period of non-production.  Therefore, the Deputy will appreciate that there are some costs that will have to be taken into consideration between now and when it does go into full production.  The Deputy asked for an estimate of how long it would take.  Three or four months probably when it will go back into production and when a certain amount of the refurbishing has been completed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming the Supplementary Estimate for the purchase of this very important project. <Col N="1224" /> might I ask the Minister what is the position regarding the land adjoining the refinery at Whitegate?  Has the State purchased the land or was it disposed of previously by the oil company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his assistance.  The position is that some of the land has been disposed of by the other shareholders but substantial land still remains and is certainly adequate for any extension.  But the land to which the Deputy refers &mdash; I appreciate it is in the Deputy's constituency and that probably he is more familiar with the details &mdash; the land that was in course of sale is not part of this transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not mind pursuing that point raised by Deputy Sherlock. In the context of the long-term policy regarding stocks of oil the Minister should look at the land immediately adjacent to the refinery with the long-term view that, in the event that we decided to establish reserves of oil held on Irish soil, there may be the possibility of establishing a tank field there which would be of benefit to the refinery and to the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have ample opportunity of discussing this, as promised.  The only point I would make to the Deputy is that to be fair to the Members of the House and the Business of the House today, obviously if we are putting this through, on the nod as it were, this morning, this nod has already taken some time.  There is the discussion that has to take place and there is the important piece of legislation that is before the House today and about which all sides are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say finally to the Deputy &mdash; he made the point about the purchase by the previous Government &mdash; as a party in and out of Government our policy on the Irish Refining Company was made abundantly <Col N="1225" /> clear at all stages.  I have no doubt that all Cork Deputies of all persuasion, on all sides of this House, were in favour of that refinery continuing in existence in the interests of employment in the area, which of course is of some concern to all of us, but also because of the strategic value and importance of having a refining capacity within our shores.</P>

      <P>I was the only person present in the House this morning who saw the breakdown of the £10 million referred to in this Supplementary Estimate. I am saying to the Minister here that there is a grave question of confidence in relation to the Supplementary Estimate introduced here.  In the course of my budget speech I stated that the £10 million was only a fraction of what the refinery is going to cost the State.  I mentioned capital figures of £45 million to £70 million.  I mentioned operational losses of £20 million.  Therefore I am correct in saying, and I wanted to continue on the comment I made, that the whole truth about the cost of this decision of the State to take over an oil refinery and refurbish it &mdash; remember the figure &mdash; announced by Deputy Reynolds, Minister for Industry and Energy was £5.9 million is not yet stated.  We find this morning that it is £10 million.  We will find when the Supplementary Estimate in 1983 will come that we are talking about £35 million.  In that context as one who has always been preoccupied about supplementary estimates and the spending of taxpayers' money I have no apology to offer to any Deputy for saying that the whole truth about this matter has yet to come out.  I stand over that.</P>

I want to explain to the House that what was suggested here this morning by Deputy Quinn could not in fact work.  If the substantive Bill now before the House had the discussion on it postponed until after Easter, with a new Seanad coming &mdash; which I think will not meet until the first week in May &mdash; the Bill would be delayed until then.  The Bill would be signed into law or the Council of State, if the President so decided, summoned a week later, and a decision on this matter might not be reached until the middle or end of July.  We would then be up against the final date again and would have to go through the same discussion and introduce another temporary Bill.  That seems undesirable.  I am glad the Minister has taken the course that I recommended to him yesterday and we shall certainly put through this Bill very quickly this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the passing of the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance), Bill which will provide a degree of security for tenants for a further period of three months in the event of the Bill under discussion being referred to the Supreme Court by <Col N="1233" /> the President, on the advice of the Council of State, for determination as to its constitutionality.  That move was suggested by this side of the House.  The House is now being given some leeway in that eventuality and will relieve the worries and anxieties of many people who were concerned as to what would happen on 25 April in the event of the Bill being discussed not being signed by the President and being referred to the Supreme Court.  I should like to refer briefly to the context in which the Bill we are now discussing came before the House and deal with remarks made here yesterday. The Bill is necessary because the 1981 Bill was rejected by the Supreme Court. It was suggested in the House yesterday that in rejecting the 1981 Bill and finding it to be unconstitutional the Supreme Court acted in some sort of pro-landlord bias.  There was a suggestion that the Supreme Court was not doing what it has always done, acting objectively as a court judging an issue.  In this context I should like, as other Members have done, to dissociate myself from the remarks made about the Supreme Court in this context. I should like to put on record that I deplore the attack made on the Supreme Court yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court is an independent court whose members, since its establishment, have served the State well and fulfilled the constitutional duties conferred on them.  In making a determination on the constitutionality of the 1981 Bill the court was doing no more than it is required to do under the Constitution, to determine whether that Bill, in the light of the Constitution, protected the fundamental constitutional rights conferred on everyone residing within the State by that Constitution.  The suggestion that the Supreme Court was acting in some biased or blinkered way in dealing with that legislation is unworthy of any Member of the House.  It casts a doubt on the independence and integrity of members of the Supreme Court.  It should go out from this House that all Members have full confidence in the Supreme Court and in the integrity and independence of its members.  It damages <Col N="1234" /> the institutions of the State to suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>In the context of the remarks made specifically about the court's approach in the area of rent restrictions which we are concerned with today, I draw the attention of Deputy Quinn who launched his somewhat startling and totally inaccurate attack, to the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in 1982 on the 1981 Bill which specifically referred to the necessity to protect tenants as well as landlords. The court emphasised that legislation dealing with this area must provide for a balance between the rights of all those who are going to be affected by it. For some reason unknown to me Deputy Quinn confined his remarks to the fact that the court found that the Bill it was dealing with discriminated against landlords. The court also found that the tenants have certain constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>The court went on to say that in its judgment, on the basis that the landlords effectively were entitled to a proper market rent:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;on the assumption that undue hardship is likely to be caused in some instances to tenants should be made and that the question may arise whether such hardship would amount to an unjust attack on the property rights of the tenant contrary to Article 40.3 of the Constitution or would amount to an unjustifiable treatment of such tenants in contravention of Article 40.1 of the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The court went on to say that because under the Constitution it had already found one section of the Bill referred to it unconstitutional, it was not necessary for it to further consider the effects the Bill would have on the rights of tenants because it did not arise as the Bill was not going to become law.  The court stated specifically that because of the decision the court had already reached, it was unnecessary to consider the matter further. However, the court stated, having regard to the obligation imposed on the State by the Constitution to act in accordance with the principles of social justice, it recognised the presumption that any <Col N="1235" /> such hardship would be provided for adequately by the State.</P>
    <P>The court went on to say &mdash; it is worth bringing this to the attention of the House and the Minister &mdash; that it was not therefore necessary to pronounce upon any other provisions of the Bill it was considering. Earlier in its judgment the court referred to the fact that its decision may not, for the legislators who may have to consider the matter again, completely explain all the possible constitutional imperfections or difficulties in this area. I would caution the Minister in this regard.  It should go from this House that we recognise the impartiality of the judgments delivered by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has a very real and important function to perform in this area.  I take the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick this morning that when this legislation goes through the House there will be a doubt about its constitutionality and it was better that that doubt be resolved immediately than to leave it up in the air with a legal grey area for a year or 18 months while some private person litigates through the courts on a further constitutional action.  There is a need, in the interests of landlords and tenants, to ensure that there is no further uncertainty in this area and that the legislation that goes through this House is recognised as constitutionally able to deal with the problems that arise in this complex area of legislation.</P>
    <P>In order to bring about that assurance there is a need for a reference by the President &mdash; that is very much a matter for him, on the advice of the Council of State, to decide &mdash; of this to the Supreme Court.  I hope that in the event of this matter being again referred to the Supreme Court, no matter what decision the Supreme Court makes, Members of the House will refrain from the type of extraordinary attack Deputy Quinn indulged in yesterday.  It was unworthy of the Deputy who, apart from that attack, made a valid contribution to the debate.  It was a most unfortunate manner of dealing with the problem, attacking the Supreme Court in the way he did. It should be said that all too often our <Col N="1236" /> courts have had, due to the failure of this House to bring legislation up to date and take into account social realities and people's constitutional rights, to make decisions that effectively changed and liberalised laws.  Many of those decisions, no doubt, have appealed to Deputy Quinn.  I have not, in the circumstances of other decisions delivered by the courts heard him make such unwarranted and untoward attacks on the courts.  I hope Deputy Quinn, if he has the opportunity of doing so, will withdraw any imputations made in the House against the integrity of members of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the provisions in the Bill, in particular those which I feel could be improved in providing the type of balancing act we must provide in protecting the interests of landlords and tenants.  I hope the Minister will consider looking at the Bill in relation to two areas I shall deal with. Section 11 sets down the manner in which a court or a tribunal determining a dispute between a landlord and tenant may make that determination in the context of the terms of a tenancy.  The section states that the terms of every tenancy of a dwelling to which section 8 relates shall be such terms as are agreed between the landlord and the tenant or, in default of agreement, as shall be fixed by the court. The difficulty with that section is that it goes on to discuss in more detail the context of that.  However, the section does not &mdash; not does any other provision in the Bill&mdash;give the courts any guidance as to what terms should be proposed for particular tenancies or leases.  The only circumstance in which the Bill goes into detail is in the context of providing criteria for determining rent of tenancies.  It does not provide any criteria of any detail to guide the courts as to whether their terms and conditions should be included in tenancies, upon new tenancies having to be negotiated or conferred by the courts under the provisions of the Bill. The suggestion is that district justices, as the Bill is presently framed, should provide, effectively, detailed leases for landlords and tenants.</P>
    <P>The only criteria on which they are given any guidance is in the context of <Col N="1237" /> rent.  There is a tremendous degree of uncertainty as to how the courts will deal with it.  It is fair to say that the legal profession, having had an opportunity to examine the Bill, are considerably worried about how any tenant or landlord will be legally advised properly on what other types of terms should be included, or insisted upon, in respect of the conclusion of new tenancy agreements following upon the implementation of this Bill. The Minister should consider this aspect. In the event of this Bill being accepted by the Supreme Court as being constitutional, we may find that, due to bad drafting, we will have to deal with another amendment Bill very rapidly, in order to give the Bill some sense and make it operational in certain areas.</P>
    <P>In the context of section 11, I draw the Minister's attention to my point yesterday in the context of another section, that if the Minister intends by regulation to provide for minimum standards of rented dwellings, which is desirable, he should give the tenants of those dwellings a right of action against the landlord in the event of his failing to comply with such minimum standards.  I suggested this on the basis that the housing authorities will not have the capacity, manpower or finance to enforce the section of the Act relating to minimum standards.  Unless section 26, which permits minimum standards to be imposed, is given real teeth or made properly enforceable, it will be meaningless. In this regard, I draw the Minister's attention to section 11.  I have already suggested that section 26 and the conditions of tenancy and the condition of the dwelling be taken into account in determining rent under section 13.  Section 11 again states that every tenancy:</P>
    <P>shall be such terms as are agreed between the landlord and the tenant or, in default of agreement, as shall be fixed by the Court.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Whenever, after the commencement of this Act, the rent of a dwelling is increased by agreement between the landlord and tenant or by the Court, <Col N="1238" /> the amount of the increase shall not be payable until:</P>
    <P>(a)  the terms of the tenancy have been set out in written form and signed by the landlord or his agent and a copy thereof has been furnished by the landlord to the tenant, and</P>
    <P>(b)  if regulations under section 24 are in force, the landlord has complied with the requirements of such regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 24 is concerned with the registration of dwellings.  It is desirable that landlords be encouraged to register these dwellings to ensure that minimum standards are complied with and I congratulate the Minister on the provision that rent increases will not be payable by tenants to landlords unless dwellings are registered. I suggest that section 2 (b) should refer, if regulations under section 4&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was suggesting to the Minister that increased rental should not be payable to landlords who have not complied with minimum standards.  That section should, in addition, refer to section 26, as well as section 24.  That would do a great deal to improve the content of the Bill before the House.  In relation to the further sections of the Bill, as the Minister correctly says, a number of amendments could be made to the Bill. <Col N="1239" /> Most of these should be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I make one further general point. Under the provisions of the Bill, in the event of a landlord getting repossession of a premises as a result of a court order and in the event of a tenant being able to establish that the landlord had misrepresented or concealed material facts when the matter came before the court, the Bill provides that the landlord may be required subsequently to pay compensation to the tenant.  That is a matter which arises under section 19.  However, there is a curious omission from the Bill. If a landlord by deception gains repossession of a dwelling he may be required to compensate the tenant, but the Bill does not confer any power on the court to order the landlord to hand possession back to the tenant.  In other words, if, through false evidence, the landlord succeeds in getting repossession of a dwelling, it should be open to a court, upon that falsehood being established to the satisfaction of the court, not merely to compensate the tenant but to repossess him in the dwelling out of which he was wrongly put in the first place.  The Minister might consider making that a further amendment, which I have no doubt will be agreed to on both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>In the context of this area of legislation we must be conscious of the rights of both landlord and tenant.  It is very easy to take one side or the other and, as a consequence, produce imbalanced legislation which will have a very detrimental effect on the availability of housing within Dublin city, county and the rest of the country.  Landlord's rights must be protected, as must tenants'.  In the area of private rented accommodation many thousands of people depend on landlords to provide such accommodation.  We must be wary of adopting the approach of attacking landlords because they provide houses and dwellings for rent when this State is not in a position to provide the vast majority of people who live in rented accommodation with accommodation out of its own finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of ensuring that this legislation is easily enforceable, that the <Col N="1240" /> rights conferred on both landlords and tenants can be implemented easily and that it is not an unduly complex and involved procedure.  I turn briefly to an item referred to by other speakers, which will be discussed in far more detail on Committee Stage.  I seriously urge the Minister to consider adopting amendments proposed on this side of the House to meet the establishment of a private rented dwellings tribunal.  I do not believe that it would be impossible within the time available to establish such a tribunal. The type of tribunal being proposed is not a unique or difficult body to establish.  The prototype of the tribunal, the type of regulations which it would require, can easily be gleaned from the employment appeals tribunal.  The Minister has recognised and accepted that, within the present court structure, there will not be sufficient district justices or, in fact, facilities by way of buildings, available to take all the applications which will be made under this legislation. If this Bill is enacted then when it becomes operational the court situation in the context of the District Courts will be far worse than at present because on 12 May 1982 a wide variety of additional jurisdiction is being conferred on District Courts under the Courts Act, 1981.  The District Courts will be swamped with cases on different areas of law over some of which at present they have no jurisdiction and because the financial limits of the District Court have been so increased cases which presently can be dealt with only in the Circuit or High Courts will then be dealt with in the District Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends, under this Bill, to confer jurisdiction on the District Court which would, by itself, overload that court and, by the Minister's admission, so overload it as to result in the Minister's recognising the need to appoint additional justices.  This will happen at a time when the court will be overloaded and ill-equipped for the massive new jurisdiction conferred upon it under the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>It would be less disruptive and far simpler if the Minister were to accept amendments on the establishment of a rents tribunal which would give approximately <Col N="1241" /> one month to establish such a body.  The new facilities or buildings which the Minister suggests which would now have to be dealt with by a district justice could be dealt with by members of the rents tribunal. It would not be an impossibility or a difficulty to establish such a body.</P>
    <P>I hope that as this House is co-operating with the Minister in accepting the need to pass this Bill swiftly through the House before the Easter recess the Minister will treat the amendments put down on this side of the House with a similar degree of understanding, give them realistic and proper consideration and not reject them purely because they are amendments put down by the Opposition. I believe the Minister is personally committed to a rents tribunal; I have heard him saying so in this House and elsewhere.  I believe all Members of the House recognise the need for one and this Bill before us provides a unique opportunity to establish such a tribunal to deal with one area of rented dwellings. I hope, in the not too distant future, we will have a further Bill which will consolidate the law in this area and provide a more coherent approach so that all private rented dwellings will be treated in the same way, regardless of when they were purchased or when tenants moved into them.  I hope it will have general criteria applicable to deal with the totality of this area and provide for a tribunal such as a private rented dwellings tribunal with jurisdiction to determine all disputes between landlords and tenants.</P>
    <P>Before we provide that type of comprehensive approach we should establish a rents tribunal under this Bill to see how well it works and to afford an opportunity to extend its application in other areas of law affected by landlord and tenant in the context of private dwellings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The spirit of the Bill before the House is summed up in the first paragraph of the Explanatory Memorandum:</P>
      <P>....the Bill is founded on important principles in the Constitution, in particular the rights of private property and the role of the State in defending these rights....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the nub of the problem which bedevils any attempt by this House to deal with the rights of tenants and families and the scandalous rip-off of those people by housing and land speculators. This Bill sets out to achieve three basic <Col N="1243" /> aims, to decontrol immediately the rents of tenants at present in rent restricted dwellings, to decontrol over the next 20 years the rights of these tenants to possession of their homes and to pay out taxpayers' money, through the agency of the social welfare subsidy, a subsidy to private landlords.  This course of action has been forced on us by the Supreme Court decision and we are now being warned by representatives of the landlords that even the minimum safeguards being written into this Bill for the landlords' tenants will again be challenged in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Apart from the urgent need there is for this House to bring in this Bill and to prevent an open season on rent restricted tenants, it is becoming increasingly urgent that legislation be brought in to protect the thousands of private tenants who are living in uncontrolled rented dwellings and who are literally being mugged by grasping landlords who pay no tax.</P>
    <P>At present all furnished dwellings and residential lettings made since 1966 are uncontrolled and, therefore, in the vast majority of flatland areas there is no security of tenure, no rent control and no set standards for the accommodation provided. Furthermore, it is widely known that most, if not all, the rents received by landlords is never declared to the Revenue Commissioners.  A myth has been created by landlords of rent restricted dwellings who have agitated relentlessly for complete decontrol and have been instrumental in bringing the constitutional action which has brought about the present situation, that they are a minority who are discriminated against and have lost financially because of rent control.  It should be noted in this regard that a great many rent controlled dwellings were bought cheaply by property speculators who, having bought these properties for a fraction of their open market value, proceeded to indulge in extra-legal bullying activities to obtain vacant possession. There are cases in Dublin city where speculators bought rent controlled dwellings for as little as £7,000 while adjacent properties with vacant possession were <Col N="1244" /> selling for £60,000.  There are also cases in Dublin where landlords have used disgusting tactics to force tenants out of their homes, such as covering stairways with excrement, smearing doors with grease, spraying children's clothes hanging on clothes lines with acid, ripping off sections of roofing and turning off water and electricity supplies.  In short, these landlords have waged war against their unfortunate tenants over the past ten years, most of whom are elderly and in poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>The ALONE organisation will testify to the degrading conditions in which many of our old people have to live in these rent restricted houses.  This is going on while, in the majority of cases, the tenant has paid more in rent over the years than the landlord has paid to acquire these so-called rights.  Landlords who have just bought a dwelling have more rights than a tenant who has lived there for more than 50 years.  Clearly Article 43 of the Constitution which relates to the rights of private property and on which the judgment striking down the relevant parts of the Rent Restrictions Act is based, is far too favourable to the rights of private property owners and is weighted against the concept of the common good and of social justice which is also enshrined in the Constitution.  It clearly contradicts Article 41 which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>The rights of a family manifestly include the right to a home which is being denied to thousands and thousands of families by the court's interpretation of Article 43 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, an urgent need for an all-party review of the Constitution, to make some attempt to restrict the all powerful rights of private property owners. These rights run through our laws and are responsible for the restrictions that exist in many areas and for the failure in social and industrial development.  For <Col N="1245" /> example, planning authorities are literally coerced in many cases into disregarding the proper planning and development of an area because of the compensation clauses of the Planning Acts.  These clauses can be directly attributed to Article 43 of the Constitution.  The result is a transfer of public funds to private hands as is happening in this Bill.  The various Rent Restrictions Acts and landlord and tenant law in general have at best been a makeshift approach to the problem of controlling rents of dwellings.  In urban areas I understand it goes back to the time of the First World War when the British Government attempted to control rising rents resulting from a large movement of people from rural areas to the cities and who were being ripped off by the predecessors of the present species of predator landlords.</P>
    <P>Since then there has not been a rational attempt to provide social justice by regulating rents or providing security of tenure. As it stands, in the view of my colleagues and myself, the Bill has unnecessary weakness which we consider can be eliminated without raising Article 43 problems and, consequently, we have tabled a series of amendments to the Bill.  For instance, we believe there should be a rents tribunal with the power to determine rents.  We believe the landlords should be obliged to bring dwellings up to standard before any new rent would become payable.  We consider that the provisions under which landlords may recover possession should be narrowed and that the tenant should have his ability to pay the new rent assessed on the basis of the housing authority differential rents system.  We also suggest that the Minister should be obliged to make regulations in regard to the registration of dwellings, the provision of rent books and the prescription of standards.  In the Bill as it stands, the Minister has no such discretion. We believe that the compensation for tenants being dispossessed and evicted should be increased from the proposed two years' rent or alternative accommodation to five years' rent or alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>We welcome the introduction of the Temporary Provisions Bill which was <Col N="1246" /> announced here this morning.  It will extend protection for tenants for a further three months.  We on these benches as far as possible will facilitate the speedy passage of the Bill now before us on the clear understanding that we will be given an early opportunity to have the amendments which we have put down debated. I also ask the Minister to incorporate, where he feels it possible to do so without causing undue delay, any of the amendments tabled here today so that tenant rights will be strengthened.  I urge that an early move be made in relation to the constitutional problem.  Otherwise, that problem will be with us until we sit down to decide definitely that we will limit the right to private property in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I welcome the efforts of the Minister to bring this Bill before us today.  As well, I welcome the Temporary Provisions Bill, but with reservations.  My reservations are twofold.  First, we will not succeed in our efforts to overcome the problem that has arisen by reason of the unconstitutionality of the Rent Restrictions Act; and, secondly, this Bill leaves a lot to be desired from a technical point of view.  I do not think it will stand the test, even if it will survive the test of constitutionality, on technical grounds because its implementation will cause severe problems.</P>
      <P>In relation to the findings of the Supreme Court on the 1981 Bill, having studied the judgment in detail I feel that the court acted soundly on the basis of law.  The court's interpretation of the Constitution gave it little choice but to find the 1981 Bill unconstitutional.  I am afraid this problem will continue until we get to grips with the balance between the right to private property and the cause of social justice.  At the moment the Constitution allows for the right to private property to take precedence over social justice requirements, and until the Oireachtas takes up that task and allows social justice to have priority over right to private property we will not solve the problem in relation to rents of private dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the technical administration of this Bill I notice from the Minister's <Col N="1247" /> opening speech that he is aware of the problems now existing in the District Court without contemplating the problems that will exist there when a whole new area of legislation will come before the court later.  Does the Minister believe honestly that the appointment of extra district justices will get over the difficulties of accommodation and other facilities to cope with what I would expect to be a wave of new cases coming before the District Court?</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the implementation of the 1981 Courts Act, due to come into force on 12 May next.  This will further burden the courts system, which is already saturated.  I cannot see any possible way to have satisfactory administration of this Bill, given the present structure of the District Court, the present delays in that court and the delays which will ensue from the implementation of the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister agrees that a fair rents tribunal will be the only remedy and I think this can be done in a short time.  I suggest that in the meantime the Temporary Provisions Bill be extended for a longer period so that we can get to grips with the machinery of the Bill now before us in order to give it some chance to work, because I do not think it would work in its present technical form and anyway it would come up against the delays in the District Court to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I am hesitant to give approval to the provision whereby the Department of Social Welfare would be instrumental in dealing with the subsidies to tenants. That Department, like the District Court, are already over-burdened, and this provision in the Bill would put an obstacle in the way of tenants who would have to go to the Department of Social Welfare.  The Bill is sponsored by the Department of the Environment. Because each local authority have their own housing sections, I suggest it would be far wiser to keep this matter within the ambit of that Department so that it would be administered by the local authorities' housing sections.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the Bill <Col N="1248" /> rather weak in their construction.  For instance, the section excluding from protection persons with tenancies other than year-to-year contracts, who were hitherto protected.  I say this is unjust in relation to tenants who may have two-yearly tenancies.  Section 8 (3) deprives tenants who have taken assignments of leases.  I cannot understand the reason for that.  Because the assignees were protected by the 1967 Act, they should continue to have protection under this Bill. It is not clear from the Bill whether the section relates to past or future assignments. Of course it can be justified in relation to future assignments, but I cannot see the slightest justification for it being applied to past assignments.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 9 of the Bill, though sound in their intention, will confront us with the same difficulties in relation to constitutionality. The technicality in section 12, whereby a person is prohibited from reapplying to the District Court for a period of five years after the fixing of a rent, is unrealistic when we take modern circumstances into account and the possibility of a person's circumstances changing very rapidly at a time of high unemployment.  It is quite ludicrous that a tenant whose circumstances may change within a very short time of the rent being fixed by the District Court will still be bound to pay the same rent and not have liberty to apply to the District Court to have that rent changed in view of his changing circumstances.  Any fear that this may lead to frivolous applications can be allayed by having costs allowed against the applicant in such frivolous cases.</P>
    <P>There are certain terms in the Bill which will lead to a lot of confusion and difficulty for the people who are given the responsibility of interpreting and implementing the provisions of the Bill. Where the length of a tenancy is deemed to be a factor to be considered by the court in fixing a fair rent, the Bill does not clarify what weight should be attributed to the length of the tenancy or whether it could be used to the disadvantage of the tenant in the case of a tenant who has been in long residence.  The <Col N="1249" /> judge may take the view that, because the tenant had a long controlled tenancy and had been paying a reasonable amount, this person could now afford to pay a market rent.</P>
    <P>The failure to provide for the giving of specific notice of improvements by a tenant to a landlord will also lead to confusion. If we are to prevent a landlord being taken by surprise in a situation where both the landlord and the tenant are not <i>au fait</i> with improvements being done which need to be done, we should introduce a simple mechanism whereby a short form notice of improvements would be required to be given by the tenant to the landlord prior to the improvement being carried out.  Otherwise chaos will result.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;in the interests of good estate management&rdquo; is used in section 16 and the question of interpretation of that section is left to the courts.  But we have defined other terms such as &ldquo;planning and development&rdquo;.  The Minister should have specified the meaning of &ldquo;in the interests of good estate management&rdquo;.  If this term is interpreted to mean commercial and economic considerations we will end up defeating the purpose of the Bill, because if only commercial and economic considerations are taken into account the tenant will be put in a vulnerable position. The Minister should have specified what he meant, because we are well aware that what that term may mean to a landlord or estate agent may be totally opposed to what it means to a tenant of poor means.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provisions in the Bill allowing the court to make an order for possession.  I feel we should have provided that the landlord would be allowed to obtain possession of a portion of a dwelling.  It may be that in a situation that has arisen over a period of years where a tenant, particularly in a larger dwellinghouse, would not need the use of the whole premises and where the landlord was seeking to obtain possession, both interests could be adequately catered for by allowing for an order for possession of a portion of the building in question.  This would certainly provide for the needs of the tenant in situations <Col N="1250" /> where the tenant does not need the use of the full premises.</P>
    <P>I welcome the efforts of the Minister and his advisers in getting this Bill before the House.  But it should be borne in mind that the likelihood of this Bill surviving the rigorous test on a constitutional basis must be fairly slim.  We should not allow a situation to develop where there is going to be a grey area of law for some time.  Already notice has been served that this Bill will be challenged in the courts and we should hope that the most expeditious mechanism will be used to get this Bill before the Supreme Court at the earliest possible date.  However, as I said at the outset in view of the problem of the Constitution whereby the rights of private property gain precedence over the necessities of social justice, we are not going to solve this problem despite the efforts of this House.  I would urge the Government to set up a committee of the House so that all parties can be consulted and we can tackle the problem seriously.  I would humbly suggest that the Constitution be amended to solve the problems of rent control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief and I will abide by the suggested ten minute limit.  I first spoke in this House some seven months ago when I spoke on the first Temporary Provisions Bill.  At that stage I suggested to the then Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, when he brought the Bill before the House that the time given to it was likely to prove inadequate, so intractable was the problem we faced.  It is regrettable that that apprehension has proved to be justified. But I indicated at that stage that I was concerned because the Temporary Provisions Bill then introduced seemed to hint that when substantial legislation came before this House it would preserve the distinction between controlled dwellings on the one hand and uncontrolled dwellings on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That apprehension also proved to be justified, and I regret that that distinction is maintained in this Bill.  If this Bill becomes law tenants in controlled dwellings will continue to enjoy a bundle of <Col N="1251" /> rights not enjoyed by tenants in uncontrolled dwellings.  With respect, that makes absolutely no sense whatever, because the distinction between a dwelling that is controlled and a dwelling that is uncontrolled is entirely arbitrary.  It is a matter of historical chance if someone enjoys these rights or finds himself totally at the mercy of the market and totally unprotected by legislation.  It is a matter of historical chance whether a building was built before or after 1941, whether or not at any stage the landlord came into possession and what the poor law valuation of the premises happened to be, and it has nothing at all to do with the circumstances of either the landlord or the tenant. It seems that legislation that is grounded in the maintenance of that artificial distinction must itself be inherently flawed.</P>
    <P>Without delaying the House I would refer briefly to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Blake and Madigan case which was the judgment on the original Act and, in particular, to a portion of the judgment of Chief Justice O'Higgins.  He makes the point that:</P>
    <P>Neither the means of the tenant nor the lack of means or possible hardship to the landlord may be considered in determining the permitted rent.  It is therefore, apparent that in this legislation, rent control is applied only to some houses and dwellings and not to others, that the basis for the selection is not related to the needs of the tenants, to the financial or economic resources of the landlords, or to any established social necessity, and, since the legislation is now not limited in duration, is not associated with any particular temporary or emergency situation. Such legislation, to escape the description of being unfair and unjust, would require some adequate compensatory factor for those whose rights are so arbitrarily and detrimentally affected.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest that in preserving that illogical distinction between controlled and uncontrolled dwellings <Col N="1252" /> this legislation is similarly flawed and is similarly suspect constitutionally.</P>
    <P>The Bill that has come before the House clearly must go through today, because we all accept that legislation is urgently needed.  The Bill is inadequate in serving both landlords and tenants. When the Supreme Court considered the abortive 1981 Bill they had to stop as soon as they found one section which was unconstitutional.  They found that when considering the position of landlords. However, since the matter had been argued before them they gave a very broad wink and a very firm nod to the fact that tenants were entitled to expect more than they received from the 1981 Bill.  It is my contention that tenants are entitled to expect a great deal more than they receive in the 1982 Bill.  All they have is that the Minister for Social Welfare may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations.  The section is not mandatory.  There is no obligation on the Minister to make funds available.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies represent constituencies with substantial rent-controlled populations.  If people come along to their advice centres next weekend and say that they heard something about subsidies and ask how they are affected, the only truthful answer a Deputy can give is that he does not know.  He will have to say that he does not know if the Legislature has served their needs.  This is totally unsatisfactory.  Tenants are entitled to look for more than the possibility of a discussion between the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare.  They are entitled to more than the possibility that regulations may emerge from that and the further possibility that the regulations when drafted will cover their situation.</P>
    <P>However, a Deputy could guess at what their situation will be.  He knows that £6 million has been provided as a contingency measure in the budget.  A sum of £6 million was also provided by Deputy Bruton in his budget at a time when our legislation would have required tenants to pay only 40 per cent of the market rent.  Our Bill was seen as an unjust attack on the property rights of landlords.  If this Bill is to have any hope <Col N="1253" /> of standing up constitutionally it must be less of an attack on their rights.  If the Department of the Environment decided in January that £6 million was needed on the basis of tenants paying 40 per cent of the market rent, that sum will now be entirely inadequate.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed doubts as to the constitutionality of the Bill and whether it is workable.  I share those views particularly in relation to section 13 (2) which is really what the Bill is about.  The criteria for fixing the rent are laid out in that section.  They include the nature, character and location of the dwelling.  That should not give rise to any difficulty.  The other criteria are:</P>
    <P>...the other terms of the tenancy, the means of the landlord and the tenants, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord and the amount paid by him therefor, the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling and the number and ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling.</P>
    <P>One would not have to be very imaginative to realise the combinations, permutations or peculiar difficulties that could arise if one had a dwelling in an up-market residential area occupied by an impecunious tenant and perhaps owned by an impecunious landlord.  It would seem that only a court of Solomon could have any possibility of administering that section as it is intended.  With respect to the District Court as it is constituted, I do not believe it is a court of Solomon.  The background of District Courts in the areas of law with which to date they have been involved does not equip them to take on what is an almost uniquely complex task.  The demands we would put on any tribunal to deal with that section are such that it would be beyond anyone to conceive.  If we are to have any hope of achieving uniformity there is need to look at the idea of a rents tribunal.</P>
    <P>The legislation we introduced and which was found to be defective by the Supreme Court also provided that rent fixing was a matter for the District Court. There is a distinction between our legislation and this legislation.  The matter we asked the District Court to administer, <Col N="1254" /> what would a lessor give and a lesee take, is a legal test and one to which the court is competent to give an answer but, with the best will in the world, the test now suggested is one which no court of law has any experience of dealing with.  The Minister should recognise that and proceed to establish a rents tribunal.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the adequacy of the £6 million to be given by way of subsidy.  My concern is heightened by the Taoiseach's statement on the Order of Business today that he would not wish to see this considered by the Supreme Court on an Article 26 reference.  I cannot help feeling that there may be an element of thinking on the Government benches that if they get this through and provide £6 million this year, even if it does go to the Supreme Court and is successfully challenged in, say, two years at least they will have bought time.  Perhaps I am being unfair but it is a suspicion which starkly arises from the inadequacy of the funds being made available and the Taoiseach's firm view that it is not a matter to go before the Supreme Court.  If that is the case it is reprehensible and deplorable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the response of the Minister for the Environment during the debate and thank him for responding so quickly to the suggestion from these benches that a new temporary provisions Bill was required.  It is an encouraging sign of co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Short and to the point. The two broad categories of lettings and tenancies we have are broken down into what are loosely described as tenancies of business premises and tenancies of residential premises.  It has always been axiomatic that the greater degree of security and protection should be accorded to residential tenants by reason of the fact that the premises they occupy constitute their home rather than place of business where profit and so on could be made. We must compare the two types of tenancies and see what the situation would <Col N="1255" /> be were this Bill to become the norm.  A business tenant at present, if he has occupied that business premises for three years, becomes entitled as of right when that three-year period is up to a new lease for 35 years, subject to a rent and a five-year review.  At the end of the 35 years he is entitled to renew that lease again for a further 35 years and so on.  Therefore, his tenancy in the premises is potentially indefinite and can continue on an indefinite basis.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the comparable situation of a tenant who is seeking to protect his home.  The tenants we are talking about have been in occupation not for three years but for, 30, 40 and 50 years.  Yet we find ourselves faced with the proposal to decontrol their rents and take away the potential permanency of their interest. They always had a permanent interest under the rent restrictions code, which goes back not to the 1981 Act or the 1960 Act but to the 1946 Act and the 1923 Act. There are still in existence tenancies that came in and were controlled under the 1923 Act and were continued by the 1946 Act.  For all those decades those people knew &mdash; or they thought they knew &mdash; that they had a permanent vested tenancy at a fixed rent subject only to such variations as would be permitted from time to time in various rent restrictions amending legislation.  By reason of the continuation of their occupation at fixed rents for such a long time &mdash; 30 years and upwards &mdash; that, within the meaning of the Constitution, is a right to private property.  That right of private property was vested in that tenant, who was entitled to regard himself as having a permanent private property right in his home by reason of that very prolonged period of years.  Consider that a mere squatter on land who commenced his occupation as a trespasser becomes the owner after only 12 years in occupation.  Should not the tenant who has been in occupation for so many years at a fixed rent have the same permanency and permanent control of his tenancy as is accorded by law to tenants of business premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of a subsidy.  The one key factor &mdash;<Col N="1256" /> on Committee Stage I will ask for this to be spelt out &mdash; is that the subsidy will have to be available to a tenant suffering hardship &ldquo;as of right&rdquo;.  Those are the key words.  He must not be compelled to go to a social welfare or community welfare officer to explain his position, state that his income is that and his rent is that and to rely on that officer making a decision on the basis: &ldquo;I will consider the matter and I may or may not grant your application for assistance to meet your hardship situation&rdquo;.  That would be entirely unacceptable.  The regulations must be so framed that the person has a legal right to that subsidy and the manner in which it is to be calculated must be clearly spelt out.  I would like an assurance that the unfortunate tenant who has to go to that officer to seek this subsidy will not be met with the reply: &ldquo;You come here as a case of hardship seeking assistance, but that cannot be because under the terms of the Act the district justice was obliged to take your means into account.  Therefore, I have to assume that the district justice did his job and took your means into account; and, if that is so, how can you come to me and say that you are suffering hardship?&rdquo;  This is a potential catch-22 situation.  By the same token, when the district justice is considering the matter he might be entitled to say to himself: &ldquo;I do not have to trouble myself unduly about the criterion of the means of the tenant or taking the means of the tenant into account because a specific provision in the Act says that in the event of any hardship the social welfare people will take care of that&rdquo;.  I would like the Minister when he replies to give his comments on that.</P>
    <P>The Bill purports to give a limited security of tenure of 20 years.  That is entirely unsatisfactory.  The very least the tenant in that situation would be entitled to would be to put him in the same position as the business tenant who has been in occupation for only three years &mdash; in other words, give him a lease for 35 years. The residential tenant should have a right to no less than a lease for 35 years, renewable in the same way at the end of 35 years as is the business lease.  The lease ought to be assignable and saleable by <Col N="1257" /> that tenant, just as the business lease is assignable and saleable.  The tenant may wish to change his residence, and he is not obliged to be chained there.  He has a vested interest by reason of his very long occupation there and, if he decides to move or is constrained upon to move, he ought to be in a position to sell that interest.</P>
    <P>The whole structure and concept of this Bill when it comes into operation will give rise to a remarkable multiplicity of litigation and to the employment of solicitors, valuers, possibly barristers and perhaps actuaries because some of these requirements might call for actuarial assistance.  Certainly, valuers will be called for.  The tenant will require a valuer, as will the landlord.  The valuers will be giving conflicting evidence about the correct and appropriate rent applicable to the premises.  The tenants we are seeking to protect here are not in a position to gear themselves to meeting the organisation and the legal and valuer costings that are essential if their case is to be presented properly to a court under the terms of this Bill.  The Bill contains a limited provision dealing with the question of the costs, but it is entirely discretionary and inadequate.  It covers only an application by a landlord.  The tenant may get the costs.  Will his valuer's fee be covered?  Is he in a position to get a valuer?  Will the whole cost be paid?  And, so on.  It highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive free civil legal aid scheme.  This is a classic example of where tenants of rented premises should be in a position to call upon the services of a comprehensive legal aid scheme which will put at their disposal what they require urgently not only in terms of legal assistance but of the assistance of a valuer also.</P>
    <P>One wonders again about the advisibility of case after case being heard in the District Court with an endless procession of solicitors, valuers and landlords queueing for case after case.  It will be a bonanza for those who practise either on the legal side or on the estate agency side, but it will not provide an admirable system of justice or a fair and efficient result <Col N="1258" /> in its administration.  It would be far better to have a skilled tribunal which would have on its board of assessors a valuer or two who would deal with valuation aspects without having to call in separate valuers in individual cases.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the unfortunate district justices who will have to try to assess rents in these cases.  It must be remembered that a district justice may be assigned perhaps 20 to 40 cases in a day. Not for them the luxury of the Supreme Court in having several weeks available to go into the details of just one case. District justices have long lists of cases which they are obliged to get through.  In dealing with the assessment of a fair rent, the simplest part will be in regard to the nature, character and location of the dwelling.  The district justice will hear evidence on this point from the valuers for the landlord and the tenant and possibly split the difference between them. That is what used to happen under the old legislation.  He arrives at a figure and then proceeds to the next test relating to the means of the landlord; perhaps he will add something on account of that. Then he comes to the means of the tenant; perhaps he will take away something on this account.  Then he must consider the date of purchase by the landlord: maybe he will add on again.  At the end of this procedure one wonders whether the net result will be fair.</P>
    <P>My final point concerns the constitutionality of this Bill.  This House finds itself in a very unedifying situation because we are considering legislation which is under a cloud.  There is an unreal atmosphere because most of us feel that there is a very large question mark over the constitutionality of the Bill.  In introducing the Bill the Minister indicated that he had legal advice to the effect that the Bill was constitutional, but such advice was given also to the previous Government in respect of the earlier Bill.  The situation in which the plight of these unfortunate tenants is being bounced back between the Oireachtas and the Supreme Court would be comic were it not for the tragic position in which these tenants are left.</P>
    <P>The sensible thing would have been for <Col N="1259" /> the Minister or his predecessor to have brought in a holding Bill to freeze the situation for several months and state his intention of bringing in legislation and going to the country in a referendum to validate it under the terms of the Constitution. That is what must be done at the end of the day.  Why not do it now?  It would be remarkable if we had to bring in legislation on this matter some months from now and then hold a referendum. The Taoiseach has indicated that he intends to have a referendum on an issue which is not an urgent matter.  Could this provision not be combined with that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat at a disadvantage in speaking on this Bill in that most of the previous speakers are members of the legal profession.  I speak, however, as the representative of a constituency which has a large number of controlled tenancies.  I have an advantage in understanding the position in which tenants find themselves because at a very early age I faced eviction because of defects in legislation.  I have a certain affinity with tenants who will be affected but I also recognise that many landlords have been very badly affected by the present situation.</P>
      <P>In Cork many elderly people are being harassed by landlords to pay increased rents, even though they are still covered by the temporary Act.  I was informed this morning that the Southern Health Board have been receiving many calls during the past few weeks for financial aid.  Section 23 allows for the compensation of tenants who will be affected but I have been advised that present legislation in relation to supplementary welfare allowances will not provide adequate cover because the maximum payment allowed is £5.  I would ask the Minister for an assurance that this matter will be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unhappy that the Department of Social Welfare are to be given the responsibility for compensating tenants and I should prefer to see the responsibility formally laid with the Department of the Environment.  The budget provision of £6 million is clearly inadequate and <Col N="1260" /> should be closer to £14 million this year. I contend that when this Bill becomes fully effective the necessary figure will be in the region of £30 million per year.  The implications for the staffing of health boards must be considered, as must the embargo on the recruitment of community welfare officers.</P>
    <P>We must ask who is to receive the money that will be gathered from the taxpayers.  A number of landlords have been badly affected by existing legislation but many speculators, anticipating the introduction of new legislation, have bought up properties and are now awaiting a bonanza.</P>
    <P>Speaking last December on the previous Bill, I expressed reservations about the suitability of the District Court system for dealing with disputes between landlords and tenants.  I pointed out that 75 per cent of the people affected are over the age of 60 and that going to court will have a traumatic effect on them.  The courts have not the personnel or expertise to treat the problem in the proper manner and during the debate last December the then Opposition were anxious to have an alternative system.  I would ask the Minister to consider again the early establishment of a rents tribunal because this is the only way that people can be fairly treated.  I find it very difficult, because of my experience, to go along with this Bill.  I cannot agree with a Bill which has been drafted to accommodate a Supreme Court decision which has put the law of property before the rights of people and a decision which deemed unconstitutional the phasing-in of rent increases.  The Supreme Court decision is a dangerous one.</P>

      <P>We should not be drafting Bills to fit interpretations of the Constitution by the Supreme Court.  If the Constitution affects the lives and rights of people instead of drafting Bills, which I believe will be only temporary Bills, we should look at the Constitution.  I fully agree with the views put forward by Deputy Taylor that if this Bill is passed today it should be only a temporary Bill; the Government should have a hard look at the Constitution and examine if people's rights are being affected by it and if we find that people's rights are being affected an early referendum <Col N="1262" /> should be held on it.  I hope, like Deputy Taylor, that a subsidy is given to tenants as a right, that they will not have to go cap in hand to seek one.  I hope it will be given to them as a right and that the rights of the people will be protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I am sure that Deputy Cosgrave like myself wishes to bring to the attention of the House the situation which affects many of our constituents in Dún Laoghaire and South Dublin who are directly affected by this Bill.  I wish to confine my comments to three aspects of the matter.</P>
      <P>Many Members of the House have not paid due regard to the precise judgment issued by the Supreme Court with particular reference to the findings relating to section 9 of the referred Bill on which the Supreme Court has just given judgment. We should put it on record that the court has accordingly come to the conclusion that the provisions of section 9 of the referred Bill would constitute an unjust attack on the property rights of owners of controlled dwellings and would, accordingly, be a contravention of Article 40.3.2º of the Constitution.  The other vitally important section in the judgment of the Supreme Court relates to two other sentences in the judgment which states:</P>
      <P>On the assumption that undue hardship is likely to be caused in some instances, a question may arise whether such hardship would amount to an unjust attack upon the property rights of the tenant contrary to Article 40.3 of the Constitution, or would amount to an unjustifiable treatment of such tenant in contravention of Article 40.1 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The court dealt with that question and said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the decision the court has already reached, it is unnecessary to consider this matter further.  However, having regard to the obligation imposed on the State by the Constitution to act in accordance with the principles of social justice, the court recognises the presumption that any such <Col N="1263" /> hardship will be provided for adequately by the State.</P>
    <P>This is the nub of the judgment.  I want to take one final sentence from this very interesting judgment, which states:</P>
    <P>In the absence of any constitutionally permitted justification, this clearly constitutes an unjust attack upon their property rights.</P>
    <P>That is the question of the five years section 9 referred to.  I will repeat the sentence because this has been ignored by some Members of the House.  It reads:</P>
    <P>In the absence of any constitutionally permitted justification, this clearly constitutes an unjust attack upon their property rights.</P>
    <P>This brings me to my conclusion in relation to the judgment.  I firmly believe we need a referendum on the property sections of the Constitution.  The President has considered this Bill, the Council of State have considered it &mdash; I am a member of that particular body like the Ceann Comhairle &mdash; and the Supreme Court have considered it and found the matter to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but I am sure he realises that only 10 minutes remain and the Minister has to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish in two minutes.  We need a referendum to revise the sections relating to property in the Constitution.  That referendum must introduce a new section in the Constitution which, while recognising the basic rights of property, must also ensure that the State has the right to arbitrate in a socially just manner between the respective rights of property owners and tenants. The State has the right to get involved in that area.  That is the nub of the need for a constitutional referendum. I deeply regret that the Taoiseach has not seen fit to start the process of an all-party review of the Constitution because I have no doubt that successive areas of rent legislation and a range of other aspects of <Col N="1264" /> legislation will be affected by that particular section.</P>
      <P>I regret any attack on the Supreme Court and the members of the court on the work they have done.  The Supreme Court, the President, the Council of State and this House must act within the Constitution. I regret that any Member of this House should attack members of the court in the way it was done.  I am sorry time does not permit me to elaborate on this but I know that Deputy Cosgrave wishes to speak also.  We need to have a constitutional referendum on the question of property rights and the quicker that is held the better in the interests of the country.  The Taoiseach will have to bow to that.  Since apparently we are going to have referenda later in the year we should take the opportunity of having a referendum on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in bringing in this legislation as I did in the case of his precedessor.  As Deputy Desmond said, we may be trying to reconcile the irreconcilable. If this Bill is submitted at the President's discretion to the Supreme Court it may be that some part of it may be found yet again to be repugnant to the Constitution and we may find ourselves in this House discussing the question of holding a referendum to amend the Constitution, providing for the insertion or the omission of certain property rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are trying to achieve here is to continue the rights of tenants to have security in rent-controlled properties at a certain level and to give them security of tenure at some fixed rent.  On the other hand, in the light of the Supreme Court's decision we must recognise that landlords have certain rights.  I represent the constituency of Dún Laoghaire and in that area many tenants are wondering what they will face in the future.  There are also landlords who have been affected by this matter during the years.  No matter what we may say about some landlords who may have obtained exorbitant rents for dilapidated premises, there are many other landlords who have received only a token rent during the years.  Perhaps when the rent was fixed 20 or 30 years <Col N="1265" /> ago it was adequate but it is not adequate now.  The added onus on such landlords to repair the premises is totally ridiculous. One pound nowadays would not pay for the paint, never mind paying for substantial repairs.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the rights of both sides.  If a District Court decide that the rent is not adequate and that the landlord is entitled to an increased amount this House will have to consider giving the necessary protection to tenants, whether by providing some subsidy or alternative accommodation.  There will be major difficulties in this area as a previous speaker pointed out.  I should like the Minister to tell us if the decision of the District Court will be the final one.  Will the tenant concerned be put in the invidious position of having to go through a lot of red tape and of having to go through a means test in order to get help to pay the additional rent?</P>
    <P>Section 13 is very wide and is open to many interpretations.  Even if there are additional district courts provided, there will be several thousand cases to be dealt with and I foresee chaos developing.  I can see landlords being well represented and giving the impression that they are entitled to get the premises.  There will be major problems in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal of the Minister to extend the provisions of the Temporary Provisions Bill.  This at least will be some kind of safety net.  I think it would be beneficial in this case if the Bill were sent to the Supreme Court where I hope it would be found constitutional, although I have some doubts about this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who have spoken in the debate.  No one will argue that the problems with which the Bill strives to deal are anything other than difficult and complex problems. Unless provisions on the lines of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill are enacted, about 30,000 tenants and their families will be faced with great uncertainty about the future possession of the dwellings they have occupied for so long.  This Government are determined <Col N="1266" /> that measures must be taken to avoid the social disruption that would ensue.  There are those who suggest that rather than social disruption it would be social upheaval.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House is a balanced measure that is in line with the common good.  It gives reasonable protection to tenants and allows landlords a just and proper return from their dwellings.  The provisions in the Bill will redress the injustice landlords have endured over a lengthy period and which led to the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Perhaps surprisingly the Bill has attracted much comment not only in this House but in the media.  Representatives of the landlords have attacked the Bill on the grounds of the restraints it imposes on them.  Representatives of the tenants have taken issue with certain aspects of the Bill not to their liking.  The Bill is neither pro-landlord nor pro-tenant in its approach.  It is a balanced set of proposals that takes account of the constitutional advice available to the Government and of the terms of the judgment of the Supreme Court.  It is manifestly obvious that in face of the judgment of the court the benefits so long enjoyed by tenants of controlled dwellings could only continue for the limited period required to enact permanent legislation.  Equally, the Government have a responsibility in line with the pledge in the Constitution that the State should safeguard with special care the interests of the weaker sections of the community and to protect tenants of controlled dwellings, many of whom are among the poorest members of the community. The manifestation of the Government's concern in this regard is the provision in section 23 of the Bill for the payment of rent allowances to tenants faced with hardship in paying increased rents.  I shall come back to this later.  I will attempt to deal with the most significant points raised by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the previous Bill, the most serious question raised on both sides concerned the constitutionality of the Bill.  This is a matter to which the Government have given considerable attention and the advice available to them is that the Bill is in conformity with the Constitution.  The <Col N="1267" /> Bill has been prepared bearing in mind the criticism of the Supreme Court of particular aspects of the former code and the terms of the court's judgment on reference to it of the 1981 Act.</P>
    <P>Much comment was made on the operation of section 13 of the Bill.  Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> contended that the rent set must be the market rent if it is to be in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court.  I do not agree with this interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment.  That judgment held that the rent must be the just and proper rent, but what was unconstitutional was the provision which phased in the just and proper rent.  That there remained some discretion as to what constitutes a just and proper rent is a reasonable interpretation.  This interpretation is supported by the comment by the Supreme Court in its earlier judgment in the Blake-Madigan case that part of the reason the 1960 Act was an unjust attack on property rights was that the Act did not take account of the means of the landlord and tenant and this is taken into account in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> said about Deputy Quinn's attack on the Supreme Court.  I do not propose to go into detail except to disassociate myself from Deputy Quinn's unwarranted criticism. I also agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> that in legislating we must operate within the Constitution because we do not help the tenants by producing legislation that is unconstitutional. This imposes constraints on me in bringing forward this legislation, but I am optimistic that this Bill succeeds in being within the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Following from comments on section 13 it is natural to deal with the subsidies scheme.  As I said in my opening speech, I am not in a position to spell out the details but the Minister for Social Welfare, who will administer the scheme, will announce the details in the near future. In the normal course of events it would be usual for such subsidisation to be provided for in legislation sponsored by the <Col N="1268" /> Minister for Social Welfare.  However, because of the time constraints I have included them in this Bill.  Its inclusion is a major feature of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry asked about the budget provision of £6 million.  It is true that the January 1982 budget included a provision of £6 million to provide a subsidy scheme for tenants in controlled dwellings faced with hardship and paying increased rents, and this provision was continued in last week's budget.  Whether the £6 million will be sufficient to meet allowance payments this year depends on the number of cases coming forward for subsidy, the speed with which the rents increases are sought and secured and the amounts of the rents fixed under this Bill.  This is a matter on which the Minister for Social Welfare will be keeping a close eye.</P>
    <P>The formula for fixing rents under the Bill is totally different from that set out in the 1981 Bill.  This will make a difference in the amount required for the present year as the gross rent fixed will be lower under this Bill than under the previous Bill.  There need be no concern that the Government will not live up to their responsibilities to provide tenants suffering hardship with the assistance they need.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In bringing this Bill before the House I have been striving to achieve a solution to a difficult problem in a manner that <Col N="1269" /> would be fair to both landlords and tenants. I also had to do so in the knowledge that the time available was limited, given the 25 April deadline and the fact that the Government came into office recently.  It is not enough for Deputies to express concern about the plight of tenants; we must take positive legislative action.  No one can be happy while this legislative vacuum remains.  The temporary legislation does not provide a satisfactory solution to the problem.  If the constitutionality of the temporary legislation should be impugned &mdash; and action in that direction has already been started by landlord interests &mdash; tenants would be left in a very perilous state in the absence of legislation, such as this Bill.  I ask for the co-operation of the House, which has already been promised, as we go through Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate for their interest in this highly complex and controversial legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 26, to delete &ldquo;the District Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Fair Rents' Tribunal to be established by regulations made by the Minister under this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are discussing all the amendments which refer to the fair rents tribunal in whole or in part.  My party's submission is not very different from that made by the Minister when he was in Opposition and the fair rents tribunal was being discussed. We do not need to play party politics on this issue.  What we are arguing about is the practicality of its implementation &mdash; the how, where and when.  To that extent I will concentrate on our amendment No. 6.  We accept the argument of time constraints which operate within the framework of this legislation and against the background of the Supreme Court decision.  For the time being we will accept the District Courts because I understand the Minister has some points to make about improving the support system for those courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While discussing this Bill we should make use of this opportunity to refer to <Col N="1271" /> a rents tribunal which would enable the Minister to establish such a tribunal by way of regulation in an appropriate time, without having to come back to this House.  In view of the guarantee of co-operation that was put on the record this morning by the Taoiseach, we would be happy to be flexible on the length of time required in terms of our amendment to provide that the Minister shall within two weeks of the commencement of this Act establish such a tribunal.  There is all-party agreement on the need for a fair rents tribunal.  There are many ways in which such a tribunal could act, but we are anxious that it come into operation sooner rather than later.  Initially what we want the legislation to embody is reference to the District Court system with the proviso that the provisions of the Act be legally and properly transferred to the jurisdiction of a fair rents tribunal when that tribunal is established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>With specific reference to the amendments in the names of myself and some of my colleagues, and which contain far more detailed reference to the rents tribunal, I would make the point I made on Second Stage, that is, that I do not foresee the type of time constraint Deputy Quinn referred to.  The time constraint referred to by the Minister was primarily on the basis of this Bill coming into force on 25 April.  By virtue of the introduction of a Temporary Provisions Bill and resulting from the Minister's amendment which has been accepted in the context of this Bill now coming into force by way of ministerial order, the time scale position as before the House now is that this Bill need not come into force until 25 July.  Therefore, if this Bill is completed here today and in the Seanad next week and then signed by the President and if there is no referral to the courts, we will be in the position for a period of almost three-and-a-half months wherein the necessary procedures could be undertaken to establish a private rented dwellings tribunal such as that proposed by Members on this side of the House.  I suggest that the Minister seriously re-assess the proposal being made <Col N="1272" /> now in the light of that time scale.</P>
      <P>I would not foresee any difficulty regarding the establishing of a tribunal, of getting people to man it within a period of three-and-a-half months.  If the Minister genuinely accepts the need for a tribunal of this nature, I would ask him to accept the amendment in my name and in the names of my colleagues. Because of the detailed nature of the amendment we made, the tribunal is not one that would give rise to a great deal of concern as to what is required.  The prototype for it is to be found in the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  That tribunal was set up under the redundancy payments legislation and it works well.  It is a more informal forum than the forum provided by the courts.  It has worked in a number of ways a good deal better than the courts could have worked when formerly they dealt with the types of problems concerned.  The amendment before the House provides for the number of members that should make up the tribunal and provides the facility whereby the tribunal could meet in various parts of the country, just as the Employment Appeals Tribunal sit in divisions in different areas.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I urge the Minister strongly to accept the amendment. During the Second Stage debate I pointed out that this gives us a unique opportunity to provide a tribunal with a degree of expertise to mediate in disputes between landlords and tenants and to decide on such disputes while at the same time not involving either the tenant or the landlord in the type of expenditure that they would have to incur in the event of a court action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not envisage the present District Court system being capable of coping with the great rush of applications that will result from the passing of this Bill. Consequently, if the Minister must find new premises and appoint additional district justices, presumably in a temporary capacity which would mean that they would be people who would not have a great deal of experience of such work, I suggest that by far the more efficient mechanism would be a rents tribunal composed both of personnel who have <Col N="1273" /> legal expertise and of ordinary members who have expertise in this general area of rents &mdash; the fixing of rents and the valuation of property.  It is fair to say that Deputy Quinn is trying to achieve what we are trying to achieve except that his amendment is less detailed than ours and would leave the Minister to do by regulation the nitty gritty of what we propose in a far more extensive amendment.  I am convinced that if the Minister accepts our amendment he will have the goodwill not only of all Members in the Opposition benches but also of many on his own side who have expressed a commitment to the establishment of the type of tribunal in question, and that is a commitment that was expressed recently also by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister elaborate on what he said about the alternative accommodation he would provide for the District Court to decide on what would be fair rents?  He referred particularly to Dublin, but I expect that there would be similar problems in Cork, Waterford, Kilkenny, Galway and so on. If the Minister intends providing alternative District Court accommodation he should do so on a national basis rather than confining it to Dublin.</P>

    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister, too, what has caused him to change his mind since he was on these benches in December last.  I ask the question because the one point more than any other that he laboured then was the question of the capacity of the courts to deal with the cases that would come before them.  The Minister is on record then as mentioning between 20,000 and 30,000 cases per year.  He said it would not be possible for the courts to deal with such a large number of applications.  I had the view then, and I have not changed my mind in the meantime, that in terms of the legislation a case can only go to court after failure on the part of the landlord and tenant to reach agreement.  Consequently, I did not consider the problem of accommodation to be of the magnitude expressed by the Minister at that time.  In addition, the Minister expressed grave reservations then about the capacity of <Col N="1274" /> district justices to determine questions of fair rents.  In other words, the Minister was saying that it was far outside the qualifications of these people to make such decisions.  In the Seanad debate that followed there was a division on that point.</P>
    <P>We all accept that a fair rents tribunal is the ideal way of determining what fair rents should be and the Minister rightly referred at that time to the prospect of old age pensioners being dragged through the courts.  I agree it would be an experience for some of those people who were never in a courtroom before. The Minister made that point very forcibly. He referred to the delay in setting up a fair rents tribunal.  I believe there would be some delay and that it could not be done instantly.  I imagine there would be some problems.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister if the Government have discussed this and if they have taken any decision on it. Can the Minister indicate that this is a temporary measure only, while we await the introduction of a fair rents tribunal? I should like to get as much information as possible from the Minister on that point.  He was very concerned about it last December.  He made the point on more than one occasion and to such an extent that his party called for a vote on it in the Seanad.  An air of uncertainty exists so far as the Minister is concerned, and I should like him to clear it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer Deputies to what I said yesterday. I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of having rents determined by using rent tribunals instead of the District Court was examined.  In the time available it is simply not possible to set up such a system of arbitration however one might favour it.  It would take quite some time before rent tribunals could be fully functioning. This could not realistically be done in time to deal with the volume of cases that will arise immediately this Bill becomes law.  I should also mention that quite apart from any administrative difficulties there are also a number of legal and constitutional problems <Col N="1275" /> associated with the setting up of rent tribunals that need to be resolved. Once the problem of the controlled sector has been dealt with, I intend, as one of my priorities, to have all aspects of the setting up of rent tribunals looked at and examined in a comprehensive and constructive manner.</P>
    <P>Following on that and the discussions which took place here yesterday and the decision taken by the Government to introduce the temporary Bill, this morning on the Order of Business the Taoiseach gave categorical assurances to the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, Sinn Féin the Workers' Party, the Independents, and members of my own party who have expressed considerable concern about the question of rents tribunals.</P>
    <P>We are now talking about rents tribunals as such rather than fair rent tribunals. We are tied by the Supreme Court decision in the Blake-Madigan case and the decision on the 1981 Bill, and we are talking about rent tribunals to deal with just and proper rents rather than fair rent tribunals.  This morning the Taoiseach gave firm guarantees that, if this Bill is passed today in its present form, immediately after the Easter recess discussions can take place at Whips level, or at party leaders level, or some other level to be decided, perhaps between spokesmen on the Environment and myself, on the whole question of the introduction of rent tribunals.</P>
    <P>The views I expressed in December when this issue was being discussed in this House have not changed.  We must find a way to remove the level of fear and intimidation which the courts and the atmosphere of the courts may create for many old people who never had anything to do with the courts.  With the time constraints on me, the only way I can go forward at this stage is through the District Courts.  It has been suggested that, since the temporary Bill has been passed, there is no great urgency about the permanent legislation and consequently we could introduce a tribunal.  I should like to correct that false impression.  Already in the courts there is a challenge to the <Col N="1276" /> temporary legislation.  There is also the possibility that this new temporary Bill may be referred to the Supreme Court. An extension of the temporary Bill increases the risk that it will be found unconstitutional.  Were this to happen, the position of the tenants would be very serious indeed, and the options open to the Government would be severely limited. Accordingly, it is imperative that the permanent Bill should become law at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I said &mdash; and I want to say it again as clearly as I possibly can &mdash; that my difficulty about rent tribunals is the time factor involved.  I give a firm commitment to the House that, as soon as this legislation is passed, the discussions to which the Taoiseach referred this morning will take place either at party leader level, at Whip level, or between myself and the Environment spokesmen of the various parties. We can sit down and discuss the form of the tribunals.  I cannot do it now because of the time constraints.  My fear is that I may leave the tenants involved without cover.</P>
    <P>I do not want to become political in any way about this.  We all share the same deep concern about the problem of protecting the tenants.  Deputy Creed raised the point that I made comments about rent tribunals when I was on the other side of the House.  I still hold those views. I want to remind Deputy Shatter that, as reported at column 1501 of the Official Report of 9 December, he said it was fair to say that in the amount of time available and in view of the speed with which this Bill would come into force it would not be possible to set up rent tribunals.  At that stage his party had been in office for six months.  I have been in office for one month.  I do not want to be partisan because it is an issue which unites us all. We all share the same feelings about this issue.  We want to provide the best protection we can for the tenants while, at the same time, being fair to the landlords and the interests of the landlords.  In the time available the District Courts system is the only system that can work.</P>
    <P>On the question of the additional district justices and the type of premises in which they will be sitting, I said yesterday <Col N="1277" /> that the Government had made a decision about the appointment of a number of extra district justices in the Dublin area, and that they would be sitting in buildings away from the courts buildings, to remove the level of intimidation and try to get as near to the atmosphere of a tribunal as possible.  I do not want to be held to the letter on this but, because of the nature of this debate, I should inform the House what the Government have in mind.  The idea is that two district justices will be appointed.  The premises the Office of Public Works are looking at for us at this stage is the old Dolphin Hotel building.  That is in the Dublin area. There will be some other smaller courts in the Dolphin Hotel as well.  They will be away from the Four Courts complex.</P>
    <P>The reason I specified Dublin had nothing to do with the capital versus the rest of the country.  Nobody has any precise knowledge of the exact number of tenants involved.  The Private Tenants' Action Group suggest that the figure may be about 30,000.  It is an imprecise number. It is generally recognised that for obvious reasons the numbers will be greater in the major cities.  I guarantee to the House that a similar situation will prevail in the major centres of population. I do not say it can be done in every District Court area.  I guarantee to the House that I will look favourably at Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and other areas.  If I leave out any major city or town I am sorry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the commitment given this morning.  We are presented with a unique opportunity not only to stitch it into the record of the House but also to stitch it into this Bill. Perhaps I could suggest a formula that we might, on the nod, put through on Report Stage this evening because that time limit is there.  The House is obviously agreed on the need for a rents tribunal, so we strike the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; from it.  We have, under section 3, the power to do this by way of regulation. Why take up the time of this hard-pressed House by coming back with more legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to handle that regulation question.  I am trying to give as much information as I can to the House on this question so that we can all be at one on it.  The how, the where and the when of the tribunal was asked by Deputy Quinn.  He suggested that the tribunal should be set up by regulation.  The difficulty with the tribunal being set up by regulation is that under this Bill the courts will be looking not just at the rent &mdash; there are other issues, the terms of tenancy as well as the rent &mdash; and there are constitutional difficulties there.  I feel that that would be a matter of such importance that it should be discussed here in terms of a Bill rather than by regulation.  It would be the simple way out for the Government of the day at any time to do it by regulation but I do not honestly believe that it would be in the best interests of the community that a body as important as a tribunal should be set up by regulation.  Even if I did it by regulation, any regulation under this Bill has to be there for 21 days and only if it is invoked; then it becomes effective and will be back-dated to the date it was signed anyway.  I feel it is such a major issue, with all sorts of implications, that it would be right and proper that it be here as a Bill setting up tribunals rather that than be dealt with by regulation of the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock made the point that, in the time, I would have to find premises and so on for the district justices anyway, and that there would be problems in finding accommodation.  Even if I set up a tribunal today I will still have to find accommodation for that tribunal and face the difficulties which will be encountered there.</P>
      <P>I honestly believe that the best way forward is our shared view with regard to tribunals.  I do not necessarily agree with the way it is being done, or under direct call from the employment agency, or the tribunals.</P>

      <P>I do not necessarily agree that that is the way forward. What I do think is the best way forward <Col N="1279" /> is that we all sit down together and establish what is the best way forward.  I would appeal to the members of all parties in the House today to follow the course I am suggesting and on which they got a guarantee from the Taoiseach this morning. It is a firm guarantee which I once again solemnly give to this House &mdash; that that is the way forward.  I will see to it and give the House that guarantee.  It is not a political point, it is not a party political issue, what we are talking about is acting in the best interests of the tenants, also in the interests of the landlords, but in the best interests of the tenants who would be left unprotected unless we pass the major Bill we have.  I am already grateful to Members for their co-operation on the Temporary Bill.  But that is constitutionally on very thin ice and I would appeal to Members to follow the line of approach I have just outlined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that commitments were given by various parties over a long number of years to bring in rents tribunals to order the rents and possession of tenancies by all tenants, both controlled and uncontrolled, and the failure by any party to bring in legislation to that effect, would the Minister consider broadening his commitment at this stage to a rents tribunal which would cover uncontrolled tenancies also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are going into a different matter altogether.  That is a matter that needs great consideration and decision by Government.  I could not give a commitment like that here on the floor of the House.  The national implications of that for the Exchequer, for the housing stock and other matters is something that would require detailed consideration and I would not be in a position to give that commitment here today. However, I will once again reaffirm the commitment to a rents tribunal on the basis of this particular set of tenants affected by the Bill before us today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just make the point that the Fianna Fáil Party are on record as saying that they would bring in <Col N="1280" /> a rents tribunal to cover uncontrolled tenancies.  I am simply asking the Minister at this point to broaden his commitment to the tribunal in this Bill to include a discussion in that area when the parties are brought together afterwards.</P>

      <P>The other is a much wider and broader question that would require full Government discussion, consideration and is something that I would be pleased to discuss with the Deputy and his party, or any other Deputies, in the future.  But the matter we have before us today is the passing of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's comments, firstly, in the context of the provision of a rents tribunal, the Minister still has not dealt with the point that, as a result of the Temporary Provisions Bill, together with the first amendment to this Bill, it was accepted that there would be a period of three months to three and a half months to establish a rents tribunal.  That point has not been dealt with in the context of the provision of premises, just as the Ormond Hotel or the premises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Dolphin Hotel to which the Minister referred.  Just as a District Court could be established to operate on an informal basis, so equally could a rents tribunal be established within the time period.  If additional district justices are to be appointed there is not a great deal of difference between their appointment and the appointment of the chairman and vice-chairman of the form of tribunal we have suggested which is a similar tribunal in the context of the provisions that would apply to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The provisions are not identical, they are quite different in some respects; that merely provides a prototype.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> Might I ask the Minister again to consider those points.  In addition &mdash; and I would put it on the record of this House &mdash; I do not believe that two additional district justices appointed for Dublin will serve the purpose, certainly not in the initial stages of the provisions of this Bill coming into operation.  But even if they did the Minister still has not clarified the other aspects of the reasons for a rents tribunal.  The Minister referred to the fact that, on the previous Bill I stated that it was not possible to set up such a tribunal. Also on the debate on the previous Bill, in the Bill produced by my own Minister, I said I was disappointed &mdash; and it is on the record of the House equally &mdash; that that Bill was not providing for a rents tribunal.  But I believe a rents tribunal is required to render this Bill operational because of the criteria section therein for determining rents.  Those criteria are quite different from the criteria laid down in the 1981 Bill that was found to be unconstitutional, which were far wider criteria, far more imprecise and very difficult to interpret and apply.  If district justices throughout the country are to operate it there will be a lack of uniformity of approach.  The advantage of a rents tribunal is that we would have that uniformity of approach within the context of a rents tribunal, with a chairman who could, to some extent, co-ordinate the operations of that tribunal to ensure that there was uniformity of approach.  That is another reason why a rents tribunal is required more under this legislation than under the previous legislation.</P>
    <P>Even if section 13 is found to be constitutional I do not believe it will be workable. It will be very difficult to work and it would be far easier for a body with expertise in the area to operate it than it would be for the ordinary courts.  There is a further reason for a tribunal in the context of legal costs that both landlords and tenants would have to incur in going to District Courts, in particular the tenants, the vast majority of whom will not be able to afford court proceedings.  They will not be able to pay fees to estate agents for valuations of property or dwellings or pay these agents' fees to come to court to give evidence as to what <Col N="1282" /> the proper rent should be.  The reason for a rents tribunal is that it would ameliorate that problem particularly in the interests of the tenant.  If one had a rents tribunal with a degree of expertise there would be an easing of the burden imposed on the tenants in this area.  I ask the Minister to consider that further as a reason for incorporating in this Bill the establishment of a rents tribunal.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to reply to something I raised on Committee Stage. Whether or not this Bill is operational through District Courts or tribunals tenants will need to be legally represented. The vast majority of landlords will be able to afford legal representation although a minority will not &mdash; we all know of some extreme cases &mdash; but in the vast majority of instances tenants will require legal representation and will be unable to afford it.  Would the Minister be able to confirm to the House if he had a discussion with the Minister for Justice and if it is intended to extend the legal aid scheme to tenants in this case who are affected by this Bill whether proceedings are brought before tribunals or courts? Would he also clarify &mdash; I think this is relevant to the tribunal &mdash; if these matters are to be dealt with by courts will the legal aid scheme foot the bill for tenants getting professional advice that they may require from an estate agent or architect?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to put on the records of the House what he suggests are constitutional objections to the establishment of a private rented dwellings tribunal.  Whenever there is a suggestion of reforming any area of law in any way that smacks of originality or a different approach, some lawyer somewhere suggests it might be unconstitutional.  I suggest that a private rented dwellings tribunal is no more likely to be found unconstitutional than is the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the vast panoply of other tribunals that we have.  I ask him to state in what way he suggests such tribunal would be unconstitutional.  If there are doubts about it I suggest with respect that there are far greater doubts about the constitutionality of certain other provisions in this Bill.  If the Bill is referred by the President to the Supreme Court, <Col N="1283" /> as I believe it may be, that would equally afford the opportunity to him of having the constitutionality of the tribunal dealt with also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again we have this three-and-a-half months because of the temporary Bill.  I thought I had answered that earlier.  I would remind Deputy Shatter of section 1(2) of the temporary Bill which says:</P>
      <P>This Act shall have effect until the 25th day of July, 1982, or the date of the commencement of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, whichever first occurs, and shall then expire.</P>
      <P>If the President signs this measure, as I hope he will, the temporary Bill falls and the permanent Bill which we are now discussing comes into operation.  It will be my intention to bring it into operation immediately the President signs it as I feel that this is the best protection for tenants and they deserve the best protection we can provide.</P>
      <P>On the question of lack of uniformity of decisions of district justices there could equally be a lack of uniformity in decisions of tribunals and I do not want to get into a discussion in that area.  I have already accepted and I confirm the guarantee given by the Taoiseach on the Order of Business.  This is a matter that only time itself can resolve.  Time constraints on the passing of the Bill prevent us from setting up tribunals at this stage. A number of constitutional matters have to be cleared up.  In addition there are some questions regarding rights between landlords and tenants and these problems must be cleared up also.</P>
      <P>Tenants will be entitled to have access to free legal aid.  Also, as regards costs, I remind the Deputy that under section 12(6) of the Bill the landlord will be liable for the tenant's costs reasonably and necessarily incurred arising out of an application by a landlord to the court unless the court on consideration of all the circumstances, including the means of the landlord and the tenant otherwise orders.</P>

      <P>We are trying to get through 23 sections before 5 o'clock with an hour for Question Time.  We have a clear commitment from the Taoiseach that he will be reasonable and talk to us, which I accept.  We have a unique opportunity for that commitment given on the Order of Business to be stitched into this Bill in a formula on which we can all agree.  We shall have an hour at Question Time in which the Labour Party and, I am sure the other parties on this side of the House, will be quite ready to sit down with the collective expertise of the Minister's Department and incorporate a formula for an amendment of the Bill which can be taken on Report and which will enable the provisions of this Bill when it becomes law to be handled initially by a District Court until such time as a tribunal is established and enable the tribunal to be established, preferably by way of regulation.  It would appear from the record of the Minister's eloquent speech in the House before Christmas, in which he is personally very much in favour of this, that we can do it by regulation.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that it is a long process to get legislation on to the floor of the House and if he is talking about the on-going internecine war between the Department of Social Welfare and his own Department in relation to it will be even longer.  On behalf of the tenants that we believe we represent in the main we have offered full co-operation with the Government in this matter.  That offer was made without prejudice to our right to press amendments in the House on Committee Stage and I want the Minister to be clear about that.  The Minister now has a unique opportunity to demonstrate on green paper as distinct from the black and white paper of the record of the House, the limit to which his co-operation will extend in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to say if he is prepared during Question Time to negotiate an agreed formula for an amendment to be taken on Report Stage which will meet the requirements of Deputy Shatter, as a legal Deputy, Deputy De Rossa of Sinn Féin the Workers' Party and certainly the <Col N="1285" /> Labour Party in regard to two things, that initially the provisions of the Bill will apply to the District Court but in time will be extended to a rents tribunal and that the form and shape of the tribunal may be prescribed by regulation and that the Minister will put on the record of the House his commitment to consult formally with Fine Gael, Sinn Féin the Workers' Party and ourselves, the Labour Party, in that regard.  That is the nub of the matter.  Either the Government are prepared to give substance to the formal undertaking of co-operation given by the Taoiseach earlier today or they are not.  The Minister has had sufficient time for consultation with his own people today to be able to respond on his own behalf and on behalf of the Government to the request I have made.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to the House we are going over old ground about which there is not much disagreement.  We are arguing about tactics and strategy rather than the substance of a type of tribunal.</P>

      <P>I would not have thought that the Deputy's remarks in relation to the Supreme Court were either well intentioned or <i>bona fide.</i> However, I do not wish to be drawn down that cul de sac.  I can see the proposal put forward by Deputy Quinn leading to chaos and confusion.  I can see great difficulties in the proposition that between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. the Minister and the Deputy would cobble together an amendment.  That would fly in the face of what we are trying to achieve, a balance between the rights of the landlord on the one hand, and more particularly, the rights of tenants.  We are talking about 30,000 of our citizens.  I will strongly resist any effort by the Minister, or Deputy Quinn, or any other Member, to get together in the privacy of a room to prepare an amendment which I would not be party to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> In relation to the question of introducing rents tribunals by regulation, I understand that we will have to introduce a Bill to establish the structures of such tribunals. At the best of times the introduction of legislation by regulation is a form of subterfuge to avoid a discussion on aspects of the law.  As a matter of principal I object to such fundamental legislation as promised by the Minister being introduced by regulation.  A Bill setting out clearly the membership, functions and status of such a tribunal &mdash; Deputy Shatter also mentioned the question of costs in relation to the appearances of tenants at such hearings &mdash; should be introduced so that the House can discuss all aspects of it.  I see the introduction of a fair rents tribunal by regulation as a sly form of introducing legislation.  The Minister should resist Deputy Quinn's suggestion, well-intentioned though it is.  It is not my intention to be disrespectful to the idea put forward by the Deputy but I do not agree with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews has just expressed my thoughts on the matter.  The whole question of rents tribunals is a fundamental one.  Such tribunals will decide on rent and other matters that arise between landlords and tenants and I do not believe the way to handle them is by regulation.  It would not be doing justice to the tenants, or to the House.  It is wrong to suggest that the matter is being put on the long finger.  I have introduced this legislation within three weeks of taking up office.  Section 13 (2) is very much my own idea as are the social welfare elements of the Bill. The Taoiseach gave a firm commitment this morning to have constructive discussions as soon as the legislation is passed and I have stated that that holds.  I accept Deputy Quinn's <i>bona fides</i> in this matter, that he wants to nail it into the Bill. However, enough constitutional questions have been raised about the Bill today and in various newspaper reports that we do not need further complications such as setting up tribunals by regulation. That would only give further ammunition to those outside the House to suggest that the Bill is unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> I appeal to all Members not to divide the House on this issue.  The House has been given as solemn a guarantee as can be given by a Government by the Taoiseach and myself about this.  I intend to stand over that guarantee and I do not think the suggestion made will help those we are trying to assist.  I give an assurance that in the next session of the Dáil, at the earliest possible opportunity the legislation on rents tribunals will be brought forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I reluctantly rise to add to this debate because I have stitched into the back of my head clearly memorised assurance after assurance about legislation being under review in relation to the Kenny Report and other things.  I do not doubt the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister but to get the legislation concerned through he must go through the office of the Attorney General, the 14 other Departments and the Cabinet.  I have some outside knowledge of the number of hurdles he has to get over in order to get a Bill before the House and therefore, I am sorry that I cannot agree with the Minister. The provisions of the Bill would stand the District Court for the time being.  That court, now housed in the former Dolphin Hotel, would be the initial instrument for dealing with such matters. A formula of words could be worked out &mdash; Deputy Andrews is welcome to participate in that work &mdash; so as to accommodate all the arguments put forward in relation to this matter.  The Minister has the wherewithal to deal with this matter on foot of the commitment given by the Taoiseach.  We are not asking for very much and we are responding to the request for co-operation here.  We could press many amendments in relation to this but the appeal from the Minister is that we do not press any of them.  I should like to see something coming from the other side of the House in substance as distinct from words because the Minister is not, in his capacity as Minister, capable of delivering the things he is offering formally to the House.  It depends on the legal advice of his Department, the advice of the Attorney General's office <Col N="1288" /> and the co-operation of the Government. We should not be naive about this.  The Minister has the capacity and power to go halfway down the road to meet what I believe is a reasonable compromise.

      <P>The Deputy has asked me to go one step forward but I have not only done that but I have gone miles down the road with the Deputy and others in regard to commitments on the setting up of rents tribunals.  This morning the Taoiseach also gave such a commitment. He specified a time when it would be discussed.  He did not refer to the future or say that the matter was under review.  He specified the type of discussions which could take place.  If I recall correctly, the leader of the Opposition party, Fine Gael, accepted the type of discussions offered, while at the same time reserving his position with regard to possible amendments.</P>
      <P>It would be the simplest thing in the world for me to cobble together some kind of amendment agreeing to the setting up of tribunals under this Act in the District Courts, but that is not good legislation.</P>

I will put forward my proposals and bring before this House in the next session, and as early as possible in the next session, legislation with regard to rent tribunals as they effect the groups of tenants involved in this legislation.</P>

      <P>What we are talking about here is trust as between members of the Government and of the Opposition. I was not here this morning when the Taoiseach gave a similar undertaking that we would have the type of legislation which we all want, namely, a rents tribunal. I will call it a fair rents tribunal, despite the remarks in that regard.  I know that the title of it would be the rents tribunal, but I would like to see it as a fair and equitable rents tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to Deputy Quinn's piece of illogicality, with respect, on the one hand he complained about this complete Bill being passed in three and a half hours and, on the other hand, he is prepared to go into some smoke-filled room in some <Col N="1290" /> part of these premises to discuss the possibility of an amendment introducing the fair rents tribunal in the space of an hour. I find that a very tenuous and thin argument, indeed, apart altogether from the fact that we would not have an opportunity of discussing the proposed amendment by Deputy Quinn in association with the Minister, who has properly resisted any such proposal.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to take into account the interests of the 30,000 people, both tenants and landlords, affected.  This legislation will be operative so long as there is no rents tribunal.  When we come back to the House with legislation setting up the rents tribunal then we can abandon the proposals under this Bill, but not until then.  There is undoubtedly, a matter of extreme social urgency involved here. We are talking about social justice for the many tenants seeking justice from this House.  We will be abandoning them in their hour of need if we do not now accept the Minister's proposals.  I am not saying that as a backbencher of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Members recognise me as being an independent-minded person. I am not, in any way, being sycopathic in regard to the Minister or the Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; that has never been my style.  I take the view that this legislation is urgently required in the national interest and in the interests of those affected.</P>
    <P>If I may conclude on a different tack, there is nothing wrong with the District Court as it is constituted.  As I understand it, the Minister intends immediately appointing two district justices to preside over fair rents sitting in the Dolphin Hotel for the Dublin area.  District justices throughout the rest of the country would also be party to this legislation. District justices must have a minimum of experience to be appointed as such. Someone suggested &mdash; I do not know whom &mdash; that the district justices would not be competent enough or experienced enough to deal with this legislation.  I do not agree with that at all.  Subject to the correction of the lawyer Deputies, I understand that a district justice, to be appointed, must be either a practising solicitor or barrister, having not less than <Col N="1291" /> ten years' experience in practice.  Inevitably, one finds that district justices have far longer personal experience in practice than ten years.  If appointed after only ten years' experience, a district justice would be from 26 to 29 years of age and it is very seldom that one sees so young a district justice.  Inevitably district justices are aged from 45 to 50, having considerable experience.  I would not underrate the capacity of the District Court to do the job required by this legislation &mdash; quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the question of intimidation by reference to court atmosphere, the District Court is a court of first instance. I do not have as wide a district court practice as Deputy Shatter and others because I do not practice that much in that court, but there is a certain informality about that court which I find to be a very good thing.  One does not have the Queen Anne era garb of the wig and gown&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All that is required of a district justice in relation to a citizen who appears in front of him or her is that that citizen be given the courtesy to which he or she is entitled.  A person is put at ease in the atmosphere of the District Court.  I find it very informal and not intimidatory.  It is not a bad outlet for justice in the first instance.  I would not underrate on the one hand, the atmosphere of the District Court and, on the other hand, the capacity of the district justices, as presently appointed and about to be appointed, to regulate the law when this Bill becomes an Act.</P>

      <P>When the Minister was speaking on the discussions which are likely to take place, emphasis was placed on the fact that it would be either the Minister himself, or his counterpart in the Opposition, or the Whips, or the party leaders.  In view of the fact that we have put forward amendments on the issue of the rents tribunal, would the <Col N="1292" /> Minister be more specific and tell us that our party will have an input in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically said that it would be discussions with my own party, Fine Gael, Labour and Sinn Féin the Workers' Party, either at parliamentary leader level, or Whip level, or with spokesmen for the Environment on behalf of the various parties.  It can be decided by the Whips as to the form of discussion.  Obviously, all four parties in the House would be involved in these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still trying to clarify certain aspects of the Minister's thinking. Deputy Andrews referred to the question of competence of district justices.  I am not suggesting district justices are not competent people or that a district justice would not be a solicitor of ten years' standing.  Indeed, on our own proposal for a private rented dwellings tribunal we suggest that the qualifications for sitting on such a tribunal would be that the chairperson would have to be a barrister or solicitor of at least seven years' standing. The point that is being lost in all this discussion is that such a tribunal would have three members, one might be a vice-chairman or chairman who would effectively have the necessary legal qualifications, but the other two would be people who had some expertise in the area of valuations of dwellings and be in a position to provide the type of technical expert advice which a tribunal of this nature would have within itself, and that a District Court would not have, unless independent evidence was presented to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Minister has said that tenants would get free legal aid, I should like confirmation on the record of the House that his colleague will issue a ministerial directive to that effect pursuant to the scheme for civil legal aid and advice which is at present in operation because unless such a directive is given the scheme will not apply.  Whatever the Minister wishes is dependent on his colleagues extending it in that way.  Leaving the problem of legal expenditure aside, what will be the position of the tenant in the <Col N="1293" /> District Court who wants to assert a rental value that is something less than the landlord is seeking?  What expert evidence will that tenant be able to present? Will he get an estate agent or somebody else to come into court and give a valuation for him?  If so who will pay the fees of that estate agent, not merely for coming to court but for going to the house or flat and ascertaining a value?  The point of the rents tribunal is that there will be a degree of expertise within the body itself.  The courts will be dependent on the professional evidence given to them in determining a valuation.  That is a fundamental problem in the context of the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, perhaps Deputy Shatter is not aware of subsection 6 (2) which says that the landlord shall be liable for the tenant's costs reasonably and necessarily incurred arising out of an application by the landlord to the court under this section, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but I am presuming many of these tenants will require and get legal aid.  I expect that to happen.  The problem with court costs is that they are dependent on the court ordering them and people ultimately paying them.  I do not know whether the District Court, even if a tenant succeeded in getting an order for costs against a landlord, would order that £100 or £200 be paid in respect of estate agents' expenses for attending court.  On the scale of costs in the District Court, I have my doubts.  An estate agent might get £10 or £20 as a fee.  I am not raising a theoretical issue, it is a real problem for any tenant trying to establish the necessary evidence to secure what he believes the rental payment should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to Deputy Quinn, that provision in this Bill will not cover that because no estate agent is going to go to court for a tenant on the basis that, if an order for costs is given against the landlord, he will be paid.  He will not do it as a charitable act because we are talking about 20,000 or 30,000 tenants in this position and there will not be enough estate agents available and willing to do <Col N="1294" /> such charitable acts.  The situation will be the same as it was before we had any legal aid scheme where the sort of remedy available depends on the amount of funds at your disposal.  The cost provision in this legislation is not going to ease this burden when the tenant first has to go to court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and Deputy Andrews indicated that what I propose would be extremely difficult to accomplish within one hour and that by extension it might somehow or other take on the atmosphere of some kind of under-the-counter deal in smoke filled rooms. That impression may have been mistakenly taken by Deputy Andrews.  I am simply suggesting that we avail of the procedures of this House to negotiate an amendment and to come back with it on Report Stage.  It was right and proper that we should avail of that procedure. The Minister's argument is that it would be very difficult to do that within the space of an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I argue that we can stitch into this Bill, for the time being, that the District Courts are the agencies which deal with the administration of this Bill but that we provide for the establishment of a tribunal within the terms of this Bill. I respectfully suggest to the Minister and the Government that a Government that were capable of doing a deal amounting to approximately £150 million with an individual Deputy before this Dáil met are capable in the space of an hour of coming forward with an acceptable formula. Our case rests on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Shatter's comments, I did not go into the details of the type of tribunal envisaged because we have been discussing the general broad issue and we did not discuss details of amendments put down by Deputy Shatter and other Members. The free legal aid scheme is a matter for the Minister for Justice but it has been <Col N="1295" /> decided it will apply.  As far as a tenant's costs are concerned, I think section 12(6) sets it out very clearly, that the landlord shall be liable for the tenant's costs reasonably and necessarily incurred.  &ldquo;Reasonably and necessarily incurred&rdquo; would, in my view, take into account such issues as the Deputy raised, either an architect giving evidence as to the quality and standard of the building or an auctioneer giving evidence as to the approximate rent that other premises get in the area. Surely those costs would be reasonably and necessarily incurred arising out of an application by the landlord under this section?  The only proviso is &ldquo;unless the Court, on consideration of all the circumstances, including the means of the landlord and the tenant, otherwise orders&rdquo;. I see also the free legal aid scheme being extended, not just to the court hearings themselves.  There will be many tenants caught in this unfortunate trap who are old and will need advice on their rights under the Bill even before going to the court.  They will be eligible for free legal aid.</P>
      <P>As far as setting down tribunals by regulations is concerned, I have made all my points.  I appeal to Deputies to take the commitment given by the Taoiseach and extended by me with regard to bringing this in in the next session and having immediate discussions with all parties in the House.  That is as far as I want to go at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was made by the Minister to the question of costs.  I think they are less than adequate.  I do not think the Minister is correct in thinking that the way it is worded providing for costs under the landlord's application would cover a valuer's fee.  My experience is that the word &ldquo;costs&rdquo; means legal costs and the question of witnesses' expenses &mdash; the key witness, of course, would be the valuer &mdash; comes under the description of expenses rather than costs.  It might be necessary to make a consequential amendment there to provide for costs and expenses.  It only provides for application by the landlord. There could be circumstances under <Col N="1296" /> which the tenant might have to seek the assistance of the court or tribunal as the case may be.  I do not see why it should be limited to applications by the landlord.</P>
      <P>There is a further matter arising there and that is the question of an appeal.  It could well happen that an application by a landlord would go to the Circuit Court on appeal from the District Court or from the tribunal, as the case may be, but there is no provision in the section to govern such appeals.  Would the costs of such appeals be covered?  Such costs would be much higher than those incurred in the tribunal of first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the same as section 17 of the Bill passed by the Oireachtas and found to be unconstitutional. The free legal aid system does not cover the cost of advice of a technical nature, but the advice I have is that this will cover costs &ldquo;reasonably and necessarily incurred&rdquo;.  That cannot be interpreted in the narrow sense merely to mean legal advice.  It must be interpreted to include advice of a technical nature needed to back up the case of the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the qualifications of the legal Members here but I want to make the point that during a number of years there has been a tendency in the House to bring in legislation to set up rent tribunals, but nothing has happened.  We take the view that if there is to be such a tribunal &mdash; we demand that there should be such a tribunal &mdash; it should be established by legislation.  In view of the time constraint and in order to give immediate protection to tenants, we are prepared to accept the assurance given by the Minister and the Government to have discussions with a view to bringing in amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sherlock for his statement.  I assure him and the House that the trust placed in me and in the Government in this instance will not be found to be misplaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): I am not a lawyer Member of the House and a lot of the debate has been conducted in that <Col N="1297" /> atmosphere.  For old people, going to court is a traumatic experience.  Many of them have never been in court before. The human aspect of this should be taken into account.  In my constitutency I know a number of widows who happen to be landlords, but in no circumstances could they be regarded as speculators.  They happened to find themselves in a situation in which their only source of income was from a dwelling, may be with a tenant in it.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Bill should have provision for the payment of legal expenses in circumstances when the landlord of the type I have mentioned would incur costs. My understanding is that there is no provision in the Bill for that.  I am sure Deputy Andrews, my colleague in the constituency, has had a number of representations like I have had concerning people who find themselves without any income except a small one from a dwelling left to them at some stage.</P>
      <P>I suggest that all of us here would be anxious to see that people who genuinely need assistance would get it.  I have no brief here to try to secure legal aid for speculators in property at the expense of people who cannot afford to provide roofs over their heads, but in justice we must see to it that everyone who needs help would get it so that his rights would be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course assistance can be given to a landlord also.  As we all know, there are many landlords of the type just mentioned and if they are eligible for free legal aid they will be entitled to it.  Section 12 (6) states:</P>
      <P>The landlord shall be liable for the tenant's costs reasonably and necessarity incurred arising out of an application by the landlord to the Court under this section unless the Court, on consideration of all the circumstances, including the means of the landlord and the tenant, otherwise order.</P>
      <P>The whole Bill is a balancing act between the rights of the landlord and the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett made a very balanced point.  It must be stressed <Col N="1298" /> that the vast majority of tenants are pensioners and social welfare recipients, but there is a minority of them who are financially well off.  Deputy Barrett illustrated the case of a widow or widower with a small income from a rent controlled dwelling which he or she inherited at some stage in the distant past and that a tenant in such a dwelling might have a far higher income than the landlord.  That arises occasionally.  It appears that if the tenant does not reach agreement with the landlord and if an impecunious landlord is taken to court he might not be given costs against the tenant.  That would happen only occasionally but there will be cases like those referred to by Deputy Barrett.  All of us have come across situations like he has described, but the vast majority are wealthy landlords and poor tenants.  If we are going to provide for an equal approach there should be a provision to enable courts to make the reverse sort of order.  I agree with Deputy Taylor because I am not happy that there is a provision to include professional fees, and even if it does I am not happy with it because I am not satisfied the District Court will be able to order the type of payment to the tenant who has made himself liable for full professional advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If the landlord is in the financial state outlined by Deputy Shatter he or she will be covered by free legal aid.  It is highly unlikely that a tenant who is well heeled will go before a court if he is on a fairly low rent: it will be the landlord who will be bringing the tenant to court.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>All airmail letters for the United States of America and Canada posted in the postal districts and regions mentioned are despatched through Shannon Airport except on Sundays when airmail from offices in Counties Carlow, Laois, Kilkenny, Offaly, Tipperary and Waterford are despatched through Dublin Airport. It is proposed that this latter arrangement should be extended on Sundays only to all airmail letters for the USA and Canada, as the small amount still being despatched through Shannon Airport on Sundays would not justify continuing the expensive staffing arrangements involved and as despatch through Dublin Airport would reduce the overall cost of handling the mails while substantially maintaining existing standards of service.  The amount of airmail letters not being despatched through Shannon Airport cannot be readily quantified but as mentioned it is quite small.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister aware that especially during the winter months the mail which is taken to Dublin and despatched through Dublin is frequently brought by train back to Limerick and despatched through Shannon and that there is no improvement whatsoever in the service?  Is the Minister further aware that flights from Dublin Airport land in Shannon anyway to pick up more mail?  The streamlining of the service does not improve the service and it is a downgrading of a provincial facility which has existed for years.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, a few minutes ago I missed a division <Col N="1306" /> here.  The bells rang  television screen in the restaurant did not show a votáil sign, and it was assumed by me and some other Deputies that this was the bell for Question Time.  Secondly, it is generally assumed here that after 2.30 p.m. Deputies are free to leave the House because there will not be any division in the next hour.  Are we setting a precedent now of having divisions during Question Time?</P>

The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was here and, according to the rules, the bells were rung for a division.  Because of possible confusion among Deputies the bells went on for almost twenty minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must agree that any of his party's members has a right to call a division, and this one was called by a colleague of his on the front bench.  Would the Deputy wish to differentiate between the bells ringing for Question Time and the bells ringing for a vote?</P>

      <P>Arrangements are made for the representation of students on the governing bodies of the University Colleges, the National Institutes of Higher Education in Limerick and Dublin, the National College of Art and Design and of Thomond College.

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements are in train for a number of third level institutions.  As far as the regional technical colleges are concerned, their boards of management are, in effect, sub-committees of their respective vocational education committees and the total membership of these sub-committees is fixed at 12.  There are existing agreements as to the composition of that membership. The normal practice is that committees, and in this case sub-committees, are formed by vocational education committees after local elections.  According to the usual pattern, therefore, these committees would not fall to be reconstituted until after the next local elections in 1984. The position is being examined to see if we can arrive at some developments in the interim.</P>

    <P>My Department have acquired a site at Tymon North for a new second-level school to serve the Kilnamanagh area.  It is intended to provide a new school on this site, but it is not possible at this stage <Col N="1319" /> of planning to give an indication of the date on which building will be commenced or when the new school premises will be completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there is an urgent need for this school and that there will be pressure for spaces in it approaching next September?  Having regard to the fact that Kilnamanagh is a community of 1,500 houses, can the Minister not be more specific about when the building works will get under way on this site?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the whole question of post-primary school provision in that area is by no means a straightforward matter.  I have looked at the situation not only in respect of this proposed school but also in respect of other proposals for development in the general area, the way in which existing schools function and how they might be affected by the provision of further new schools.  As the Deputy will know, there have been a variety of views put forward relationg to both the precise location and the size of the proposed school for this area.  I am indicating that we have acquired this specific site in Tymon North and that it is intended to provide a school on this site as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy says &ldquo;in this area&rdquo; does he mean specifically the Kilnamanagh grouping of <Col N="1320" /> approximately 1,500 houses, to which Deputy Taylor referred, or is he talking about the area which might be a reasonable catchment area in this district?

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In my supplementary replies I indicated the general provision in that area, that it was not only the question of deciding on the size and exact location of new schools but that it was also a question of looking at how best they should fit in along with the existing schools.  That was my point.  In giving a firm commitment to building a school on the Tymon North site I was not pre-empting decisions about the size and location of other schools in that general area.</P>

I think I have given a reasonable indication of what is being done at this stage.  I am not delaying the provision of post-primary facilities in this area.  I do not think there is any question of there not being provision for pupil enrolment as the need arises.  Taking account of views expressed by Deputy Taylor and others, I do not think it unreasonable that I should want to give all views full and reasonable examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in order for me to put some supplementary questions in relation to some anomalies in the grants system?  There are three particular anomalies I have in mind.  There is a rule that states that the honours required must be gained in one sitting and obviously this militates against the person who goes back to school to do a night course.  There is the condition that states four honours are required for a grant even though less than four honours are required for the course in question.  There is also the situation of students who wish to do a one-year third level course but who are not eligible for a grant, even though the one-year course may be part of a longer course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the anomalies to which the Deputy has referred.  In my opinion there are a number of other anomalies in the operation of the grants system.  I am having the structure of the grants system reviewed but at this point I should not like to prejudge the outcome of that examination. To the extent that State moneys are available to support students in third level institutions, my general intention will be to ensure that such moneys are given in the way that will best assist students who are most in need of financial support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is being somewhat mischievous. There are plenty of other matters for which provision had not been made even when Government decisions were taken. For instance, when I came to office I discovered that although my predecessor had announced provision for additional primary teachers there was no financial provision for that item.  While I consider it reasonable for a government to make financial provision for their decisions, I do not think it reasonable to make hypothetical provision for some decision that is not yet taken.  In my reply to Deputy De Rossa, I indicated that this question is being examined as a matter of urgency but it would not be feasible to arrive at a financial provision until the examination is complete and the decision taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

I have indicated that I hope that matter will be completed not later than two months and I will then be in a position to see what decisions can be taken. To the extent that decisions are taken, the appropriate provision, financial or otherwise, will be made.</P>

As the Deputy points out, a number of schools provide a four-year course for their pupils.  There is nothing in the regulations to prevent schools which can do so making this additional provision.  In so far as a requirement laid down by the Department is concerned, we would have to look at the financial and other implications of a decision to add an extra year.</P>

I am not conscious of any delay during our term of office as distinct from the term of office of my immediate predecessor.  If the Deputy wants to talk about apparent delays I can tell him they occurred at a number of points.  The actual process of planning the new school commenced in 1978.  In July 1981 the Department issued a revised schedule of accommodation for the project and authorised the preparation of a sketch plan.  There was a meeting with the building unit of the Department of Education on 4 March when certain design amendments and technical reports were requested.  The Department are now awaiting a response from the committee in this matter.  If the Deputy wants to imply there was a partisan element in <Col N="1328" /> the delay, he could easily say that was being done as late as 4 March.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 14, after &ldquo;any&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;structural alterations, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Briefly, this is to give effect to works which a tenant might be obliged to undertake such as treating dampness and which professional evidence in court would argue is a structural alteration.  Subsection (1) of section 7 provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;improvement&rdquo; means any addition to or alteration of a dwelling carried out by the tenant or any of his predecessors in title on or after the 31st day of December 1960 which adds to the letting value of the dwelling and includes any addition or alteration connected with the provision of any services <Col N="1365" /> to the dwelling, but does not include work of repairing (except where such work was the responsibility of the landlord and he failed to carry out the work), painting and decorating or any of them....</P>
    <P>I am simply saying that the tenant should get the benefit by way of capitalised reduction on the gross rent for work which could be of a structural nature but which was not part and parcel of what was perceived as the landlord's responsibility but which would improve the value of the property.  Damp proofing would be an example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not necessary and therefore I do not propose to accept it.  Structural alterations to a dwelling are included already in the earlier part of the definition.  The second part of the definition in respect of which amendment is being sought deals with the provision of services to the dwelling.  The section is framed so as to ensure that, for example, a tenant installing a sewerage system would be entitled to have that work defined as an improvement. The definition of &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; is important in that a tenant can have his rent reduced to take account of an improvement and can be compensated for an improvement on his quitting a dwelling.  The right to compensate him for improvements did not exist under the Rent Restrictions Act but does exist under the landlord and tenant code. What the Deputy is suggesting is covered in the first part.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8.</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), lines 21 to 23, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  who would, at the commencement of this Act, be the tenant of the dwelling if the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, and the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, had full force and effect at all times from their passing until such commencement, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical drafting amendment to the definition of &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; in section 7. The word &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; is crucial to the rights conferred by the Bill.  It is essential to ensure that &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; includes all persons who would be entitled to stay in a controlled dwelling had the former Acts not been found to be unconstitutional. Unless every such person is included in the definition of tenant his rights to retain possession under the Bill would be in jeopardy.  Under the amendment all present tenants of controlled dwellings, whether contractual or statutory tenants, are covered.  The reference to the rent restrictions code is being confined now to the 1960 and 1967 Acts for the purpose of pinpointing a tenant.  It is taken that the two Acts had full force at all times since their enactment and not solely at the date of the commencement of the new legislation.  This will remove any doubt particularly about spouses and members of families who succeeded to a tenancy after April 1980, the date of the original High Court judgement and from which time the status of a person succeeding as tenant could be in doubt.</P>

      <P>The original subsection (1)(a) refers to the Rent Restrictions Acts, 1960 to 1981.  It is not for me to explain the Minister's amendment.

      <P>The Minister has put his finger on it and Deputy Shatter has now picked up the point.  There is an implied reference to the spouse in the word &ldquo;tenant&rdquo;.  The Minister is giving us an additional meaning for the word &ldquo;tenant&rdquo;. The Minister's amendment must be prefaced by the definition of the word &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; which means &ldquo;the person for the time being entitled to the possession of a dwelling to which section 8(1) relates and includes a person...&rdquo;  There is an implied reference to what the Minister is talking about when he mentions a spouse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (3), line 17, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  the tenant of the dwelling assigns or sublets his tenancy other than when he assigns or sublets his tenancy to his spouse or family as defined in section 7 (2), who is bona fide residing in the dwelling at the time of the assignment or subletting, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We put forward this amendment because we understand it may happen that a tenant who, for reasons of health may have to move out of a dwelling and become institutionalised, may be dispossessed.  I understand that under the present legislation a tenant retired and moved out of a town into the country, leaving his family behind him, and his family were subsequently dispossessed by the landlord.  We are anxious that that should not occur under this legislation.  That is why we are moving this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that this amendment is not necessary. If a tenant moves out and leaves his family behind, once he does not do anything with the tenancy such as giving it up or anything like that, there is no difficulty, no complication.  He is covered under the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a slightly different point but it deals with the question of assignment of the tenancy. Deputy De Rossa is concerned to a lesser extent.  I am concerned with the wider question that the right to assign has been taken away &mdash; in other words, that what we are now saying to a tenant is: &ldquo;You cannot transfer that tenancy to anybody else.&rdquo;  I ask &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;  It is a basic fact that there should be freedom to assign a tenancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not saying it.  The Supreme Court said it because it affects the property rights of the tenant. That was the original decision.  But the principle in this Bill is that we are allowing tenancies to be transferred on death to a spouse and members of the family, <Col N="1372" /> but not on assignment, and we are not withdrawing landlord and tenant rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think there was any directive given by the Supreme Court on the question of assignability of controlled tenancies.  That point was not at issue at all.  Traditionally any tenancy has always been assignable.  That has been an inherent factor in our landlord and tenant legislation going back to 1931, when it was left open to tenants to apply to the court if a landlord refused consent to assign the tenancy.  That seems to me to be a gratuitous hardship imposed on the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The general principle behind the Supreme Court's decision was that in this whole question of the indefinite transmission of tenancy from one to the other, &ldquo;to the other&rdquo; meant that the landlord had no hope in the foreseeable future of gaining rights to and possession of his property.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 21 and 22, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>(4) Paragraphs (a) and (c) of sub-section (3) shall not affect the entitlement of a tenant to compensation under section 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment to section 8 sub-section (4) of the Bill.  Its effect is that a tenant who assigns or sublets his or her tenancy would not be entitled to compensation for improvements.  In effect, if a tenant assigns or sublets, he loses all rights and benefits under the Bill. By assigning or subletting a dwelling it is being transferred to another person during the lifetime of the present tenant which is at variance with the intent of the Bill that a dwelling should transfer only on the death of a tenant, in accordance <Col N="1373" /> with section 9 of the Bill, to a spouse or member of the original tenant's family.</P>

      <P>I am moving this amendment on behalf of the Labour Party largely in response to the existing shortage of housing accommodation in the greater Dublin area particularly but also throughout the country generally in order to give a greater degree of security to tenants because the options of getting alternative accommodation are somewhat limited. The effect of the amendment is to extend the period of entitlement from 20 to 30 years.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons leading to the finding of the Supreme Court that the Rent Restrictions Act was unconstitutional was that a landlord was being alienated from his property indefinitely.  I consider that section 9 of the Bill goes as far as one can reasonably go to protect tenants.  The present tenant and, on his death, his spouse, is being given a right to possession for their lifetime.  Other members of the family who succeed to the tenancy are being given a right for 20 years from the commencement of the provisions of the Act, that is, into the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill affords two important improvements to tenants compared with the 1981 Bill.  Firstly, where a member of the family succeeds to the tenancy with less than five of the 20 years remaining, he can stay for a minimum of five years. Secondly, the rights under the Landlord and Tenant Act to a new tenancy after 20 years occupation of a dwelling are not being withdrawn in this Bill as compared with the 1981 Bill.  Consequently, a tenant <Col N="1374" /> who either himself, or jointly with his predecessors in title, have 20 years continuous occupation would be entitled to a new tenancy under the landlord and</P>
    <P>I consider that the provisions of section 9 of the Bill provide reasonable protection for tenants and I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>This is a question of succession as between the family when the tenant dies. I know this was done in previous legislation but I have often wondered about the wisdom of the court selecting one member of the family who may have resided there to be the tenant.  Would the Minister consider amending that subsection to provide that all the members of the family who are bona fide residing there should become joint tenants of that tenancy rather than selecting one?  One could envisage situations in which a court would select one person to be the tenant and in which there could be internal family disputes as a result of which some members of the family might be unwelcome there and could be ejected from the family home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why it would be unworkable when one considers that it is precisely what happens when a man who owns a house dies &mdash; all the members of his family succeed in equal shares if he has left no will.  That is perfectly workable. Why should it be any less workable here?  One wonders on what basis one particular member of the family would be chosen by the court.  There could be five or six children, they could all be of full age and it could give rise to disputes <Col N="1376" /> between them.  Why not make them all joint tenants, they have all equal right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was to be disagreement between family members, the recipe is just as suggested by the Deputy.  The best way to handle it is through the formula laid down in subsection (5).  It provides a simple mechanism for choosing among the members of the family living in the dwelling at the time of the death of the original tenant and his spouse.  If they agree on the one member chosen, that is fine.  If they do not, then the court make the selection.  It is also for the court to decide in all cases if the prospective successor has been bona fide residing in the dwelling.  If we were to use the suggested formula of Deputy Taylor it would be a recipe for chaos.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Why draw a distinction between this situation and the normal inheritance situation?  For example, if there is a widower living in a house with six grown-up children and he dies having made no will, the six children take equally.  We did away years ago with primogeniture, single succession and that sort of thing.  Tenancy here is important. Why draw a distinction because it is a tenancy situation rather than an ownership situation?  The modern thought on this is that you have equality between children, between people in an equal category. This would seem to me to be putting the clock back and placing on the court the responsibility to nominate one particular person rather than having equality.  Why not make them joint tenants? They are all children of the father who died.  Why not give them equality here?</P>

We want to ensure that the regulations are brought into effect.  The section as it reads says that, if the regulations under section 24 are in force, the landlord has complied with the requirements of such regulations.  We want to ensure that the regulations are enforced <Col N="1378" /> and in fact brought into effect and that the landlord must comply with them.

The existing provision is that if a landlord is to get an increased rent he must satisfy registration requirements. That is something easily determined. What is suggested here is so broad in its implications that the advice I get on it is that it would be unworkable.

It should not be beyond the ingenuity of the Department to produce regulations which it would be possible to define as regards a certain job being completed. The regulations refer in particular to the registration of the dwelling, which is very straightforward, and provision of rent books, which is also straightforward.  The only one is No. 26, which seems to be giving the Minister some problems and which would relate to the actual standards of the dwelling.  I cannot see that the inclusion of these under section 11 to replace paragraph (b) would cause any great difficulty in the operation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>We discussed this at length this morning.  The existing construction of section 12 (6) is quite adequate to deal with the costs which Deputy Quinn's amendment seeks to encompass. There is no qualification of costs in the subsection.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it; it is a fact that the word &ldquo;costs&rdquo; means legal costs.  There are two kinds of orders that the court makes.  One refers to legal costs, but if one is to get witnesses' expenses, particularly professional expenses, it must specify &ldquo;and expenses.&rdquo;  I urge the Minister to agree that we insert after &ldquo;costs&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and expenses&rdquo;.  That is essential to enable valuers'fees, which are a key part of these hearings, to be covered.  The tenant will be left in an impossible position if he is not covered for his valuers' fee to go into court with him and it is into <Col N="1381" /> court he is going.  The word &ldquo;expenses&rdquo; is essential there; that is the element necessary to provide for his valuers' fee and without a valuer he is not in a position to go into court at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point raised by Deputy Taylor.  The word &ldquo;costs&rdquo; in the legal system is used not always on quite the same premises.  It is certainly the case that, in the Superior Courts if one says &ldquo;costs&rdquo;, everybody takes it as meaning witnesses' expenses and everything else and no difficulty would arise.  In the District Court the standard order made, if they wanted to compensate someone fully for their out of pocket expenses, is one of costs and expenses.  A distinction is always made by a district justice in his order in a civil case between the scaled costs that are provided and the witnesses' expenses.  A District Court examining this provision would have to have regard to the order it normally makes and its normal order is one of either costs, confined to the scaled costs for legal fees or costs and expenses. That is what happens in the District Court every day.</P>

      <P>The Minister takes the view that costs include the various items referred to in the amendment.  If Members on both sides agree that costs should cover the items referred to in the amendment, I would ask the Minister in those circumstances to avoid doubt and accept the amendment.  All the amendment will do will be to ensure that what the Minister says the section does will be implemented. It is a provision that will provide a degree of protection for both parties, but tenants in particular.  The section does not guarantee that at present.  If the Minister is disposed to allowing orders for costs made by the District Court to include the costs of estate agents, surveyors or other professional fees which a tenant incurs as a result of bringing such proceedings, then no harm can be done by including this.  In fact, a great deal of good can be done in that it will avoid a degree of uncertainty which surrounds the section.</P>

      <P>When the 1981 Act was referred to the Supreme Court for judgment this section was included. One of the main points in the arguments in the Supreme Court by those representing the landlords was that the subsection under discussion highlighted the anti-landlord element of the legislation. A risk I am anxious to avoid is that the legislation is held to be anti-landlord or anti-tenant or pro-landlord or pro-tenant. It is important that we get the balance right.  It is important that in the interests of settling this complex issue involved in this major social problem this Bill decides the matter once and for all. It would be inadvisable and dangerous to extend the provision at this stage.  I accept the Deputy's suggestion, but my interpretation of &ldquo;costs&rdquo; is that it includes costs and expenses.  I do not wish to include the terms of the amendment at this stage because the subsection was one of the key areas highlighted as being anti-landlord.  We must be careful to ensure that the Bill is seen to be a balanced piece of legislation between landlord and tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the Minister's attitude to a number of amendments which are less damaging to the Bill than are some of his own.  The commitment to co-operation has fallen somewhat short of what I expected.  The gross rent will be fixed by the courts and from the gross rent will be deducted an allowance for items such as improvements, alterations and so on.  The value of them will be assessed by the court after it has heard expert evidence.  It would be reasonable, from my own experience, to assume that for an architect to respond to a solicitor's request to give an estimate of the value of work done over a period of ten or 20 years he would need quite often the experience of a quantity surveyor. That quantity surveyor may need the assistance of a builder to give an estimate of the costs of the works to test it against the market prevailing at that time.  The expense involved in all that, having regard to what the legal Deputies have said, would be substantial.  If there is any doubt, surely the Minister can <Col N="1383" /> respond by including the words &ldquo;and expenses&rdquo; in the subsection.  What is the point of being here if we are not going to get some movement on this?  It must be remembered that we are discussing the improvement of legislation about which we are all agreed.</P>

      <P>The almost universal practice in the District Court is that an order for costs follows a successful conclusion of a civil action, but the costs that can be recovered are limited by the scale that applies.  Quite often witnesses' expenses, even if it is only people travelling to court in a taxi, will amount to as much as can be recovered under the scale of legal costs.  It is because there is no taxation procedure in the District Court that it is the practice for a district justice to measure the amount that can be allowed for witnesses' expenses.  The order the district justice is accustomed to making is one of costs and expenses.  It is by no means unusual for the district justice to differentiate, because he may take the view that a person was entitled to the legal costs but that a witness was not necessary or that a witness had taken a day off when a half day would have sufficed. <Col N="1384" /> In the District Court, as distinct from any other branch of the legal system, on the successful conclusion of a case the district justice turns his mind separately to the question of costs and expenses.  With a view to being helpful to the Minister I should like to make a suggestion. If the Minister is concerned that accepting the amendment as phrased in full would seem to be stitching in an anti-landlord view into the Bill, I suggest that he include after the word &ldquo;costs&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and expenses&rdquo;.  That would meet the situation and I do not think the Minister need have the fears indicated.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for accepting that amendment which <Col N="1385" /> is valuable and necessary.  However, I have a further problem in relation to that subsection, which states:</P>
      <P>(6)  The landlord shall be liable for the tenant's costs reasonably and necessarily incurred arising out of an application by the landlord to the Court under this section unless the Court,....</P>
      <P>As we are aware from the interpretation clause, &ldquo;the court&rdquo; means the District Court.  As the legal Deputies can clarify, there could be an appeal and, no doubt there will be an appeal, to the Circuit Court.  Such an appeal will be on the basis of a complete rehearing.  That is the form appeals take from the District Court to the Circuit Court.  In a case where that happens the section does not provide for the tenant's costs of the appeal, so he will be left completely exposed.  The landlord will have no problem covering himself, but the tenant will be left without either costs or expenses of an appeal.  The section is confined to the costs in the court and, by definition, the District Court only.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Deputy Taylor's question, I have one further relevant point.  As far as I am aware, there is no expressed provision anywhere in the Act specifically stating that there is a right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  I presume that arises under the Courts Act as an automatic right, which is the reason for its not being referred to here.  However, I endorse Deputy Taylor's remarks.  Certainly in so far as that would be the case, there would be the same problem of expenses in the Circuit Court.  The Minister may possibly consider putting down his own amendment on Report Stage to permit the payment of costs and expenses in the event of an appeal to the Circuit Court.  The section would have to expressly state that.</P>

      <P>On the question raised by Deputy Taylor, I would anticipate very few cases being appealed through the Circuit Court.  They would be covered by the courts legislation and <Col N="1386" /> not in this legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a clear-cut question of winning or losing.  It is a question of a long-standing low rent and a landlord coming in on an application and obtaining a substantial increase.  An appeal then arises, either on the part of the tenant or the landlord, and the same figure may apply, or it may be slightly raised or lowered.  The tenant's rent has gone up in the meantime from £3 to £30, so he loses come what may.  The intent of the section is that he at least should not have the burden of the legal costs and expenses. That should apply in the event also of an appeal.  Would the Minister agree to the slight appropriate amendment to cover an appeal situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I have gone as far as I can in the subsection as it reads to cover the tenant's liability for costs, and now expenses, in section 12.  I cannot go any further at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <P>Section 12 (2), states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Court has fixed the terms <Col N="1387" /> of a tenancy under subsection (1), the landlord or the tenant may not apply to the court to fix new terms of the tenancy until the expiration of five years from the date of the last order of the Court fixing the terms of the tenancy.</P>
    <P>In the 1981 Bill the time mentioned was three years.  Why has that been increased to five years?  However, that is not my major point, which is that under the 1981 Bill the means of assessing the rent of the premises were quite precisely defined under section 6 (2).  That rent was meant to hold for a period of three years.  Under this Bill the definition of rents is not precise at all&mdash;in fact there is a huge number of variables, if one looks also at section 13.  If the rent is fixed under section 13, it applies and may not be altered, even on application to the court, for a period of five years.  One of those conditions is the means of the landlord and the tenant.  Obviously, the means of either the landlord or the tenant can vary on the day following the court's making an order as to the rent to be paid for these premises. The conditions also include the ages of the tenant's family residing in the premises.  The tenant might have two children today and quins in a year's time and his conditions will have changed utterly.  Also, the house may be owned by a self-employed person who dies, leaving the house to his widow and leaving her no other means.  She is now unable to apply to the court for another five years.  Coincidentally with that, the means of the tenant may have improved enormously, but the tenant cannot be liable for a higher rent, nor can the owner of the house get an increase in rent for five years.</P>
    <P>The converse of that is that the landlord may win the Sweep within 12 months of the fixing of the rent, while the tenant may lose his or her job.  The means of both may change to an enormous degree, yet the tenant is stuck with this rent and may not apply to the court for a further five years.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House nodded when allowing account of section 13 to be <Col N="1388" /> taken in this new Bill.  We should have put down an amendment.  Would the Minister accept some form of amendment to allow in special circumstances an appeal to the court to have set aside the court order which fixed the rent if the means of the landlord or the tenant change in the intervening five-year period?</P>

Under the subsection which I have included here, if the landlord and tenant come to an agreement and the landlord decides after a month, a week or any other time, they can immediately go to the court at present and get a decision, whereas in the old Bill if there was agreement they still could not go to the court for three years.  Having gone to the court and a decision having been made, they are both tied to it for five years.  If one opens it up to include changes of circumstances in the 13(2) draft, which I have here, as regards the matters which must be taken into consideration by the court in deciding on a rent, there can be complications. One would be into chaos if tenants and landlords were going back and forth to the courts at all times.</P>

If there is a change of status for the tenant, if his financial situation <Col N="1389" /> deteriorates either because of being made unemployed or in the case of the addition of the quins which were mentioned, then the home subsidy scheme is there to protect him from the additional burden which he has to pay.  He merely goes at that stage to the Department of Social Welfare and is looked after by means of an improved subsidy.  If the husband dies and the widow is on a fixed pension I accept there is a difficulty.  This is a complex matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is quite clear in including a list of things which the court must take into account when assessing the rent.  The condition of the house is very important.  Two landlords with houses next door to each other could have kept them is quite a different state of repair.  There is nothing in this section that would allow the court to take that into account.  If a landlord has not kept the house in good condition the tenant should be charged a lower rent than for a house which has been kept in good condition.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's amendment is a criterion for the determination of the rent.  The Deputy is attempting to include as one of the factors the condition of the house and the matters referred to in section 26(2), that is the standard prescribed by regulations. The existing section 13(2) refers to the character of the dwelling and allows all the factors the Deputy spoke about to be considered and to be taken into account. It is much wider in scope than the Deputy's amendment seeks to include. Consequently, I do not intent to contract the scope of this Bill, I intent to leave it as broad as I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When determining rent, the condition of the dwelling will obviously have to be taken into account. We talked earlier about surveyors, architects and estate agents assisting the court to determine a value.  Their assessment is going to be largely based, in so far as they can contribute to this area, on the condition of the dwelling.  The character might be concerned with whether it is situated on the Rathgar or Rathmines Road, the centre of Dublin city or wherever it is, but it will not be concerned with determining whether it is in good or bad repair.  With respect to the Minister, the word &ldquo;condition&rdquo; is the usual sort of terminology and has been used in other landlord and tenant Acts in helping to determine the amount of rent payable for a premises.  It is the obvious factor to be taken into account whenever there is a private letting arrangement, be it a shop or dwelling that does not come within the terms of this Bill.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the amendment.</P>
      <P>I also refer the Minister to the fact that the second portion of the amendment is a most important provision in that it is concerned with providing an incentive to landlords to comply with any regulations that require a minimum standard of the condition of the dwelling.  If that is inserted in the Bill, it may obviate the necessity for having hordes of housing officers and local authorities running around the country trying to assess the condition of dwellings which come within the provisions of this Act.  If they do not comply with the minimum standards as a consequence landlords may lose out in a rental payment which the courts may judge should be made.  I would ask the Minister, in the same spirit as Deputy Quinn referred to the fact that we are co-operating with the Minister in passing this Act, to note that this is not a powerful, political, contentious amendment. It is an amendment suggested purely having regard to making the Act workable and readily interpreted by the courts and also properly enforceable by tenants where minimum standards are imposed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (2), line 35, after &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the prospect of suitable alternative accommodation being available to such tenants by the local authority&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious from the constraints the Minister has taken upon himself that he cannot accept it.  I want to put on the record of the House one of the reasons why this amendment should be incorporated in the terms under which a just and proper rent would be fixed by the District Court.  In my experience, to date, tenants <Col N="1393" /> who occupy uncontrolled dwellings and are taken to court because of their inability to pay or simply because the landlord wants to get vacant possession, find that the judge expects that the local housing authority will automatically take on the responsibility of housing them.  In establishing what would be a just rent, section 13 (2) requires the court to have regard to eight separate factors.  We have been talking about only one of them and the amendment seeks to add at the end of the subsection &ldquo;and the prospect of suitable alternative accommodation being available to such tenants by the local authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason for the amendment is that it is and it should be an admissible argument by a tenant whose rent was about to be increased considerably that she or he could point out to the district justice that the lists for, in my case, Dublin Corporation are in excess of 2,000 to 3,000 people and that in the event of such a tenant not being able to arrive at an agreement for a rent she or he could afford, and which would be subsidised in part by the social welfare code, the person would have no option but to try to get housed by the statutory authority.  It should be possible for that person to be able to say to the district justice that the housing authority simply would not be in a position to house the person because of the queues involved and the constraints on the housing lists.</P>
    <P>A number of Fianna Fáil Deputies who are members of Dublin Corporation are well aware of the situation.  Indeed the decision of the court which we have states:</P>
    <P>The Court recognises that hardship may be caused to some tenants required to pay even the abated rent provided for in section 9.</P>
    <P>My argument is that the court recognised all these things in the subsection but they did not see fit to try to balance their decision.  Therefore, I am saying to the Minister that this factor should be part and parcel of the items which the court <Col N="1394" /> should take into consideration when trying to establish a just and proper rent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment to the criteria in the section.  As the Deputy said, it is an attempt to include as one of the considerations the prospect of the tenant being eligible for housing by a local authority.  I cannot see that this type of criterion can be applied as a matter affecting the relationship between landlord and tenant.  Concern was expressed on the Second Stage that section 13 (2) could raise constitutional problems and I fear that inclusion of something on the lines of this amendment would exacerbate these difficulties, and therefore I cannot accept the amendment. I gave similar reasons to Deputies Barry and Birmingham for not accepting their amendments.</P>

      <P>Our reason for tabling the amendment is that the decision of the court refers to hardship being caused by the consequences of this.  There are eight factors which the court must take into account in determining a just and proper rent, and in order to avoid the hardship of homelessness we thought it necessary to provide that the judge should allow as admissible evidence on behalf of the tenant details of the housing situation in the area concerned.  It is quite clear from the ambiguity in relation to the degree of subsidy available under the social welfare code that even with the maximum allowance that will be paid to tenants&mdash;let us be honest about it, no Government are prepared to give an open-ended commitment to pay the full difference &mdash; many tenants will find themselves flung back on the local authorities' housing lists.  Therefore, if it were a choice between homelessness and going on the housing lists, I suggest the court should be enabled to accept this factor as admissible evidence.</P>

      <P>One of the things <Col N="1396" /> which the court is likely to have regard to is the age of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling.  There seems to be only one explanation, and I hope it is correct. If it is correct I will have a suggestion to make.</P>

      <P>As I have said many times, this legislation must provide a balance between what is fair to the landlord and to the tenant.  We could not bring in anti-tenant or anti-landlord legislation. In deciding on the rent, the landlord is entitled to have some account taken of the circumstances of a family in which there might be three or four wage earners.  Their income should be taken into account &mdash; their earning capacity. The reverse situation is where there is a tenant with five or six young children. The tenant might have a good salary but the fact that he has five or six children to educate and to feed should be taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the position I approve of it wholeheartedly, but I wonder what the end effect would be.  Surely if the ages of the family members are to be looked at it does not matter whether there are four 17-year olds none of whom are working or earning?  Is that not a graver situation than having four young children?  The court will be allowed to have regard to the means of both landlord and tenant.  It will also be allowed to look at the size of the family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">

      <P>The tenant's ability to pay would also be affected by the contribution being made to the income of the tenant by his working children or by children who are not working, whichever way it is.  It is there to assist the tenant in the situation where he has a large young family that he is trying to educate and clothe.  It is also there to protect the landlord in the event of a tenant having five or six working children.  The landlord in that case would be entitled to his share of the contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I am raising arises from a question I had on the Order Paper today to which I got a written reply.  The question was effectively and essentially concerned with asking the Minister for Justice whether he intends to introduce legislation to amend those provisions in the Courts Act, 1981, which would enable the District Court to determine custody proceedings as and from 12 May 1982 and which will from that date deprive the High Court of jurisdiction in such proceedings.  The reply I was given was to the effect that parliamentary questions <Col N="1398" /> about possible legislation presented particular problems for the Minister for Justice because of the very wide range of his responsibilities.  Effectively, the reply was that various policy questions about law reform have first to be discussed by the Minister with the Government.  It is clear from his reply that there is no intention to deal with the problem referred to by me in the question.</P>
      <P>What I particularly want to raise is the worry about what is going to happen as and from 12 May 1982 if no amending legislation is introduced by the Minister and in particular what plans the Minister and the Government have to deal with the ensuing problems.  The problem is a simple one.  It is that there are a great number of marriages breaking down and in a number of instances parents cannot agree as to which parent should have custody of children born to them.  As a result there has been a continuous stream of family law cases going into the courts dealing with different aspects of marital breakdown and family law.  In particular there has been a regular stream of such cases into the High Court.  The most recent statistics available to me show that in a 12-month period the High Court dealt with something approaching 1,000 custody cases.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is that, under the legislation passed by the previous Fianna Fáil administration, the High Court from 12 May will effectively lose its powers to deal with this area of law, will cease to have power to make custody orders, and this jurisdiction will be rransferred, willy nilly to the District Court.  It will be transferred out of the High Court, a court which for over 150 years has had power to deal with this area and in which it has developed a considerable expertise in determining such distressing cases.  The District Court at present has very limited powers in the area of family law and has had no experience of dealing with custody disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Government should consider introducing as rapidly as possible &mdash; if possible on the first day after the adjournment to this House for the Easter holidays &mdash; a Bill to remedy the situation and to remove that jurisdiction <Col N="1399" /> from the District Court and retain it in the High Court.  The reason for that is due not only to the fact that the members of the High Court have developed an expertise in that area while members of the District Court do not have such expertise, but that the District Court totally lacks proper court facilities throughout the country.  It is demeaning to the family in a nation whose Constitution upholds the institution of marriage and says we will defend it from attack, where we regard marriage as the most important institution and something worthy of protection.  Yet we are intending to tell people whose marriages have broken down that they can no longer go and have their custody disputes over any children resolved in the court which has the most experience in this area, that they must now go down to the District Court which has no experience.  If one looks at the facilities available in some of our District courts one sees the idiocy of this proposal to be implemented on 12 May. In some parts of the country District Court sittings are held in dance halls, in rugby football clubs, in dilapidated buildings that are sometimes simply one single room with no facilities for consultation with clients, for private discussions or privacy of any nature.  The District Court is totally both structurally and in regard to manpower, ill equipped to deal with such cases and it should not be given the power to deal with them until it is fully and properly equipped to do so.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Justice is not available and I understand the reason why he is not.  I presume the Minister present has been briefed by the Minister for Justice.  As this is not a matter of Government policy requiring all sorts of preparations, I would like to know whether the Minister intends to introduce emergency amending legislation after the recess.  If not, what steps will his Department take to provide the additional facilities that the District Court will require to enable this Act to be workable?  If those facilities are not provided, if additional district justices are not to be appointed, if additional social workers or court officers, who are presently doing <Col N="1400" /> some work in the area of marital problems, are not appointed to the District Court, we will have total chaos in our court system in the area of marital problems from 12 May.  We will have total confusion, not merely on the part of lawyers seeking to advise their clients, but also on the part of people caught up in the unfortunate predicament of facing a marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The chaos will be added to by the fact that depriving the High Court of power in this area is unconstitutional.  Therefore we will be creating a situation where we may have a logjam of family custody cases.  We will be creating a situation in which it will appear on the face of it that the High Court has no jurisdiction to deal with those cases.  The District Court or, alternatively the Circuit Court, which will also have jurisdiction and has equally little experience in this area, will find themselves in the position of trying to take up such cases under an Act which I believe may be constitutionally unsound. We will have a situation where couples whose marriages have broken down will find themselves in a complete limbo, unable to litigate in the High Court, unable to litigate in the District Court either because the structural facilities are not available for the cases to be heard or because the District Court is waiting for the determination of a constitutional decision in relation to the validity of this section in the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister in the interests of people whose marriages are in difficulty and who have sufficient problems without this legislation adding to them by placing them in this political limbo, to take immediate steps to repeal that section of the Courts Act 1981.  In case the Minister tries to give the justification his colleague gave to justify this position, that by conferring this jurisdiction on the District Court it would ease the legal cost burden of people who are parties to constitutional cases, I disabuse the Minister of that notion.  It is desirable that legal costs be reduced but where a custody case is fought between a husband and wife represented by lawyers in the District Court or High Court, the legal costs aspect is not relevant in the context of the form in <Col N="1401" /> which these cases are determined.  What is relevant is the type of work involved in the proceedings.  Many custody cases are not determined and dealt with in the courts within an hour or half-an-hour, which is the usual time a District Court takes when dealing with cases in the area of family law, but often can run for two or three days.  Whether that happens in a District Court in a dance hall in Lucan or in the High Court proper the same evidence will have to be called, the same professional and psychiatric witnesses will have to be present and the same degree of work will have to be done.</P>
    <P>It is dishonest to suggest that this measure will save money.  It will add to human misery and to the existing legal chaos we have in the area of family law.  If the Minister's colleague does not intend to introduce amending legislation, what specific plans have the Department and the Minister to make this provision work? What arrangements have the Department made to have suitable premises made available in which the courts can operate?  Does the Department know whether the President of the District Court has taken steps to ensure that his colleagues in that court are fully acquainted with the vast number of judgements delivered by the High Court in this area to ensure uniformity of approach when dealing with tragic cases of custody disputes between husband and wife?</P>
    <P>In case what I am saying is misinterpreted I do not believe that these types of cases should remain for all time within the High Court jurisdiction.  Before being a Member of the House, I advocated the establishment of a family court.  We should have a uniform and specialist system of family courts established to deal with all family law matters and matters arising particularly from marital breakdown. Under the system that exists at present with no legislation for the establishment of family courts, we must deal with the situation in the best way we can, which is to use the judicial expertise which resides in the courts and have such cases determined within those courts that have been used to dealing with them.</P>
    <P>The High Court has dealt with the vast <Col N="1402" /> majority of custody cases which have been determined over the years.  The Circuit Court had a jurisdiction but it was more theoretical than real.  There have been no more than half-a-dozen custody cases dealt with in the Dublin Circuit Court in the last 12 months.  The reason is that the expertise rests in the High Court and everyone knows this.  The manner of Circuit Court sittings has never lent itself to these cases being dealt with in a considerate and humane way. Instead of such disputes being heard in one, two or three days when the Circuit Court is involved, the parties may find themselves in court on a Tuesday, a week later on a Thursday and the following week on a different day and so on.  The process is dragged out and adds to the distress of the people involved.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give specific information as to what the Government intend to do in relation to this matter, whether we will have amending legislation or state, as an alternative, the facilities that will be provided.  Not merely does the Act deprive the High Court of jurisdiction to determine custody cases but it also appears to do so in a number of other areas, for example, maintenance applications.  What plans are afoot to ensure that the Circuit Court has proper facilities in this area?  What measures had the Minister and the Department implemented to ensure that all these matters are dealt within a proper, humane and speedy fashion, whether in the District Court or the Circuit Court?</P>
    <P>The Minister's answer to my question on today's Order Paper is disingenuous, to say the least.  It is an appalling reply from a Minister who has no knowledge or understanding of the whole area with which I am concerned.  Clearly neither he nor his officials made any inquiries to ascertain the problems in this area.  It shows no inkling of knowledge or wish to obtain, through his officials, the necessary knowledge to provide a sensible and substantive reply.  I am appalled by the long waffling answer given that if there is to be law reform the Minister must discuss it at Government level and so on. On 12 May this problem will arise.  The vast majority of people heading into <Col N="1403" /> court with a marital problem will find themselves in considerable confusion as will the courts, the lawyers and other professionals such as social workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply is an indictment of the lack of social concern this Government have.  It is indicative of the fact that the Government have no serious commitment to tackle the real problems that exist in the general area of family law and marital breakdown.  This is confirmed by the fact that there was no Minister of State appointed to the Department to deal with the area of law reform.  If there was such a Minister possibly there would be more understanding of the problem I am dealing with.</P>
    <P>There is an additional matter I should like to put on the record of the House so that the Government will have no excuse for not tackling the issue.  A commitment was given by Deputy Spring on 1 December 1981 that this provision in the Act would not be allowed to come into force. He stated that in the matter of family law anyone who attended a District Court in rural Ireland would appreciate that District Courts as presently constituted are not geared to cater for custodial matters in family law.  He went on to say that until certain steps were taken, he and the Minister for Justice were satisfied that these custodial matters should be dealt with in the manner in which they had been dealt with until then, that was within the High Court structure.  He said that until then as far as the District Court jurisdiction was concerned, the provision of the 1981 Act would not be introduced.  I have been advised that a Bill was under preparation to introduce necessary amending legislation to ensure that the events which are to befall us on 12 May will not happen. If the Minister or the Government have any desire to amend the provisions I have referred to, some of the preliminary work has been done.</P>

It was decided that, subject to compliance with the terms of the scheme, a grant of £15,000 would be made to St. Paul's Boxing Club, Lisduggan, towards the construction of a boxing gymnasium.</P>
    <P>All funds placed at my Department's <Col N="1332" /> disposal for the purpose of the scheme have been fully committed since 8 March 1982 and, accordingly, the question of making a grant to Dungarvan Youth Club cannot be considered at this stage.</P>
    <P>A list of projects located in Waterford city and county, towards the cost of which capital grants were approved in the period December 1979 to February 1981, and the amount of the grant approved in each case, is given in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, will be circulated with the official Report.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an accident at work, on 16 June 1981.  It was necessary before the claim could be authorised to have inquiries made as to the nature and origin of the incapacity. As there was some conflict as to the origin of the incapacity the inquiries proved more protracted than had been anticipated. In was eventually decided in December 1981 that the incapacity was due to an accident at work and the claimant was notified accordingly.  Payment of injury benefit should have been made at that stage but through an oversight the cheque did not issue until 26 March 1982.</P>

      <P>On completion of the inquiries it was accepted that the incapacity was in fact due to an accident at work and injury benefit was allowed at the maximum appropriate rate from 18 December 1981. Payment of all injury benefit and pay-related benefit due to 16 January 1982 after which date he was certified fit to resume work less the amount of interim disability benefit and pay-related benefit already paid has since been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 153, 154 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>These three questions all relate to possible legislation and I think it may be helpful to the House if I make a brief general statement on that issue.  What I have to say is not new &mdash; it follows the pattern of what has been said in the past when similar kinds of questions were asked.</P>
      <P>Parliamentary questions about possible legislation present particular problems for the Minister for Justice because of the very wide range of his responsibilities which cover virtually the entire area of the criminal law and large areas of the civil law.  Accordingly the range of possible parliamentary questions about legislation is almost unlimited.  Nearly all legislation on such issues requires extensive preparatory work and all legislation promoted by a member of the Government requires Government approval.  It is not practical to deal with the issues involved between the time a question is put down and the time it is answered in the House.  When Government approval is given for an announcement about legislation to be made, then it is made without delay in the normal course.</P>
      <P>It follows from this that I would very rarely be able at Question Time to make a useful statement about pending legislation because either I would not have Government approval for an announcement or, if I had, the announcement would already have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the situation with regard to the <Col N="1336" /> three questions I am now dealing with, all of which raise substantial issues of policy and indeed a number of legal and practical issues as well.  If and according as proposals for legislation, either on any of the matters mentioned or on any other major issues, reach the stage where the Government have approved of their being publicised, that will be done in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Even though it is stating the obvious, perhaps I should add, formally, that of course all the matters raised in the questions will be considered as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>May I add, in order to avoid any feeling that I might be responding to different questions in a discriminatory way, that what I have said now does not necessarily apply, for instance, to a question on a point of a technical character or one on which, because of some particular circumstance, I may be able to reply without specific reference to the Government, but this would be exceptional.</P>

      <P>Ireland's serious concern at the persecution of member's of the Baha'i Faith in Iran has been made clear both in contacts with the Iranian authorities and in international fora on a number of occasions recently.  On 9 March 1982 at a meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland appealed for an end to the attacks on the Baha'i Faith.  This session of the Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution, which Ireland co-sponsored, requesting the UN Secretary-General to enter into direct contact with the Iranian Government with a view to ensuring that the Baha'is are guaranteed full enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.  In January this year a démarche was made in Tehran to the Iranian Foreign Ministry by the Presidency (Belgium) acting on behalf of the Ten EC member states to express deep disquiet at the treatment of Baha'is and in particular the execution of leaders of the religion.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to follow developments affecting the situation of adherents of the Baha'i Faith in Iran and to use appropriate opportunities, in contacts with the Iranian authorities and in international bodies, to make known the concern felt in this matter.</P>

    <P>For 1982 the estimate of the total amount is £1,424 million.  The breakdown of this figure as between domestic and foreign payments will depend on the extent to which the Exchequer's borrowing needs in 1982 are financed from external sources.  As the amount of foreign borrowing is decided from time to time during the year having regard to the Exchequer's financing needs, sales of <Col N="1341" /> domestic securities, inflows from small savings schemes and the position of the external reserves it is not possible to provide a breakdown as between domestic and foreign components for 1982.</P>

      <P>A register of discretionary trusts is not kept by the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of capital taxation since trusts as such are not liable to a tax on capital.  The only statistical information available to the Commissioners in regard to these trusts is in respect of the years 1975 to 1977 when wealth tax was in operation and applied to discretionary trusts.  The number of such discretionary trusts ranged from 1,615 in 1975 to 1,316 in 1977.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the provisions proposed in the January 1982 budget in regard to discretionary trusts would have yielded £4 million in 1982 and £2½ million in 1983.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1981, my Department received in the order of 700 applications for capital grant assistance under the community, youth, recreational and employment programme.  The applications submitted included requests for financial assistance towards the provision of a Scout Den at Shantalla; the development <Col N="1353" /> of an outdoor education centre at Letterfrack and the provision of a community centre at Mervue.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce that a capital grant of £35,000 has been allocated to the 16th Galway Unit of the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland, towards the cost of erecting a scout den in the Shantalla area. Also a capital grant of £186,000 has been allocated to Galway Corporation towards the cost of providing a sports and community centre in Galway city.  It will be a matter for the elected members of Galway Corporation to decide on whether the grant of £186,000 will be spent on the provision of facilities in Mervue or at an alternative location.  Officers of my Department are arranging to discuss the proposed projects with the local organisers involved.</P>
    <P>The applications submitted by County Galway Vocational Education Committee and the Mervue/Ballybane Community Complex Organisation in respect of the development of recreational facilities at Letterfrack and Mervue, respectively, were not nominated for assistance under the capital scheme.</P>
    <P>As all funds placed at my Department's disposal for the purpose of the scheme were fully committed by the previous Government the question of making additional grants available cannot be considered at this stage.</P>

A cheque in respect of the period 28 January 1981 to 28 July 1981 was then issued to him.

This allowance is payable to an incapacitated pensioner aged 66 or over with whom there is living a prescribed relative who provides him with full-time care and attention.  With the exception of children under 18 or persons who are mentally or physically incapacitated no other person may reside with him while he is receiving the allowance.</P>
    <P>When the pensioner applied for the prescribed relative allowance in 1971 he stated that there was no person residing with him other than the daughter in respect of whom he claimed the allowance. In reply to an inquiry from my Department in August 1976 he again declared that this was the case.</P>
    <P>In November 1981 the local social welfare officer reported that in addition to another daughter, who was in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance, there were also two sons living in the house, each of whom was employed as a farm labourer.  In the circumstances as the conditions for receipt of the allowance were not fulfilled it was necessary to terminate it.</P>

      <P>A deciding officer of my Department assessed the person concerned with means in excess of the statutory limit derived from profits from farming and he was disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance.  He appealed against the decision on his claim and his case was referred to an appeals officer for determination.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer, whose decision is final, assessed him with means of £40.00 weekly.  The person concerned is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £11.70 being the maximum rate of £51.70 less means of £40.00.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of a partial contributory widow's pension since 1 November 1966 on her own insurance record, based on a yearly average of 30 contributions at the time of her husband's death in 1956.  The maximum rate of pension is applicable where the yearly average of contributions is not less than 48.  The difference at present between her pension of £27.75 a week and the maximum rate is only £1.25 a week.  Her pension will be increased to £34.70 a week from 2 April 1982.</P>
      <P>This woman is also presently in receipt of half-rate disability benefit of £13.90 a week from my Department, which will rise to £15.83 from 5 April 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed a widow's contributory pension on 22 May 1981 but according to the records of my Department she was not qualified for such pension on the basis of her late husband's insurance.  As, however, it appeared that her husband's insurance record might be incomplete, inquiries are continuing, to see if he had any insurable employment prior to 1974, which might serve to qualify her for her pension.</P>
      <P>On completion of these inquiries the widow will be notified of the outcome.  In the meantime she was asked if she wished to have her entitlement to a non-contributory widow's pension considered but she declined.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed <Col N="1360" /> unemployment benefit in respect of short periods of unemployment intermittently between September 1981 to March 1982. He was not entitled to unemployment benefit as he did not fulfil the statutory contribution condition and his claim was accepted for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was not available for interview when the social welfare officer called to investigate his means.  It is understood that he was employed between 15 October 1981 and 4 February 1982.  The social welfare officer is endeavouring to contact him and when inquiries are complete his means will be assessed and his unemployment assistance claim will be determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to records at my Department the person concerned did not claim disability benefit.  He did, however claim unemployment benefit from 12 September 1981 to 13 February 1982 and all flat-rate unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit to which he was entitled was paid.</P>
      <P>The increase in the rate of flat rate unemployment benefit paid in respect of one of his children was terminated on the date on which the child attained the age of 18 years.  No increase in flat-rate unemployment benefit is payable in respect of a child dependent after he attains the age of 18 years whether or not he is attending school.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit is based on a claimant's reckonable earnings during the relevant income tax year and the number of dependants has no bearing on the rate of pay-related benefit payable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 257, 258 and 259 together.</P>
      <P>The decision to locate the facility at Baldonnel was taken by my predecessor who in the period between the holding of the election and the change of Government entered into a binding commitment to purchase the site at Baldonnel.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the proposed waste centre is to provide a collecting point for those hazardous wastes for which alternative satisfactory means of disposal are not at present available.  It is intended that initially the centre will be used as a depot for the bulking up of wastes for export.  Treatment of waste may be undertaken at the centre in the future but only if this is seen to be justified by the quantities of waste being received and the economic considerations.</P>
      <P>The development of the centre will be undertaken by the National Building Agency who will be applying to Dublin County Council in the normal way for planning permission for the project.  The agency will be drawing on the best available expertise in the design and planning of the project thereby ensuring that the highest safety and environmental standards are observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there has been criticism of the project.  It would seem that this criticism is based in the main on a misconception of the nature and purpose of the proposed facility, as I have described it.  There have been repeated references to the provision of a toxic <Col N="1363" /> waste dump and it is understandable that this has caused unease.  I wish to give a categorical assurance that such a description is absolutely inaccurate.  No waste of any kind will be tipped or dumped on the site.  The facility will resemble a small factory or warehouse complex and will cause no more inconvenience than such an establishment would cause.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised and accepted at this stage that a facility of the kind planned is absolutely essential both as a support for industrial development and employment provision, and in order to avoid a situation in which potentially harmful wastes are disposed of by unsafe means.</P>
