      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 2 and 11 (resumed).</P>
      <P>By agreement, the proceedings on the motion for the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, 1982, and on the amendment thereto, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m.: and Members as follows shall be called by the Chair not later than the times specified: (i) 6.15 p.m. a Member nominated by the Workers' Party; (ii) 7 p.m. a Member nominated by the Labour Party; (iii) 8 p.m. a Member nominated by Fine Gael; (iv) 9 p.m. a Member nominated by the Government.</P>

      <P>The <i>Irish Times</i> contained a report two days ago that there would be legislation soon on Whitegate oil. According to this report a Government source confirmed that legislation would, as the source put it, &ldquo;be enacted&rdquo;, &mdash; although that is not up to any &ldquo;source&rdquo; to predict &mdash; within two weeks, ordering all oil importers in the Republic to take 35 per cent of their total requirements from Whitegate Oil Refinery.  Could I ask the Taoiseach whether it is intended to produce, before the summer recess, legislation to this effect?  If the answer is yes will he assure the House that the passage of any such legislation will not be accompanied <Col N="464" /> by consequential rises in the cost of oil products to consumers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a Bill to take over the Whitegate Oil Refinery.  It is merely a Bill to control the distribution of oil products which is a different thing. Will legislation to control the Whitegate Oil Refinery be enacted before the summer recess?</P>

      <P>What about legislation to control the Whitegate Oil Refinery? The Government are not introducing legislation to take over the Whitegate Oil Refinery but only to affect oil coming out of Whitegate.  It is not the Bill to take over the refinery.</P>

      <P>When the Minister for Finance is concluding the Finance Bill tonight will he indicate to the House what agreement he has come to with The Workers' Party tail that is now shaking the Fianna Fáil dog and if he will let us know what changes will be introduced on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The form of Deputy Barry's statements seems to have induced <Col N="465" /> silence on the part of the Tánaiste.  There is a serious intent behind the question, given that the Finance Bill departs so radically from the budget.  If it is proposed to have further departures, it is important that the House be informed of this in the concluding speeches tonight. Would the Tánaise indicate if there is an intention to introduce further amendments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thing about tonight is that the Fine Gael Party by their amendment propose to throw the finances of this country into chaos and to add £307 million to the public budget deficit.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. MacMahon Mr. MacMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>During the election campaign in February, the Taoiseach, through his representatives in the area, gave an undertaking that no jobs would be lost at the Clondalkin Paper Mills. Since his election as Taoiseach he has given a firm date on which the mill would reopen.  That date has now passed.  Could I ask the Taoiseach what the position is with regard to Clondalkin Paper Mills and when the necessary legislation of the Government's intention to take over the mill will come before the House?  Will he or Deputy Reynolds make a statement to the House to clarify matters.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is more relevant to a Question on the Adjournment and there are other ways of raising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised relates to intending legislation to take over the mill and it is entirely appropriate that it should be raised on the Order of Business.  When are we to have this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is required to take over the mill at Clondalkin. Surely the Taoiseach has made some arrangements by now.  Obviously the undertakings that were given to which I referred were given without any investigation whatsoever of the position of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  Surely the Minister has now discussed it with someone and there must be some plans to bring it before this House.  Could we be told when it will be brought before the House or if a firm date has been arrived at for the mill to open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, because a firm commitment was given that the Clondalkin Paper Mills would be open and in operation by 9 June and, if <Col N="467" /> necessary, they would be nationalised. Clearly, nothing has happened.  The mills were not opened in accordance with the Government's undertaking and the least we can expect is that a nationalisation Bill would be finalised.  It is a matter for the Taoiseach or the Minister to indicate when that Bill will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no notice of any intention to raise this matter.  I can only deplore this continual erosion of the standards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my experience it has always been the procedure that if Deputies wished to raise a matter of this sort, notice should be given to the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach.  However, the position in regard to Clondalkin Paper Mills, as the Deputies who are asking these questions know, is that I have arranged to meet all Deputies of both constituencies at an early date as soon as the Minister for Industry and Energy returns from the US where he is on an IDA promotion tour to discuss the situation fully and indicate to them the Government's plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I knew that I had to give notice to the Taoiseach but I already gave notice to the Tánaiste when I raised this matter on Friday last and he was not willing to answer.  Surely he must have since reported to the Taoiseach or the Cabinet he was representing in this House.  The Taoiseach's reply is most unsatisfactory. It is the first I have heard of any arrangement to meet the Deputies from either constituency.  I thought the Taoiseach might have gone a little further today and give some indication as to when the mill might open.  The workers in the area are now having meetings among themselves considering what further action they will take.  The Taoiseach knows that he was responsible for the workers withholding a document which they indicated they would release prior to the by-election in <Col N="468" /> west county Dublin and he personally arranged to meet them in the area on one of his visits &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a speech on the matter.  I am trying to facilitate the Deputy but he cannot hold up the House unnecessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach now give an indication as to when the mill will open or what new date is now being aimed at to have the mill reopened? Will he indicate how many jobs will be lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is more pertinent to a Question on the Adjournment. The Deputy has been given an answer and we will have to leave it at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach seems to be evading this question by referring to discussions with Deputies in the constituencies. As a Deputy from a rural area I think this is a matter of national concern and as a Member of this House I am entitled to know what is happening in this area just the same as any other Member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the permission of the Chair to raise the matter on the Adjournment?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question to the Taoiseach related to legislation because clearly nationalisation requires legislation and the Taoiseach is aware that there is no provision for such legislation in the programme submitted to us for the remainder of the session.  Would the Taoiseach accept therefore that there is no intention of taking any action on this matter until next October and that the promises made are obviously not being taken any way seriously by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion and I want to make it clear to the House that the Government undertakings <Col N="469" /> in regard to Clondalkin Paper Mills will be honoured in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach seriously if he is not satisfied that the display in the past few months in relation to issues like Clondalkin Paper Mills and his comment just now that he proposes to honour in full the various commitments he has given to the workers in Clondalkin is an absolute disgrace?  It is a disgrace that Irish industrial workers should be used in the manner of a pawn and in an outrageous way in which the future lives of these workers should be treated as a political game and statements made this morning by you that the commitments given in public will be honoured such as nationalisation and continued employment for 480 people, when you know perfectly well that there is no way in which you can deliver&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The key point of the issue was this.  The Taoiseach has referred to meeting Deputies on some future occasion but here we are talking about the Order of Business and the key issue is not a matter of meeting Deputies but of asking the Taoiseach when he is publishing this nationalisation Bill because the date has already gone by.  It is not a matter of the Taoiseach saying that he will comply with the commitments and promises given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only games being played in this House are being played by the Opposition parties with the jobs of these workers.  They kept the workers and their representatives traipsing in and out of this House over a period of six months.  We have given a firm commitment <Col N="472" /> in regard to the opening and continued operation of Clondalkin Paper Mills&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Out of my unfailing courtesy to Members of the House I offered to meet all the Deputies from both constituencies to discuss the situation fully with them and I propose to keep that promise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the failure to put such a measure forward in the legislative programme for this session means that such a measure cannot now be enacted before November and that consequently there is no prospect of the factory being reopened as a nationalised factory before then and that the Taoiseach's promise that it would reopen by 9 June will be in default by at least six months even if he proceeds? Does he accept that that is factually the position?</P>

May I suggest that not only is the Taoiseach misleading the House but that what he has said is untrue?  He cannot honour the undertakings given to the workers in this case since one of those undertakings was that the <Col N="473" /> mills would open on 9 June.  We all know that has not happened.  The workers, the public representatives and all the people in the area who are concerned about this matter are entitled to an explanation but there has not been any utterance either from the Taoiseach or from the Minister. Because of the unsatisfactory nature of what we might call the debate here this morning I wish with your permission to raise the matter on the Adjournment.</P>

    <P>(a) in departing significantly from the terms of the Budget as outlined in the Financial Statement by the Minister for Finance in March 1982, it confers concessions solely on the relatively well off, while giving no equivalent concessions to the low-paid as was proposed in the Family Income Supplement provisions of <Col N="480" /> the Budget presented to the House in January 1982,</P>
    <P>(b) in granting concessions in regard to PRSI, it does so in such a way as to give maximum benefit to the well-paid, and little or no benefit to the low-paid,</P>
    <P>(c) it aggravates national economic difficulties by measures, in regard to payments in advance of Value-Added Tax and Corporation Tax, which will cause losses of jobs in many vulnerable businesses, and will worsen the national budgetary situation for 1983 by using up revenue that would otherwise be available in that year, and</P>
    <P>(d) it does not provide for any long-term reform of the PAYE system as was contained in the proposal for the introduction of a system of tax credits in the January Budget, while it fails to seek other sources of revenue by abandoning any proposal to reduce tax avoidance through discretionary trusts.&rdquo;</P>

Unhappiness with the tax system has been widespread for many years.  Its first manifestation was the clamour for the reduction and eventual abolition of domestic rates.

I will deal with the latter question first and then deal with the general unfairness of the tax system.</P>

    <P>In the minds of civil servants who operate it, PRSI may be an insurance scheme.  Indeed, the insurance aspect of it may have been widely understood and accepted by workers when it was first introduced or in its earlier form of insurance stamps.  However, I do not believe that most workers now regard PRSI as an insurance scheme.  To most of them it is just another tax levied at quite high rates <Col N="481" /> with little possibility for evasion.  The insurance aspect makes even less sense to employers.  To them it is a straight pay roll tax, an overhead for the use of labour and an incentive to replace labour with machinery on which there is no tax.</P>
    <P>I accept that pay-related benefits were sought for many years by the trade unions to cushion the effects on their members of sudden unemployment, and they would not wish to return to a flat rate benefit.  I also know that the complete abolition of PRSI and its incorporation into the general tax scheme would cause problems.  We ought, we are told, to retain a broad range of taxes and not be too dependent on a small number of taxes.  Some permanent adjustment of the PRSI system is necessary.  The concession granted this year is fine as far as it goes but it is extremely complicated and is not a permanent solution.  Some more radical changes affecting both the employees and employer contributions are required.  An employee's contribution could be regarded as part payment of tax or as an allowance.  The high tax on employment which the employer pays should be replaced, preferably by some form of tax on capital which would encourage rather than discourage employment.</P>
    <P>All this implies that the Government should abandon the concept of PRSI as insurance and accept the common view of it as a direct tax.  I hope this matter has been taken into account by the Commission on Taxation.  Their review will be second rate if they consider PRSI solely as insurance and not as a tax.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the subject of tax reform.  I am encouraged by various leaks of information to believe that the commission will come up with some worthwhile findings, and I urge the Government to implement their recommendations as soon as possible. Too many commissions have found their work on library shelves covered with cobwebs, and seldom has their work reached the Statute Book.  As the report is to be available soon, the Minister is correct in not proceeding this year with the changes proposed by the Coalition.  Tax reform is urgently needed.  A large amount of the <Col N="482" /> total income earned is not declared for tax, partly because of high rates, although for the vast majority of taxpayers this is not the main reason.  They evade the payment of tax because they are convinced that others are not paying their fair share and they feel a keen sense of injustice.  In this way tax evasion feeds on itself.  The more evasion there is thought to be, the more otherwise fair-minded people feel justified in doing their little bit.  Tax evasion has grown considerably during the past ten years and in my opinion it is contributing to the weakening of morality in the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Apart from making the tax burden fairer there must be an effective deterrent to tax evasion.  Too often evaders are allowed to pay off the outstanding amounts without extra interest, often in instalments, and no charges are preferred. Although various Ministers for Finance have promised more effective deterrents and stiffer penalities, and some of these have been passed into law, I see little evidence of tax evaders being punished as they should be and there is therefore no example to deter others.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the provisions of the Bill which make the tax system more just and limit possibilities for avoidance or evasion, both of which are fiddles against the man in the street who cannot afford accountants' fees and is not into the &ldquo;nixer&rdquo; business.  I am glad that business entertainment expenses can no longer be used to reduce a company's tax bill.  Entertainment expenses are a scandal and are part of the reason for the high cost of eating out in Dublin.  A large part of the turnover in the ritzier joints was being paid for by the tax man.</P>
    <P>I am glad also that there is to be a special tax on the profits accruing from the sale of building land.  We in the corporation could see massive profits being made with little or no risk, sometimes arising directly from corporation decisions to build houses or provide services in an area.  The recent court decision to force local authorities either to give planning permissions or pay penal damages was also quite galling.  I am glad that at least some of the profits being made can, even at this late stage, find their way back <Col N="483" /> to the Exchequer.  The proposal to tax at realistic levels company cars supplied to employees with sometimes minimal official travel is welcome.  I am also in agreement with the tax on bank profits.  All these proposals will meet with general agreement among working class people, who are most upset with the present system which appears to give large advantages to the self-employed and the middle classes.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government proposed in their budget to tax short-term social welfare benefits.  I will be interested to read what the commission will have to say about this, but I feel that my party would not agree with such a suggestion. To tax short-term social welfare benefits would be wrong and the collection of such a tax would be very difficult.  The Coalition's proposal was short sighted, and I am glad the House would not agree to it.</P>
    <P>The high rates of short-term benefits may discourage some people from working because their take-home money may be greater on the dole.  I accept that there are certain abuses of the system but I do not think that taxing benefits is the answer.  However, people should not be better off on the dole than when working. If the Minister is discussing PRSI with the trade unions he might suggest taxing benefits as part of the price for lower contributions or tax free contributions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the remainder of the budget proposals.  I am glad the Minister has abolished the Coalition's proposal to impose VAT on clothing and to remove food subsidies.  It was a national scandal that a Government supported by a Labour Party could introduce such insensitive proposals.  Some of the people who framed the budget do not appear to have known the price of a loaf of bread.  The budget fell because it was totally unacceptable to the majority of the people, irrespective of their political affiliations. It was an unjust budget which proposed to tax the weakest sections.  Food and clothing must be bought by people every day and they cost enough as it is.  The Minister is to be complimented on abolishing those two items.  A Government <Col N="484" /> who would introduce such provisions are unfit to govern.  This revised budget will go a long way towards alleviating poverty and stimulating employment, despite the pedlars of doom and gloom on the other side of the House.  We are on the right road now and I look forward to the implementation of the provisions of this Bill in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak in support of the amendment in the name of Deputy Bruton and, in doing so, I want to be as objective as possible given the provocation that has just come from the opposite side of the House.  It was interesting to hear Deputy Brennan, speaking allegedly objectively, about the fitness of Deputies on this side to form a Government.  I do not want to become involved in any sort of hassle or across the floor sneering.  The situation is far too serious for that.</P>
      <P>I do not have the benefit of a prepared script such as Deputy Brennan had but I want to raise nevertheless various points which I consider relevant to this Bill, to the amendment and to the needs of those who will be affected by this measure.  The reason why this amendment has been tabled is because of the changes that have occurred in this Bill in direct contradiction to the Minister's budget statement, the result of which is to make this Bill totally dissimilar from the budget statement of the Minister delivered in this House only a few weeks ago.  We on this side are at a loss to understand how in eight or ten weeks the Minister's budget strategy could have changed so dramatically. We wonder how he could have got the advice of his Government and his civil servants so wrong eight or ten weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to implement the budget statement.  Instead of doing that this Bill, containing so many changes, is a separate document altogether almost and has very little relevance in very many areas to the Minister's budget statement, to the objectives he then set himself, objectives he said would have to be achieved.  I wonder why the changes have been made.  To what pressure groups has the Minister bowed in <Col N="485" /> the interval?  I suspect that the bowing in the capital gains tax area has been to the party backers.  If there is going to be a constant looking over one's shoulder and changing one's mind every couple of weeks at the behest of party backers in a general election &mdash; there may be one very soon&mdash;then the Government will not be able to govern the country as it should be governed.  Fighting general elections in this democracy should be funded by the state and the sooner we get down to providing funds for that purpose the better it will be.  As matters stand Fianna Fáil are too much in the pockets of big business, and therefore answerable to big business, and that is why so many changes have taken place in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>When in Government in the years 1973-1977 we introduced in 1975 capital gains tax as part of the general reform of the tax system.  The Taoiseach has a reputation as the man who reformed the VAT system.  He is also alleged to know a great deal about finance.  He has spoken about our VAT legislation.  That legislation is no different in principle from that of any other country in Europe.  Has he ever really made any fundamental changes to brought in any fundamental reforms?  Reforms in the area of taxation were made in the years 1973-1977 when capital gains tax, wealth tax, taxation of farmers, corporation tax and capital acquisition tax were introduced.  In that period the whole area of taxation was dealt with properly.  Of course then we had the Government which was governing. We had a government which did not have to look over its shoulder all the time.</P>
    <P>People are genuinely concerned about the present situation.  When we were in Government they did not like some of the taxes we introduced but they took them on the chin.  There was very little attempt at real government when the party opposite had a majority of 20 seats in this House.  Leadership is not about getting votes but about directing and helping people to achieve what they want to achieve.  If the people were given a choice tomorrow I believe they would change their allegiance to those who <Col N="486" /> would not seek office by pandering to the electorate, something which was all too obvious in the last general election.  The people are crying out for leadership. There is evidence of that in many areas. Even in Northern Ireland people are now responding to efforts at proper leadership. The sooner we get proper leadership the more we will be respected.  The people are waiting for leadership and they will respond to leadership.</P>
    <P>We introduced capital gains tax in 1975.  The Fianna Fáil Government between 1977-1981 made changes in that legislation which resulted in capital gains tax being practically abolished.  They introduced the time scale measure and the multiplier relief which meant the abolition of tax for a large number of people.  This enabled those people to make big profits by selling land, shares and so on.  They did not have to pay capital gains tax but the man earning £30 a week had to pay PAYE.  That is the equity and the justice the people got from Fianna Fáil.  In our budget earlier this year we took steps to bring more people back into the capital gains tax net.  Fianna Fáil introduced the present measure with the support of the so called Workers Party to enable people to make vast sums because of not having to pay capital gains tax.  Our budget proposal was deleted in March and money was given back to those who could well afford to contribute to the running of the country.  Further changes still are proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>All citizens should contribute equitably to taxation.  The burden should not rest on the man with a small income, a big family and a mortgage.  The sooner steps are taken to bring about a truly equitable system of taxation the sooner will the country move forward in the right direction.  There is a patent absence of reality at the moment which results in an unfair burden being placed on the shoulders of the working classes.  We must get it across to the wealthy that they will have to contribute their share to the running of the state irrespective of who is in Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in mortgage interest proposals.  The Minister has not quite gone back to what we proposed to <Col N="487" /> do in our January budget but he has had second thoughts and he is now proposing to go some of the way towards what we were proposing to do.  He has not said how he will pay for this.  He has not told us from whence the money will come. Had he left it as it was in our budget in January those burdened with mortgages would have greater relief, a relief which is their due.  Everybody knows that the mortgage interest rates are phenomenal. A £15,000 mortgage could cost in the region of £55 per week and about £50 of that would be interest.  It is only right that people in that category, particularly those below a certain income, should be given income tax relief.  The Minister has gone back to our proposals, but not in the capital gains tax area, to raise funds to pay for this.  How is he to pay for this? Where is he to get the £45 million to pay for the changes in PRSI?  I welcome those changes, and they are very good, but we provided for the income on the other side of the account in our budget.  We set down precisely where the income was coming from and where the expenditure would be, and the tricksters come along and say that we will do this, that and the other.  At the end of the year when the books do not balance and the deficit is £1,000 million or whatever the chickens will come home to roost and we will have to answer for it, unless we have an election before then, which is probably what will happen.  They will bail out before they are bailed out because no financial management is coming from the Government, as is patently clear to anybody with even the slightest knowledge of finances.</P>
    <P>We have in the Taoiseach a very experienced accountant who knows a great deal about dealing with books, and there are many ways of balancing books and showing figures and bringing Estimates before this House which do not reflect the real situation.  Take for instance the City of Dublin VEC.  When you discount the salary portion of their budget for 1981 not only was their non-salary income less than in 1980 but it was less than had been given in 1979.  That is what Fianna Fáil did in 1981.  Those figures do not show up in the Estimates, so <Col N="488" /> you leave public bodies short of funds and the Estimates go through the House as if everything was hunky-dory.  What happened?  The Coalition Government in their budget of September last year had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to bail the VEC out and ensure that those attending vocational schools and colleges in this city got the necessary funds to enable them to get the education they deserve, and thus kept the system going. We come back to this year, and Fianna Fáil have done it again.  The City of Dublin VEC is £2.5 million short even to get by for this year.  I do not know whether we will have another Fine Gael or Coalition Government by the end of the year to bail them out, but somebody must bail them out.  We cannot continue to cut, because if we want public services we must pay for them and we must provide for them in this House, not providing for them in January and coming along in September saying that we under-provided, when such under-provision occurred not because of mis-calculations but because of deliberate calculations, surely just to show that the finances of the country are better when everybody knows that that is not the position.</P>
    <P>People talk about two forms of taxes, progressive and regressive.  There are three forms, progressive, proportionate and regressive.  Progressive tax is where the percentage of taxation increases as income increases.  Regressive tax is the opposite, where a disproportionate amount of tax is taken.  This is often referred to as a poll tax because of the way it was used against negroes in the deep South of America.  From the way it is used in this country one would think we had a few negroes here, at least in some parts of this city.  In other parts there is surely a type of discrimination intended to buy one vote to keep the Government where they are.  The third form of taxation is proportionate, where everybody gives a fixed proportion, one-tenth, a tithe or whatever.  We are getting further and further away from progressive taxation and we have come back to regressive taxation.  The tax provisions in the Fianna Fáil budget compared <Col N="489" /> with our budget in January are without question, regressive.  They are taking more income from those who can least afford to contribute and there is no sign of reform.  We have started down the road in the opposite direction.  Regressive taxation is the order of the day instead of getting back to some form of fair taxation which we all know is required and what all the marches were about.  Fianna Fáil have turned their backs on those people and have made changes in the PAYE and PRSI proposals which are regressive and which cause those who can least afford to do so to contribute more.</P>
    <P>In the budget in January we on this side of the House had gone for indirect taxation in preference to further PAYE taxation.  We had widened the tax bands and introduced the family income supplement to assist those families whose income was below a certain figure.  Given the difficulties that we faced at that time, that was a courageous and honest step to take.  Given that difficulties of which everybody is now aware had accumulated over the years and had to be dealt with, it was a courageous, fair-minded thing to do at that time, yet even though it reduced the burden on the PAYE taxpayer, the Government decided to scrap all that and to give back funds to the capital gains tax people in the bigger income group and make PAYE people pay further for this.  In changing the tax bands we proposed they reduced those bands to make the PAYE earners go back to high rates of tax more quickly and contribute more.  I cannot see the justice in that.  I do not believe that their budget from start to finish was thought out on the basis of justice, fairness, need or anything objective.  It was thought out purely on &ldquo;What can we get from the House and on what can we con the people and the Workers Party Deputies to get this Bill through?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Workers Party described this as a very good budget.  Is a good budget one that increases PAYE for the workers? Where are the workers' representatives now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>They have supported measures in this House to increase further the PAYE on the workers and to give back funds to the capital gains tax people.</P>
      <P>I want to say something about evasion and avoidance.  There is very little difference between the two, as Deputy Brennan rightly said.  One is the legal way of doing it.  If the man in the street could afford accountants' fees he would do it as well.  Since it is the wealthy classes who avoid tax, the amount involved is great. It is looked on as being very clever if one can avoid tax.</P>
      <P>Tax evasion and avoidance have always been with us.  When income tax was first introduced during the Napoleonic wars there was avoidance.  It is amusing to think now that at one time a person could be taxed on the number of dogs he owned, or the number of windows in one's house or on hair powder. People used to sell their dogs, block up their windows and stop using hair powder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must come to terms with tax evasion and avoidance and deal with it in moral terms.  The situation cannot continue where people on low incomes, which are known, are contributing to the running of the State while those whose income is not known are not contributing anything but are living in very good circumstances. Such people live in very big houses and have very big cars.  Where does the money come from?  In some cases we know that it comes from tax avoidance and evasion.  The sooner it is realised that it is not very clever to be a tax evader and that other people have to <Col N="491" /> contribute to keeping evaders where they are the better it will be.</P>
    <P>As regards the economic situation in which we find ourselves I should like to rehash my maiden speech which I made on the last Finance Bill.  The problems we have now came about between 1977 and 1981 for a number of reasons.  I have already said that between 1973 and 1977, the Coalition Government set about governing the country and not everyone liked the way they did it.  They took things in hand and brought in tax reforms.  When they left office they had brought the inflation rate down to 6¼ per cent.  The national debt, which had accumulated over 25 years, was £5,000 million.  The current deficit was somewhere in the region of £200 million.  Having gone through the first modern recession they came out of it with things pretty well in hand.  The country was governed, inflation was down, tax reform was introduced and then there was the general election.  Fianna Fáil promised everything and to their amazement they got a 20 seat majority.  Then they had to implement the things they promised.  The effect of implementing them recklessly meant that by the end of 1981 the national debt had doubled to £10,000 million.  Between 1977 and 1981 they had borrowed more than had been borrowed in the previous 25 years.  That shoved up inflation and unemployment rose.  In the short term of Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach at that time, employment rose by 40 per cent. Hopefully, his reign this time as Taoiseach will be even shorter.  We are now paying for the recklessness that went on during 1977 and 1981.  We should now be in a position where we should be ready to bounce back in terms of economic recovery.  While other countries have started to recover we still have a millstone around our necks.  That is where our problem started and it is a problem that is still with us.</P>
    <P>In relation to borrowing the Central Bank Report of 31 December 1981 states:</P>
    <P>A recovery in the world economy is expected over the next eighteen months..... The coexistence for several <Col N="492" /> years past of high inflation and large public sector and balance of payments deficits &mdash; all of which are contributing to the present historically high level of interest rates &mdash; will make it harder for Ireland to exploit fully the benefits of international recovery.</P>
    <P>There is a millstone around our necks which was placed there by Fianna Fáil and now they have not the gumption to face up to it and try to get the economy in shape, not for the sake of balancing the books but to get back the 80 per cent of our income tax which we pay in interest to foreign bankers.  This would help create employment for young people.  We have the fastest growing young population in the western world.  There is no hope for them unless we take the economy in hand.  Fianna Fáil are running away from the problem and the sooner they realise they will not be the largest party for very long because they did not face up to the problems confronting the country, the better for them.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank also stated that the large external deficit constituted the principal constraint on our economic target, a point which was stressed consistently by the bank in recent years.  Last year, the current balance of payments deficit reached the unprecedented level of £1,300 million, equivalent to 13 per cent of national output.  The forecast for 1982 is that an improvement in the trade balance will be offset by higher interest payments on foreign debts, leaving the external deficit at the same absolute level as in 1981 &mdash; although somewhat lower as a percentage of nominal GNP.  The problem is that no progress is being made. Fianna Fáil brought down our Government in January when we were on the second leg of the correction referred to in the report.  They came back and started to talk about boom and bloom as if they could wave a magic wand and this would come about.  The only bloom we will ever have is Bloomsday unless we get down seriously to managing the economy.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank Report continues:</P>
    <P>However, spending associated with high public sector deficits, accompanied and accentuated by excessive <Col N="493" /> incomes increases, have also been major factors behind the growth in the balance-of-payments deficit.  Because of their scale, the public sector deficits have had to be financed mainly by substantial foreign borrowing, leading to a level of Government external debt at the end of 1981 of £3,725 million or more than five times greater than in the mid-1970s.</P>
    <P>&mdash; more than five times greater than in the mid-70s, and that is our external debt only.</P>
    <P>Servicing this debt has not only pre-empted a progressively larger share of Government current revenue but has also itself become a major factor contribution to the rise in the external deficits.</P>
    <P>The servicing of the debt has now become a major factor in our external deficit. Even the payment of interest on this vast debt built up by Fianna Fáil has become a major factor contributing to our external deficit itself.  That simply cannot continue. We know it cannot continue, the people know it cannot continue.  Indeed in the first general election of this year the people showed they were prepared, they knew things were bad, they realised that sacrifices had to be made but they were prepared to come to terms with it. Now purely through falsehoods emanating from the far side of the House they are being told that is not necessary at all, that Fianna Fáil will do this and that. Everybody knows a sacrifice must be made in the interests of people generally. It is the job of government to pass legislation and run this country in the interests of the people, not in self-interest.  The sooner we get back to that attitude the better and the greater will be the response from the people.</P>
    <P>In the Central Bank Report they say that the planned reduction of the current deficit would be the fulcrum of an economic plan.  When we introduced our budgets of July and January last we said they formed part of a plan.  We said specifically what would be the current deficit at the end of 1982.  I think it would have been something in the region <Col N="494" /> of £700 million had we followed the plan we had laid down.  We had planned to eliminate that budget deficit over a specific four-year period.  Not once from those Government benches, in any speech made whether at the opening of a pig parlour or in this House in introducing a Bill, not once have we been told that there is a specific planned period for the elimination of that deficit.  The Central Bank says&mdash;as does anybody who knows the situation&mdash;that the elimination of the current budget deficit over a specified period is the fulcrum of an economic plan.</P>
    <P>It is time that this target was pinned on the Government.  If they continue on their present path certainly we shall not have the current deficit at the end of the year they forecast of something in the region of £650 million, or whatever was the figure.  But if all the promises they have made at the recent by-election and to the various pressure groups are to be fulfilled and paid for, and the changes in this Finance Bill paid for, then not alone shall we not eliminate the current deficit over a planned period of four years but the deficit will be much larger than was forecast for the end of this year.  The Government must have a specified plan for the reduction and eventual elimination of the current budget deficit over a specific period.  That is something about which we have heard nothing from them, and it simply must be tackled.</P>
    <P>Had our budget of September last not been introduced not alone would the budget deficit this year not have been of the order of £650 million&mdash;leaving aside any additional commitments entered into since September last&mdash;but the current budget deficit at the end of this year would be of the order of £1,500 million. If one adds to that the promises the Fianna Fáil Government have made in the meantime, without taking any other changes into consideration, then it must be realised that we would be heading for something in the region of a £2,000 million budget deficit at the end of this year. As a result of the changes we brought about in our September budget and intended bringing about in our January budget we were heading for a deficit of <Col N="495" /> £700 million, to be eliminated over a four-year period.  God only knows what sort of deficit we are now heading for. Certainly the Minister for Finance does not know.  I do not think even the Taoiseach knows, but sooner or later the people will know.  I do not know what will be the answer at that point, but we must tackle the problem of our current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>The public expect leadership.  They know that the day of the promises, carrots and so on is gone.  They do not want them; it did not work in the Dublin West By-election and will not work in a general election.  People want real leadership. They want opportunities for their children and they are prepared to make sacrifices if done on a fair basis.  Let us get down to that real task, the central part of which should be the reduction and eventual elimination of our current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank Report says further.</P>
    <P>In order to adhere to the original budgetary dispositions, significant extra taxation will have to be imposed (or expenditure reductions effected) to make good this year the revenue forgone through recent tax concessions. In addition, the non-recurring nature of some of this year's revenue will create difficulties for fiscal policy in 1983.</P>
    <P>That is putting in formal language what I said earlier, that the promises made and changes effected must be paid for.  But where in this Finance Bill are we told the money will come from?</P>
    <P>With regard to the non-recurring nature of some of the measures adopted it will be noted that the Government are bringing forward taxation from next year into this year which should have been left to the ensuring year, not merely because it will be needed next year but because people being asked to pay this year on account of the general economic situation, are not in a position to do so.  The Fianna Fáil proposal to bring forward corporation tax payments into this year is purely a book-balancing operation placing an enormous burden on companies, <Col N="496" /> particularly small ones.  It is threatening employment, adversely affecting cash flows and, in the case of some companies putting them into liquidation.  We all are aware of the number of redundancies that have taken place in recent months.  It will be interesting to see how many factories will have closed by the end of this year.  If we examine the number that closed during the last term of office of Fianna Fáil we shall see that there was a very large increase. The bringing forward of the payment of corporation tax into this year will cause chaos for many companies already experiencing difficulties, companies already finding it difficult to tick over, those endeavouring to shelter from the economic storm and maintain their current employment levels, and will put many of them over the hill with a resultant increase in unemployment.  Yet that proposal was brought in here at the stroke of a pen by the Taoiseach.  To a great extent also that responsibility lies with the present Minister for Education, Professor O'Donoghue, who contributed so much to the reckless performance between the years 1977 and 1981.  The collection of that corporation tax this year is a disastrous proposal.  Already we can see that it has raised the white flag <i>vis-á-vis</i> the redundancy race.  It will take very little more to cause massive redundancies. We should be encouraging people to take on more employees, eliminating any disincentives existing at present, so that we can provide people with jobs and maintain their employment.  But that is not what is happening.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one point made by Deputy N. Brennan with regard to tax on clothes.  I believe there are a lot of people who would be prepared to pay VAT on the one or two suits they buy in a year rather than be squeezed in the way they are being squeezed by a combination of PAYE and PRSI.  I believe there are a lot of clothes companies who have second thoughts about the wisdom of imposing some form of VAT or indirect taxation as against what has happened.  The purchasing power of the consumer has been reduced to such an extent that sales of consumer goods, including clothes, are falling rapidly.  Those clothes companies <Col N="497" /> will have cash flow problems to add to their difficulties as a result of corporation tax being brought forward, and they will have to pay higher petrol charges which their competitors in Czechoslovakia and all the other countries will not have to pay, although they will have to pay VAT like everybody else.  The 1 per cent VAT on clothes imported will cause a general decline in sales because it will cause a general increase in prices for domestic and imported goods.</P>
    <P>I believe if the people in the clothing business, the St. Bernard branch of Fianna Fáil, had looked at this thing objectively and said to themselves: &ldquo;what is the best thing for our companies in terms of employment and in terms of profitability, cash flow and continuation?&rdquo; And if they had known that those proposals were the alternatives we were talking about they would have had very serious second thoughts.  They are not very good businessmen when they did not see that coming.  They have been sold a pup and they have got a lot to answer for. Many of them, who are Fianna Fáil supporters, in any event would benefit in other ways, so the propaganda put out would not be balanced and objective.  If they set about an objective analysis they would find, in terms of employment for the people in the industry, in terms of profitability and cash flow and encouragement to keep people employed, what was in the January budget was much better than what has come since.  There are many examples that can be given of that.</P>
    <P>There are some other aspects of the Finance Bill I want to refer to, such as the changes being made in the proposals put forward by Deputy Bruton in his January budget to tax discretionary trusts, which is another payment back to the party backers.  We all know that there should be a tax on discretionary trusts, but it is being eliminated because some wealthy party backers have telephoned somebody, put on pressure and said they will not contribute any more if this is the sort of tax which is to be introduced.  The party system, particularly Fianna Fáil, have become dependent on this sort of pressure.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to introduce legislation to <Col N="498" /> finance the party from the State and let there be no apology to anybody for it.  It is in the public interest.  We should not pay any heed to these self-interest groups who constantly come looking for all sorts of favours and all sorts of special treatment on the basis of lining their pockets.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were not always in the sorry state they are in now.  At one time they were a good party.  They did things, they governed, particularly during the late Sean Lemass's time.  They are in a very sorry state now.  They have not brought in any real reform anytime they were in Government in the last decade. What has happened to the fighting spirit? What has happened to the moral fibre there used to be in that party?</P>

      <P>If the Chair can point to where I have moved away from the proposals before the House I will accept that.  My opinion is that I have not moved away from them, I will conclude by saying that the reforms which have come before the House have all come from the Coalition <Col N="500" /> Government between 1973 and 1977 and last year.  Even in the short term of office of the Coalition Government then we had the Housing Finance Agency, which was a deliberate and determined attempt in difficult circumstances to come to terms with the enormous housing problem we face in the country and particularly in this city.  The Youth Employment Agency was introduced and provided for.  A sum of £20 million was provided for the National Enterprise Board, but that was reduced to £5 million by Fianna Fáil with the support of the Workers Party, the people who talk all the time in their propagandist papers about employment and the need for the State to create employment. Where have all these things gone?  When will the Housing Finance Agency start functioning?  When will we see funds being provided for those people to function?</P>
      <P>The bite has gone out of the Fianna Fáil administration.  There is nothing in the Finance Bill to give any sort of moral, financial or economic leadership.  The amendment put forward by Deputy Bruton should be fully supported.  He is to be commended for putting down that motion and he is to be commended for his consistency in being as courageous as he has been.  I fully support the amendment and I call on the Government to stop borrowing for day-to-day purposes and day-to-day spending.  If the borrowing is for investment purposes which will create employment and give a return that is another thing and there is no objection to it from this side of the House.  The objection of this side of the House is to borrowing for day-to-day expenditure. The essence of the amendment is to try to bring back to the Government the economic realities to govern the country as it should be governed.  If the Government take the economic needs of the country seriously then they will have to support this amendment.  I want to record my full support for the amendment before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill, as an instrument of taxation, is concerned with the raising of revenue to give effect <Col N="501" /> to the Government programmes for economic development and the public service.  To that extent, no finance or tax Bill can be viewed in isolation. It is the action necessary to fund the necessary services to implement the economic and social programme.  The Minister, in introducing Second Stage here, said that these new provisions in this Finance Bill would cost just £2½ million over and above what he had suggested in his budget.  He was, thereby, acknowledging the linkage between the purposes of the Finance Bill and the overall Government programme as introduced in a budget.</P>
      <P>Looking for the moment at taxation itself, in April 1980, I asked the Commission on Taxation to look at the whole question of taxation generally, and, in particular, to consider three heads &mdash; firstly, equity in taxation; secondly, the need to ensure economic and social development, because one could not view taxation in isolation; thirdly, to ensure an adequate tax level.  Those three heads were then, and are now, inexplicably interlinked, so that when we consider, either in this House or outside it, levels of taxation we cannot isolate them from the overall level of public service and public service expenditure.  Our narrow tax base is one of the reasons why I set up the Commission on Taxation, far too narrow having regard to the level deriving from the PAYE sector &mdash; which, incidentally, as I said at that time, is not attributable to the employed worker in the sense in which we normally understand it, something like 20 per cent of PAYE payment coming from the small companies themselves paying PAYE. That said, we have a very narrow tax base, because of which, from time to time, there is considerable impatience. Unfortunately, we do not get the same realistic approach in considering the most effective way of easing the burdens of the taxpayer, which does not necessarily mean spreading the burden more widely. I believe firmly that it is now a question of the ratio between tax and the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a notion here inherited, <Col N="502" /> from the time of great growth in the sixties, that the only question about public service, like salaries, is by what level of increments it increases.  We have seen a great advance in public service in a whole range of areas, but the present reality is that people recognise that the question is no longer just by what level of increments public service cost will increase by the service itself, but rather how we can examine the service with a view to minimising the level of taxation. This has become a key issue in the running of the economy and, equally, a key issue in the minds of the public.</P>
    <P>In many areas, we have reached the point &mdash; and, objectively, most people will agree &mdash; of almost a maximum tolerance in relation to the level of tax.  For that reason, many of our Departments, and particularly the big spending Departments, must now recognise that their future role cannot be &mdash; and, for that matter, never has been &mdash; in the interests of lessening the burden of taxation when we introduce Bills such as this, one of administration, of passing out what is made available to them under budget or any other proposals.  Any Minister for Finance who can get under control these big spending Departments, Health, Social Welfare and Education, will have gone a long way to getting the budget deficit under control.</P>
    <P>I propose to exclude, to a great extent, Education from what I have to say in this area because of the whole need for training in education for employment of our growing population, to which Deputy Mitchell referred.  There are elements in some of our services which can be looked at with a view to reducing the burden of taxation, thereby reducing the current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health particularly, should insist on not just being a channel of public expenditure.  They have an obligation which, speaking from my experience as Minister for Finance, I am not convinced they have always readily accepted.  For instance, there is the question of the amount of money which could be saved on the GMS by a system of prescriptions by generic designation in every case, as distinct from label.  If doctors <Col N="503" /> prescribe by label, the pharmacist is obliged to give that label, whether it be librium, valium or certain types of drugs. If, on the other hand, a doctor prescribes by type, the pharmacist gives a type which conforms to the standard.  In that one area alone, if the regulation could be introduced of conforming to standards, prescriptions by type, we could save considerably more than the Minister is asking for here, which is £2½ million.  I am talking about a saving of four times that amount.</P>
    <P>There is a way of easing the tax burden. There are countries, some very prosperous, where almost 50 per cent of the population are on GMS medical cards.  Is that something which the taxpayer can be asked to provide?  Of course, it is right and proper that where farmers transfer the farms to their sons, to encourage effective, productive farming, they be classed then as people of no means and, thereby, qualify for old age non-contributary pensions.  Socially and economically, that is a good thing.  However, in every case where that happens, must we arrange to provide free medical cards &mdash; and I am speaking as one who represents a rural constituency &mdash; for parents from relatively comfortable income backgrounds? A saving could be made there. One could look at the custom of taking family income into account and might find some anomalies which exist.  The growing irregular expenditure through various health boards could then be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There are two very closely interlinked areas not completely relevant to this debate.  There is the administration of the services funded by the taxpayer.  If we want to relieve him of his burden, we should not just see what we can give him under this Bill.  It is time that we looked at the application of the services for which he is paying.  Doctors dealing with long-term patients, to guarantee the continuing prescriptions for these patients must invite them back, apparently, every month, thereby adding to the cost of the service.  This is purely a matter of administration, control and discussion with the medical profession, but people who have to come back every month sometimes get <Col N="504" /> the impression that they are sick all the time, particularly older people.  Most doctors will tell one that this is an area where great costs could be saved.  Has anyone failed to notice the level of drug prescriptions and the level of chronic or continued ailment amongst those on the GMS is so much higher than it is among that section of the population who pay for themselves?</P>
    <P>I have great concern for those who are genuinely entitled to these benefits, the genuinely old, sick and deprived.  They are the ones we must protect.  Those are the people the taxpayers are ready to help.  But when one sees an imbalance of this kind in terms of the cost of drugs in the GMS in comparison with what the ordinary citizen pays, when one sees a level of illness that is so much higher among those in the GMS system, questions have to be asked.  The fact is that the taxpayers who pay for all of this&mdash;and those in the PAYE sector pay the heaviest burden&mdash;are being asked to fund programmes that those who are charged with implementing are looking at rather loosely.</P>
    <P>Let us just look at the original Estimates for health and social welfare last year compared with the Estimates this year.  At this point, assuming that there will not be supplementary estimates that will need perhaps further tax proposals, the original Estimate for last year on the health services was £691 million and this year the projected Estimate is £845 million. That is an increase of over 25 per cent already.  If we are going to have an incremental growth of that kind in our services so that those who are entitled can be assured of continuing and improving services&mdash;and I would like to see increased services in case anybody might interpret me as saying that I am in favour of reducing the level of services for those who are really entitled&mdash;we will have to examine the position of those who are not entitled to such benefits.  The original Estimate for Social Welfare last year was £476 million.  The Estimate that we are now dealing with is £743 million.  Those two alone demonstrate that to ease the burden on the taxpayer we will have to look first of all at the way in which the <Col N="505" /> money is spent.  The social insurance fund this year cost 30 per cent more to administer than last year.  Last year it was about £28 million and it is now about £37 million. Is that level of increase acceptable? Is it meant to be justified by relating it to the amount paid out?  Is it to be justified on the basis that if the amounts paid out to individuals are increasing each year somehow the administration costs increase proportionately?  Each £10 million that is added on this area and other such areas is going to bring further pressure on any Minister for Finance who comes in here.</P>
    <P>We should now consider having really effective services for those who are in need and entitled to them and have a good look at the application of those services.  In the application of these services sometimes what is perceived generally to be the case cannot be too far off the mark.  There are evidently abuses in the social welfare system.  In this State we have an inherited attitude towards the establishment, which perhaps was not too kind to us over the generations.  The notion of the citizen has, to a certain extent, been to take whatever one can get from the State.  I sense, fortunately, a growing awareness of a new mood.  But there has not been an awareness that when one draws what one is not really entitled to one is not just cheating the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Welfare but is cheating one's fellow citizens; one is commiting an act of bad citizenship.  Perhaps we have a little to learn of what is involved in bad citizenship, but the basic element is that if those who are not entitled to it draw money they are helping themselves from the worker's pocket and almost ensuring that those who are entitled will not get the benefit of increased services because the budget deficit has gone too high.  The budget deficit has definitely gone too high, and to ensure that we can look after our large dependent population we must adopt a firm and strict approach to these services.  We have obviously an unusually high dependency ratio.  Deputy Mitchell referred to the ratio of the population under 25.  It is just over 50 per cent in Ireland, and the average for the rest of <Col N="506" /> the EEC is just over 30 per cent.  By definition there is a high dependency area there already.  Not all of them are dependent but a very considerable number are dependent in terms of education, preparation for life, opportunity for jobs. That is huge.  But at the other end, the old and the sick and the unemployed, it is very considerable.  To look after those dependants of different kinds we must guarantee that those who are not dependent but should be contributors will not be allowed to present themselves as being dependent on the taxpayers' contributions.</P>
    <P>Some things will emerge if one looks at the patterns of disability benefits.  I will go no further than to inquire as to the reason for the difference in the patterns of disability benefits as between men and women.  One can accept that there would be some difference for physiological reasons.  That may be reasonable.  But when one finds quite a distinction in the patterns of disability benefits as between single women and married women one has to wonder why.  I will just leave the question there.  There is very considerable imbalance between the levels of disability benefit for single women and married women.  The pattern of absenteeism among married women is regrettably high, and it is even higher in some of the heavily subsidised semi-State bodies.  The facts are there to prove it.  This all costs taxpayers money, and these patterns of absenteeism or disability are burdens on the taxpayers and are becoming a mounting problem that any Minister for Finance or any Government will find very difficult to deal with simply in the context of the Finance Bill.  The problem must be dealt with for what it is, an abuse and a fraud against fellow citizens.</P>
    <P>On the question of the level of unemployment, which has been mentioned so often, perhaps when one is on the Opposition side one likes to blame the Government. I have been on both sides and now find myself on the Government side but not in Government so I can perhaps take a rather special view of it.  But we all generally recognise that the level of unemployment in terms of the figures presented is not the true level of unemployment. <Col N="507" /> Most Deputies know that in many parts of the country where we supposedly have high levels of unemployment the fact is that they are not nearly as high as are being registered in the unemployment exchanges, because many people are doing what are called nixers. This could be dealt with by a strengthened inspectorate, but it also calls for an awareness on the part of the citizen.</P>
    <P>We have an inherited attitude about informers.  Those who communicated with the State to the detriment of their fellow citizens did not earn very much respect but, in a sense, the whole community now needs to become informers for the public good.  I would like to see in our community an intolerance of abuses in this area.  I am not going to deal only with social welfare in this context because that would give an imbalance but I would like to see an intolerance among the people who contribute to those services on behalf of the citizens who are entitled to those services.  I would like to see an intolerance based on self-reliance and self-respect but with respect for those who cannot help themselves.  Otherwise we are in great danger of losing the work ethics which are an essential element of our economic well being.</P>
    <P>When I set up the Commission on Taxation I asked them specifically, although it was not included in their terms of reference, to look at PRSI as an element of tax contributions, or to at least recognise that it is a contribution taken from gross pay.  I very confidently expect that when they bring in the report very shortly they will deal with PRSI in that context.  That is very important.  That is something most PRSI contributors would welcome.  The PRSI fund was intended to be self-financing but because of the increased services and the enhancing value of those services, the feeling grew that it was not enough for employers and employees to contribute, but the State should contribute too.  It must be remembered the State is the taxpayer who is complaining about the PRSI level.  The taxpayer's contribution to that fund this year is over £210 million.  Before we start talking about adjustments, let us recognise that an <Col N="508" /> adjustment, of £45 million will only be possible if further contributions are made by the taxpayers.  This is not mentioned in the Finance Bill because the Minister said the money would be found by savings in expenditure.  Do not let any taxpayer be under any illusion.  If the State is to make a bigger contribution, that money will be coming from the people who are saying they are already paying too much to the State.  The Minister said the £45 million PRSI relief will be found by savings on expenditure and I support him fully.  There may be a buoyancy element of about £10 million, but he will still have to find £35 million to keep within the budgetary projections.</P>
    <P>I confidently hope he will adhere to that discipline, not just for the sake of disciplining himself and his colleagues, but because it will demonstrate that what is required now is a consistency that when we make a commitment our first obligation is to honour that commitment.  When introducing my budget in 1980 I made a statement that if we had extra expenditure by way of special pay claims&mdash;and we had three in that year, teachers, nurses and gardaí&mdash;the only way they could be financed was by extra taxation. I meant what I said and I regret I was not able to introduce a supplementary budget to fulfil that commitment.  When we give commitments we must honour them because the time has come when we can no longer avoid acting on them.  The difference between the Estimates at the beginning and the end of the year show very clearly that to maintain the current budget deficit we will have to look at the level of public services.</P>
    <P>Another element that has to be recognised as a glaring anomaly is that approximately 60 per cent of the current budget goes on pay and 40 per cent on services. If we want to curtail this expenditure this can only be done on the services side because the pay element is already provided for.  I agree with many of the views expressed about discipline in the public sector, because this is one way of, first, ensuring that the imbalance is corrected and, second, guaranteeing that the burden on the taxpayer can be minimised.</P>
    <P>I am sure when the Commission on <Col N="509" /> Taxation look at this question they will not confine themselves to saying they are introducing a new system of taxes and that we need not worry how much we spend.  If they did that they would not be acting in accordance with their terms of reference.  They have to look at the overall position to see that the money raised by way of taxes is being effectively applied.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Bill, 1980, I introduced income splitting for all married couples, not just those where the wife is working outside the home.  The wife who works in the home is evidently a working wife. There are pressures which might make it more encouraging for wives to work at home, and I do not just mean dishwashing in case somebody says I am taking an old-style chauvinist view.  I believe the wife at home can make a contribution to society no-one else can, and she can enhance society in a way no man at home can.</P>
    <P>I would like to see that area being properly recognised because it might encourage some married women working outside the home to spend all their time at home, thereby releasing some jobs for single women who are at present in a very serious situation.  There are some professions, like nursing, where many single girls are unable to get employment or training places.  In that profession there are a number of married women working at present.  There is nothing wrong with that but when there is a limit on the number of places available I think we should try to introduce other tax inducements for the married couple, such as I introduced in the Finance Act, 1980, which would serve two purposes at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget statement and in his second statement on the Finance Bill compares the budget deficit that he projects for this year at £680 million or 5.6 per cent of GNP with the outturn for 1981 of £802 million or 7.9 per cent of GNP.  The comparison stands out, but of course there is one significant factor that will be the real comparison, that the projection for 1981 can be adhered to.  Otherwise the comparison of a projection with an outturn does not <Col N="510" /> represent a real comparison.  I do not question the Minister's determination to adhere to that projection of £680 million but to be able to do that he will need to do several things.  Savings on PRSI must be found.  Increased VAT returns at the point of entry must also come in as projected to the order of £140 million.  The Minister said in his Second Stage speech that by the end of June the deficit should be in the order of 100 per cent of the figure for the year as a whole and this figure should be significantly exceeded by the end of September.  The Minister went on to say &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; that provided this could be adhered to, the level of revenue from tax in the last quarter must accrue, otherwise we all run the risk of losing credibility.</P>
    <P>Any previous Minister for Finance will sympathise with the present Minister because of increases that will come in current expenditure demands.  The level of slippage must be contained.  The Minister this year will find himself in an unusual position for a Minister for Finance that within this House he will be supported in what he proposes to do, namely adhering to the disciplines he has set out for himself both in his budget statement and in the Finance Bill.  The public will also support him because they now recognise very clearly that if he were to do otherwise it would mean that we would be taking more and more of their money to make concessions for other purposes.  That is why the Minister has gone in the right direction in setting these firm projections in the Finance Bill.  The public will understand that if there are to be any public demands on the public purse then it must come from taxation but I think that limit has already been reached.  We should recognise when we come into this House that when we come in here proposing an increase in services of one kind or another that we can only do so in the recognition that we are asking the taxpayer to pay more.  We cannot promise better services and at the same time say we intend to reduce taxation.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes some adjustments in relation to VAT.  When there are different categories there will always be certain anomalies but there are some elements <Col N="511" /> which are included in the general category of house furnishings where the level of VAT is being reduced.  Two items, gramophone records and television cabinets are at the lower level of VAT while at the same time, and here I disclose a political and perhaps a personal interest, the ordinary kitchen teapot, frying pan and kettle, provided they are made of aluminium hollowware and cups and saucers are now charged at the 30 per cent rate of VAT.  My political interest is that perhaps the only aluminium hollowware company in the country is based in Nenagh. If I were asked to define which were essential and which were luxuries I would come to a conclusion which would not be influenced by my own personal and political association in the area.  The level of VAT is reaching a point of maximum intolerance in that it affects sales, the cost of living and inflation but because of the important contribution it makes to the exchequer funds it must be retained.  But where there is scope to do so I hope the Revenue Commissioners, in advising the Minister, will not adhere too rigidly to the notion that because you make one adjustment you will have others and may lose money.  It is always possible to make adjustments, especially when the consequences of not making them can be very serious for some industries.</P>
    <P>In connection with VAT, there is another element that most Deputies are conscious of.  That is the number of small traders, who, for one reason or another, find it difficult or impossible to keep their VAT payments or records up to date. Perhaps some are careless and negligent and others have not the capacity to cope with it.  One knows that from the diligence of VAT inspectors.  I would not like to classify every small trader who is in arrears with VAT as a person who draws benefits to which he is not entitled. I would prefer to see the number of social welfare inspectors increased and perhaps the VAT inspectors being a little bit more tolerant.  Most shopkeepers' only interest is in keeping their business going, and many of them are living in constant fear, if not dread, of the consequences of not being up to date with their VAT payments. <Col N="512" /> The balance between spending and collection should be looked at in that context also.  I do not think it is impossible to transfer people from one inspectorate to another.  I am certainly not advocating an increase in public service employment.  I think there is some scope for examining that area also.</P>
    <P>One should also look at how the levels of tax allowances are fixed, just say in respect of mortgage repayments.  I wish I were convinced that it was done according to a clear, deeply-analysed and considered judgment as to what will be the consequences of coming to a certain figure of allowance.  One finds that, for instance, if one looks at the housing market in Ireland particularly in Dublin, it has one characteristic in comparison even with cities with a very high living standard such as that which I recently left, and it is that the level of inflation in house prices in Dublin is far in excess of what one finds generally in other cities, with few exceptions.  One should consider to what extent provisions that may have been introduced in Finance Acts and which will be continued in this one contribute to that situation.  If we are going to make adjustments of the kind, that interest reliefs on mortgage repayments are going to be increased by way of allowance rather than curtailing them, that in itself can have the consequence of increasing inflation in house prices.  It is not the only effect that could accrue; I mention it just in passing as an effect, and one that should be examined.  It is also a feature that the Commission on Taxation will consider, I am sure.</P>
    <P>The direction set by the Minister in the Finance Bill is the right direction.  The important thing is that each of us in whatever role we have here should now recognise that we cannot bring new pressures for new services without realising that it immediately puts the direction off course.  It is vital that the Minister be able to adhere to these two commitments, as otherwise the continuing trend that he is now endeavouring to check will not be checked to the extent needed.</P>
    <P>The sixties was a period of great growth, great excitement, and those who came into their first employment at that <Col N="513" /> time felt a magnetic pull towards involvement. There was growth internationally and the semi-State sector was one of the major engines of growth at that time.  We must now realise that we are in a different climate and perhaps the role of the semi-State sector has changed very considerably. The IDA in the Estimates of this year, have got £142 million.  Most Ministers of Finance know that if there is one State body that always got what it sought it was the IDA.  We owe them a lot for what they have achieved.  That figure represents over 1 per cent of GNP, which is a very considerable amount.  In the current international environment I think the trend is now emerging where the real thrust for development cannot be as dependent as hitherto on international investment at considerable cost to taxpayers; it has to depend more on self-help at home in terms of the resources we have here, fisheries, forestry and agriculture, and training and preparation for these programmes.  That will mean a great degree of relief to taxpayers and ensure that the Minister will be able to adhere to what is set out in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the previous speaker in his closing remarks referring to the necessity that we should base development of our industrial structure more on home-based industry using native talents available to us.  I do not agree with him that this is only a recent situation, that we need not have looked that position in previous decades.  That was one of the major mistakes we made. We have relied far too much, in my view, on the entrepreneurial activities of foreigners brought here by the IDA, all too many of whom have taken the loot and gone.  Many millions of pounds have been expended by the IDA in bringing in foreign-based industries and factories and too many of these set up operations, created jobs for a while, took the enormous grants and benefits given to them by the IDA and the taxation relief granted to them by successive Governments and continued operations, while it suited them &mdash; motivated as they would be entirely by profit motives &mdash; and when <Col N="514" /> the occasion arose they either liquidated or went away leaving a hiatus or vacuum of unemployment and misery behind them in Dublin in many cases and in many towns in the country.</P>
      <P>That is very regrettable but true.  We relied too much on outside firms and not enough on our own resources.  That is why I deeply regret that the thrust of the present Government has not been to accept the proposal to set up our own national development corporation and to direct the major funds for investment in industry to that corporation, which would have been locally based, using the skills and enterprise we have in our own people &mdash; and we have those skills available and they can and should be called upon.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil proposal for a national enterprise agency is but a faint shadow of what is required, inadequately funded, just a showpiece to avoid the key issue that when we need to create jobs &mdash; as we do &mdash; and when we need to set up industry, call in the outside man or firm and let them see to it rather than gear up and engineer our own resources and people to do it.</P>
      <P>We have been very remiss; we have not used the resources available to us in recent years.  Our major natural resources have not been exploited in the way required to produce growth and wealth and reduce unemployment.  I refer in particular to our main natural resource, the key national resource, the agricultural sphere, particularly the cattle industry.  We have really done a disservice to the country in failing to exploit that major natural resource.  This has been mentioned many times inside and outside the House.  If talk alone were sufficient we would now certainly have a fine downstream industry in cattle.  All we have done about it is talk, and we have made no aggressive impact on that industry as a Government, and that has been true of successive Governments over the past decade.  We have allowed that natural resource to be exported as a natural resource and allowed others in the UK and elsewhere to exploit it, leaving us with very little to show for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter has been very well researched.  An excellent report on it was <Col N="515" /> produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute in March 1979.  I should like to quote from it, and these quotations are as relevant today as they were then, possibly more so.  They point out that if present trends continue, the Irish food processing industry by 1990 could be predominantly in the hands of multinational concerns and producing about twice the 1973 output with less than 18 per cent more employees.  They say that these trends can be altered only by massive co-ordinated effort of the major factors in the beef and dairy industries or by large direct intervention by the Irish Government.  We have had no evidence of any such intervention.  All we can see is that the food processing factories, such as they are, are closing down and that the people who work in them are being thrown on to the dole queues as if they were not long enough already.  There must be aggressive intervention by our Government not only from the point of view of saving jobs but of adding to the wealth of the country.  We are permitting this industry, this basic resource, to proceed as though ours was a primitive or undeveloped economy.  The ESRI say that the main reason for the low value added of the Irish food industry is that firms are still using the basic processes that are used in more primitive economies. That is a poor reflection on us after decades of independence.  Instead of paying out millions of pounds to the IDA to bring in foreigners to run for a couple of years a Potez or Fieldcrest-type operation, we would be better employed in directing the resources of the Irish taxpayer towards something we can manage ourselves, to operations that will produce jobs for our people and increase wealth for the country.</P>
    <P>Successive budgets and the fiscal policy of Finance Acts are being used as a kind of book-keeping operation, an operation to balance the books, without adequate attention being given to the use of fiscal policy as a means of stimulating employment. Every major measure that could be brought up in a Finance Bill should be put on the weighing scales and tested in terms of what effect it would have on <Col N="516" /> employment.  In respect of each measure we should ask whether it would have the effect of providing a stimulus towards employment or of causing people to be put out of work.  Has the measure concerning VAT at the point of entry, for example, been examined in that light?  It seems to me that that measure of taxation will make savage inroads into the liquidity of those firms providing employment and that it will be bound to create further unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to remind the House of the jobs that have been lost in the footwear and textile industries.  There are not all that many such industries left. They have closed one after another in the last decade, throwing numbers of people on to the dole queues and increasing the burden of social welfare on the people remaining in employment.  We must ask whether sufficient stimulus is being provided in this Finance Bill to ensure that the remaining workers in the declining footwear and textile industries are maintained in employment.  Is there any stimulus in the Bill for an increase in employment in those areas?  I would like to see some form of encouragement by way of the taxation process that would ensure that those industries producing goods would be afforded some measure of protection against the dumping of imports here both from EEC countries and from third countries.  Our industries, particularly those in the textile business, have been subjected to unfair competition from abroad.  I wonder whether our representatives and our successive Commissioners in the EEC have been pursuing a sufficiently aggressive policy to protect our interests.  We know now that the EEC has not proved to be a panacea.  Restrictions are imposed from Brussels as to what we may restrict in the line of imports while imports are coming in in large quantities not only from the EEC but from Asia.  This is the type of situation that is causing unemployment and misery to so many of our people.  Perhaps we should cease being the most respectable man in Europe and look instead to our own needs and to the urgency of our own situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy talked about the <Col N="517" /> urgent need for the Minister for Finance to adhere to these commitments.  Unfortunately, the record of the Government to date in the matter of adhering to commitments leaves much to be desired.  Far from adhering to commitments the Government seem to be responding to every pressure group.  We had the pressure in respect of the PRSI situation which resulted in a concession of £45 million, and there have been others.  I presume that is the sort of thing that Deputy O'Kennedy was referring to.  We cannot run the country on that sort of basis.  I agree that we must set out on a course of economic development and adhere to that course, but I am afraid that this Government have given every indication of doing the reverse.  What can we do to ensure that industry is stimulated and given a base on which it can compete with foreign industry and provide jobs as well as providing the goods that we need here and those that we can export?  Something we can do and which is done in other countries, is to consider some of the main cost factors that go into maintaining industry which in turn is so vital in maintaining employment.</P>
    <P>An important factor in this context is the cost of energy, mainly oil and, in turn, electricity.  I suggest that we give serious consideration to a policy of subsidising the cost of oil and electricity to factories where employment is maintained in order to ensure that those industries will be in a position to operate.</P>
    <P>That is done in other countries, and if we fail to do it we will place our main industries at a disadvantage and take away from them their ability to maintain employment and compete abroad.  Our energy costs are a vital factor in industry. Our costs are the highest in Europe, and those costs on energy place an almost intolerable burden on every employment centre in the country.  The high energy cost content is an obvious disadvantage and, if we were to subsidise the cost, we would make a signal contribution towards the creation and the maintenance of employment.</P>
    <P>I know it will be said that the cost of such a subsidy must be met from somewhere. <Col N="518" /> Of course it must, but the actual cost of providing that subsidy initially is not a real outlay and not a real cost because the advantages come back very quickly in another direction.  When one subsidises the cost for marginal factories one preserves employment that would otherwise be lost.  One keeps in that employment people producing goods, people who would otherwise have to be paid redundancy money or weekly social welfare benefits for an indefinite period. That is the position obtaining at the moment.  In addition, when one keeps these people in employment they are producing the goods we require, goods which otherwise would have to be imported, adding to the burden of our foreign exchange and foreign deficits.</P>
    <P>Something will have to be done about high interest rates.  These have now become almost a matter of course.  With the exception of Italy we have the highest interest rates in Europe.  These are a deterrent to employment and they must not be allowed to continue.  Something will have to be done if we are not to see our unemployment figures rising year after year.  These interest rates, like energy costs, result in putting people out of work.  I am not exactly sure of how the situation can be remedied.  There are difficulties, but some fiscal method will have to be implemented to cushion the effect on industries which are already on the brink of disaster.  They are on the verge of going into liquidation or receivership. We have had many industries which were wholly viable for many years.  They provided employment and they provided the goods we needed.  Too many of them have gone to the wall.</P>
    <P>Reference was made this morning to the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  These mills are a classic example.  At one stage we had six paper mills.  We were virtually self-sufficient in the provision of paper. We now have the situation where the last surviving paper mill is facing closure.  If it is allowed to go the paper making capacity of the country will be gone for all time because the expertise will disperse and every scrap of paper we use here in this House and elsewhere will have to be imported while those who <Col N="519" /> worked in the mill will be a burden on the Exchequer and therefore on the remaining taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The object of the Finance Bill should be to encourage industrial growth, stimulate employment and maintain existing employment.  It should also be a measure of equity in the administration of taxation. That equity has been lacking for many years, and its absence has given rise to a great deal of disquiet amongst the general body of taxpayers.  We have had marches in the streets of Dublin and in other cities, in many cases with good and sufficient reason.  Here I want to make special reference to what one might call the housing subsidy situation.  It was touched on by Deputy O'Kennedy, but he did not quite develop the point as I hoped he would.</P>
    <P>A major item of Government expenditure comes in the field of housing.  A tremendous amount of that money is provided by the taxpayer in different ways. The money is expended in the form of grants to local authorities and to new house buyers.  It is also expended in the cost to the Exchequer on the allowances people receive on the interest they pay on their mortgages.  This is an aspect upon which I want to touch now, because of the retrograde step taken in this measure whereby the tax allowance system on mortgages has been radically altered in the interval between the Minister's budget statement and the publication of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The situation now is that the general body of taxpayers is making a very substantial subsidy to those who, to use the common expression, trade up in the purchase of higher cost houses, because as a result of this measure they will be entitled to set off the entire interest of that traded up mortgage.  In effect, that is a subsidy granted by the State to enable those who already have houses to buy larger houses. That subsidy is paid by the general body of taxpayers, many of whom have no houses at all.  Those in local authority housing who are working are paying PAYE week after week and thereby contributing to the central tax fund.  Those who have no houses at all and little prospect <Col N="520" /> of getting one in the foreseeable future are also subsidising those who are trading up their present houses in order to get bigger and more expensive houses. That situation has been brought about by this Finance Bill.  Actually the reverse was the situation in the Minister's budget statement, when a limitation was placed on the income tax on mortgages and not to the actual marginal rate of income tax paid by such a house purchaser.  That is a retrograde measure which ought to be removed.  A strong case could be made for the abolition altogether of the allowance, but that is another day's work.  As a compromise measure the provision for the limitation of such payments to the standard rate was very reasonable in achieving at least some measure of equity in that aspect of the taxation system. There would be a saving of money if that was done.  That money could be directed towards the provision of housing for people who have no houses.</P>
    <P>The development of our finances over the last decade has produced a situation whereby the level of service in many aspects has been lowered.  I refer in particular to the abolition of the rating system of local authorities.  That was one of the promises of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1977 and rates were duly abolished, but the people understood from the abolition of rates &mdash; as I did &mdash; that the moneys which the local authorities had acquired from rates would be made good in full out of central funds by the Government, but that has not happened. The funds made available to the local authorities year by year have in real terms declined, so much so that the level of service that the local authorities are now in a position to supply for people living in their areas is becoming less year on year.  Those Deputies who are members of local authorities will be aware of the increased number of complaints coming to them from their constituents regarding the serious deterioration in the level of service being provided by the local authorities up and down the country, and it is going to become seriously worse.  If this decline is not arrested in the next five or seven years the whole fabric of local authority administration will become so <Col N="521" /> seriously constrained that it will become difficult to provide a lighting service, a road sweeping service or a bin collection service on anything like the lines we were used to years ago, and if anyone complains about this to the local authorities the stock answer &mdash; which means a lot, the key is there &mdash; is &ldquo;We are providing such services as are possible with the resources available&rdquo; and the resources are no longer available to them in the way they were.</P>
    <P>I conclude on the note on which I started, that where we are going wrong and a situation that has brought the country to the condition it is in is that we are using the budget, the Finance Bill and the whole direction of fiscal policy as a book-keeping exercise and not as it should be used in every respect, as a test for the economic development of the country.  Every major fiscal measure must be tested and examined with that in view. We must ask if that will raise the tax basis, the wealth basis and the employment basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance on Second Stage of the Finance Bill talked about the principal concern of the Government as achieving a proper balance between reducing borrowing and improving employment.  Most speakers touched on those two areas which, in conjunction with taxation, are of great concern at present.  It is important with the present rate of interest that borrowing would be reduced or stabilised.  The Fianna Fáil Government have always been concerned to provide as much employment as possible.  With the number of young people coming on the market at present there is an inherent danger because of the frustration which arises from being without a job.  If we cast our minds back we will remember that the cause of wars &mdash; certainly the cause of the Second World War &mdash; has been mass unemployment in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxation is another very controversial matter.  I hope that the report of the Commission on Taxation when published will form the basis of a fairer taxation system.  If a fairer taxation system was introduced the Minister for Finance <Col N="522" /> would be in a position to plan well in advance rather than in the way planning is done at present, on a year-to-year basis.  It is important that we be enabled to plan on a three to five year basis.  No company, private or public, can plan on such a short-term basis as we have.  With the increase in unemployment it is time that the semi-State bodies and such bodies as the OPW, country councils and other authorities examine closely whether they can create employment even on a temporary basis.  The OPW have a branch at Ardee which each year has taken on 12 or 13 men temporarily for seasonal work.  This year we have reached summer and these temporary workers have not received any indication that they will be employed this year. When manufacturing industry is in difficulty and the creation of jobs is difficult also, such bodies should come to the rescue and create employment even on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>The county councils in many areas could bring in temporary staff if they would adjust their programmes in order to achieve this.  In concerns such as the semi-State bodies the first to suffer unemployment are their temporary staffs.  Last week the Irish Goods Council estimated that 600 million industrial components which are being imported could be manufactured in Ireland.  That is ridiculous. The IDA have work to do in this regard. They have the necessary information on market requirements and what can be produced and they have the technology and the ability to train.  They should initiate a promotional campaign to have such goods manufactured here.  Practically every country has the factory space. The factories are there already built and in some cases for some reason have closed down.  Those buildings could be utilised and an examination should be carried out as to the number of industrial components which could be manufactured here.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill contains a number of welcome changes from the original budget proposals.  Provision is being made for the continuation for a further year of a scheme introduced in 1979 allowing tax relief on the labour content <Col N="523" /> of expenditure on home repairs or improvements, up to a maximum allowance of £900 for married couples and £450 for single persons.  This is a welcome provision, because we look to the building and construction industry to provide more employment and small extensions and renovation works on private residences can generate a lot of work.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the special provision for the disposal of small sites up to a limit of £15,000.  A person who sells development land for a price not exceeding that figure will be liable under the rules governing capital gains tax rather than under the alternative arrangements.  Many people contemplating the sale of sites worth about £10,000 close to towns feared that a large portion of the money would be paid in taxation, and this discouraged them from selling such sites.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to raise the annual exemption threshold for capital gains tax to £2,000 for single persons and £4,000 for married couples.  This will provide some compensation for the small investor for the substantial increases in capital gains tax, and I welcome the measure.</P>
    <P>In February 1979 the EEC Ministers for Agriculture agreed to allocate eight million units of account, approximately £5.5 million, for cross-Border drainage schemes, and the catchments listed were the Blackwater and the Finn-Lackey.  It was decided that the details of the proposed schemes should be submitted to the EEC by July 1981 and it was hoped that work would commence shortly afterwards. I kept in touch with the Office of Public Works and was told that the matter was progressing satisfactorily but I now find, 11 months after the expiry of the deadline, that details of the scheme have still not been sent to Brussels for approval.  The latest information is that it will be done within months rather than years.  The fieldwork and the drawing-board work have been completed and I would hope that the OPW would recruit additional staff so that the schemes would go ahead and be processed in Brussels as soon as possible.  This is one of the major schemes to have been suggested since the <Col N="524" /> start of the troubles in 1969.  Apart from bringing thousands of acres of farmland into production, it would also create substantial employment and generate much goodwill.  I hope the OPW will not delay any longer and will obtain approval for the scheme in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Deep concern has been expressed about the imposition of VAT at points of entry.  People in my county involved in industries such as footwear, furniture, textiles and light engineering have been very worried about this measure.  Over the past month or so, however, the Department and the Revenue Commissioners have clarified the position, and in some cases importers will have up to six weeks to pay this tax.  They can also claim on invoices, even if the goods are received on credit and irrespective of whether they have been held in stock or not.  The Department claim that abuses and tax evasion will be eliminated by this measure, but I hope they will watch the position closely and make allowances in cases where hardship is being caused.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned abuses in the taxation system and the general cost of administration.  An important area where we are making little headway is in the elimination or control of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.  Cattle are one of our main exports both in processed form and on the hoof.  The Department have spent a lot of money on disease eradication.  From 1973 to 1981 they spent £43½ million in payments to vets who were involved in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Compensation paid to farmers was in excess of £50 million. In the same period in relation to brucellosis vets were paid £16.62 million and farmers were given compensation which amounted to £56½ million.  In 1974 the national herd totalled 7.2 million.  This was reduced to 6.62 million in 1981.  Following the veterinary strike the incidence of TB was high.  At that time it was 7.50 per cent, in 1980 it was 2.94 per cent, in 1981, 2.11 per cent and in 1982 to date it has increased to 2.76 per cent.  The fact that it has increased since 1981 is a cause for real concern.</P>
    <P>In 1973 the number of staff dealing with this problem was 892 and that number <Col N="525" /> was increased to 1,252 in 1982.  Such an increase at a time when herd numbers were decreasing is a cause for concern. Many of the staff are located in offices. At a time when computerisation and other aids are available it is hard to justify that number of staff to deal with a reduced national herd number.</P>
    <P>My area used to be clear.  In the last three years the disease has become rampant. Many herds have been wiped out. Practically all my neighbours have cattle which are coming up as doubtful in the tuberculosis test.  Out of a herd of 50 it is not uncommon to have one or two doubtful. People have to decide between disposing of the animals at a low price or keeping them and hoping they will be clear next time.  The area of disease eradication must be closely examined.  The 30-day test was opposed on different grounds.  Despite the test we still have the problem.  Not only does it mean that there is a loss of animals but a drop in milk production.  It creates a lot of indecision for farmers.  They have to decide between keeping animals or selling off perhaps their best stock which they had built up from good sires.  The Department are concentrating only now on problem areas.</P>
    <P>Inflation is causing a real problem for industry and even for households but nowhere has it as much impact as in farming.  Everything is affected by it, fertilisers, diesel, silage making, grain production and so on.  This is because there is a great dependence on oil and oil-based products.</P>
    <P>Another area which has come in for much discussion is that of grants.  I hope these are reviewed and updated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should relate this to the taxation measures before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The time has come for the Department to have a look at introducing grants for lower cost cattle sheds. With the number of cattle which are left out during the winter, and particularly the high percentage we had last year, the Department should examine this situation. It is very hard for farmers who are <Col N="526" /> involved in milk production to get a reasonable return.  Many co-operatives have been heavily aided through FEOGA grants.  They have the capacity to manufacture much more.  I would hope that there would also be efforts made to have the 12 western counties categorised as severely disadvantaged, thereby qualifying for cattle and sheep headage payments. By so doing the national herd would be increased.  Probably also it would lead to an increase in milk production.</P>
      <P>There was reference earlier to our roads and their structure.  It can fairly be said that Fianna Fáil Ministers for the Environment have at all times been concerned to provide as much funds as possible for the improvement of our national primary roads.  This will be realised particularly if one draws a comparison between the position under Fianna Fáil and that under the Coalition Government in the mid-seventies when, year after year, they reduced the allocations for roads and during which time we in Monaghan, I think for three years in succession, did not receive any allocation at all for our national primary or secondary roads.  We did receive £10 million on one occasion to buy a small tract of land required for realignment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for the Environment would have the technical staff of his Department check on the expenditure on maintenance of our national primary and secondary roads.  Travelling from Monaghan to Dublin, through a number of counties, one cannot help but notice that the roads have not been maintained adequately, particularly at a time when local authorities are in receipt of reasonable allocations for such maintenance. There may well be local authorities in some counties who are not carrying out the necessary maintenance of our national primary and secondary roads. I realise that expenditure on improvements and realignment is proper to another allocation, but the question of maintenance is of the utmost importance. People travelling from Derry or Fermanagh to Dublin use the same roads as we do from Monaghan, and it must be particularly noticeable to them coming off their <Col N="527" /> very good roads.  In recent years the structure of our roads has been improved to a large extent, but their maintenance is crucial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few general comments on the Finance Bill.  There are two areas of major importance with which I want to deal as briefly as possible. However, most of the points I wanted to make have been made already in the discussion to date.</P>
      <P>We are discussing this Finance Bill in most unusual circumstances.  We had the situation first of the January budget introduced by the Coalition Government and defeated.  Then we had another general election, a new Government formed and a new Minister for Finance introducing what he described as an almost similar budget, with a few exceptions, because, he said, time did not permit of the introduction of a budget to the Government's liking.  I do not accept that as a valid excuse but I do not want to go into the matter in great detail.  We are now in a situation which has led to further confusion about the Finance Bill and indeed confused Members in its discussion. There are some meetings taking place behind closed doors with the Minister for Finance and Members of the Government, with people in a strategic position in this House, so that one never knows what will be included in the Finance Bill by way of amendment at the end of the day.  If the Government survive the vote this evening I shall have some comments to make on the next Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on some points made already.  I listened this morning to a former Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, and found myself agreeing with and supporting a considerable amount of what he had to say without qualification.  He seemed to put his finger on the problem.  However, there were some points on which I would have to take issue with him.  He spoke about our taxation system as having reached saturation point, and of people having become completely intolerant.  He was advocating greater tolerance and the broadening of the taxation net, that its <Col N="528" /> base should be broadened.  He hoped this was something that would emerge from this report of the Commission on Taxation. That is indeed surprising coming from a Minister of the Government in 1977 whose election manifesto promised certain concessions which began the decline at the root of our present social and economic problems.  It was disastrous at that time that the tax base should have been narrowed in order to gain power. However, we are now in a situation in which our people realise the seriousness of the problems confronting us.  Deputy O'Kennedy said they were prepared to make sacrifices in order to rectify our very serious economic situation.  I believe that is so, but also they expect leadership. I believe also that what some Members on the Government back benches have been saying about promises, deals and so on is true also, that our people will not now respond to the type of demands emanating from this House or the Government in order to implement the necessary corrective measures to tackle our financial difficulties.  I believe that to be an absolute fact.  Indeed the recent general election, even though it led to a change of government, indicated that quite clearly.  The measures proposed in the Bruton budget constituted an honest attempt to rectify that situation.</P>
    <P>On the subject of food subsidies, value-added-tax and clothing I would say that the proposal to remove subsidies from clothing was an emotive one on which the present Government played. The whole situation in relation to food subsidies was completely misjudged also, because it must be remembered that they were first introduced in order to cushion people against increased prices resulting from our membership of the EEC. Indeed it was the present Minister for Education, the then Minister for Economic Planning and Development, back in 1977 who proceeded to dismantle those subsidies on food.  He said then that food subsidies were never intended as a permanent measure.  He said we were in the unfortunate position of having a system under which there was the subsidisation of food which meant the rich as well as the poor were being subsidised and that <Col N="529" /> he believed our taxpayers would not continue to support such a system.  It is most extraordinary that some few years later, in order to get back into power, we have the very same Minister advocating their restoration.  This is what creates the problem and leads to a situation in which the people will not respond.  Indeed it leads to distrust of people in power.  It is the Government who should give leadership but when this is not forthcoming people will not respond, and that in turn creates further problems.  I believe that our problems are basically those created by politicians with the sole desire of getting into power at any cost.  This cannot continue.</P>
    <P>I accept also what Deputy O'Kennedy said this morning, that the present abuses of our services must be eliminated. Indeed he was seeking a system under which people would inform on those abusing those services.  He was talking about people in receipt of benefit from the State.  He said that those services were being abused and the cost was enormous. He said the services could not be expanded because of this and those who were in real need could not get services adequate to deal with their circumstances. I agree with that.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have developed a greedier society.  We have a society who are demanding more.  I believe there is a lack of leadership here.  When Deputy Colley was Minister for Finance he introduced the 2 per cent levy on farm produce and the farmers took to the streets.  The Government capitulated and as a result of that, PAYE workers took to the streets and the Government appeared to capitulate. People believe that no matter what they demand provided they can use sufficient muscle there will be a capitulation and their demands will be met.  I do not believe you can run a Government with that sort of attitude.</P>
    <P>I believe it is necessary, when in Government, if it is for the long-term good of the nation and the people, to take unpopular decisions.  Sometimes those decisions can be very unpopular.  I have only to go back to the 1973-77 Coalition period when unpopular decisions were taken, which we now know were in the best interests of the people.  If Government <Col N="530" /> decisions are taken and if pressure from outside the Government and from the people make them change those decisions and accede to the demands of the people who take to the streets, the Government will create great difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is not peculiar to any Deputy or any side of the House but the demands and the approaches which will be made within the next couple of months will be very great.  This is the time when a new lot of young people come out from secondary school after doing their leaving certificate examination and are looking for jobs in local authorities as clerical officers or clerk typists, in nursing or anything else. This is the time of the year when very concerned parents bring their children to Deputies because they are anxious to find jobs for them but there are no prospects of jobs.</P>
    <P>I know the terms governing the discussion do not allow me to go into detail.  I will not do so but I feel there are some decisions which could be taken which would alleviate some of those problems. I believe there is no incentive to work now and there is no incentive to save. There are people drawing unemployment assistance &mdash; what is commonly known in the country as the dole &mdash; who are working and are earning far more money than the people who go out to work and work a full five-day week.  This is a tragic situation. People are seeing this happen every day throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I believe it is necessary to provide good leadership.  The Government have to set the example to highlight those fraudulent activities which are depriving people in need of what they are entitled to.  The unemployment figure is now approaching 150,000 although I accept the point made by Deputy O'Kennedy that it is not a true figure and that there are people who are registered as unemployed who are not in fact unemployed.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of work which needs to be done throughout the country.  Many of our roads are in urgent need of repair. At the same time I cannot see how it is that the Department of Social Welfare can pay out such a large sum of money in my county on unemployment assistance. Surely some of the people on unemployment <Col N="531" /> assistance could be employed repairing our roads and looking after our parks and other amenities.  The case was made at Cork County Council that if this money was devoted to the local authorities and if people in receipt of unemployment assistance were employed three days a week we would not have the serious situation we have in relation to roads, water and sanitary services.  If there was the will to do something that would not be too popular politically but would in the long-term be in the best interests of the country and the best interests of rectifying our economic situation, some of those people on unemployment assistance could be doing some of this work.</P>
    <P>I am sure many Deputies are aware of cases where the father of a family is not working and is not given an incentive to work and that family have not seen anything else during their upbringing except the breadwinner being provided with handouts and unemployment assistance. There is no encouragement to that family to go out and seek jobs.  They find their parents are doing as well on unemployment assistance as others who are working. If we want to tackle the problem we have to provide incentives to work and we have to make sure that it is only as a last resort that people will go on unemployment assistance and that it will be provided for them.</P>
    <P>I am as critical of the Coalition Government as I am of the Fianna Fáil Government when I talk about the 25 per cent increase in social welfare benefits right across the board.  I know there are some recipients of social welfare benefits who could do with more and there are some people who are in difficulty trying to exist on the amount of social welfare they receive.  At the same time it was wrong to give a 25 per cent increase to everybody regardless of the type of assistance he or she is in receipt of.  There are some people who did very well.  Some people who are drawing the 25 per cent increase are working at the same time and are not concerned about the Revenue Commissioners.  As a result we have a new poor in our midst.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is as aware of <Col N="532" /> this as I am.  I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is in the House because recently we debated a new house purchase scheme. I know of a number of people who are applying for the purchase of their council houses whose income is between £100 and £120 a week and their repayment in some instances is as high as £55 per week. I do not know how those people will exist.  Those are the people I regard as the new poor.  It is important that some assistance be provided for them.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for us to look occasionally at the direction we are going in economically, our progress, the trends, our objectives and the speed at which we are going towards those objectives.  I recently put down a question to the Minister for Finance to try to get from him where we are going and what our position is at the moment.  I asked the Minister for Finance if he would give the following information for each of the financial years 1976 to 1981, inclusive and from 1982 to date: (a) the amount borrowed each year by the State, (b) the national debt, and (c) the cost of servicing this debt by way of (1) interest repayments, (2) capital repayments and (3) the amount paid in interest outside the State.  The last one is the important one.  I do not object to borrowing.  It is necessary occasionally. It is sound economic planning to borrow for certain developments.  But I criticise the present Government for the level of borrowing in recent years because they have been mostly in power since 1976. We have now reached a dangerous situation. The Minister's reply to my question was that in 1976 Exchequer borrowing was £506 million; the interest payments on the national debt in that year was £268 million; the capital repayments were £244 million; the interest paid outside the State in that year was £66 million.  Now we come to 1982.  Exchequer borrowing is estimated at £1,693 million &mdash; and being familiar with Estimates in this House we can expect that that is an underestimation.  The interest payment on the national debt will be £1,300 million.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the figures for the <Col N="533" /> years between those years but the trend is gradual and shows the direction we are going in.  But the most damaging element is the interest paid outside the State on what we owe, £528 million.  If one talks to the general public about budget deficits and borrowing and our indebtedness abroad they sometimes do not understand because they feel it does not affect them directly.  I heard Fianna Fáil speakers this morning refer to the necessity to bring the budget deficit under control. We have reached the target mentioned by the Minister in his budget in the first five months of this year.  If we could get our people to accept disciplines and make sacrifices to reduce that borrowing what could we do with that money?  It would double the farm modernisation scheme grants; it would double the disadvantaged areas scheme grants; it would double the interest subsidy; it would double all old age pensions and orphans' pensions; it would double the grants for private housing and, if my figures are correct, it would even go so far as to build Knock airport.</P>
    <P>That is the way we should look at this figure.  But there is no determined effort made to bring our borrowing back to manageable proportions and if this goes on we will reach a situation where we will be beyond redemption and will not be masters of our own destiny.  I would be the first to support any steps the Minister would take to make sure that this monstrosity will not devour us even though the vast majority of it was created by the Minister's own party.  That is the reality and magnitude of the situation.  The national debt would pay for the entire Book of Estimates over the next two years.  If we continue on these dangerous lines we will end up bankrupt.  I ask the Government and the Minister to take note of this trend because there is inherent in the reply given by the Minister an indication of an irresponsible attitude of Ministers for Finance who borrowed because of pressure from groups instead of taking actions which were politically unpopular.  I do not know how long any individual or business or enterprise would last if they followed the example set by this Government.  The problems <Col N="534" /> we have at the moment were created by the Government and whatever Government are in power will have to tackle those problems.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I would be brief.  I wish to refer to something that was also in the Bruton budget to which I am opposed.  There is nothing wrong with introducing proposals in a budget and then changing them in the Finance Bill. This is happening every other day.  But this measure is one to which I am opposed and it was supported by the Minister when introduced in the Bruton budget. The measure has to do with the remission of stamp duty for young farmers.  Every Deputy must be aware of the views of the law society on this measure.  It is discriminatory, it is unfair, and it should be changed.  I will be using and have used, with other Deputies, another forum within my own group to ensure that this simple amendment will be tabled and will be supported.  I know that the thinking behind this is to give an incentive to every young farmer to be trained.  I contend that people with experience who have come up through Macra na Feirme &mdash; and I have been very much involved during my time in public life with such people &mdash; are active and able young farmers and it is a pity that even before now no incentives were created to encourage them to take over the family farm and, with modern techniques and thinking, do a better job.</P>
    <P>In section 85 it is provided:</P>
    <P>(4) In this section &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; means a person in respect of whom it is shown to the satisfaction to the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) that he was under the age of 35 years on the date on which the relevant instrument was executed, and</P>
    <P>(b) either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) that he is the holder of a certificate issued by&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta certifying that he has satisfactorily completed an agricultural training course of a <Col N="535" /> duration of not less than 100 hours, or</P>
    <P>(II)  the Farm Apprenticeship Board certifying that he has satisfactorily completed the course under the Farmer Apprenticeship Scheme of the Board or the course under the Trainee Farmer Scheme of the Board, or</P>
    <P>(III)  the Minister for Agriculture or a committee of agriculture established under the Agriculture Act, 1931, being a certificate issued before the 1st day of December, 1980, and certifying that he has satisfactorily completed a course equivalent to that referred to in paragraph (b) (i) (I) of this subsection,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(ii) that he is the holder of a university degree, or equivalent university qualification, in agriculture,</P>
    <P>I put it to the House that in rural Ireland today it is common for a farmer to have six or seven children with the eldest usually staying at home to help on the family farm.  Every effort is made by the eldest to provide the wherewithal to educate the remainder of the family because only one person, usually the eldest, can inherit the farm.  But to qualify for this remission of stamp duty a person must be under the age of 35 on the day of the transfer of the farm to him.  A person who is 35 years of age will have spent 15 years or more getting practical experience of the day to day working of the farm and will inherit the know-how and all the techniques from his father who was a farmer before him.  In effect he is the person who is working that farm and who has put so much into it.  But in this Bill the stamp duty is increased from 1 per cent to 3 per cent for farms worth over £50,000.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of a farm with a value of £150,000, and that is not a very big farm particularly if the Valuation Office or the Revenue Commissioners have to put a value on it.  The son who inherits that farm will be paying £4,500 duty.  If a son or daughter has an agricultural <Col N="536" /> degree, stamp duty is remitted.  That is daft.  This situation must be rectified, because it is discriminatory.  A simple amendment could be accepted.  A new section could be included saying that a person with three to five years practical experience would qualify for this remission. I accept that the Government are trying to ensure every farmer is properly trained but I dispute the definition of &ldquo;trained farmer&rdquo; and I will do everything in my power to see that discrimination is eliminated.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned local authorities and housing.  I will not go into this in detail, but there has been a great deal of duplication and waste which must be eliminated.  For example, the officials of local authorities are paid to collect the road tax which they send to the Department and the Department send the money back to the local authorities to carry out the necessary work.  Greater autonomy should be given to the local authorities.  That kind of duplication leads to wastage and constant dictation from the Department.  I believe local authority officials are better qualified to say where the revenue from the Department should be spent rather than being dictated to by departmental officials.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about tax evasion and tax avoidance.  There is both tax evasion and tax avoidance in most sectors of the community but there are certain categories who cannot avoid or evade tax.  They are the people who are becoming the new poor.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the building industry. The Coalition Government introduced the new Housing Finance Agency Bill.  I do not think it was the greatest Bill introduced since the State was founded, but it provided more money for the building industry and that, in turn, created more jobs.  That Bill went through this House, we had a change of Government and that Minister, Deputy Raphael Burke, still has not made money available to operate that scheme.  In my local authority, applications for loans under that scheme are being held up.  I ask the Minister to take special notice of this matter because this scheme will provide extra jobs which are badly needed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> If this Bill survives the Second Stage I will be raising other points on Committee Stage, because there are many problems involved.  This country is facing very serious problems and irrespective of which side of the House we are sitting on we will all be affected by them.  I believe what we are doing is a recipe for a revolution, and we must take action soon. This Government have failed to take unpopular decisions which in the long term would be to the advantage of the community.  There is no point continuing that kind of policy.  Therefore, I support the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to start by coming to a practical point which will probably be re-echoed throughout the House today, and will probably be on the minds of many people as they look at Dáil Éireann, and that is that there is a very real possibility of a general election. No matter how we may wish to play politics with the idea that there may be a general election, we have to be realistic enough to know the numbers in this House and to know that tonight, next week or before the autumn, we could be plunged back on the streets looking for votes.</P>
      <P>I am one person who would not relish knocking on doors for the third time in a year saying &ldquo;could I have your vote, please?&rdquo;.  They might say we had a Finance Bill which tried to raise funds to run the economy and we did not take the opportunity to enact that legislation to raise those funds and get on with running the country and it would be very difficult to answer those criticisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that the failure of this House to give passage to this Bill will set the country back roughly over £200 million. By the time the new Government is formed, we have all said our pieces on RTE and beaten our ideological breasts and said &ldquo;you are wrong and we were right&rdquo;, the country could have lost another £200 million.  We might look into our crystal balls and look back over the last decade to see who did what and who was responsible for what, but the reality today, 17 June 1982, is that the Finance Bill is before this House, and whether we <Col N="538" /> are totally happy with it &mdash; and nobody is totally happy with financial legislation &mdash; or mildly happy with it, this country is being given a Finance Bill it has not had for a very long time.  I wanted to start by making that point because I feel very strongly about it.  The Irish public expect the House to introduce a Finance Bill of some sort, whether we are or are not happy with it.  That is a very important point.  The alternative is to plunge the country into some kind of financial merry-go-round while we all go back to the streets.  Some might misinterpret those comments and say that I am afraid to go to the public for some reason. People without a lot of sympathy might say that, but that is not the reason.  The reason is the future of this country and the need to raise revenue to run it for months ahead, rather than indulging in politicking for the third time in a year. Without doubt, this country, like all western countries, is becoming difficult, to manage.  It is simple to point to this or that Minister, to this or that party and say &ldquo;You are to blame.  You did not do this&rdquo;, or &ldquo;You did that&rdquo;, but it is due to a combination of all our actions for many years.</P>
    <P>I will now take a quick look at how current expenditure for 1982 is budgeted. Straight away, a number of very important headlines stand out.  For example, servicing the public debt in 1982 is estimated to eat up 24 per cent of all current expenditure, whereas income tax collected is estimated to come to 26 per cent of all revenue.  The figures are £1,400 million for servicing the public debt and £1,500 million collected in income tax, that is PAYE.  We are virtually spending the great bulk of our PAYE payments in servicing the public debt.  I am sure that headline has sunk in many times, but it is no harm, in a debate such as this, to show again the actual figures.</P>
    <P>As a nation we must, it is hoped by agreement, come to grips with some basic figures, for example, those for the social services.  Between just three Departments &mdash; Social Welfare, Health and Education &mdash; we are spending 42 per cent.  If one adds in one or two small Departments, we are spending virtually <Col N="539" /> half of every penny on these Departments' services.  That raises all sorts of questions of value for money, cost of services, whether people should pay for some of those services for which they are not now paying and our general philosophy towards the provision of those services.  There is no doubting one fact.  We cannot, as a nation, continue to provide the volume, quality and level of services which we have been providing. The demands are swelling up.  Every T.D. receives those demands every working day of his life.  People want more of this and that.  They want more nurses, guards, doctors, social welfare benefits, teachers, schools.  It is quite clear that no State will ever be able even to attempt to meet a fraction of those demands.  One knows, from examining the figures, that it is not physically possible.</P>
    <P>Having accepted the reality of not being able to continue to put money into even those three Departments, let us look at some further figures.  The dependency rate here is 63 per cent, leaving 34 per cent of our people in the broadly employed area.  In that employed area, over a quarter are now working for the State.  One comes up with some 750,000 people, who are neither dependent on nor employed by the State.  This is out of a total population of 3.3 million.  One is asking 750,000 people to sustain the public service &mdash; which is fine, because one must have a good, solid sensible public service at an agreed level &mdash; but you are also asking that small number of people to maintain 50 per cent of the total State expenditure.  The sums just do not add up.  We cannot continue with that dependency ratio and that service figure to load more and more taxation on the backs of that small sector who are not State employees and not dependants. That is the golden goose which we tend to kill by heavy State attitudes to the private area and to industry generally.</P>
    <P>We must come to grips with the headline of the structure of the population and of the State services.  £2 out of every £3 spent here is now spent by the State. The consequent level of taxation needed to sustain that expenditure is a great burden <Col N="540" /> on us.  Over the past seven or eight years, employment in the public service has grown by 36,000 people, or 13 per cent.  In the manufacturing industry the growth was 7,000 people, amounting to 4 per cent.  Again, the gap is widening. We are asking a diminishing group of people to maintain an expanding demand for services from the State.  No matter what our politics, attitude or ideology, whether inclined more to the left or to the right, those basic figures must be tackled.</P>
    <P>The United States have an inflation rate of 6 per cent, Britain one of 9 per cent and our own at almost double that last figure.  This is something which must be tackled urgently.  The demand on the State services and the level of dependency are some of the main reasons for our level of inflation.</P>
    <P>Overall, on the Finance Bill, I am simply suggesting that the relationship between the money which the State raises and the money which it spends is getting out of proportion and running us into difficulty.  It would help to pull aside the curtain and look at another country to see how they manage.  For example, the situation in Austria is worth examining. It is a fairly small country with a population of 7½ million.  It is dependent to some extent on a very large neighbour, Germany, as we are dependent on ours. It is similar to Ireland in very many other respects, but its economic performance is strikingly different from ours.  It is a very open economy, its main trading partner being its German neighbour. Imports and exports each account for 40 per cent of national income.  It is heavily dependent on imported energy and raw material, as well as capital goods.  Yet, unemployment, although rising slightly, is still only 2 per cent of the workforce. In spite of a growing population of working age, youth unemployment is still extremely low.  Inflation, although again rising, is now at a figure of 7 per cent. The external deficit is deteriorating, but is still below 5 per cent of the national income.</P>
    <P>The differences between Ireland and a small country like Austria could hardly be more marked.  How have they managed <Col N="541" /> to be strikingly more successful in their economic policies than we have? The main reasons undoubtedly are the unique Austrian system of economic planning and economic policy making. This is much wider than just an incomes policy.  It is more an agreement between the social partners &mdash; labour, business and Government &mdash; and the system has a very long history.  Austrians from their experience of civil war, political persecutions and foreign occupations, decided to co-operate on the basis of equity.  That is what this country will soon have to do, bury the ideological differences and conflicts and solve some of our economic problems on a more consensus basis.</P>

      <P>On 2 May 1982 the Government announced that local authorities may approve loans under the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981.

      <P>I thank you, Sir, and the Minister for having agreed to take the supplementaries today on these questions. The Minister has said that he would advise only people who cannot raise conventional loans in the ordinary way to use the agency.

If the Minister tells me he does not know I will accept that as an honest answer but he should stop playing around with this matter.  If the country has not the money applicants should be told they will not get the loans.  Giving answers such as, &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;in due process&rdquo; is insulting.  I know the Minister has a difficult job but the answer he is giving us is not worthy of him.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will agree to vary the conditions stipulated by the Housing Finance Agency to allow persons to go on projected earnings where they have been on substantial social welfare earnings for the previous year or where they did not have earnings at all; if he will consider introducing amending legislation or making an amending order if necessary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain guidelines were issued to housing authorities by my Department on 26 February 1982, to advise them of the general policies and principles to be adopted in dealing with applications for agency loans.  This document stated specifically that the maximum amount of loan available under the scheme will be three times the gross income (including overtime) of the borrower or his spouse in the previous tax year, subject to this amount not exceeding 90 per cent of the net value of the house or the appropriate upper loan limit; provided, however, that where the income of a borrower or his spouse in the previous tax year was derived mainly from social welfare payments the amount of loan may be based on a multiple of up to three times the estimated income in the current year.  To alter the scheme along the lines recommended by the Deputy would increase <Col N="552" /> liabilities under the scheme.  The agency considers that it would be undesirable at this early stage to alter the details of the scheme in a manner which would lead to increased liabilities.  The agency will, however, keep the operation of the scheme under review and introduce amendments to the scheme in due course in the light of experience.  Any such amendments will be subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I share the agency's view as regards their general approach to the question of amendments to the scheme, and I am not disposed at this stage to issue a directive to the agency along the lines proposed by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when Deputy Barry was Minister for the Environment and introduced this legislation, he wanted to make finance available as widely as possible and to as many people as possible, especially to those most in need?  It is not helpful to restrict benefit to someone who is unemployed for 20 or 23 weeks or, in the case of one constituent of mine who was a voluntary lay preacher, and had no income in the previous year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> Is the Minister aware that when the multiplier is applied to a previous year's earnings it is the only time that such a system is used with regard to housing finance loans?  If one gets a loan from a building society it is based on the current year's earnings. Surely the original design of the scheme was that the £9,000 income limit was based on the previous year's earnings in order to qualify?  Would the Minister agree to apply the multiplier to this year's earnings in the circumstances which Deputy Mitchell has outlined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what Deputy Barry has also said I will look at this question.  With regard to general income it is generally the income on 5 April 1982, which is taken into account for loans.  I take the Deputy's point and I will raise it with the agency next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary pounds operated by local authorities are not generally regarded as suitable for the holding of dogs.  Homes or shelters for stray and unwanted dogs and cats may be provided by local authorities with the aid of grants under a scheme operated by my Department and presumably the Deputy is referring to this scheme.  Under this scheme, local authorities may be recouped 50 per cent of their expenditure on the provision or the operation and maintenance of existing shelters or homes.  The only such shelters provided by local authorities, so far, are in Counties Wicklow and Long-ford, but I understand that a number of other local authorities are in the process of providing such facilities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment when he proposes to introduce building regulations which will ban the use of highly flammable <Col N="561" /> materials in the construction of new buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the building regulations can be brought into force it will be necessary to enact amending legislation to provide for a more flexible control system than that originally envisaged and also to enable the regulations to be used to promote energy conservation in building and to allow for the implementation of proposed E.E.C. directives with implications for building regulations.  The preparation of the necessary legislation is well advanced and will be introduced as soon as possible with a view to having building regulations in force by 1983.</P>
      <P>Building regulations are written in terms of performance requirements which, in so far as danger from fire is concerned, minimise the risk.  Only materials which enable these performance requirements to be met will be permitted to be used in the construction of a building. It is intended to make provision in the proposed legislation for the banning of unsafe materials should the need arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. B. Allen Mr. B. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Though these regulations have been in force since 1981, is the Minister aware that even to date there is a total absence of building standards and that builders are embarking on new projects while using unsafe materials while we are powerless to do anything about the situation?  On the occasion of a tragedy lip service is paid by Minister to the need for proper standards but no action is taken.  Would the Minister ensure that the regulations in relation to flammable materials are taken out of the overall regulations and brought before the House immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point being made but I would prefer to deal with all the regulations in one piece of legislation.  I would point out though that local authorities have been informed that they should ensure that all materials used in the building of houses are safe from the point of view of constituting a fire risk.  I have not received correspondence <Col N="562" /> from any individual or organisation to indicate that these instructions are not being complied with.</P>

      <P>The position is that the regulations cannot be enforced.  Is the Minister aware that at a seminar held in March this year by the IIRS, the present regulations were described as incomplete and incomprehensible?  Therefore, anticipating the next question, would the Minister be prepared to re-draft the regulations published in 1981?</P>

However, they are experiencing difficulty in regard to having items used in their work tested.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. B. Allen Mr. B. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's reply.  Is he aware of a proposal that was passed at a meeting of the IIRS in March of this year to the effect that the language of the regulations is imprecise and downright unintelligible?  In the light of that statement from the institute will he now consider a complete redrafting of the regulations?  Also, since the regulations are so imprecise, will his Department embark on an educational programme <Col N="565" /> for builders and the allied trades?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Some minor alterations in the regulations will be proposed.  In regard to the terms, the Deputy can take it that the building regulations we propose to bring before the House will be comprehensive and will deal with all the items.  If anything arises when they come before the House in regard to amendments and so on I or the Minister will be very sympathetically disposed if it is in the interests of doing a good job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to have a good job done will the Minister of State agree that, if the regulations are to be administered by a system of self-certification and the people who certify that they have complied with the building regulations will in law be liable for anything that goes amiss as a consequence, it is absolutely essential that those regulations can be interpreted clearly by the person who has to certify them and by a subsequent court in the event of a civil action?  Will he agree that the view expressed by the IIRS and by many other people is that at the moment in their current form the building regulations are vague and imprecise and open to different kinds of interpretation, which could lead to a disastrously complicated set of legal actions and would be counter-active to the purpose for which the building regulations were drawn up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that prospective house purchasers who have placed deposits with builders have lost their deposits when the builder went bankrupt; and if he will without delay enter into discussions with the CIF with a view to extending the house building guarantee scheme to include full insurance cover to provide for full repayments in such cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any purchasers of houses registered under the structural guarantee scheme have lost their deposits because the builders had gone bankrupt.  The main purpose of the structural guarantee scheme, which is operated by the National House Building Guarantee Company, is to protect purchasers from the legal and financial burdens that a major structural defect might involve.  Nevertheless, house builders who seek registration under the scheme are subject to detailed financial and technical vetting to ensure, as far as possible, that they have the resources and expertise to build to acceptable standards and the financial capacity to complete the <Col N="567" /> construction of their houses and honour their obligations to the purchasers.</P>
      <P>The extension of the scheme to provide cover for prospective purchasers in respect of endangered deposits is primarily a matter for the guarantee company and would involve a revision of the rules of the scheme.  The on-going operation of the scheme is closely monitored by officials of my Department, who act as observers in the company.  I have instructed my officials to pursue the question of protection for deposits and to report to me in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to enlighten the Deputy a little more.  There is no evidence that any of the purchasers of the 34,000 houses registered under the scheme since it commenced have lost their deposits because of the builders going bankrupt.  No case has been brought to me in respect of a builder going bankrupt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the recession in the building industry at the moment and of recent unfortunate bankruptcies of house-building companies of which the Minister is undoubtedly aware, would he agree that it is a very serious situation, and that the people who placed the deposits under the present financial law have no rights &mdash; or they have rights but they have no prospects at all of getting their money back?  They are so far down in the queue in terms of other creditors that in reality if the company goes bankrupt they will not see their deposits. Would the Minister of State accept that it is reasonable for the building industry and his Department to extend some system of insurance bonding that will cover what will be a minority, a very small <Col N="568" /> percentage of cases?  For the people concerned it is their one and only chance of getting a house, and if they lose their deposit they can forget about trying to get another one.</P>

    <P>The memorandum referred to, which was issued by my Department on 21 April 1982 to each housing authority and the <Col N="571" /> National Building Agency, merely reiterates in detail for their convenience existing standards and guidelines which were contained in a number of circular letters which issued to local authorities over several years.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will summarise the points I made before Question Time.  I adverted to the possibility of another general election and pointed out that the situation would be that we would be without a Finance Bill in that event for a considerable period.  I suggested that might cost the country in the region of £250 million.  I concluded my point by pointing to the responsibility of the House to provide the country with a Finance Bill irrespective of whether Members are totally happy with various sections of it.  That is a great responsibility on Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went on from there to point to a few headlines in the financial situation.  One is that the servicing of the public debt is now eating up virtually 90 per cent of the total take from the PAYE sector which demonstrates that that is a road that we cannot go down for any period of time. I pointed out that over the years we got ourselves into a situation where virtually 50 per cent of total current expenditure by the State was spent in three Departments, Social Welfare, Education and Health.  I seriously question whether we are receiving value for money in those areas.  I also pointed out the very narrow tax base which applies to this country.  I quoted a figure of 700,000 to 800,000 people who could be regarded as the real tax base because the gap between them and the population of 3.3 million is taken up with dependants and those employed in the public service.  That is a statistic which is getting worse and one which I pointed out as a headline for the nation which we ignore at our peril.  In the past six years the public service grew by 37,000 people while manufacturing grew by 7,500 people.  If the public service is to achieve anything close to 20 per cent this <Col N="599" /> year, the cumulative increase in public service pay between 1981 and 1983 will come to 75 per cent.  That is at a time when incomes in industry, industrial services and agriculture will probably fall.  I pointed to the tension in society and said the greatest tension seems to be between the public sector and the non-public sector.  The figure of 75 per cent illustrates the point I am making.  The consequent imbalances in income awards, job opportunity and security in different sectors of the economy are factors which make this country harder and harder to govern.</P>
    <P>I went on to talk about the situation in Austria.  I pointed to the openness of that economy and how they got their inflation rate down to 7 per cent.  Unemployment is down to 3 per cent.  They did this by putting aside ideological differences which existed in their parliament and among their people.  They embarked on a course of putting the economic difficulties before any other consideration.  It seems to be meeting with some success.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I made before Question Time and I should like to continue by pointing to the situation in Austria where they have appointed a joint commission for prices and wages which consists of 20 people.  Labour has abstained from using its full bargaining power in return for a direct influence on price formation and on economic policy generally.  Some prices, notably foodstuffs and energy, are controlled by the Government.  The others are subject to voluntary control.  The joint committee have taken a grip on the economy in that way.  Free wage-bargaining is allowed. They do not interfere except to postpone negotiations from time to time.  Success on the prices front has moderated wage claims to competitive levels.  Bargains have been made with unions which are linked to tax cuts.  They have successfully managed a hard currency policy which is difficult to implement.  The unions have accepted the need for international competitiveness to be maintained.  This has improved the Austrian economy and there is no reason why it could not be done.  It has produced a remarkable <Col N="600" /> degree of self-discipline among workers and wages have tended to move with those in the highly-competitive German economy.</P>
    <P>The main reason for consensus on income determination has been that all sides, business, Government and unions, are committed to maintaining employment at a high level.  They managed to keep inflation under control and because of this have been able to introduce more expansionary policies.  There are many similarities between the Austrian economy and ours.  Between us all we seem to have failed dismally for many decades to lessen, let alone eliminate, our problems.  Perhaps the Austrian experience is one we should look at.</P>
    <P>We have had social partnerships, national wage agreements and various gatherings of the brains of the nation to sort out our problems but in the end we seem to retreat into our sectional groups when the chips are down.  The interests of the nation seem to come out last.  If we are to have a new social partnership now is the time for it.  It must be genuine and unselfish.  It is obvious to anyone who looks at our situation that our options are limited.  Basically in terms of day-to-day finance we have three options.  We can put more tax on the people.  We can broaden the tax base and pile on taxation. Quite frankly, that is not an option and there is no point in anyone thinking that that is the answer to all our problems or that we can continue to pay for services.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the level of services is not maintainable.  Not only is it not maintainable but, as the years roll on, it will be even more impossible to maintain the present level of services.  Seeking to raise extra taxation is therefore not an option.  I agree with those who say taxation has reached saturation point.  I was speaking to a constituent the other day and I was told the joint income of himself and his wife is of the order of £16,000. With PAYE, car tax, value-added tax and the various direct and indirect taxes, he calculated that he was returning to the State out of that £16,000 something of the order of £13,000.  Admittedly some of the taxation involved would be voluntary <Col N="601" /> indirect taxation but, even so, there are not many options these days in personal expenditure.</P>
    <P>Taxation in not the answer.  Some effort must be made to introduce a broader spread.  The tax basis is something of the order of 24 per cent on the entire working population.  That is the fresh money coming in.  What we must do is spread that, broaden it out and introduce greater equity.  I trust the commission will take a major step in that direction because taxation reaches a stage at which incentive dies.  It stifles initiative. What then is the other option?  I have already pointed out that virtually all the return from PAYE goes in servicing the national debt.  It would be quite unsustainable to increase borrowing, thereby adding to the national debt.  One need not dwell on that.  It is quite obvious.  It is now accepted there is no real option in that regard and we can no longer look to it.</P>
    <P>That brings us then to the only remaining sensible option.  Whether the ideology is left or right, or whether one wants to deal practically with the matter, one thing is quite clear, namely, that the level of public expenditure has reached an all-time high.  Someone will have to shout &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  I have dismissed the other two options and I know the public at large have also dismissed them.  The difficulty in curtailing public expenditure is that somebody who wants to be clever will immediately start arguing about a reduction in gardaí, a reduction in the schools, a reduction in the number of teachers and so on.  Over the years we have tried to achieve a successful embargo on employment in the public service.  I quoted the figure of 37,000 new people in the public service in seven years and 7,000 in manufacturing industry.  This shows that, however much we may try to control public expenditure in the public service, we have not been successful, mainly because of the enormous increasing demands under the headings of social welfare, health and education and more and more State services generally.  We may indeed have reached the point at which the effort must be to ensure that the level of expenditure will not continue <Col N="602" /> to rise.  Health expenditure in just one decade has doubled proportionately.  I emphasise proportionately.  We are spending twice as much proportionately on health as we did ten years ago despite the fact that we have not earned the extra money to pay for the service in that period.</P>
    <P>We are now spending 8 per cent of GNP on health.  That caters for some 45 per cent of our people.  Britain spends 7 or 8 per cent of GNP in catering for 90 per cent of the population.  That comparison must lead to very close questioning of the cost-benefit of every £ we spend on these services.  Public expenditure is growing at an alarming rate.</P>
    <P>To digress for the moment, I had a lady to see me the other day.  She lives in a corporation house.  She waited an hour to tell me that the taps in her bathroom were dripping and she wanted to know if I could get the corporation to fix them. She was living on a corporation estate and she said the repair was not her responsibility.  I had a gentleman from a corporation estate who told me his front window had been broken and he wanted me to get the corporation to fix the window. I told both that the State is not there to act as a continual subsidy machine.  It is there to protect the vulnerable and encourage people but certainly not there at one's right hand every time something minor goes wrong.</P>
    <P>That mentality seems to be growing.  It is increasing the cost of the public service and thereby increasing taxation out of all proportion.  I say that quite bluntly. Equally bluntly I say that the only real financial option in the foreseeable future is the control of public expenditure. Much as we may hate to do that, much as we may hate to say to schools, or hospitals and so on that they will have to do with less, nevertheless that is now the only approach.  But we must not do that on its own because on its own it would depress the economy.  Parallel with that we must try to increase that figure of 24 per cent mainly in the private sector so that a surplus can be produced to enable us to pay for increasing services in other areas.</P>
    <P>The country needs a double injection. <Col N="603" /> It needs control of public expenditure and at the same time encouragement to the private sector to improve competitiveness. There must be no disincentives to those who wish to create employment.  Most of our employers are very small, five, six or ten man operations. They must be protected.  I am supported in this by no less a body than the Central Bank in its report, which says:</P>
    <P>The primary and immediate objectives of economic policy at present, therefore, should be to</P>
    <P>(i)  correct the imbalance in the public sector finances &mdash; particularly through introducing policies that will lead to the elimination,......of the current budget deficit......</P>
    <P>(ii)  improve the competitiveness of Irish industry and services.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Central Bank also have diagnosed the remedy we must adopt.  To be fair to it I think this Finance Bill has taken a step in that direction.  It has tackled the question of the deficit and has budgeted to reduce it in the 12 months to end-December 1982.  I look forward to some results in that regard.  The Central Bank have advocated that course of action as being the only one now available to us.</P>
    <P>I pointed out earlier tensions between the public and private sectors.  I want to suggest a road we might take in that respect.  For example, in New Zealand the system of awarding wage rounds is as follows.  The private sector enter into negotiations in the first place based on what the economy has actually achieved. When the private sector have finished their rounds of negotiations a norm is taken which is automatically and statutorily applied to the public service.  The private industrial sector, therefore, set the norm for increases in the public service and the public service have no option but to follow that norm on the instructions of the national parliament. What happens here?  We do it the other way round.  First of all we sit down &mdash; and <Col N="604" /> have done for many years &mdash; with the public service and tend to say, &ldquo;what is the rate of inflation?  What do you need? What can we get away with?&rdquo;Then we set that figure.  Then we tend to throw the private sector off the deep end and say, &ldquo;Well, you can always plead inability to pay&rdquo;.  That is putting the cart before the horse.  The New Zealand system at least carries the benefit of pinning wage increases to something tangible which is the performance of the economy.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, and must do so again, between the years 1981 and 1982 the cumulative increase in public service pay came to about 75 per cent while the corresponding figures for industry fell.  It is quite clear that that road cannot be taken.  Without making it a contentious political issue &mdash; there are too many of them, they are too divisive and rend the country assunder &mdash; we might examine the possibility of getting our order of priorities correct.  We might measure the performance of the economy by initiating our negotiations in the private sector, coming up with some figures based on the performance of the economy &mdash; that is what the traffic will bear and the country can afford &mdash; because the private sector is well able to decide what the country can afford, the unions on the one side and management on the other.  Having done that we might then take a similar figure, or some formula based on that figure, to the public service.  If we do not do it in this way we shall be off on the old spiral of the public service using its muscle, getting its increase, leaving it to ordinary firms to plead inability to pay, or go out of business thus increasing the employment queues.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the main point I wanted to make in this debate, which is that I look forward eagerly and with some excitement to the production of a national economic plan.  I know the Government have committed themselves to this, as indeed had the previous Government.  That plan must be the saviour of our economy because if it is not and if it does not come up with solutions to the difficulties at present confronting the country, then we shall have <Col N="605" /> missed a tremendous opportunity to tackle our problems.  That economic plan must, first of all, deal with the financial situation about which I spoke.  It must take account of the fact that we are using all of our PAYE revenue to pay the national debt, that £2 out of £3 in this country is spent by the State at present. It must take account of the growth in the public service.  It must take account also of the fact that we are spending nearly half our current expenditure on three Government Departments, Social Welfare, Health and Education.  It must take account of the fact that the options of borrowing and of increased taxation are not real options.  Therefore, it must face squarely and honestly the only remaining option as a means of curtaining the growth of public expenditure and must do so honestly and openly.  I am confident it will and I urge the Government to tackle it in that way.</P>
    <P>Having done that, this economic plan must also undertake something much more fundamental.  It must adopt an economic philosophy which defines the economic direction of the nation in the few years ahead.  It must define the role of the State.  Are we to continue to have the State act as the main generator of employment, to have the State act as the party that picks up all the tabs, to have it act as the great big brother who breathes down the necks of everybody?  Or are we to adopt the philosophy which merely says: &ldquo;Come here a second, the role of the State in this country is to be this &mdash; it should guide the people of enterprise who want to provide employment; it should prevent the worst excesses of the private sector; should there be excesses its role should be to prevent abuses of the private sector, to act as a referee, a hand-holder and a general climate setter of the economy.&rdquo;  I fear we cannot have it both ways.  I fear we cannot produce an economic plan which says on the one hand that we shall have some involvement by the State whenever it suits us and, on the other, some involvement by the private sector whenever it suits us.  This country is too small to have opposing ideological approaches to our economic difficulties of the day.  I trust and I am confident that <Col N="606" /> this economic plan will seek to address those issues and come up with solutions to them.  I am not privy to the information as to when that plan will be produced but I see from parliamentary questions that it will come up in the near future.</P>
    <P>I should say also that in writing that plan I trust and hope the Government of the day will take into account not just their own views but those of every Member of this House, of pressure groups and the public at large.  If it does not seek to pull together the various philosophies, the various pressures and realities facing the country, if it does not pull together those strands and define a course of action over the next five years &mdash; based on the kind of philosophy about which I have been speaking &mdash; I personally fear that the country will sink into an even deeper decline.  I trust that is something none of us wants to see.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the economic plan at least to that extent I want to move on but, before doing so, I should like to quote an attitude of mind with which I find it difficult to disagree.  Here I am quoting the head of the IDA, Mr. Padraig White, as reported in a recent newspaper article:</P>
    <P>What was needed was a fundamental change in attitude, and the attitude to hard work, he said.  &ldquo;The basic problem with Ireland is that the public sector attitude and mentality dominates thinking within the country: that attitude is that you rely on the State, you get a job with the State which doesn't involve you in great risk.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Quite bluntly he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That's going to change over the 1980s.  It might be turbulent, but it's going to change because the public sector is not going to be able to employ the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I have demonstrated here today from my earlier comments on the budgetary figures that the public service indeed are not going to be able to take up that slack.  There are some 100,000 youngsters at present coming through the educational system at intermediate and leaving certificate levels and there is no way at all, looking at those figures, that <Col N="607" /> the public service can make any real impact on taking up the employment slack there.  Certainly I agree with Mr. White when he says that it will be turbulent. Indeed &ldquo;turbulent&rdquo; probably is too mild a word to describe it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the only solution is to address the problems honestly and openly in the manner I have advocated within an economic plan.  The end of this century is the year 2000 A. D.  That probably seems to be a long time away but in fact it is only 18 years.  Children born today will be 18 years of age at the turn of the century.  We shall see many changes in those years and we shall face many stresses.  But from the point of view of the country's infrastructure, for example, we shall need another city virtually the size of Dublin because the average growth of 1 per cent per annum will result in a population in excess of perhaps 4,000,000 people by the turn of the century and a substantial shift in age structure, with the young, the 15 to 29 age group, greatly exceeding the maturer age group, the 30 to 49 or so, group.  We will see a very rapid shift towards urbanisation. Half of the population by the turn of the century will be living within a 50-mile radius of Dublin city.  By the end of the century also we will have perhaps three-quarters or 80 per cent of the people living in cities and towns if present trends continue.</P>
    <P>Our population growth is now among the highest in the EEC and will exceed a figure of four million by the turn of the century.  We have not been able to keep pace with the growth in population and we have not been able to keep pace with these developments.  It was estimated recently by An Foras Forbartha that between now and the turn of the century we need to spend £30 billion on putting in the kind of environmental infrastructure, roads, schools, telephones and all the various infrastructures we need in the next 18 years.  Where in ainm Dé will we get £30 billion between now and the end of the century?</P>
    <P>We certainly cannot do that if we continue to milk the system dry to the extent we have been doing for a long time.  The <Col N="608" /> State will not be able to meet that bill. We may need more imaginative forms of raising finance, we may need to talk to the private sector more honestly and openly and we may need to involve the public in helping to fund various projects. I have not got all the answers.  I am sure the economic plan will include some imaginative answers to the kind of problem. If we have not found the answers by the end of the century we will be faced with traffic jams which will make the traffic jams in Dublin city at the moment look like a freeway, which will make the pollution and all the various environmental difficulties look like kids stuff.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the money will come from.  On the figures of the economy for the past decade, that kind of money is not here.  I am trying to inject the realism which simply says that we need to invest in our infrastructure, that we need to spent that £30 billion which we have not got, so we must give some imaginative thought to the question of where we will get it.  Earlier today at Question Time the Minister of State said time and time again that he would love to do this, that and the other scheme if he had the money.  Quite clearly he has not got it and no other Minister ever had it.  With an expenditure of up to 50 per cent on only three Departments and the figure growing all the time, there is no way the Minister will ever get that money, because that figure will continue to increase as the years go on.</P>
    <P>I want to see imaginative answers in the economic plan to the problems of the day.  I do not believe the recession has bottomed out.  That is disappointing, considering we have a lot of advantages.  We have a sterling advantage, we have an oil advantage because oil prices have come down and we now have a dollar advantage. Despite those advantages we do not seem to be able to get ourselves up on our feet.  I look to the economic plan to chart the course for Irish business, public institutions and the semi-State companies, to tell them what is on for the next five years and what is not on and to pinpoint the type of objectives and targets they will have to meet in that time. One would not dream of running a business <Col N="609" /> today without a three-or four-year plan for how one would do it.  Neither can one attempt to run a state as complex as ours without a similar type of plan. Under such a scheme Irish business will, hopefully, be able to plan its own development and employment needs, what areas it can get into and the areas it can make money on to provide the taxation which the country needs.</P>
    <P>The Government are collecting 3 per cent of the total revenue of the State in corporation tax.  My friends in the Workers' Party will probably say that that is because they are all dodging tax.  I have another view of it.  I believe that the vast majority of Irish companies &mdash; I will put the figure at 60 per cent &mdash; are losing money and are not paying corporation tax because of that.  On the national balance sheet, if we continue to allow expenditure to go up and revenue to drop, as has been happening by firms getting into trouble, we will obviously face national bankruptcy and we will not be able to avoid the kind of measures needed to develop the economy in the years ahead.  The young people of today expect us to develop the economy.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the old simple answer thrown out from time to time &mdash; devaluation &mdash; is the solution.  It gives an artificial boost in the short term.  There is a feeling in the country that all of a sudden everything is a bit lighter and easier.  But, unless it is accompanied by very stringent financial economic measures it is worse than useless because it gives a short-term reprieve before we go into the same type of cycle again.  I am not happy with devaluation because I believe the public would see it as a solution to the problems and not what in fact it is, the start to a series of very difficult measures.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what I said earlier, that we have become a subsidy-saturated society.  There is nothing we wish to do now for which we cannot look for a subsidy. Much as it pains me to disagree with Members of the Opposition, I must recall something said by Richie Ryan on radio one day during the time of the great snow, which everybody remembers.  He said: &ldquo;Go out and clean the snow from your own front garden&rdquo;.  That is the type <Col N="610" /> of philosophy I would like to see incorporated in a new national economic plan. I mentioned earlier the people who came to see me in my clinic and who asked me to get their windows fixed and to get other things done for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said it pained him to disagree with members of the Opposition.  The Deputy has actually agreed with the Opposition.  That is what is paining him and that does him credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of pain the Opposition give me is not measurable. We have all paid lip service to reform of parliamentary procedure.  I am only 12 months in the Dáil and this is probably the sixth or seventh time I have mentioned this.  We all seem to run away from it when the chips are down.  We must do something about the reform of the House and about getting the financial procedures and the debating procedures right.  I saw in the Fine Gael manifesto before the 1981 General Election a commitment to tackle that, but after seven months in office it was not tackled.  We, on our part, mentioned it from time to time but never actually got around to it. It is something which we must honestly face.  I am not convinced that we are dealing efficiently with financial legislation and legislation in general.  The Chair may feel that this does not come under the Finance Bill but I raise it in the specific context of the manner in which we analyse financial expenditure.</P>
      <P>There is a need for some financial committee of this House to go through the various figures in the public glare, comment on them and bring them to the attention of the public.  I would like to see some improvement in that regard in the years ahead, but hopefully in the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item to be mentioned is our balance of payments.  That is a nice, economic cliché for most of us but the harsh reality is otherwise.  The balance of payments deficit has reached an unprecedented level of £1,300 million, which is now equivalent to 13 per cent of the national output.  We simply must get our exports up and our imports down.  Various <Col N="611" /> reports from professional accountancy bodies time and time again have stated that Irish industry is working at something like 50 or 60 per cent of its output.  It could take another 40 or 50 per cent, if it could sell it.  It could sell it if we could get our marketing and exporting philosophy organised.  Córas Tráchtála do a fair job, considering their resources. We reach a very tiny proportion of all the markets of the world.  As a trading nation, if we do not export we do not survive.  I have said to a number of young people recently &ldquo;Look at the world markets and see what you can sell to them. Do not fall back on the State.  By selling to the world at large, you are seeking to take up the slack in Irish industry&rdquo;.  Irish industry, believe me, is now gasping and is slack, indeed.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I regarded the Finance Bill, in its attempt to close the budgetary deficit, as being an honest first step.  In that regard, I support the Finance Bill.  I summarise by saying &mdash; and we must make no mistake about it &mdash; that a country will not remain unchanged if tens of thousands of young unemployed march every year on our streets.  It will not remain unchanged when we must find this extra £30 billion for infrastructure.  It will not remain unchanged if we find that all our PAYE money is going on borrowing and that our public services are costing increasingly more money.  It is the duty and role of political parties and Governments to seek to make the changes which will live up to the responsibility placed on their shoulders in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I have put forward what I believe to be the solution, which is twofold.  It is to contain public expenditure, to encourage the private sector by a series of initiatives, by seeking more concensus in our economic policies, more agreement.  Let us have the battle on the streets, but, having had it, let us get down to running our economy and finding a consensus as to how we are to do that.  We should package all this into a national economic plan, which above all has as its core and central root a national economic philosophy which charts the course of the country for <Col N="612" /> the years ahead and which says &ldquo;The State has a central guiding role.  It can do so much, but to look to it to do all that has been asked of it is just not on&rdquo;.  We politicians must continue to spell out that message in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In supporting the Finance Bill, I look forward to that economic plan and trust that it will incorporate these issues, get some consensus as to the solutions and chart our way forward, so that we can have a document we can all support whether on the Government, Opposition or minority side or as members of the public generally.  We want an economic philosophy in a document which we can support.  The public are willing to support such a document.  I know that the Government will produce that document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No document presented to this House is of as much interest and importance to the community as a whole as the Finance Bill and its budgetary policy.  Each year, this legislation is looked forward to with interest and, by some, with apprehension.  No segment of our people view the annual budgetary policy with the same interest as do that sector confined within the PAYE system. Over a number of years they have experienced, which is generally admitted, that their contribution to the Exchequer has been far in excess of what is justifiable.</P>
      <P>It would take much longer than the time available this afternoon to go into the merits and justifications of their protests, marches, frustrations and discontentment. The frustration and discontentment have reached such proportions as at last to bring a realisation to the Government and all other sectors of our community that the necessary adjustment in that taxation system, to bring about a degree of equality, cannot be much further delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Brennan has already said, we all hope that the Commission on Taxation will be both courageous and just in its interpretation of what the total taxation system should be and that, at long last, the PAYE sector will receive justice, so that that element of discontent, <Col N="613" /> so high among that very important sector of our community, is finally removed.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with a number of problems regarding the economy.  I start with the tourist industry which is of vital importance to the economy and which is in a state of absolute disarray at the moment.  Because of its importance, it merits immediate consideration from the Government, Bord Fáilte and all tourism interests.  Let me say at the outset that the principal factors in the decline of this most important industry are inflation and taxation.  Our current inflation has raised our prices to such an extent that they are now completely out of line with some of our competitors in the tourist industry. Taxation on petrol, drink and VAT on restaurant and hotel meals has been the last straw which has about broken the camel's back.</P>
    <P>Last year, the tourist injection into our economy was £650 million.  To date there has been a substantial drop.  This decline is caused by our inflation rate, our policy of taxation and, to some extent, the political climate.  As we all know, since 1969 the northern troubles have had an effect on tourism.  Current British events have also created an unfavourable situation. We have a long-standing relationship with the ordinary British citizen and our brothers in Northern Ireland.  At this point of crisis in the industry Bord Fáilte and the Government should intensify their efforts to win back that element of the British and Northern Ireland tourist market that was so welcome here and made such a major contribution to the economy.  It is important that immediate steps be taken because there is absolute depression among the major elements of this industry at the moment.  Hotels, guesthouses, bars, cafes and so on in tourist areas are suffering a drastic drop in their earnings.  Unless the situation improves this will have serious repercussions for the rating authorities because those are among the most highly valued premises and make a very large contribution to the finances of the local authorities. The serious decline in incomes will have a serious effect on their ability to pay the rates which will affect local <Col N="614" /> authority finances by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>There are a number of Government Departments involved to some extent in tourism, including the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, who have direct responsibility.  The Department of Transport have among their vital concerns air, sea and rail travel and these are concerned with the development and growth of tourism.  The Department of Education is involved in training hotel management staffs and all grades of hotel staffs.  The Department of the Environment are involved with roads, car parks, monuments and so on.  The tourist industry is such that it should have a specific ministry and that ministry should cross into some of the areas in the Departments that I mentioned with a view to getting a completely consolidated structure that would take into account all the aspects that are so important in this vital industry. We are now approaching the peak of the tourist season and because of the prevailing depression positive steps should immediately be taken to initiate a very intensive sales programme in Britain and Northern Ireland as the best basis for a hope of resumption of the normal tourism programme for the remainder of the year.  Also the programme for the development of home holidays should be intensified with a view to retaining as much holiday money as possible within the country.</P>
    <P>I will now deal briefly with agriculture. This industry has been in deep recession since 1978.  There has been a very substantial fall in incomes and milk production. In my own area milk production has dropped very substantially.  This year there is some indication of a slight increase.  But the drop in milk production for that area represented a loss of about £15 million to members of the co-operative. That is bad.  But any drop in milk production and processing means very substantial job losses.  Our co-operatives have been operating rationalisation and redundancy policies which are a disaster so far as local employment is concerned. The creamery and co-operative industries were one of the biggest centralised employment agencies in rural Ireland.  I asked the Taoiseach last week what tonnage <Col N="615" /> of potatoes was imported in 1981. The astonishing figure of more than 60,000 tons is not only a disaster for our economy but a disgrace to our society. We are one of the principal agricultural communities in Europe and yet in 1981, in addition to the potatoes, we imported about 700 million tons of agricultural goods.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned the serious position in regard to the balance of payments.  Here is an area in which both courage and planning are required to ensure that colossal bill is at least reduced if not finally eliminated.  I am convinced that the traditional farmers have not lost the technique of producing potatoes and vegetables.  What is required is a marketing and processing and presentation system which cannot be developed by the individual farmer but can only be undertaken through a major expansion of the co-operative movement into this field.  The Department of Agriculture, the co-operatives and the various farmers' organisations have a major responsibility to ensure that the situation as we now see it, this colossal importation at great cost to our economy of goods which are capable of being produced here and which could create so much employment that is so badly needed, is remedied before things get much worse.  With the goodwill that must be there much can be achieved.  Then we can look forward to an expansion of employment from the country's natural resources.</P>
    <P>In the budget, provision was made for exemption from stamp duty in respect of the transfer of land from father to son. There are specific requirements in order to qualify for the exemption.  I accept that today scientific as well as practical training is of the utmost importance.  There are a number of people under 35 years of age who would not only have 17 or 18 years' practical experience in agricultural development but in many cases have been managers of their parents' farms. As the regulations stand, such practically qualified farmers would not benefit from the proposed relief.  The Minister for Finance should have another look at this regulation which encourages the transfer <Col N="616" /> from older to younger farmers because this could result in the dynamic agricultural development required.</P>
    <P>There is a dire need for the development of a realistic land policy.  The Land Commission, who do useful work and who have an excellent staff, are starved of the necessary finance to allow them to make any contribution to the realignment of land, particularly in the west, where it is required to enlarge uneconomic holdings. Far too frequently we find that foreigners with adequate bank accounts will outbid a local farmer, thereby denying him and his successors the opportunity to develop his agricultural holding to make it an economic unit.  This whole area of land realignment and the number of foreigners allowed to purchase land under EEC regulations should be looked at again.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission policy seems to be that after a residency of seven years any EEC citizen is entitled to purchase land here.  I know of cases where foreigners bought land but it was not registered in their names until 16 years later.  There is a loophole in the law which enables some foreigners to purchase land and these transactions are not made known to the Land Commission until residency has been proved.  There are a number of people who are not EEC residents and who have not resided here for the requisite period who are registered land owners. Taking into account the scarcity of land to enable small farmers to have economic holdings and the number of young people who would like to have their own farm but who cannot get land, we should be very concerned that land does not pass out of the ownership of Irish citizens. This is of fundamental importance.  The development of a land policy is urgently needed, especially a land policy which will aim at allocating land to the people with small uneconomic holdings rather than allowing people with 300, 400 or 500 acres to buy that land.</P>
    <P>A major portion of this Finance Bill is taken up by social welfare.  The social welfare recipient has become the hobby horse of many concerns who want to level criticism at the system.  It has been said that the level of social welfare benefits is <Col N="617" /> responsible for our unemployment level. Every Deputy knows the problems experienced by those on social welfare. The first thing we must realise is that poverty is confined to those dependent on social welfare.  It has been said that people on the higher levels of social welfare will not take employment.  If this claim had any substance we would never see protest marches or hear of disputes when a factory is threatened with closure. I can assure Deputies that when announcements of closure are made there is a great deal of concern among workers and their families and the overwhelming majority of these people would rather work than face unemployment.</P>
    <P>Some people claim social welfare recipients are a drag on the nation's resources, but I never hear criticism from those boardrooms of the many millions of pounds given to industrialists to create jobs; yet within 12 months those factories, built and equipped at the expense of Irish taxpayers, were closed and the equipment shipped overseas.  I have not heard any criticism of the volume of State aid for hotel development which was to benefit our tourist industry.  We all know that within a short period of major renovations being carried out with State grants, those hotels were sold and their further use as tourist assets lost.  I realise that in any system of grant aid there will be abuse, but what I want to say is that the criticism about the magnitude of social welfare abuse is not justified. There is hardship and poverty experienced by social welfare recipients and they would much prefer if we could offer them employment rather than social welfare.</P>
    <P>Many hardships are caused by the delay in social welfare payments &mdash; unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefits and maternity benefits.  This problem is not of recent origin.  It has existed over a very protracted period.  We were advised that with the introduction of the new system there would be no further delays.  Every Deputy knows these delays are still happening and I urge the Minister to leave no stone unturned to ensure that where benefits are due there should be no <Col N="618" /> unreasonable delay in making those payments.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions I mentioned the anomalies in the social welfare legislation. Let us take an old age pensioner, living with his wife, who enjoys free electricity, free travel and a free TV licence. When the husband dies the widow has her income reduced by half and her entitlement to free travel, free electricity and a free TV licence withdrawn.  Taking all the circumstances into account, the forced reduction of her income and the fact that she will not be capable of earning any sort of income in her remaining years, the Minister for Social Welfare should look benevolently into such cases to try to relieve the new pressures on such widows.</P>
    <P>Another important omission from our social welfare services is the introduction of an income-related pension scheme, despite all the work that has been done on its preparation.  So far, this has come to nothing and I urge the appropriate Minister to draw up a scheme as soon as possible.  At the age of 66 people leave employment in which they earned anything between £100 and £200 a week.  At that age their incomes drop to flat amounts, as little as half of what they had been earning.</P>
    <P>In the context of the current high unemployment rate, we must all accept the challenge which Deputy Brennan, before me, posed.  It is an immense task. The Youth Employment Agency was a step in the right direction because at least it provided a pool of finance to be spread around on various projects.  The employment opportunities legislation provided immense scope to local authorities in particular, if only they had the finance. Therefore, there should be the closest possible co-operation between the State agencies&mdash;the Youth Employment Agency and the Manpower Service&mdash; and the local authorities to ensure that some valuable work will be done to relieve unemployment among our young people.  Such co-operation would serve to reduce substantially the drain on the Exchequer of having people on the dole. As well, by way of taxation, it would <Col N="619" /> benefit the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan dealt with the colossal cost of the health services.  On a previous occasion here, and many times in the Seanad, I asked the responsible Minister, having had 12 years experience of the operations of the regional health boards, to try to provide a national health service which would not be so top heavy at the administrative end.  We should concentrate on the provision of hospital medical staff, doctors, nurses, ambulance and ancillary staff, and try to cut down on the superabundance of administrative staff.</P>
    <P>The 1970 Health Act provided for the establishment of eight regional boards with very expensive administrative centres.  I suggest that is over-generous for a nation of our size.  We should concentrate more, after 12 years experience, on relating our expenditure directly to the benefit of people who need the health services.  Therefore, we should take a hard look at the possibility of restructuring the national health services and the eight regional boards.  The hospital service is a vital need and we should concentrate on improving it.</P>
    <P>In County Kerry we completed a new hospital complex but we are in the invidious position that we cannot have the hospital opened, because of lack of finance, until 1984, and people who have been waiting so long for it have given up hope.  I am asking the Minister for Health to solve any financial problems and have that hospital opened.</P>
    <P>We need to give more attention to the mentally handicapped whose problem has been neglected by the State.  Apart from the great help of voluntary organisations, we cannot be very proud as a nation in this respect.  There should be far more generous Exchequer provision for services for the mentally handicapped.  I include our psychiatric services.  Until recently we had colossal institutions but they were used for custody rather than treatment.  In the past few years excellent improvement work has been done but more needs to be accomplished.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health should make every effort to improve treatment for kidney patients by bringing dialysis <Col N="620" /> machines within reasonable distance of sufferers.  We have a number of patients in Kerry who have to travel from remote areas over bad roads three times a week to receive treatment in Cork and return home each evening.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister for Health to install one of these dialysis machines in the new central hospital in Tralee.  If that is not done kidney patients in Kerry will lose confidence that they can get treatment nearer home within their lifetime.</P>
    <P>The innovation in 1979 of issuing medical cards on an annual basis has involved an immense amount of administrative work.  I suggest that such cards operate for a period of three years.  This would eliminate a tremendous amount of work for the administrative staffs in hospitals and would be more economical.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment have responsibility for housing, water supplies, sewerage schemes and road works but the local authorities have major problems also in these sectors. When derating was started in 1978 promises were given that there would not be a diminution in the level of services provided by the local authorities but it is now realised that we are coming to a crisis point.  There has been a substantial loss of employment in the local authorities and road development work has not been carried out.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, all Ministers do their utmost within the constraints upon them to keep local authority housing schemes up to reasonable level.  One of the major problems of a housing authority is the securing of adequate land at a reasonable price so that the impact of the purchase price will not fall too heavily on the tenants.  The Minister should recommend to housing authorities that they build up a large bank of land which could be used not only for their own housing needs but also as sites for people who might wish to build their own houses.  If people were offered serviced sites many of them would prefer to build their own houses rather than depend on the local authority.  The current cost of local authority house is in the region of £17,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> In addition to the provision of sites the Department should look favourably on the expansion of the subsidy scheme for site development in respect of local housing. At the moment to qualify for that subsidy the density of housing must be not less than ten houses to the acre.  In view of the developments in housing since that was originally decided, I suggest that where there are eight or more houses per acre the Department should look favourably on the provision of a subsidy.  This would encourage people to take their names off the housing list and the subsidy would be an incentive to them to purchase a site.</P>
    <P>The recent schemes for house improvement grants have laid down that approval must be obtained for the grant before the commencement of work.  In many instances when people had completed their forms and sent them to the Department they thought they qualified for a grant.  I suggest that a proportion of the grant, perhaps 50 per cent, be paid to people who had started work before the inspector visited the site.  Many people added an additional bedroom or a bathroom to their premises but unfortunately as they had commenced work before the inspector's visit they did not get a grant. I ask the Minister of State who is present in the House to review the situation with a view to making a contribution to such people.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have responsibility for school building and reconstruction work.  I accept that there has been a considerable investment in that programme but the number of condemned schools and those in need of major repairs is appalling.  In my area one school has been condemned for more than 30 years and only now is work proceeding on the purchase of a site.  This is a demoralising situation for teachers and students.  It should be a priority to eliminate as soon as possible buildings that have been condemned because of their insanitary condition, overcrowding or because of structural defects.  Such buildings are a hazard for students and teachers and they give a very bad image to the public generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> The Office of Public Works have responsibility also for drainage work. Many rivers throughout the country have been scheduled for such work.  Flooding has caused enormous damage to houses and land and it has endangered life. There is no hope that some of the rivers can be dealt with in the next 30 years and people in the areas concerned are becoming restless and are forming action groups in order to deal with the matter.  I am suggesting to the Minister responsible that the Government should re-introduce legislation to enable local authorities to undertake interim drainage schemes in order to feed the rivers into the main catchment areas.  By doing that they would be making a major contribution to agricultural development and to the safety and security of householders through the elimination of flooding.  This is of paramount importance and I hope that in this Dáil session the suggestions I have made will be acted on.  There are difficult times ahead and the most useful basis on which we can survive is by the development of our national resources, agriculture, tourism and so on.  In regard to agriculture, I hope that the colossal import of goods that could be produced at home will occupy the immediate attention of the responsible bodies with a view to ensuring that not only will our economy develop but that our balance of payments, a vital matter, will benefit accordingly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for his good wishes and I am privileged to be making my maiden speech on the Finance Bill, a most important piece of legislation.  The most important business dealt with in the House is the budget because it seeks to stimulate and consolidate the economy.  The Finance Bill gives effect to the provisions of the budget.  I am worried about what the Finance Bill holds for my constituency, Roscommon, and the country.  It is my belief that the three men closest to the Taoiseach, the Ministers for Finance, <Col N="623" /> Agriculture and Industry and Energy, are being influenced by him.  That worries me and many other people who have a stake in our economy.</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with the economic policy being pursued by the Government.  We have heard a lot about social policies but if we do not have good economic policies we cannot get the money to finance good social policies. Nobody denies that the Coalition Government while in office for seven months alerted our people about the depth of the recession and the debt we had been plunged into by the previous administration. The Coalition Government presented their case so well that in the general election the people showed that they were willing to accept the reality of the situation as outlined by them.  Our people were prepared to accept the tough economic policies of the Coalition but in spite of that, in spite of the general acceptance of those difficulties and the understanding of the financial requirements needed to continue to support overseas investment the Government have failed to take any positive action. They continued to postpone for a considerable time positive action to deal with the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1981 general election we heard many promises and there were more promises before the general election of 1982 from the Taoiseach.  He promised many stop-gap patching up operations. Wherever problems were clearly identified by Fianna Fáil the Taoiseach made promises.  Deputy Haughey during the campaign promised favours in different areas.  For example, in one area the Taoiseach promised a general hospital and in another area an airport but he did not recognise the disastrous financial situation of the country.  Fianna Fáil are back in office on the strength of those gimmicks and mortgaging millions for the future.  That is being done to obtain a few votes here and there and not least to please an Independent Member from a Dublin constituency.  We are all aware of how freely that money was handed out particularly in relation to the Talbot workers and the workers at Clondalkin <Col N="624" /> Mills.  I wonder what the final bill will be for that at the end of 1982.  I am not prepared to accept the accounts presented because they seem to change daily and depend on the type of case presented by pressure groups.  As the pressure groups take to the streets one finds that money is made available for this and that but aspects of important investment are neglected.  That was the policy prior to 1981.  Irrespective of who cried &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; the Government stepped in and paid the bill with borrowed money.</P>
    <P>It is pointless to hope that the realities of the situation here will be ignored by foreign banks.  They will not be ignored simply because we are Irish or because Fianna Fáil are in office.  When it comes to advancing loans the nationality of the borrower does not matter.  We must pay the going rate of interest for the money we borrow or if not we will not be given it.  I deplore the policy of the Government to borrow money for current expenditure. That was Fianna Fáil policy from 1977-81 and we are all aware of the financial mess they left us in.  The Bill proposes to introduce a system of collecting VAT at the source of entry and the Minister for Finance told us he would make provision through the ICC for those who must borrow money to pay this VAT.  He did not tell us that that money would cost those firms 22 per cent.  That is the harsh reality of borrowing money and that will eventually close many of our major industries.  What we are doing is collecting next year's tax this year.</P>
    <P>Our ability to service and repay debts depends on our ability to negotiate fresh productive lending for the country.  In the course of a speech to an economic club in New York some months ago the Taoiseach suggested that the efforts of the Coalition to bring public finances under control had damaged our image abroad. However, in a recent survey it was found that approximately a quarter of the overseas firms who have invested here would go elsewhere if they were investing today. That disenchantment springs from problems which result from decisions taken since 1977, many internal.</P>
    <P>I have the height of praise for the IDA and the county development teams.  We <Col N="625" /> all admit that great economic strides have been made here trying to develop industries in our cities and throughout Ireland. The present economic policies being pursued are seriously damaging that success. We talk about attracting new industries but we must create an environment in which those industries can produce and export abroad.  We must create the infrastructure. For example, in the west very often an industrialist who moves there finds there is no telephone, very poor roads and, if his gateway to the west is through Athlone he is faced with trying to get through a town which is choking to death.</P>
    <P>These are areas in which the Government could usefully spend money on building new roads and opening up depressed parts of the country, in which industrialists find it hard to set up businesses which will give major long-term benefits to the area.  We need low interest rates, low inflation rates and good labour relations to stabilise those industries.  We must have easy communications and facilitate our industrialists to communicate with the Continent or wherever they are selling their products.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the question of competitiveness. At present, many industries are not competitive, even on the home market.  It was mentioned during the debate that at the present rates for borrowing it is not practical for industrialists to borrow on a large scale.  I am not against borrowing if it is for productive purposes but I regret the trend that has developed here for borrowing for current expenditure.  The handouts over the last three years were paid out of borrowed money, taxpayers' money given out for cheap political gain.  Every member state of the EEC has its own problems and concessions gained by the Irish Government are very small.  That does not affect the other member states and they are satisfied as long as benefits flow in their direction.  Our Government should be much tougher in negotiating a fair deal for this country.  In the past I do not believe that those negotiations were handled as effectively as they should have been and the unwarranted delay in introducing the increases for agricultural produce <Col N="626" /> which was granted recently cost this country vast sums of money and came at a time when farmers are producing the maximum amount of milk.</P>
    <P>The Government should pursue more vigorously the schemes that are at present in operation.  The provisions of the present Bill are totally inadequate to stimulate growth in the economy and to encourage foreign or home investment. While we have interest rates of 22 per cent, we cannot expect investments from the home market or from abroad.  There has been a great deal of criticism about the budget introduced by the Coalition in January which resulted in a general election. However, the provisions of the budget were necessary and people do not deny it.  This was borne out at the Dublin by-election.  During that election I had my first chance to meet Dublin people in the doorstep, the very poor, middle class and the very well off.  Over those three weeks, I learned just how those people are thinking.  If they can see light at the end of the tunnel they are prepared to put up with the harsh measures and to support the Government of the day. Unfortunately, the people are not getting that leadership at present.  It has been widely stated that the Government are causing confusion and uncertainty by changing their minds from one week to the next and even, at times from day to day.</P>
    <P>There are serious changes in the Bill which were proposed in the budget.  Our economy will not improve until the inflation rate is reduced.  Let us look at our nearest neighbour, Great Britain, who is one of our partners in the EEC.  Her interest rates are about 12 per cent while ours are over 20 per cent.  Her inflation rate is substantially lower that ours.  How can we compete for new industry?  If an industrialist has a choice between establishing an industry in Great Britain or here, he will opt to set up an industry in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I object to the payment of VAT at the point of entry.  I accept that there is a great deal of tax evasion and that it is the function of the Department of Finance to tighten up in that area.  But to have to pay VAT at the point of entry is damaging <Col N="627" /> industry.  It is increasing the price of raw materials, machinery which we need for agricultural production and all the other equipment that is necessary for industry and for agriculture.  It puts a major strain on the cash flow of firms importing essential materials.  Irrespective of whether the people concerned have to borrow from the ICI they will still have to pay exorbitant interest rates of 22 per cent on this money that they now have to turn over to the Government because of the principle of collecting next year's tax this year.  There is no doubt that the cash flow of those industries is going to be severely damaged by this decision.  Even in the last few days we have seen industries closing down.  We are still not at the end of this slide.  The Government have imposed this measure to collect £140 million but I believe that, at the end of the year, they will not have collected this amount because the recession will not allow them to collect this kind of money.  We will have more redundancies, and the unemployment figures will rise.  I sincerely hope I am wrong but I am afraid that is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about the question of subcontractors' certificates.  This first came to my notice two years ago when I made representations to the Minister about the problem.  The system of subcontractors' certificates was originally intended to counter tax evaders and to counter fly-by-night boys.  However, the regulations and the manner in which they are applied are so severe that they are financially damaging to the economy because, in many cases, contractors who should have certificates are not able to get them.  If they cannot get them they must pay 35 per cent of what they earn there and then in tax and may have to wait up to two or three months to get this money back from the Revenue Commissioners. This is grossly unfair.  If small contractors, young fellows who set up a small business and are prepared to employ two or three people, are faced with this situation, this barrier against equal opportunity to earn a living, it is very unfair and I respectfully ask the <Col N="628" /> Minister to examine the matter carefully and see what can be done to eliminate the hardship caused to these young people.</P>
    <P>At present we have a frightening figure of national debt and repayments.  The interest on the national debt in 1976 amounted to £268 million.  In 1977 it was £399 million.  Capital repayments at that time amounted to £315 million.  Interest paid outside the State was £99 million.  I understand that the figures expected this year are: interest payable on national debt, £1,300 million; capital repayments of national debt, £1,160 million.  The interest paid outside the State is a tremendous burden on the economy.  With these vast payments it is little wonder that the economy is not able to generate sufficient wealth to invest in worthwhile employment projects or able to create the employment young people so badly need.  Another 100,000 students are coming on the labour market this year and there is no employment for them.  It is a frightening situation where we have this escalation of unemployment.  Many young people now on the unemployment list will never have the opportunity of working or knowing what it is to do a satisfactory day's work and draw a day's pay.  This is morally and legally wrong.</P>
    <P>Many at the other end of the scale have become redundant through no fault of their own, men of 45 or 50.  I doubt if they will ever have an opportunity of working again simply because far too much money has been spent on the past four or five years on domestic expenditure, on day-to-day expenses and not sufficient has been put into worthwhile job creation programmes.  I regret that this has happened.  The Government have a moral obligation to provide job opportunities for young people.  It is hard to understand why the Government will not invest in projects with major employment potential.  I am speaking particularly of projects in which we can utilise our national resources.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the building of a briquette factory in the Ballyforan area which the Government now appear to have shelved.  It is hard to understand the economics of this decision when we are <Col N="629" /> importing briquettes from abroad.  We have the raw material, the manpower and everything necessary to make the same commodity here, but it seems that the Government cannot finance the project. I regret this because the employment potential there directly is 600 jobs.  I appeal to the Minister to see that this project is started immediately.</P>
    <P>In agriculture the Government have failed miserably to provide money necessary to stimulate output and create jobs in the agri-sector.  More than half our total workforce are employed directly or indirectly in agriculture.  A thriving agriculture means a thriving economy.  If agriculture prospers every other sector of the community shares that prosperity. Progress in agriculture and increased exports mean we can pay for badly-needed imports for industry and thus create jobs and give everybody a chance to earn a living in his own country.  In the past four years agricultural production has dropped and farm income has fallen disproportionately.  Regretfully, I say that the present Government in the last four years when they were in office took no positive steps to prevent the fall in farmers' income and are not now doing so.  Farmers no longer have confidence to invest in the economy, to buy a new machine, to reclaim or drain land.  They have neither the confidence nor the money to buy an additional holding becoming vacant near them if it goes up for sale.  Young boys and girls who up to three or four years ago were taking a course in agriculture, coming back and settling down to work on the family farm, are now on the labour market seeking industrial jobs.  The income from the farm cannot maintain two families.  That is the situation that has developed.</P>
    <P>The Government should realise that the cost of creating an industrial job is £15,000.  It makes good economic sense to try to retain on the land and employed in agriculture as many young people as possible and to try to ensure that the income from agriculture is sufficient to maintain two families.  Very often we find on a farm where a father and son are working that when the son marries he must look for an industrial job because <Col N="630" /> the farm income is no longer sufficient for two families.</P>
    <P>In regard to the disease eradication programme, I should like the Minister to examine the position fully and to increase substantially compensation paid to farmers with reactor cattle.  Many farmers when they sell their cows or yearlings to the factory find tht the price from the factory plus the departmental subsidy is only 50 per cent of the animal's real value.  No other section of the community would tolerate this situation.  Many farmers in my county face financial ruin because of a major outbreak of disease in the area.  The compensation for reactors is ludicrous with no relation to the value of the animals.  The hardship fund is totally unrealistic and is not workable. I appeal to the Minister to have that fund restructured so that it will be meaningful and can be operated so as to help the people it was intended to help and I ask him to increase the compensation payable.</P>
    <P>I come to a point that costs no money but one about which I feel strongly.  In terms of the economy it is very important. Where a farmer is unfortunate enough to have his stock locked up with one beast that reacts &mdash; he may have 20, 30 or 40 cattle to sell &mdash; these animals are frozen on the farm and he can do nothing with them.  They may not be suitable for a factory and the farmer may not be able to afford to take grass or to keep the cattle on his farm.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the Department of Agriculture would allow these farmers to have those cattle exported, cattle which are disease free but which are from a locked-up herd.  I urge that such cattle be exported to Third World countries in which not as much emphasis is placed on disease eradication as is the case here and in the rest of Europe.  This would alleviate much of the hardship farmers are experiencing in the context of the disease eradication programme.  It was the situation that was in operation up to April 1980, but for some mysterious reason it was discontinued at that time.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government also to take the necessary steps to stimulate agricultural production and incomes at <Col N="631" /> this time of a crisis situation.  Agricultural incomes have fallen from 52 per cent of the industrial wage in 1977 to 22 per cent today.  How can we expect farmers to exist on the sort of incomes they are deriving from agriculture?  There is an obligation on the Government to ensure that this section of the community are protected just as all other sections are protected and that farmers be given the opportunity of earning decent livelihoods for themselves and their families.  This makes good economic sense too because it may prevent members of farming families from seeking industrial employment, from taking up industrial jobs that are needed by others.  Production in the dairy and beef industries, too, must be encouraged.</P>
    <P>One of the omissions in the budget that astonished me was in the area of the taxation of short-term social welfare benefits. It was a retrograde step on the part of the Government not to include in the budget the proposal in this regard that was contained in the January budget. Such a measure is badly needed in order to deal with abuses of the social welfare system.  I refer to situations in which people stay away from work on the pretext of being ill and proceed to draw sick benefit when their aim is to keep down the amounts on their P60's so that they may qualify for other benefits.  Short-term social welfare benefits are not included as part of their income for taxation purposes.  It is wrong that someone who works for only nine months in the year ends up at the end of the year with the same amount of money as the man who has worked in a similar capacity for 12 months.  Morally and legally that must be wrong.</P>
    <P>Regarding borrowings in agriculture, I appeal to the Government to do everything possible to alleviate the problem presented to farmers in this regard.  In 1977 and 1978 the experts in agriculture &mdash; technical economic and financial &mdash; advocated increased investment in agriculture. The financial institutions vied with one another in soliciting for the provision of loans to farmers.  There was a situation that was tantamount to loans <Col N="632" /> being forced on farmers.  Since then rapid inflation, input cost increases and exorbitant interest rates, none of which was envisaged at the time no more than the effects of EMS were envisaged, meant that many of those farmers who borrowed money in 1977 and 1978 found that they were no longer able to meet their repayments and they are now in serious financial difficulty.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition were in office they took certain measures to alleviate that problem.  These measures were widely welcomed.  They should be continued by the Government.  The situation should be monitored regularly to ensure that none of those farmers is forced to sell land or even to leave his home as a result of the mishandling of the Irish economy in the past four years.  Inflation was one problem that we should have controlled ourselves. Many other factors that have affected farmers' incomes related to domestic problems also and, consequently, could have been dealt with at home.</P>
    <P>In the January budget there was a proposal to provide moneys to begin work on a survey of the Rivers Shannon and Suck.  The Minister should ensure that this task is commenced in this financial year.  More than 500,000 acres of land in the midlands are flooded by the Shannon and the Suck.  The Minister should examine the possibility of having local authorities deemed to be drainage authorities within the terms of the EEC western drainage scheme.  This would be a major asset in so far as that scheme is concerned. Many local authorities have the machinery but because of lack of sufficient finance for roadworks they are unable to keep that machinery in operation. But if they were recognised by the EEC as drainage authorities for the purpose of carrying out major drainage works there would be a double advantage for the economy, because on the one hand they would be undertaking valuable drainage work while at the same time utilising the machines that are lying idle.</P>
    <P>In the years 1970 to 1980, 62,000 farmers left the land and if there is not an improvement in agricultural incomes as many more will leave in the next two to <Col N="633" /> three years.  While speaking in the Seanad in January 1 requested that there be provision in the budget for those people who were practically robbed by the Tuohy affair.  Some of those people had all of their earnings, the fruits of all their life's work, swept away overnight. Many of them supplied cattle to the firms concerned but found that all they got in return were useless pieces of paper.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that funds are made available.  Interest free loans should be made available until such time as we know what percentage refund they will get.  At the moment many farmers are facing financial ruin. They cannot meet interest rates.  Many of them have to borrow in order to live. Some have been left without any stock. Some have not been able to replace stock.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the possibility of making interest free loans available to these people.</P>
    <P>I come now to the plight of our county councils and their inability financially to provide essential infrastructural developments such as roads, water, sewerage and housing.  Local authorities play a very important role in our economy.  Unfortunately the existing deterioration in their financial situation is having serious repercussions on local communities.  The rot set in in 1979 following the Fianna Fáil decision to restrict county councils to a 10 per cent increase in rates at a time when local authorities were faced with increases ranging from 35 to 70 per cent in statutory demands, such as wages, demands from health boards, demands for supplementary welfare, statutory obligations such as those in relation to the Board of Works and so on.</P>
    <P>The position now is that the majority of our councils are on the verge of bankrupcy. The number of houses being built has decreased.  There is a patent deterioration in our roads and a decline in the installation of water and sewerage schemes.  There is no money for county roads.  As I said on an earlier occasion, it appears to be the policy of the Government to allow our roads to disintegrate into nature trails.  In the long run it will cost the economy far more to repair our roads than it would if money were provided <Col N="634" /> now to maintain them.  It is bad economic policy not to provide sufficient money for maintenance.  Our county manager recently reported to the council that he would require £1.5 million of an overdraft.  Four years ago the council were in a credit situation.  The banks will no longer advance money on current account overdraft.  It must be a loan with a rate of interest of 20 to 25 per cent.  This is an indication of how the change in the rating system in 1977 has affected local authorities.  The placing of a ceiling on local authorities in 1979 has had an appalling effect.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of health services, I would ask the Minister to ensure that money is made available to the Western Health Board to provide for the back-up staff for consultants in Roscommon County Hospital.  One will take up duty on 1 July.  A second has cancelled the arrangement to come to Roscommon. There was a clear commitment given by the Taoiseach that he would ensure money was made available for the necessary back-up staff.  Unfortunately it has not been made available.  I would ask the Minister to take this up immediately with his colleague, the Minister for Health, and ensure that the necessary funds are made available for the necessary staff in that hospital.</P>
    <P>On returning to office the Government put local authorities generally in further financial difficulty by ensuring that one particular part of the country gets a very large share of the money available to local authorities.  I refer to the Gregory deal.  I do not object to money being spent in Dublin.  We are all proud of our capital city but it is most unfair that a vast amount of money should be chanelled into one particular area to the detriment of other areas.  It has resulted in counties like my own not having the finances necessary to build houses for our people. This is a most unsatisfactory situation and will have a detrimental effect in the long-term on our housing programme. Before the House is Deputy Bruton's amendment to the Finance Bill.  In that amendment he points out that the better off will get benefits while the less well off will be mulcted.  I support Deputy Bruton's <Col N="635" /> amendment.  It is our object to persuade the Minister to change his mind on certain provisions in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important section in our community is the farming section.  Yet this is the section which has had to accept a 75 per cent drop in income between 1978 and 1981.  This is the section which provides genuine long-term employment because it is their products that are processed in the meat factories, in the creameries and so on.  Fianna Fáil are about to produce a four-year development plan for aid to agriculture.  I am very happy that this plan is on the way but I would appeal to the Minister to make it a ten-year programme.  A farmer cannot do very much in four years.  It has been Fianna Fáil policy down through the years to expand agriculture.  That is their policy today.  Because of the magnitude of the problems facing agriculture there is urgent need to restore viability by overcoming the many problems facing the industry.  Fianna Fáil believe it is necessary to bring forward a co-ordinated investment plan for the industry as a whole agreed on by the Government and major farming organisations and State agencies.  Fianna Fáil have always stood steadfast in support of the farm family and expanding agricultural output in the interest of national economic growth. Fianna Fáil will take positive steps to restore farm incomes, increase output and bring hope to that sector.  The main thrust of Fianna Fáil policy will be reducing inflation, the four-year plan which I appeal to the Minister to increase to a ten year plan, pressing for more EEC measures to relieve the problems in farming, and national aid measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not so long ago the farm modernisation grants were 30 per cent and they were reduced last September by the previous Government to 25 per cent.  Fianna Fáil have restored them to 30 per cent. The 30 per cent grant is based on the standard of costs drawn up in 1978 and as a result is completely out of date today compared with building costs.  The 30 per cent grant today is equivalent to 20 per <Col N="636" /> cent in contractors' costs.  It is important that these standard costs be updated in the light of present costs.  I appeal to the Minister to do what he can in that area.</P>
    <P>Another change that occured last September was that grants for concrete yards were eliminated unless the applicant was putting up a new building.  This is unfair to farmers with existing buildings because they will not be entitled to any grants for concrete yards around such buildings. When we are encouraging farmers to increase stock production it is important that the animals be fed quality winter feed.  About 45 per cent of our farmers are making 70 per cent of their winter feed in the form of silage and it is important that other farmers be encouraged to make silage to increase their milk yield. Much higher grants should be given to small farmers to enable them to put up a silage base.  The £3 per ton silage grant was a good help to small farmers making up to 50 tons of silage but real benefit from this is not obtained unless the proper facilities are there for making the silage.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I appeal to the Minister to bring up the standard costs in line with present grants, that grants for concrete yards be restored and to allow a grant for silage bases for small farmers.</P>
    <P>Another area of farming which has come into deep trouble in recent years is the agricultural contractor who is part and parcel of the whole scene of progressive farming.  Such people have come under real pressure recently.  They have provided an excellent service for farmers, but the inflationary trend has affected them seriously in the areas of machinery costs, oil, interest rates etc.  One of the biggest problems facing the agricultural contractor is that he has not the security to borrow money at competitive rates and, therefore, is forced to borrow from hire purchase companies at prohibitive rates. A detailed examination of contractors' problems should be undertaken by the Government and the Department of Agriculture to help to identify the problems of these contractors.  I appeal to the Minister to do what he can in that regard because many farmers even at this time &mdash; I have met some of them &mdash; could not <Col N="637" /> cut their silage in time because contractors had gone out of business.  In other words, those farmers will have a lower quality feed.  Many contractors are forced out of business by cost and this has created a problem because therefore farmers must purchase their own machinery and equipment.  This is not a welcome development because farmers are putting their money into machinery when they should be putting it into stock.  Farmers should not be compelled to invest in machinery because contractors are forced out of business.  Help in this area will be beneficial not only to contractors but also to farmers.</P>
    <P>The proposed interest subsidy is to be welcomed, but it is no help towards getting people involved in systems of farming. It is difficult to justify a calf-beef system of cattle production at present high interest rates.  At present costs it would cost £400 to bring an animal from birth to two years of age, including the cost of the calf.  Interest on this would amount to approximately £80.  It is of the utmost importance to have an interest subsidy for stock production in order to get people involved again in systems of cattle production and give confidence to the farmers.  The interest subsidy already in operation is based on capital investments such as buildings and machinery. It is important that the interest subsidy be based on livestock production.  Many co-operatives have introduced interest subsidies and they subsidise interest down to 10 per cent in order to enable farmers to increase their herd size.  This initiative by the co-operatives would be welcomed in the cattle production sector of farming whether it be through a Government agency or the cattle industry itself.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister also to do what he can to increase compensation to farmers for brucellosis and TB reactors which is completely out of date and many farmers are experiencing serious hardship in freeing their herds from those diseases.</P>
    <P>Farmers are aware of the high cost and the problems of out-wintering without sufficient winter feed.  This can be provided only by use of additional fertiliser and if that is not available at a fair and <Col N="638" /> reasonable price to farmers, then all the plans and programmes for the increase of farm output will come to nothing and will be a waste of time and money.  The present high cost of fertilisers is a great stumbling-block in that it inhibits greater output from our cattle and dairy herds. This is true particularly in areas of low quality land which by nature demands a high input of fertiliser.  In the light of the necessity of a higher through-put of milk for our processing factories and the new beef and cattle deal negotiated by the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, farmers must be given the opportunity to produce these products. I appeal to the Minister that, if at all possible, some scheme be implemented whereby our fertilisers will be subsidised to increase production and thereby create employment not alone in the farming areas but throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We have proved that investment in agriculture has been falling for a number of years.  Results show that few farmers now earn more than £10,000 a year.  This figure does not represent the farmer's income but is the return for all the family working on the farm for long hours under very difficult weather conditions.  Were it not for the help of their families many of our farmers would have been bankrupt years ago.  They are entitled to a just reward for their hard work.  They cannot say at 6 o'clock in the evening that they are finished until 8 o'clock in the morning. They have to work through the night at harvest time, harvesting beet and wheat, and they cannot look at the clock. They should get a just reward.  They proved their worth during the war years in saving the people from unemployment and starvation and they are the only section of the community who can pull this country out of the trouble it is in today.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were always behind the small farmer, as they have proved down through the years.  Every £1 million that our Government will invest will be returned a hundredfold with increased income for the farmers and thousands of new jobs with resulting spin-off employment. Despite their small income, the farmers are supposed to invest for the future, but borrowing at 20 per cent is <Col N="639" /> out of the question.  What will it take to convince our people that a healthy, thriving agricultural industry is of benefit not alone to the farmers but to everyone in the country?  Prosperous agriculture will provide extra jobs at farm level and many more in processing.  People will be kept on the land and in the rural areas.  Instead people are moving to towns where employment does not exist.  We have many problems in the bigger cities and I hope that planning for the future will provide more industry in small rural towns and avoid the problems of overcrowding and law breaking of every description which occur in the cities. Rural Ireland was allowed to die slowly because too many industries were established in the cities.  That trend must be reversed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the encouragement given to parents to hand over farm property to members of their family, but I am not happy with the condition regarding university qualifications.  Most young people who have stayed at home on the land have not had the opportunity of going to a university and I hope the Minister will be liberal in this respect and that there will not be discrimination against these people.  They may spend 20 or 25 of their best years working on a farm and they should not be penalised.</P>
    <P>During the past few years many different types of penal taxes have been imposed on people who are the salt of this country, those who work long hours without looking at the clock and who produce genuine exports.  They are being penalised by slick taxes devised by the brains in the Revenue Commissioners. The life of the farming industry is being squeezed out.  Fifty per cent of the finest land in Europe is being badly managed because of our stupid system of taxing people because they own a bit of property. The land is not transferred and the young people cannot get hold of it and qualify for grants.  I know it is the Minister's intention to encourage people to transfer land, but he must spell things out more clearly in order to remove fears.  I appeal to the Minister to do as much as possible for the farming community and <Col N="640" /> they will produce the goods.  What other section would accept a drop of 75 per cent in their income while continuing to work hard?</P>
    <P>I hope that the report of the Commission on Taxation will lead to the introduction of a fairer system of taxation for every section of society.  The present system is outdated and unfair and I am confident that the Taoiseach and the Government will take the necessary steps to relieve the hardship which exists under this system.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to be as liberal as possible with people who are trying to improve their houses by extending them or adding on a bathroom and toilet.  It is a shame that some people have been refused grants because the work was started before their houses were inspected by the Department. People who find themselves in this position should be enabled to receive these grants.  The Minister for the Environment should also do something for people living in NBA houses which were built without chimneys.  The costs of heating by electricity are extremely heavy. These people are also being asked to pay unfair amounts of money in order to purchase their houses.  We have NBA houses in Tipperary town, Cahir and Killenaule. The Minister should provide the local authorities with grants to enable fire places and back boilers to be installed and to reduce the purchase prices of these houses.</P>
    <P>We have the youngest population in Europe and they are as fine a generation as this country has ever produced.  With goodwill and commonsense we can be as good as Germany or any other EEC country.  We must give hope to young people, whether they are in industry or in farming.  There has been too much preaching of doom and gloom and we must have faith in ourselves and in our country.  People talk about the tough times today but our fathers went through tough times during the war.  We must believe in ourselves.</P>

      <P>The Chair would like to congratulate Deputy Seán Bryne and Deputy Liam Naughten on <Col N="641" /> two impressive maiden speeches.  The Chair must now call on the Member nominated by The Workers' Party.  Deputy Gallagher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> The Workers' Party in Dáil Eireann see as their task the provision of representation for a forgotten sector of Irish society, the working class and the economically weak and giving voice to the battered people, the tenants of our rundown local authority schemes, the young, the unemployed, the insecure, the old.  We have three seats and are part of a balance of power situation which has afforded us the opportunity of maximising the interests of the people we seek to represent.  We make no apologies for seeking to use this position to try to shift economic strategy towards a restructuring of the economy. We will make no apologies for finding ourselves in a position, thrust between the competing rivalries of the two civil war parties, where we must use this rivalry to obtain benefits in the interests of the vast majority of ordinary working people.</P>
      <P>In following this course we see the opportunity that exists to help make an historic break in the mould of Irish politics by restoring sovereignty to the Dáil and by making Parliament more relevant in the formulation of legislation.  It is in this spirit that we approach the debate on the Finance Bill.  We aim to use this debate, and the Committee Stage which will follow, as a means of trying to amend the 1982 budget.  Such parliamentary involvement, let me add, is more the norm than the exception in developed democratic countries.  By refusing to rubber stamp the Finance Bill we aim to move Ireland in the direction of this democratic mainstream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we know that this motivation is not shared by other parties in this House &mdash; by Fine Gael in particular, who view this debate and the forthcoming Committee Stage quite cynically as an attempt to force another election for their own narrow party interests.  We are about to be treated to an intriguing spectacle in which Fine Gael will pursue a strategy of <Col N="642" /> tabling ingeniously worked out amendments, designed specifically to put The Workers' Party and other left wing Deputies on the spot so as to force a general election.  We shall shortly be able to gain a further insight into their desperation and indeed into the depth of their cynicism when we see the precise nature of their amendments.  Will they go so far as disowning measures which they themselves brought in in the January budget, as they did during the Dublin West by-election campaign?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, to judge by the contribution of Deputy Bruton to this debate last week, are already working themselves up into a new found frenzy of concern for the poor and the lower paid.  Deputy Bruton argued last week that the budget needed to be amended in favour of the lower paid because the Fianna Fáil budget had already eliminated some of the equity features in the original Coalition budget.  This had been necessitated by the inclusion of some savage anti-working class features in Deputy Bruton's budget, such as the proposal to tax pay-related benefits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> I was making reference in relation to the frenzied concern by Fine Gael for the poor and lower paid.  There were features contained in the Coalition budget, which were necessitated by the inclusion of some savage anti-working class measures in Deputy Bruton's budget, such as the proposal to tax pay-related benefits of recently unemployed workers, to raise the price of milk and butter savagely and to put an 18 per cent tax on clothing and footwear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the falseness of their present stance.  What they really are looking for is a general election that will return them to power so as to enable them to bring in <Col N="644" /> immediately a pure and uncontaminated Fine Gael budget in 1982.  It is our judgment, supported by our Ard Comhairle, that this is not an attractive prospect for the working class and the economically weak in the country.  We have good reason to fear a Fine Gael budget now. Their recent record in this area gives us no grounds for confidence that they would not revert to the tough monetarist policies contained in Deputy Bruton's January budget.  Their new found concern for the less well-off can certainly give no grounds for encouragement, especially since they are mesmerised by the hope of a return to Government.</P>
    <P>Last July Fine Gael, supported by the Labour Party and indeed by ourselves, were given their first chance.  The July 1981 budget was an emergency measure to reduce an unsustainable budget deficit. We did not oppose the budgetary measures then implemented, which almost entirely consisted of increases in indirect taxation, a form of tax to which we are opposed in principle, because Deputy Bruton was able to argue that the time was not available to bring in the capital taxation and self-employed profit taxes that we, as a party, favour.</P>
    <P>The Coalition had their opportunity in the subsequent six months to get the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners working on proposals which would have ensured that the burden of paying for the economic crisis would be fairly shared and not again by working class shoulders.  To help that Government along, we submitted a 27-page document setting out in great detail the realisable taxation changes that could be incorporated in the 1982 budget.  They were totally ignored in the January budget.  I recall Deputy Bruton's comments last week when he said that he had no patience with Finance Ministers who plead administrative difficulties and that &ldquo;any difficulties can be overcome if there is a will to do so&rdquo;.  Indeed, we can confirm these opinions of the former Minister following our own consultations with the Department of Finance when they costed the alternative taxation measures we proposed in our alternative budget submitted during the February general election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> Thus we conclude that the Coalition's desire to ignore our proposals for capital taxation and for a fairer share to be paid by the self-employed derived not from any administrative inconvenience that arose but from a political will to cushion the wealthy and the gombeen elements from having to suffer unduly as a result of the crisis in the Exchequer finances. Instead, it transpired that in the six months available to them Fine Gael and their Coalition partners had set their energies to formulating a particularly nasty budget which, unbelievably, given their parliamentary weakness, blatantly placed the burden of paying for the economic crisis on the backs of the working class and the less well-off.  That budget was run through with the monetarist theories of the economic adviser of the Chilean Junta, Milton Friedman, as instanced by their conscious and declared aim of shifting the tax base away from direct taxation to indirect taxation.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In view of the turn that this has taken I think that the procedure and Standing Orders of the House have been brought to the notice of the Chair and precedents may be established.  As you have said, Sir, Standing Orders say that a Deputy other than a Minister may not read a script verbatim.  It has now been brought to your notice and to the notice of the House that a script is being used.  Indeed, a script has been formaly circulated through the staff of the House to the stenographers and to certain Members of the House.  I think you have to decide whether you are going to establish a precedent and whether scripts will be allowed in future.  With the greatest respect, Sir, I do not think it is good enough that you draw the attention of the Deputy to the rules and then say to him: I leave it to you to put your interpretation on the rules and to skate around them as you think fit.  On your shoulders now, Sir, is the heavy responsibility to decide whether Deputies in this House may read scripts, prepared by themselves or by others, or whether Standing Orders will be enforced.  I think it is my duty to say that.</P>

        <i>(Waterford):</i> As I was saying, a concern for the effects of taxation on the low-paid comes very strangely from Fine Gael when they were some of the most enthusiastic advocates of the shift from direct to indirect taxation. Indirect taxation, as even the dogs in the streets may know, is an inherently regressive form of tax because, by taxing expenditure, the poor pay proportionately more of their income than do the rich.  Of course, this is the philosophy of Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> The lower a person's income, the more of it they have to spend to live.  That is clear. Indeed, in this country the great majority of people find themselves in the position <Col N="650" /> of having to spend all they have to live. Thus, under an expenditure tax régime, they pay tax on all of their income.  The capitalist, on the other hand, spends only a portion of what he gets, the rest he saves, invests or speculates.  Indeed, as an economist once said; the capitalist gets what he spends while the worker spends what he gets.  By trying to shift the tax base towards indirect taxation Fine Gael were trying to bring about a situation in which workers were taxed on all of their income and capitalists were taxed on a portion only of theirs.  It was the frills of that budget &mdash; designed to offset the central regressive drift that it represented &mdash; for which Deputy Bruton is now shedding crocodile tears.  It is only when he can convince us that he has given up his former reactionary commitments to basic right wing monetarism that we might begin to accept that there is some sincerity behind those tears.</P>
      <P>As if the attempt to shift the tax base towards expenditure taxes was not enough the Coalition Government added insult to injury by such proposals as the measure to repay to farmers interest on bank loans they had raised to speculate &mdash; I might add unsuccessfully &mdash; in land for no other reason than it was farmers who got their fingers burned.  Industrialists, and even oil speculators were not to be accorded this extraordinary privilege. The audacious attempt to remove the resource tax from the Statute Book retrospectively so that the Exchequer could pay back payments of a tax passed by the Dáil was not alone an insult to the longsuffering PAYE taxpayers but to the democratic system itself.  Indeed, listening to some of the comments of the Fine Gael Party, so vehemently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Waterford):</i>&mdash;&mdash; the pseudo Liberals within the Fine Gael Party and their commitment to the democratic process.  We have seen an example of their commitment to that.  They are trying now, as I have said, to add insult to injury by handing back retrospectively taxation which they themselves were going to implement.</P>
      <P>With such a record on economic matters there can be few enough grounds for working class representatives and socialists in this House, in effect, to pass a vote of confidence in Fine Gael's alternative budget by bringing down the present Government on the Finance Bill at this stage.  And we warn those who might be tempted into this course of action that a return of a Fine Gael Government could well result in a renewed and concentrated onslaught on the living standards of the working class.  Fine Gael, to earn our confidence that their alternative approach to the budget will bring significant benefits to the mass of people and to the economically weak will have to do better than they have done in their budgets to date.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael were offered a third chance to show an earnest of their good faith after the February election in the discussions we held with the leaders of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Parties to form a new Government.  We entered those discussions with an open mind, and indeed if one cares to consult the press cuttings of the time, it was the perception of the media that we would lean towards Deputy FitzGerald in those discussions. However, by the time they were over it was very clear to Deputy Sherlock, Deputy De Rossa and me that Deputy FitzGerald had no policy other than the one which had been rejected by the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was made evident to us in our meetings with Deputy FitzGerald that he had no stomach to even consider any of our alternative suggestions.  The Fine Gael side were not even willing to pay us the <Col N="652" /> courtesy of even attempting to acquaint themselves with the proposals we were putting forward to shift the burden off working class shoulders and to ensure a fair share throughout society through our proposals for tax equity.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, let me add, seemed to adopt the attitude that they were the rightful majority, even though they did not get a mandate from the people, and in an arrogant way refused any suggestion of engaging in serious discussions with us. They apparently expected from us the meek acquiescence that they had seemingly become used to from their association with the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>It was clear to us, too, that in the aftermath of the election it was the right wing of the party that was holding sway, people like Deputies Kelly and Bruton, as was evidenced by the clear message from them of having no truck with serious socialists.  This was a signal to us that the more progressive wing of the Fine Gael Party, although having maintained a high profile during the recent general election campaign were decidedly in the minority when it came to the real exercise of power and of showing a willingness to consider the proposals we were putting forward.</P>
    <P>We came to this conclusion, despite our reservations about the Fianna Fáil attitude to Northern Ireland, and to the aim of reforming the Constitution and achieving a secular republic.  At that time, as a result of the highly-published constitutional crusade of Deputy FitzGerald, the general perception was that Deputy FitzGerald was a true reformer.  In the interim Deputy FitzGerald has had the chance to show his commitment in this regard.  Yet he has done nothing to date.  On the key issue of civil liberties and constitutional reform at present, for example, the proposed pro-life referendum, Deputy FitzGerald has shown himself to be in the same camp as the Taoiseach.  Fine Gael's stance on this developing campaign will be a true test of just how deep is their commitment to a constitutional crusade. Thus far, they are in favour of a deeply reactionary amendment to make the Constitution more rather than less sectarian. Thus far, both in the budgetary <Col N="653" /> sphere or in the broader political sphere, Fine Gael have given us no reason to substitute them for Fianna Fáil in Government.  Of course, The Workers' Party are under no illusions about Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> I am now coming to our agreement with Deputy Kelly on one aspect.  We are under no illusions about Fianna Fáil, but we accept completely Deputy Kelly's perception of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael as ideological twins as accurate.  Why do they not get together?  As we said on many occasions, let the two reactionary conservative parties in this Assembly get together, give the stable Government they are consistently preaching about and let those of us on the left in this Dáil Chamber form a socialist left in the country.  We are prepared for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will continue to maintain an open mind on the issue of whether a Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil Government will best serve the country's interests of the working class at any particular point in time. If the time comes when a change of the present Government will best serve the interests of the people and the workers in a clear and demonstrable way, then we will willingly participate in bringing this about.  My colleagues in this Chamber are on the same line as this.  Let nobody in the conservative parties make any mistake about it.  If and when we decide, it will be we who decide, not intimidation or pressure from either Fianna Fáil, Fine <Col N="654" /> Gael or, God help us, the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>We thus offer neither of the conservative civil war parties in this House an unconditional mandate to govern.  They can of course at their own choosing take up Deputy Kelly's suggestion to coalesce. But as long as they refuse to take up that option we will continue to use their division to fight for the workers and for the country, and in relation to the economy, to try and make sure that they will not be able to make the working class pay for this crisis, a crisis created by the economic policies of successive Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>Our resolve to continue to follow this course has been confirmed by the democratic expression of the electorate in Dublin West.  Contrary to what Fine Gael have made of the Dublin West result, the real picture was that Fine Gael suffered a drop in their first preference votes compared with the February election.  This is hardly a strong vote of confidence in a working class constituency for a Fine Gael alternative budget.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Fianna Fáil vote fell as well.  The 100 per cent increase of The Workers' Party share of the vote, on the other hand, is a message to us to continue to use our resources in the Dáil to press for working-class interests.  Rather than being a vote of confidence in Fine Gael we take the view that the doubling of the vote secured by The Workers' Party candidate, and the subsequent transfer of our votes to Fine Gael, was an indication of the electorates desire to ensure that a continuing restraint be placed on the Fianna Fáil minority Government.</P>
    <P>The debate on the Finance Bill is overshadowed by the continuing difficulties of the Exchequer, as indicated by the continued high current budget deficit. The Minister for Finance's admission that the deficit will amount to 100 per cent of the full year total by the end of this month is a serious matter and one that we must take cogniscance of.</P>
    <P>These budgetary developments have raised once more the possibility that the working class people will be asked to pick up the tab for the capitalist crisis which exists precisely because of the failure of the capitalist policies espoused by the two <Col N="655" /> conservative parties in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>To the Minister for Finance we give notice that, in considering corrective measures to deal with the budgetary situation, we will oppose any attempts to do so at the expense of the working class taxpayer, the unemployed, and the economically weak, either in measures this year to recoup lost revenues or in the 1983 budget.  We note the Minister's statement that the PRSI £45 million will be met through expenditure reductions. If these reductions are to be found through the elimination of waste, or through the raising of productivity in the civil service through better management, then we will support them.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party accept the need to cut the budget deficit.  We reject the attempts by Deputy FitzGerald, which are quite unfair given our clearly enunciated policy regarding the budget deficit, to portray the left in this House as irresponsible, as looking for more spending all the time, with blithe disregard for the national interest.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, we are advocating economic policies which are of a far more constructive nature with regard to the horrific unemployment problem in cutting the Government's deficit than those of Fine Gael, which are negative and which cannot see any further than cuts, irrespective of the economic consequences. We believe that the deficit must be reduced through the expansion of profitable &mdash; and I emphasise &ldquo;profitable&rdquo;&mdash;activities of the semi-State bodies as well as through the elimination of waste in our public sector generally.</P>
    <P>In this connection I mention one example: the opportunity for the development of mariculture in the 1980s.  The massive potentials in commercial fish farming were recently set out in the report on the sector by the National Board for Science and Technology.  The recent report that the Electricity Supply Board have got &ldquo;permission&rdquo; from the Department of Fisheries for the export of 100 tons of cage-reared salmon is welcomed.  We urge that the ESB should be made responsible for expanding their activities in mariculture to the fullest and most <Col N="656" /> profitable extent possible, instead of hiving it off, as is the inclination of the conservative parties, to yet more gombeen interests.  Such an industry could be contributing £80 million to the balance of payments by the second half of this decade. Such sums are a positive example of what can be done by our public sector to curb the deficits.  However, I suspect that this call will meet with little enthusiasm from the private enterprise fanatics of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>I cite the ESB's potential involvement in mariculture as one example of what can be done.  Who can imagine what could happen to our economy if the whole public sector were unshackled from its gombeen capitalist manacles?  It is a disgrace that a great, progressive and productive enterprise such as the ESB should have to go cap in hand to the Department of Fisheries for permission to export a paltry 100 tons of fish.</P>
    <P>But in the absence of these more attractive, but unfortunately longer-term possibilities for economic development, we must still come to terms with the grim realities of our present economic crisis, brought about by the capitalist policies of the two conservative parties, whose failures now dominate the discussion on the Finance Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not need a Commission on Taxation report to tell us what needs to be done.  The PAYE taxpayers have been telling successive Governments since 1979 to widen the tax base, to increase the tax take on Schedule D of the self-employed income, both earned and unearned.  Interest payments, rent and dividend income must be brought fully into the tax net, like the wage and salaries of PAYE taxpayers.  Rent is a major area where tax evasion exists.  This must be properly tapped.  Other self-employed <Col N="657" /> income must also be brought in, and the problem of tax evasion by professionals must be tackled.  The farmers must pay their fair share, a proposal which clearly does not meet with the support of Fine Gael to judge by their January budget, which unbelievably reduced the liability of farmers to pay for the massive amount of services they get from the State, through the outrageous proposal to cut by half the rates payments of larger farmers.</P>

The existence of substantial untapped tax revenues in this economy is evident to all with eyes to see.  The wealth of the black economy is clearly in view.</P>
      <P>To achieve these ends we assert yet again that sweeping changes must be effected in our tax system &mdash; changes of a progressive nature that will widen the tax base through a reliance on direct taxation of the self-employed and the wealthy and the implementation of capital taxation proposals that will see this form of tax rise as much as is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendments to the Finance Bill <Col N="658" /> on Committee Stage are aimed to provide this House with the opportunity of taking the first serious steps towards a balanced tax system, and finally show the PAYE taxpayers that their campaign for tax reform was not in vain.  The kid glove approach of Minister for Finance towards the wealthy in the past must now be ended.</P>
    <P>While economic issues are central to this debate, given the drastic level of unemployment, high inflation, a critical balance of payments situation, inequitable taxation, gross under-utilisation of our natural resources, particularly in agriculture, mariculture and allied industries. The Workers' Party insist that the crisis in the economy is but an element, though a key element, of a much wider and more deeply rooted <i>malaise</i> within the social system.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> In the course of the recent general election, we set out alternative budget proposals which are simply a short-term response to the present crisis in Ireland.  Admittedly, they involve no more than a tinkering with the superficial details of the present capatalist economy.  But, as I have already indicated, taxation cannot solve the problem.  The problems of 20 per cent inflation and over 148,000 unemployed &mdash; and the figure is still growing &mdash; and the acute balance of payments problem are just the surface manifestations of the extent to which the private enterprise economy is in trouble.  They cannot be solved without a radical change in attitudes and an overhaul of the economic system.  The Workers' Party maintain that two basic changes are required for a solution to the long-term <Col N="661" /> economic crisis that faces this country in the eighties.</P>
      <P>(1)  There must be a renewed commitment among the work force to the task of economic development, and</P>
      <P>(2)  There must be a planned approach to development so that the resources of the economy are harnessed fully and efficiently to achieve the increase in national output necessary to cut inflation, reduce the taxation burden, raise real wages and provide the material basis for social progress.</P>
      <P>Neither of these two changes can be brought about in a private enterprise dominated economy.  Why should the work force contribute the increased productivity and efficiency required for such a plan to a system in which it has no stake?  The working class in this country know intuitively that if they respond to the endless calls for wage moderation from conservative politicians and industrialists, or indeed to the demands for an acceptance of an unbalanced tax system, that they will get nothing in return.  The very fact that capitalism offers no guarantee of economic justice is proof that belt tightening among the workers will only lead to fatter dividends for employers.</P>
      <P>It is thus understandable that workers must resist attempts to raise efficiency or productivity at their expense, not just in the public sector, but in the private sector. For the same reasons, the endless calls for wage moderation repeatedly fall on deaf ears even though economic circumstances dictate the need for such austerity.</P>
      <P>For this country's long-term economic problems to be solved it is essential that the working class co-operate fully to improve efficiency, increase competitiveness, raise exports and cut imports &mdash; the measures necessary to solve the balance of payments crisis.  Without the consent of the working class it is inevitable that this country will lurch from balance of payments crisis to deflation for years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> Thus the key principle of any long-term economic development plan is a guarantee to workers that the profits to be reaped from belt tightening, from efficiency and from the raising of productivity will accrue to the ordinary people in a just way.</P>
    <P>By ensuring, through legislation, democracy in the workplace so that each and every worker will fully participate in the running of his or her enterprise, and by ensuring a key role for socially owned State enterprises such as CIE, the ESB and Bord na Móna, the creative energies of the working class can ultimately solve all economic problems.</P>
    <P>The second essential feature of the long-term development plan we propose is planning.  Our economy under private enterprise domination is chaotic at present. For example, there can be no effective national drive to solve the major problem of massive energy imports because there is no co-ordination between ESB, CIE and our transport planning authorities, all of which would have to be the pillars of a national plan to reduce the deficit arising from energy imports.  By introducing planning on a national scale, the decisions of productive units in the private and socialised sectors of the economy can be meshed together in the national drive for development that is needed.  The state sector must be at the centre of any planned expansion.  The Workers' Party has consistently backed the expansion of the role of State enterprise in the economy. Because the State enterprises are the most amenable to a planned drive for economic development their expansion goes hand in hand with the introduction of planning.</P>
    <P>The long term efficiency and development plan that we propose would concentrate on the raising of exports and the cutting of imports in the following key sectors, in agriculture by the expansion and involvement of State enterprise in large scale farming, and food processing, as outlined in our recently published policy document, &ldquo;Land for the People&rdquo;, in energy through a plan to raise the production of cheap energy, and by a planned conservation plan, organised <Col N="663" /> and executed by the ESB; in manufacturing by the involvement of the State in manufacturing initiatives to replace the failed small industries programme of the IDA, and through renewed and sustained efforts to obtain foreign industries which are of real benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>The response of the conservative parties to the economic crisis is predictable. The Coalition showed clearly who they wanted to pay the cost.  It was to be placed yet again on those who could least afford to pay, the working class.  Fianna Fáil in Government have done little different. Deputies Haughey and FitzGerald represent the same interest &mdash; they both have shown consistently over time that they will refuse to tax both wealth and capital. The Labour Party by their support for Fine Gael policies have shown that they have lost the will to defend the interests of the workers.  But the voting record of my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, Workers' Party TD, made sure that the voice of 900,000 marching PAYE taxpayers had to be listened to at last.  That voice was heard on 27 January, budget day.</P>
    <P>In voting against the Coalition budget, we did not deny that there is an economic crisis.  What we disagreed with fundamentally was how the Government proposed to pay for it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> The Workers' Party fully accept that there is an acute economic crisis.  As an economy we are spending more than we are earning abroad and the difference has been made up by Government borrowing. Over the past few years successive Governments have attempted to maintain the illusion of prosperity under capitalism by more and more borrowing to pay for day to day spending.  Both Fianna Fáil and the Coalition refuse to follow the policies necessary to lay the foundations <Col N="664" /> for real prosperity through a significant restructuring of the economy to raise production to the levels necessary to maintain our standard of living, and to create sufficient employment for the growing labour force.  The unshakeable faith of these conservative parties in private enterprise as the engine of growth is misplaced.  Despite an investment rate the same as that of Japan, the inefficient ramshackle private enterprise economy has proved that it cannot meet the challenge. The engine has seized.  By 1982 all we are left with is an unemployment level of 148,000 an inflation rate of over 20 per cent, economic stagnation and of course, a huge foreign debt.</P>
      <P>With the economy now on its knees, and little prospect of ever being able to pay the interest on that debt through self-sustained growth, the economy by international definition, is on its knees. Like any company in trouble which first turns to its workforce to cut wages, the Fine Gael and labour Party Coalition Government in their 1982 budget tried to do exactly this: they tried to take money out of the pockets of workers by huge increases in direct and indirect taxation. In the past the conservative parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, with the collusion of the Labour Party were able to get away with this approach.  There is now a workers' voice in Dáil Éireann prepared to call a halt.</P>

      <P>I would just draw the attention of the House to some of the courtesies.  We have extended the courtesy to The Workers' Party, to conclude their speech.  We should look at some of the old style traditions.  If the Deputy feels a prepared speech is preferable, I do not think it is wise for us to get hung up on it.  By all means let us change tradition. We are all aware that many people read speeches, therefore why do we tie ourselves up in such traditions of our own making? I would prefer to see The Workers' Party, formerly the Official Sinn Féin, represented in this House rather than outside and I would prefer to see the Provisional Sinn Féin represented inside rather than outside this House.  If certain traditions are broken, they were made by Irish people and we should not get too hung up on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to address my remarks to the comments made by The Workers' Party and then deal with the economics of the <Col N="666" /> Finance Bill.  I want to address my remarks in a manner in which I hope all my comments have been to date, and that is as constructive criticism and not in a personal way.  The Workers' Party's attitude to parliamentary democracy is consistent and comes from a long political parliamentary tradition, which does not necessarily exist in this country but which has existed in every European country where there has been a Euro-Communist or Communist Party.  The opportunistic behaviour of The Workers' Party in this House since last June is exactly the same as that of the French Communist Party, the Italian Communist Party, the Portugese Communist Party and the Spanish Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, the opportunistic voting pattern of that party is something our sister parties in the Socialist International forum have experienced.  I was not surprised by any of the criticisms made by The Workers' Party nor was I surprised at their decision to vote against an amendment calling for the establishment of a rents tribunal, <Col N="667" /> against which all three Deputies voted in return for some kind of vague changes. They had 27 amendments accepted in that legislation, all of which purported to change the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;will&rdquo; or &ldquo;may&rdquo;, or some such substantial radical Marxist tranformation of the housing market.</P>
      <P>Since The Workers' Party representative in his concluding speech saw fit to attack the Labour Party I feel I should reply in the context of a left wing analysis of what their proposed policies are. There are inconsistencies in, on the one hand, voting in this House for the PRSI increases, which they did, and then going out on the streets to march in opposition to them, which is also what they did.  That is something which is not necessarily correctly paraded on the front page of <i>The Irish People</i>, but journalists not representing party newspapers have an obligation and an opportunity to record accurately.</P>
      <P>They have also tried to misrepresent some of the progressive measures a small party like the Labour Party are trying to have implemented.  Tragically, they cannot recognise the kind of changes that have been made and, because of the economic framework within which their own policy makers conceive politics, they cannot understand the reasons why the belt-tightening exercises have to be undergone in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When The Workers' Party was originally known as Sinn Féil they were committed to economic independence for the Republic of Ireland.  It is my understanding that they are still committed to that policy.  So are the Labour Party.  The restrictions imposed by the International Monetary Fund on the working class, for whom The Workers' Party are so concerned, would be savage beyond belief when compared with any kind of constraints which any combination of domestic political parties would impose.  It is precisely the kind of reckless spending by the Fianna Fáil Party to buy votes which would bring this country and its economic dependence to a stage of disintegration where the IMF would be obliged to come in, as they did in Britain when the Labour <Col N="668" /> Party were in office and as they did in Italy.  That is exactly what the Labour Party were seeking to avoid and will continue to do, and we make no apology for that.  If that was not understood by the people, then that is a criticism of our ability to communicate our policies, but it is not necessarily a criticism of the policies themselves.</P>
    <P>I can understand The Workers' Party's lack of understanding of the role played by the IMF, because the IMF do not operate in the eastern European socialist economies and therefore does not necessarily come into the economic frame of thinking of people who have a certain support.  There is nothing wrong about that support.  I want everyone to be quite clear about what I am saying, because that is a perfectly valid point of view to have.  All I am saying is that every Deputy or party who puts forward a view should try to argue it honestly, rationally, reasonably and recognise all the facts. That is the basis on which scientific Marxism and scientific socialism is constructed.</P>
    <P>In the Irish economy and in the western world in which we operate, the IMF are a very strong force, particularly for leftwing governments, or left of centre governments, who want to protect workers from the revages of the collapse of the international system by borrowing and maintaining levels of income at a time when economic growth is declining. I draw the attention of the international affairs committee of The Workers' Party to the fate that befell the Manley Government in Jamaica which attempted to ride out the strictures of the International Monetary Fund by implementing a socialist programme in an extraordinarily difficult economic system.</P>
    <P>If we are to have left wing criticism of the role of the minority party in this House, let it be consistent with the facts and take cognisance of all the facts, not the selective facts which are made for opportunistic debate.  The tone, text and colour of The Workers' Party speech were extraordinary.  I had to pinch myself most of the time because I felt it had been written for the previous budget, not this budget.  It seemed to suggest that Fine <Col N="669" /> Gael were in government.  The only motivation there can be for that is &mdash; and it is quite clear to me, to the House and from the relieved smiles of the Fianna Fáil Deputies &mdash; that The Workers' Party again decided to go into coalition with Fianna Fáil to abstain or to vote for the Finance Bill tonight.  A journalist recently described an objective assessment of the role of The Workers' Party in this House as &ldquo;benevolent neutrality&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I welcome the support of every Deputy, but I was surprised and disappointed Deputy Fitzsimons did not vote with us on that issue.</P>
      <P>The point at issue is that we are debating the Finance Bill.  The impression has been created that there was an underhand deal, a secret arrangement, under which, in return for The Workers' Party's abstention on the Second Stage, concessions would be made by the Minister for Finance on Committee Stage.  We must wait and see what the outcome will be. The Labour Party will be pressing their amendment to relieve the kind of distortion that was in the budget, which this Finance Bill compounds and which The Workers' Party appear to wish to support, either by benevolent neutrality or by positive support in tonight's vote.  We will do that because the bias in favour of the people who own wealth goes right through the section.  That provision has not been modified relative to the needs of the people.  It has not been modified one iota by any of the representations made by The Workers' Party in private or in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any progressive provisions in the Bill, and there are some&mdash;I welcome their survival and I thank the Minister for retaining them despite lobbying from some sections of the Fianna Fáil supporting groups <Col N="670" />&mdash;in fact are legacies from the Coalition Government.  However, the more progressive elements in that budget, which was an extremely difficult budget, have been removed.  It was rather sad to hear somebody as sincere as Deputy Gallagher&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that sincerely.  On the one hand he was able to argue passionately against what he called the &ldquo;obscene accumulation of wealth&rdquo; but tonight he will vote, or not vote, in favour of legislation which is the legal vehicle to enable people to hide wealth, which, in the phraseology of The Workers' Party was robbed from the working classes by the capitalists.  I understand Deputy Gallagher's dilemma, and Deputy De Rossa's, and Deputy Sherlock's: it is the dilemma of being elected to a parliament that has two large centre parties, populist parties, who have to be pushed and shoved to make any kind of progressive concessions.  It is a dilemma that will continue until we get some kind of radical re-alignment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest respectfully to The Workers' Party that that kind of sloganeering and the sort of insulting analysis they presented here tonight do not fit in with their party's policies.  We are in a real economic crisis.  On the one hand we are playing in the popular scrum of more money for everybody in demonstrations throughout the country, and at the same time we are saying that jobs can be produced overnight in a whole range of industries.  It is simply against economic reality.  If we were to apply the model of economic development that has been applied in Eastern Europe, and which is inherent in the industrial revolution proposals of The Workers' Party, we would be forced to have wage constraints on a planned basis and an incomes policy without any of the increases being talked about for a long period.  The very first people to baulk at that would be the trade union movement. Indeed, I gathered from what Deputy Gallagher said that all of the benefits of increased productivity should go to the <Col N="671" /> workers, the people who produce the wealth.</P>
    <P>If that is to be the case, there would not be any benefit in increasing productivity, whose purpose is to find capital for re-investment.  It is clear that our capacity to borrow more money abroad for productive investment is extremely limited because of the declining value of the Irish punt and the parlous position of the Irish economy <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other European economies, particularly the British and the pound sterling.  Therefore, we are in a very vulnerable position.</P>
    <P>I make these comments on The Workers' Party contribution because we must try to strike a balance.  My socialist colleagues in all the other European parliaments have had to respond to the same narrow pre-1973 Marxist analysis of economic realities in the world today.  That party's analysis extends to the North-South dialogue on the Brandt Report in regard to Third World development: it is a rigid, hard, narrow interpretation of world economics, conceived in a framework that does not any longer fit the economic realities of the world since the oil crisis of 1973.  It certainly does not fit into a programme to try to establish an economy within the EEC.  I understand that The Workers' Party now support the EEC, though they did not support it during the 1971 referendum.</P>
    <P>It is only through a mixture of socialist planning with co-operation from the private sector in a mixed economy that we can attain any measure of fixed security and stability in Ireland.  Unfortunately, the ability to get the kind of consensus that helped to achieve the industrialisation of Ireland from the early sixties to 1972-1973, when there was consensus, when we had wage agreement after wage agreement, when real productivity was gained in nearly all sectors, was shattered by the refusal of certain sections in the economy to recognise the need for change, for people to participate in the spoils, the benefits, of redevelopment.</P>
    <P>The most culpable section are undoubtedly the farming community.  If any section created a sense of total alienation among workers and brought into <Col N="672" /> the streets hundreds of thousands of PAYE people &mdash; they were right to go into the streets, and I joined them there &mdash; it was the farming community who, having campaigned vigorously to get us into the EEC in 1971-72 and who then benefited from the undoubted short-term bonanza in terms of farm prices, categorically refused to share their new-found wealth with the urban workforce, many of whom were finding that the old tariff protected industrial jobs with which they had grown up were disappearing.</P>
    <P>I remind The Workers' Party that it was not the so-called radical republicanism of Fianna Fáil that took on the farming community: it was on Labour Party insistence, with Fine Gael support, that for the first time those who were making real money, the farming community, were taxed.  That was in 1974-75.  The effect was that many of them transferred their support to Fianna Fáil.  Any analysis made in the House should be based on what happened in history rather than what one would like to have happened in history.  The history of that time is that the farmers refused to pay the money: they refused adamantly to pay their taxes and they are still refusing to do so.  I suggest they are still being treated too lightly.  All the professional lobbyists for farmers, mainly for the large farmers, are conceding that there is growth in the incomes of the farming community. Therefore, it is only right and proper that they should be paying their full and fair share of the taxes required.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not ask them to do it.  It will not get at the ranchers, will not oblige them to make a contribution.  I will be looking for support from The Workers Party and other socialist Deputies for amendments to try to redress that situation. I will give one example.  The last Coalition Government implemented the Labour Party proposal for the establishment of the Youth Employment Agency, which is financed by those who are at work, but not by farmers or some of the self-employed.  That is unacceptable. Why should one section of the workforce, mainly the PAYE people, be obliged exclusively to carry responsibility for the financing of the Youth Employment <Col N="673" /> Agency when the farmers or the self-employed do not contribute?  We have calculated that a Youth Employment Agency levy on farmers and the self-employed would yield £20 million.  We draw that to the notice of the Minister for Finance and we will be moving an amendment on those lines on Committee Stage. It is now likely the Committee Stage will be passed because of the &ldquo;benevolent neutrality&rdquo; of The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>The budget attempted to provide a cosmetic exercise on the continuing inequality in our country.  This inequality has been severely aggravated by the response of the country to the crisis of 1973 and has caused divisions not just between town and country, between farmer and worker, but within the work force itself. On the one hand there is the problem of young people trying to get a job for the first time and, on the other hand, of workers seeking redundancy payments rather than attempting to keep a factory in operation in order to maintain employment. They are real problems that demand real solutions but the solutions are not contained in the provisions of this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>This Government, like the previous Fianna Fáil Government when stability was not a problem, have failed to deal with the central issue of the utilisation of the public finances they control.  The convention of the theological dogma of so-called left wing parties is that one should nationalise financial institutions and take them into public ownership.  For example, when the Labour Party in Britain were in office the British Government nationalised their loss-marking steel industry, to the great delight and joy of every capitalist shareholder in the industry because they got a bonanza they would not have got otherwise.</P>
    <P>This country already owns the largest life assurance company in the nation.  It is in public ownership.  The Minister for Finance owns 97 per cent of the shares.</P>

      <P>Yet, with that kind of leverage the Government have not used <Col N="674" /> their power in a planned way.  The Minister could exercise enormous fiscal power through the organ of the Central Bank, which is publicly owned, and control the direction of State finances, the investment policy and the way in which it would develop exactly on the lines mentioned by Deputy Gallagher in relation to the long-term development of sectors of our industry.  However, there is an extraordinary reluctance on the part of Fianna Fail to do that, and there has always been that reluctance.  It was not there in the forties and fifties when the private enterprise sector simply could not aspire to that kind of thing.  I challenge the Minister to refute the claim that Fianna Fáil now are strongly in the hands of a small clique of wealthy people who control their economic policy.  The refusal of Fianna Fail when they had a 20-seat majority in this House to take effective action in directing the policy of companies such as Irish Life and the Central Bank into responsible economic planning and development was because it was more profitable for private enterprise to do the job.</P>
      <P>When I spoke on the Bill dealing with urban development I pointed out that it was another cosmetic exercise by Fianna Fail that would do nothing to regenerate the north side of Dublin city because it was not making financial resources available for the job.  As Deputy Sherlock correctly pointed out, if anything it was attacking still further local government autonomy in the name of the revitalisation of the inner city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Government have the power, the instruments and the levers to effect major economic policy changes if they have the political will to do so.  During the four years when we were in socialist opposition on this side of the House and when the Government had a 20-seat majority there was no point in arguing or even talking to Fianna Fáil.  Now that they are a minority Government I appeal to the left wing Deputies and parties to exercise their influence in a constructive manner to get some of the changes and reforms implemented by a minority Government, changes on which all of us are agreed.  I can assure the members of <Col N="675" /> The Workers' Party in this House that it Fianna Fail return to a majority situation the courtesies and the secret meetings and all the rest will be something of the past.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party are disappointed that the Government, with all their experience, did not see fit to respond to changing the overall composition of the taxation package in order to introduce a greater degree of equity in a manner acceptable to a wider range of people.  I am talking in particular of working people who represent 80 or 90 per cent of the population, people who earn their living by head or by hand and who are PAYE workers.  For some reason, perhaps related to the enormous cost of Fianna Fáil's election programmes and their election campaigning, as the magazine <i>Aspect</i> indicates in this month's issue, there is an extraordinary reluctance on the part of Fianna Fail to tax wealth.  We are suggesting that a comprehensive capital taxation series of measures could be introduced to produce the following: a tax on wealth to produce £25 million; a capital gains and acquisitions tax to produce £25 million; a land zoning development levy to produce £15 million and an income-related selective property tax to produce £20 million.  This gives a total of £85 million.  I will refer in detail to two of those measures for the purpose of clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin County Council have witnessed the spectacle during the past year of acres of land being rezoned by a combination of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors. In the opinion of the technical advisers this land was incapable of being developed or serviced for the foreseeable future; yet, in relation to such a parcel of land on the north side of Dublin city, in the vicinity of Swords, it was estimated <Col N="676" /> that its agricultural pre zoning value was in the region of a maximum £3,000 to £4,000 per acre.  Even with the restriction that there would be no services available in the foreseeable future and, therefore, no planning permission its value had increased to at least £25,000 per acre. There has been an extraordinary queue of landowners, farmers and land assemblers knocking on the door of the houses of councillors and local authorities and Dublin County Council in particular will testify to the continuous representations made in relation to getting land rezoned. Apparently the market is extraordinarily buoyant and, I suggest, extraordinarily flush and generous with its money.</P>
    <P>We propose that the land zoning development levy would be made at the point of the decision to zone.  If a person petitions to have his land zoned and if the value is increased &mdash; the problem now in local authorities is that far too much land is zoned &mdash; the decision at the time of zoning would be the point when the value changes from agricultural use to development use.  This would have the advantage of raising capital legitimately in those areas where there was to be redevelopment in a constructive manner and the additional benefit of discouraging in a very effective way speculative rezoning that has effectively destroyed the planning of Dublin county and, as a consequence, made nonsense of any attempt to plan the city of Dublin and for its growing population with any sense of coherence.  Members who campaigned in the Dublin West by-election will recognise the type of nightmare legacy we have constructed and will bequeath to our children.</P>
    <P>The Minister could adopt that suggestion which would produce £15 million approximately.  It would hurt a lot of Fianna Fáil supporters but it would bring in money that could be taken off the load the PAYE sector have to bear.  It would be hard for Fianna Fáil to accept another tax which we are proposing since they abolished rates on all dwellings, narrowed the property tax base and total tax base in such a way that it was the workers who carried the tax burden because nobody else was carrying it by the time <Col N="677" /> the extraordinary O'Donoghue &mdash; Colley package was introduced.  Deputy Colley is the man who discovered honesty in the back benches of Fianna Fáil.  We are proposing that the income-related selective property tax apply to the second home and some family homes.  It is an extraordinary testament to the division of wealth here that one can propose such a tax in these days when there are approximately 30,000 homeless on local authority housing lists.  On the basis of our estimate an income-related selective property tax would produce a yield of up to £20 million.</P>
    <P>We will be looking for support from all sides of the House for that change.  I presume that the overall budget and deficit strategy is being maintained.  We are talking about a package of approximately £85 million and that could be transferred from the PAYE sector to this section.  If a Fianna Fáil Deputy wishes to say why he does not want a land zoning tax or why he does not want holiday homes taxed he should say so; that is what democracy is all about.  That Deputy should then try to explain at a clinic why it is that housing lists are so long on one side of the fence and why some people can have two houses.  He should explain at those clinics why Fianna Fáil are not prepared to tax those people.  I am not talking about taking the second house from such people, I am not totally naive, but I am asking Fianna Fáil to be a little just.  I challenge Fianna Fáil Deputies, since honesty is something that has now been discovered in the back benches where the Colley faction sit, and since Deputy McCreevy outside the House can make such points like Deputy Colley, to tell us why they are not prepared to support the measure I have suggested.</P>
    <P>If democracy is on the wane and if people are becoming cynical about the machinations of politics &mdash; it is my view that that is happening &mdash; this is the place where we should be discussing this openly and honestly.  Indeed, this is the place where not just the press should be but where the TV cameras and the radio should be so that ordinary people can hear what is being said, or more to the <Col N="678" /> point, what is not said.  That is one area where the shift in the taxation burden should be.  The Bill is designed to give effect to the budget which was designed to give an indication of the Government's response to the economic problems that confront us.  Regrettably for all of us that is not the case.  It is regrettable for our working people, and the number of people who do not work in some shape or form is small.  It is my understanding that at least 80 per cent of the population depend on their economic activity on a daily basis in order to survive.  If we do not do something the situation will get worse.</P>
    <P>I am saddened, though not surprised, that the Bill does not contain anything that could be presented as going down the road of introducing equity and justice in the system in a substantial manner.  I am referring to anything Fianna Fáil put into the Bill because the progressive parts are the legacy of the last administration, an administration that some Members saw fit to attack and vote against.  Tonight we will have an interesting transformation by people who voted against progressive legislation now voting for it. That is the democratic choice of The Workers' Party but it should be seen by the public that that is what they have decided to do.</P>
    <P>The decision to abandon totally the idea of discretionary trust is undoubtedly in deference to the growing wealthy section. The proposal to introduce the legislation was brought in by a majority Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.  If The Workers Party want to be honest about their criticism they should tell the public how they can make a criticism against that Coalition which intended dispelling and removing that capacity for people to retain wealth and evade any type of taxation measure and how its abolition or removal by Fianna Fáil will get their support. In my view that is opportunistic voting and it is right to describe it as such. There may be a reason for it and it is up to The Workers Party Members to respond and tell the House and the country what the reason is.  Certainly, the speech by Deputy Gallagher did not <Col N="679" /> attempt to give that reason because it was not referred to.</P>
    <P>The country's difficulties can only be resolved by a system of economic planning supported by the majority of our people.  With our type of democracy, our type of constituencies where the constituency work of a local Member is as much a contributory factor in their election success as are the policies of political parties at head office, any type of economic policy presented for the support of the people must have a significant degree of consensus.  Ideologies in all parties &mdash; we all have them, people who always know best but never have to be elected, the theorists, the think-tank boys, the specialists who know precisely what should be done and then have the honour and privilege of being able to tell somebody else go out and do it &mdash; must realise that there has to be public support on a broad basis for economic policies.</P>
    <P>The divisions that the Fianna Fáil Government introduced into the economy in 1977 between the farmer and the worker on the one hand and the self-employed and the PAYE worker on the other and between different kinds of industries have broken down and damaged that potential consensus in such a way that the trade union movement have found it increasingly difficult to get support among their workers for national wage agreements.  The Labour Party have always supported the concept of national wage agreements, as has the official leadership of the trade union movement.  It is an essential and integral part of economic planning to have some form of understanding of what wage costs are likely to be in any industry over a period of time so that the law of the jungle between weak and strong sectors does not prevail.  If you do not have national wage agreements it would be impossible to undertake long-term planning projects.  It is only through long-term projects that we will get the kind of increase in productive wealth that is essential for the provision of jobs.  Every budget and every Finance Bill have a direct relation to the ability of the trade union movement to obtain a national <Col N="680" /> wage agreement; that is the workers' most constructive contribution to economic growth, in addition to their own productivity.</P>
    <P>The workforce over the last five to six years, led by the trade union movement, have made an extraordinary contribution in terms of productivity and ceding a substiantial portion of the wealth that they create to the Government and to employers.  That is done in the form of deferred payments and reduced increases relative to the rate of inflation or, in some cases, relative to the profits of the firm. Yet, Fianna Fáil in particular have consistently refused to radically change or transform the legislation relating to companies or provisions in financial legislation that will enable the workforce to have access to the accounts of companies so that the workforce can participate positively and constructively in the long-term future of the firm.  It has been compounded in a whole range of ways by creating divisions so that the co-operation of the workforce is now far less available than it was two, three or four years ago.  Anyone involved in the trade union movement knows that there is growing resentment to the concept of national wage agreements.  The trade unions believe &mdash; and I support the view &mdash; that if we break down that consensus, not only will the working people in general be damaged because the economy will be further undermined, but, within the workforce, the most vulnerable sections will suffer most.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this Bill does not provide for making available the information that workers will need in order to assess the financial position of their company. Perhaps we will discuss it in greater detail on Committee Stage but I am concerned that the options for profit sharing and for taking up shares as part of the financial take that a workforce would have in lieu of cash, in order to facilitate the cash flow and the general economic performance or survival of the company, in contrast to the impression in the budget speech, will only be confined to those companies that are publicly quoted on the Irish stock exchange or companies that are owned in whole or in part by <Col N="681" /> publicly quoted stock exchange companies. I think the House will realise that the list of companies in the Irish stock exchange is not exhaustive and would only cover a tiny part of the workforce. Therefore, this Bill fails in what should be the task of every financial resolution and Bill introduced in the House, the objective of introducing equity and fairness into our taxation system and also creating a climate within which the workforce can willingly operate and see that their future is being secured in a reasonable way.  There is no evidence, regrettably, to the satisfaction of the Labour Party that this legislation is moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is continued opposition among many employers to the EEC Fourth Division which would establish the rights of workers to have access to the financial information of their companies albeit in a very mild form because, like many EEC measures, it is the product of compromise and consensus and does not go far enough.  Significantly, however, it goes further than any of the legislation on our Statute Books.  That will not produce the kind of support which the trade union movement needs within its own ranks to get co-operation among its own workers to give the kind of productivity that is needed in the large public sector.  If we confine ourselves to the public sector, where there has been much industrial trouble on the question of wages because of the impostion of PAYE, it is essential that this or any Government can clearly be seen by that sector to be introducing equity and balance in their financial measures generally and particularly in the financial Bills introduced in this House.</P>
    <P>Because that is not there, the capability of using the public sector as the engine for economic growth &mdash; which in the official view of the Labour Party and of The Workers' Party, is the only substantial productive element in the economy under Irish control with the capital reserves capable of that development, with the full co-operation of the workforce &mdash; is being damaged because of the refusal by the Government to introduce the kind of balance and equity that is <Col N="682" /> needed in the financial provisions.  I made that point at some length because I want to give notice to the Minister that it is our intention to introduce amendments to try to make changes in that area.  I hope the Minister will be open to reason on this because, without it, we are not going to get the kind of economic response in the short term that we desperately need.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party opposed the auctioneering politics that emerged in 1976-77. Immediately after the 1977 election, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley came into the House and said that the economic policies of that time, of the bonanza days of throwing money around, would not work and that at the end of the day we would, in real terms, be worse off than when we started.  I used the analogy that it was like borrowing money to bet on a horse in the belief that you had a sure winner but that at the end of the day not only did the horse lose but you were left with having to pay back the money you had borrowed in the first place.  The only problem was that it was not Fianna Fáil money which was on the horse, it was money that the Irish people were legally responsible for.  It is because of that extraordinary taxation debt that now hangs around the neck of the country in the form of foreign borrowing and debts that we are in our present situation. Therefore, the realistic room for manoeuvre that Fianna Fáil have in this present economic climate is very constrained and tight.</P>
    <P>We are learning all the time, as we did in yesterday's Adjournment Debate, of secret deals and arrangements which make that situation worse.  Therefore, on behalf of the Labour Party, I call on the Minister to do a serious rethink on Committee Stage &mdash; it is quite obvious that some rethinking will have to be done &mdash; and to increase in a general way the level of capital taxation so as to be able to reduce the burden on the PAYE taxpayers; to look seriously at the question of bringing farmers more into the taxation net than they are at present.  It is really scandalous to see the low level of money the farmers continue to refuse to pay. Finally, I want him to amend the legislation <Col N="683" /> in relation to access to companies so that workers and their trade unions can clearly see the financial situation of the place in which they work and in which they have a stake so that they can take responsible decisions as the vast majority of them wish to do in order to secure their jobs, expand their plants and create new jobs for their sons and daughters and indeed for their grandchildren.</P>

This is the third economic debate on the budget this year.  What this country needs now is not another economic debate but a general election.  This House and the public have completely lost faith in the present Government who will turn, twist, bend and go back on their word; they will give way to any pressure group.

      <P>That is fine.  I am satisfied with what Deputy De Rossa has said. I was about to say that when Deputy FitzGerald questioned the Minister about it tonight the Minister denied that any deal had been hammered out.  If that is so I think the Minister is quite right.  It would be wasting his time and further diminishing the credibility of his Government if he came to a deal or accepted amendments from The Workers' Party next week because the Government are in no danger from them.  They will trot into the lobby with the Government any time they are wanted because they are as much afraid of the voice of the people as the Fianna Fáil Party.  I think the Minister should not further dismantle the budget and the Finance Bill by giving away or accepting amendments that may come from that source in the next fortnight because they are no threat.  If the Government want them to vote with them or to abstain, they will do so.  We shall have an example of that later tonight.  This group of people who profess themselves to be so concerned for the working class will vote tonight for a Finance Bill that dismantles many of the good points alluded to by the Minister in his budget speech because this Finance Bill is certainly a dilution of the budget as delivered by the Minister on 27 March. I think it is true that probably never anywhere in the world has there been such a change between the budget as introduced and the Bill as presented to the House.</P>

    <P>We cannot continue under this Government unless they get a bit of backbone.

      <P>We should not be surprised at the reluctance of Fianna Fáil to face the electorate because I think the leader of that party has demonstrated in his period of leadership that he is far stronger with words than with deeds. Here it is necessary to go back because we are talking about the same time bracket, from the time Deputy Haughey assumed office until today because it has all had an effect.  We all remember and I think many of us breathed a sigh of relief secretly when we heard the then Taoiseach and the present Taoiseach on television in February 1980 listing out coherently and authoritatively what was wrong with the economy, and telling us what it was necessary to do to put it right. That was the promise of February 1980, and that withered away into the reality of the disgraceful Talbot deal in May 1981, prior to the general election.  Anybody with that sort of record was rightly thrown out of office despite the fact of having a 20-seat majority at the time.  The Taoiseach had clearly and correctly listed the faults in the economy but had taken no action to rectify them.  He had let the situation drift, having brought in a disgraceful budget and Finance Bill in 1981. If Fianna Fáil did not have the courage to tackle the problems at a time when they had a 20-seat majority, how can we expect them to tackle them now when they are in a minority position?  These <Col N="687" /> problems have been compounded since the recent change of Government.  This Finance Bill is simply the last chapter of what has been going on since the 1981 General Election.  It was obvious to us on our election last year that problems had to be tackled urgently and courageously. Within three weeks of being returned to office we produced a budget which, as Deputy Gallagher admitted this evening, was justified having regard to the extent to which Fianna Fáil in office had damaged the economy.  In our seven or eight months in office we attempted to set about righting that damage by cutting public expenditure in every Department. Our budget of January last was the result of eight months of exhaustive and heartbreaking tackling of the Estimates for every Department.  We are told that that budget was too harsh.  It was certainly too harsh for Deputies Kemmy, Loftus and Sherlock, who voted against it.  In the event we lost the vote and went to the country on the basis of that budget.  We used the slogan &ldquo;Garret is Right&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We did not modify the budget.  We said that we would not impose the tax on children's shoes and clothes but we pointed to where we would raise the alternative revenue.  This was spelled out clearly, unlike the situation in respect of the £45 million concession in respect of PRSI.  Our budget was put intact to the people.  We increased our vote but we had even a more significant impact on that election campaign.  We forced Fianna Fáil &mdash; against, I suspect, the wishes of their leader &mdash; to admit that our approach was correct and that they would abide by the thrust of our proposals in relation to borrowing deficit and so on.  I suspect that that line was forced on the Taoiseach by the Minister for Education and the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  At various press conferences held prior to the election it was obvious that a prominent part was being played by the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>A deal, which according to Deputy Colley was not discussed by the Fianna Fáil Front Bench, was drawn up between the Taoiseach and Deputy Gregory on the basis of Deputy Gregory voting for Deputy Haughey on his nomination as Taoiseach.  My friends of The Workers' Party then got themselves into a lather of sweat when they found they had been outmanouevred, despite all their backroom boys, their Ard Comhairle and their 200 per cent increase in membership, by an Independent.  They had to join the happy throng through the lobby in the hope that they might pick some of the crumbs from the rich man's table.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party trotted in like tame dogs hoping for a few crumbs from the rich man's table and so Deputy Haughey became Taoiseach. We come now to the intriguing part in all this, to the man who had played such a prominent part in Fianna Fáil's economic strategy for the previous six to eight months and who had taken such a prominent part in drawing that party's economic programme for the election.  I refer to one who appeared so often in front of <Col N="689" /> the television cameras as the financial guru of the party and who, having been restored to the Front Bench is now Minister for Education.  Apparently the Taoiseach considered that there had been enough of that kind of nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He was made not the Minister for Finance but Minister for Education and so we are back once more at the old unhappy phrase of &ldquo;spend all&rdquo; and it does not matter where the money comes from.  The tragedy about this is that both Ministers, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy O'Donoghue, were correct when they saw that the public did appreciate what we have been trying to do. More importantly they saw that unless the strategy we had evolved was followed through, the result for the country would be larger deficits, more borrowing, increased inflation, fewer jobs with the inevitable consequence of having to finance that policy not just this year or next year but for decades to come.</P>
      <P>The present Government then introduced a budget and, reasonably enough, the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, said he had to introduce that budget in a hurry.  That budget was introduced on 25 March.  Now the civil servants in the Department of Finance naturally thought that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Taoiseach actually meant what they said during the election and they could go ahead on the basis of what was said and prepare a budget on that basis.  Of course, once the pressure mounted on the Cabinet from their own back benches, from Deputy Gregory, from Sinn Féin The Workers Party, and God knows who else outside this House, they bent once more and brought in this Finance Bill which bears very little relation to the budget they introduced in March.  The variation is something which has never been experienced so far in this country and I would think it is something which has never obtained in any other country either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Stage of this Finance Bill <Col N="690" /> will be passed tonight.  Deputy Gallagher has said they have a long list of amendments drafted and I think it is reasonable to assume that these amendments probably formed the basis of whatever discussions took place yesterday and today.  I want the Minister to say tonight when he rises to reply to this debate precisely what amendments he proposes to introduce on Committee Stage and precisely what further changes he envisages on Committee Stage.  What sections does he intend to change?  What amendments does he intend making?  I also want to know whether he proposes to accept any of those amendments which The Workers' Party showed him yesterday and today. Such an important measure as this should be debated and agreed on in this House and not elsewhere.  I shall leave it at that. The Minister has assured me he has not dealt with The Workers' Party and, as I said earlier on, if he has not made a deal he is wise because they will vote for him anyway.  They are afraid of the people and they will trot dutifully into the division lobby to make sure they do not have to face the public again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This scenario I have been painting has been quite clearly interpreted by the former Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley.  He gave an interview to a newspaper and to Radio Éireann the Sunday after the by-election. He did not want to rock the Fianna Fáil boat and so he kept his mouth shut until after the by-election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed that was the content of his interview with both the newspaper and on radio.  Now Deputy Colley cannot have it both ways.  He and whatever friends he has in the Fianna Fáil Party should make up their minds.  Either they show that they do not approve of low standards in high places or they shut up.  They should not curry favour with sections of the Fianna Fáil Party who <Col N="691" /> disapprove of their present leader or seek publicity for themselves and, at the same time, continue to support that of which they disapprove.  The only result of this is to give a hollow ring to their protestations.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, if the Ministers, Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy O'Malley had any courage, if they believed what they were saying during the general election, then they should now resign from the Government.  That would be the correct position for them to adopt.  Deputy Colley has portrayed himself vehemently and articulately on two occasions recently and on one occasion earlier on as the defender of purity in Irish public life.  He should now put his feet where his mouth is but I have no faith in that happening at all.  If he is as pure as he likes to portray himself he has an obligation to those friends of his on the backbenches of Fianna Fáil and to those many supporters in the party outside this House &mdash; it is a dwindling body of supporters, very obviously dwindling because the more changes that are made and the more variations that occur demonstrate clearly how the Government are being pushed around by every small group, every faction, every Independent, and by The Workers' Party &mdash; to demonstrate clearly his purity.  The patently dwindling support to which I have referred will be clearly shown in any general election this Government care to call.</P>
      <P>Protestations of virtue from Deputy Colley ring a little hollow.  Deputy Colley was the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance who oversaw the implementation of the famous 1977 manifesto from which many of our present problems flow.  More significantly, he was Tánaiste of a Government who in November 1980 fought a by-election in Donegal where more strokes were pulled and more promises made than even in Dublin West last month.  To pretend that he was not party to them or did not approve of them or has a post-disapproval now is less than honest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It boomeranged, as Deputy L'Estrange says.  After doubling with The Workers' Party &mdash; I cannot get the name Sinn Féin out of my mind &mdash; of course it is a fact that Deputy Liam Skelly is in this House and you can double your votes as often as you like as long as we win the seats.  That is the reality of politics. As I say, Deputy Colley is equally responsible with all those members of Fianna Fáil who were members of Fianna Fáil Governments from 1977 until last June and again for the last three months but he is more responsible than some of the others because he was a member of the Government whose leader sorted out what was wrong with the economy and then refused to do anything about it between January 1980 and the 1981 General Election.  The result of their doing nothing about it was the losing of a 20-seat majority in this House, unheard of in politics in this country.  That shows what the people thought about what they were doing and I know the people are thinking precisely the same at this moment.  Deputy Colley did not open his mouth either about Knock Airport &mdash; and he was a Minister of the Government &mdash; nor about the famous Talbot deal <Col N="693" /> about which we heard this morning nor about the Gregory deal &mdash; at least he did but after the by-election when he was out of office &mdash; nor about the Clondalkin Paper Mills or all the other strokes which took place when he was a member of the Government.  Deputy George Colley is a nice man.  In many of the portfolios he occupied he was a good Minister.  There is no questioning his patriotism, but he cannot, nor should he attempt to, criticise others for what he was part of himself.</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill continues on the same spendthrift, low standards that Deputy Colley was objecting to.  They were giving in to any pressures, and the changes that were made between the budget and the Finance Bill are obviously a result of pressures by those various groups.  The Minister denies, and I repeat his denial to put it on the record of the House again, that there is any deal between The Workers' Party and the Government about amendments that may be accepted in the next fortnight on this Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to repeat the denial that any deal was done because we want that in the next fortnight and we want to see the Minister's attitude to that too.  The reality will then be proved that Fianna Fáil are not the Government.  For the first month Deputy Gregory was the Government and from now on until the by-election no doubt we will have The Workers' Party in government.  They will tell the Government what to do, they will call the shots.  The extraordinary thing about this Bill &mdash; again I cannot understand the attitude of The Workers' Party to it &mdash; is that any changes that have been made in it since the budget have been to help the well off&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and not the less well off about whom The Workers Party are weeping tears here tonight.  Regarding the changes in company cars, that perhaps <Col N="694" /> was too severe and I think they were right, but the less well off do not have company cars.  I do not know if The Workers' Party provide them but most people on the dole do not have company cars.  The change in capital gains tax I will be interested to hear when we come to that in the Bill.  Deputy Gallagher was eloquent about that change as he was in defending the rights of the workers here tonight and the restoration of the tax relief on money borrowed.  I cannot see how that would help those who are less well off.  They do not normally have overdrafts and perhaps they do not have mortgages either and are in rented accommodation.  Deputy Gallagher says that the changes in the Finance Bill are to their benefit.  Even the changes since the budget in the PRSI hardly help the lower level of taxpayers because it is given as an allowance.  That means it is worth 60p to anybody in the 60 per cent bracket and only 25p to anyone in the 25 per cent bracket.  Yet The Workers' Party these defenders of the underprivileged, will troop into the Fianna Fáil lobbies and vote for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside the absolutely inadequate explanation of the Minister as to where he is to get the money for the £45 million &mdash; forget about it, we will get it from savings or from increased taxation &mdash; they will vote for the concession that helps the better off PAYE payers against the worse off PAYE payers and they will come along in a month's time and vote for the taxation necessary to pay for it.  If that is consistency and what their Ard Comhairle are telling them, they should seek other advice.  I do not think that is very consistent policy.  The Minister says that he will get this £45 million that he referred to either by cuts, public expenditure or increased taxation.  I must express grave doubts about the willingness of any Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance to cut public expenditure because during their four years in office from 1977 to 1981 their policy was the absolute reverse and they increased public expenditure.  I do not think that leopard will change his spots now.  They boasted about the policy of Deputy Martin O'Donoghue to increase the numbers <Col N="695" /> employed in the public sector and to increase the level of public sector spending, now at 60 per cent, one of the highest in the world.  I do not have any faith in the nerve of Fianna Fáil to cut that.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about public sector pay.  We have all had a go in recent years at the increase in public sector pay but it is only fair to say that individual civil servants have not received pay increases which are out of line with what has been paid in the private sector. What has happened is that the number of people employed in the public sector has grown because of Fianna Fáil policies to an extent which is absolutely unwarranted for a country of this size.  Every person employed in the public sector must to a large extent be carried by taxation gathered from those outside the public sector.</P>
    <P>If policies are adopted which interfere with industry, the creation of jobs and the willingness of people to invest and if at the same time the public sector is expanded, then the country is on the road to disaster.  I do not see any change in Fianna Fáil policy in this regard or any willingness on their part to cut back on the cost of running the country.  Neither do I see any willingness on their part to do anything to help the creation or the preservation of the jobs which are so necessary outside the public sector.  The reverse is the case.  The policies in this Finance Bill, enunciated by the Minister in his budget speech and originally part of the Fianna Fáil programme in the general election, will discourage investment and close businesses.</P>
    <P>It is unreal in a time of recession to expect firms not only to pay this year whatever corporation profits tax they will owe for next year but also to impose VAT on imports at the point of entry.  This will have the effect of putting into the hands of the liquidator many firms who are at present finding trading extremely difficult. The Minister's solution for this bite into their cash flow is to tell them to borrow, saying that he will arrange for the ICC, through the European Investment Bank, to assist them to raise the money.  What help is that to a firm who <Col N="696" /> are breaking even or making losses? What encouragement is to to them to stay in business when all the Minister is doing is increasing their losses by asking them to pay interest on the money they borrow or wiping out their profits?  What person in the private sector, to which we continually pay lip service, will invest in those circumstances?  The cash needed to run businesses is being drained away.</P>
    <P>Money is to be borrowed from banks who are at the same time facing an increased levy, thus diminishing the pool of resources they have to lend to anybody considering investing.  Perhaps it is too strong to say that this is a receipe for disaster but it is certainly not the action of a Government or a Minister genuinely concerned with creating jobs and encouraging investment.  This is the action of somebody who wants to blunder through as best he can for this year only and let tomorrow look after itself.  As a result of the attitude of this Government and this Minister, we are building up problems for 1983 and 1984 which would test even the loyalty of The Workers' Party to vote for Fianna Fáil.  They want Fianna Fáil to stay in office for another five years so that they can keep twisting their tails and making them jump through their hoops. They certainly do not want us returned to office.</P>

He said it would be substantially exceeded in the third quarter but he went on to say that of course the final quarter would take care of everything because the receipts would flow into the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the <Col N="697" /> Minister believes that.  I am certain that those who are advising him do not believe it and I presume some of the amounts he has included in his calculations are to accrue from the down payments of VAT at the point of entry and the bringing forward of corporation profits tax from next year.  The Minister should have a chat with the Revenue Commissioners and they will tell him from how many firms it will be possible to obtain this year corporation profits tax due in 1983.  They will tell him how much his cash flow will be improved for the last quarter of this year from that source.  Does the Minister not listen?  Does he not talk to industrialists? Does he not hear the views of the Confederation of Irish Industry or the Federated Union of Employers?  Does he not understand that practically every employer in the private sector is short of funds at present, is overdrawn to the hilt, is terrified of the inflationary effects of what is happening and, more than that is terrified of this Government staying in office?  Nobody whether an employee, a public sector worker or employer has any faith in this Government as presently constituted to take hard decisions and tackle the problems of the economy so that we can all have a share of the cake which the Workers' Party dish out without any thought as to how it should be made.</P>
      <P>If the Government continue on the road they are going, they will damage their own party and that does not worry me.  What worries me is that they will damage people's faith in democratic Government and that they will damage the economy to such an extent that their children may be unemployed.  The majority of us in the House went to secondary school and left knowing we would get a job.  The way the Government are managing our affairs, our children have no such guarantee.  They are wrecking the economy and the future for young people.  For God's sake let them get out and go to the country before they do any more damage.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank all Deputies who <Col N="698" /> contributed to the debate.  As I said at the outset of the debate, the measures continued in the Bill were complex and incorporated a number of changes in the taxation code.  The comments made by Members were wide and varied and I cannot hope in the time available to me to answer all of them.  I have taken careful note of all that has been said during the course of the debate and shall reply to the major issues raised.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with a few points made by Deputies Quinn and Barry.  One of the points made by Deputy Barry was that he wanted me to say now what amendments I will be introducing to the Bill.  The simple answer to that at this stage, as anyone involved or closely associated with finance will know, is that it is not possible to say what amendments will be made.  Deputy Bruton knows that well.  I have been consulted by officials in the Department to the effect that there are various recommendations they will be making to me regarding possible amendments, mainly for technical reasons.  That is normal in any Finance Bill.  It was referred to on a few ocassions and Deputy De Rossa has already replied to it.  I confirm that.  The only real contact that one has had in relation to possible amendment on this Bill has been by Deputy Bruton who has been in correspondence with me and has had some contact with officials in the Department. I want to make that position quite clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. If the Deputy does not like the facts I am sorry.  I should like to refer to a point made by Deputy Quinn which was the extension of the youth employment levy to farmers and the self-employed.  Farmers and the self-employed are already provided for under existing legislation in regard to the collection of the levy which was passed by this House under the Coalition Government last December. Farmers pay their contribution through the health contribution scheme and the <Col N="699" /> self-employed through the income tax system.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the debate, Deputy Bruton put forward a motion opposing the Second Stage on a number of grounds.  These were, first, that the Bill departs significantly from the terms of the budget; secondly, PRSI concessions were unfairly distributed; thirdly, some tax measures will add to our economic difficulties and, fourthly, no provision is made for long-term reform of the income tax system.  During the course of the discussion, I intend to refute, point by point, the arguments put forward by him.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill does not depart significantly from the terms of the budget. The only major difference relates to the special PRSI allowance which has already been approved by Dáil Éireann and is simply confirmed in the Bill.  The other changes <i>vis-á-vis</i> the budget have a total cost of only £2½ million.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is so concerned about additional costs, it is hardly logical that he should seek a higher exemption from development land tax than the £15,000 which is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nonsense for Deputy Bruton and others to talk about changes in budgets. We know that the budget introduced on 27 January was significantly changed as we went into the general election.  Following the election, it was again changed substantially in discussions with various groups in the House.  The extent of those changes was much more significant than what is suggested in these measures which amount to £2½ million.  The Deputy demanded that I should let the House <Col N="700" /> know, when replying to the debate, what the net cost for 1983 would be of the changes now being made <i>vis-á-vis</i> the budget proposals.  The full year cost will probably be in the region of £10 million to £15 million.  I cannot be more precise than that.  I must make it clear that the bulk of this cost arises in relation to two major changes and these are the benefit in kind provisions relating to the private use of company cars and the proposals for mortgage interest relief.  Even with the changes I have made, the revised provision for the benefit in kind will still give a higher yield than the scheme put forward by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Changes in the mortgage interest relief provisions have been necessary, as I pointed out, for technical administrative reasons.  The Revenue Commissioners advised me that they were not in a position to implement the proposals as originally announced.  These proposals would have involved three separate and unrelated restrictions.  There would have been a limit of £4,800 on the old interest qualifying for relief, a limit of £35,000 on the capital sum in respect of which new interest was to be relieved and a maximum rate of 35 per cent on which relief was to be given on the new interest.</P>
    <P>It was not found possible to devise a satisfactory method of incorporating these unrelated restrictions in certificates of tax-free allowances for PAYE purposes. The only alternative would have been to apply the restrictions by way of review at the end of the year.  Apart from the huge increases in staff required to review up to 230,000 PAYE cases where interest relief is claimed, this would have caused inconvenience and, in some instances, hardship to the taxpayers concerned in collecting under-deductions of income-tax.  However, I shall be looking further at this relief at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies Desmond and Taylor suggested that the relief might be phased out over a period of years.  I believe this suggestion has some merit.  I was accused by Deputy Bruton of showing a lamentable lack of imagination because I did not exempt low-paid workers entirely from the PRSI increases.  These increases were <Col N="701" /> proposed originally by the previous Government; that should not be forgotten by Deputies opposite.  They include a 1 per cent levy on income to promote youth employment.  When this concept was originally floated there was mention of an exemption for those on low incomes &mdash; I may say &ldquo;mention&rdquo; at that time &mdash; but no such exemption was incorporated in the legislation brought forward last December by the Coalition Government for the implementation of this levy.  I wonder where was Deputy Bruton's imagination then?  While it is quite true that those with higher incomes will generally receive higher benefit from the PRSI tax allowances it must be borne in mind that these people are making a higher PRSI contribution and are paying more taxes.  I should say that the entire PRSI changes were introduced exactly as proposed by the Coalition Government. Now, when a major concession is given by our Government to ease the burden, I suggest the last people to complain are those in the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>The motion opposing the Second Reading rejects the Finance Bill because it does not provide for the reform of the income tax system.  The income tax changes which were announced in the budget, and were incorporated in this Bill, are carefully designed to achieve virtually the same effects for individual taxpayers generally as the tax credit proposals of January.  This can be clearly illustrated if we take a range of <Col N="702" /> individual taxpayers.  In the time available to me my ambition was to give the individual taxpayer the same treatment as was proposed by the Fine Gael and Labour budget.  This I have done.  It is wrong to suggest that the tax arrangements in the Bill offend against social justice while, at the same time, pressing the case for the tax credit proposals of 27 January last.  There is one difference and this relates to the family income supplement. This supplement was seen as a support to families where the breadwinner was in low income employment.  It was estimated to cost £4 million this year. It must be remembered that although this scheme was advertised widely, the response was very poor; approximately one-eighth only of those eligible applied for the £9.60 payment.  It created serious anomalies.  Because of the minimum income eligibility limit of £2,000, it would have led to a situation where a family with taxable earnings of £2,000 would have qualified for a subsidy of £500 but a family with taxable earnings of £1,900 would have been entitled to nothing. Also large sections of the community would have been ineligible for benefit &mdash; single persons, widows and widowers, one-parent families, the elderly, social welfare recipients, farmers under £40 valuation and all those whose taxable income for one reason or another fell below £2,000.  Furthermore, the £500 would have been available to a very wealthy taxpayer who, because of accelerated capital allowances and other business reliefs was able to show a taxable income of £2,000 only for a particular year.  In the event, the £4 million was set aside in the March budget for the child dependants of social welfare recipients so that the money is finding its way to the low income families.</P>
      <P>There will be no anomalies and I must suggest that this is a more equitable and effective way of distributing income than was the proposed family income supplement.</P>

      <P>The impression is now developing that the tax credits are <Col N="703" /> good <i>per se</i> and that the tax allowance system is totally inadequate.  Tax credits are equated with tax reform.  This is a dangerous assumption.  I must advise caution when discussing the merits of one system <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other.  There is no reason that tax credits should be inherently better than allowances.  There is one criterion only that really matters when measuring the effects of different systems, that is the impact on the individual taxpayer.  The particular structure of the tax system is secondary to the overriding consideration that all taxpayers must be treated in an equitable fashion. Equity means that those who have more should pay more.  Superficially the tax credit emerges as a more equitable system because it shows an equal distribution of reliefs irrespective of an individual's marginal rate of tax but its weakness is that it makes no adjustment for the fact that the taxpayer on a higher rate is paying more tax in the first instance and, consequently, has a claim to relatively high reliefs in certain circumstances.  This is a reality we cannot set aside in measuring the impact of tax changes.  If we ignore it we shall create new anomalies which will further annoy taxpayers.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence to suggest, as implied in the amending motion, that the new arrangements for value-added tax on imports and for the earlier payments of corporation profits tax will aggravate national economic difficulties.  The liquidity cost of these changes on business will not be severe.  The overall annual cost to business, in terms of liquidity cost, is not expected to exceed £10 million to £15 million, so that the adverse effects of the new system are being grossly exaggerated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>If it transpires that difficulties are experienced in individual cases as regards value-added tax then, as I said in my budget statement, I will examine the possibility of Industrial Credit Company assistance.  It should be remembered also that value-added tax on imports will have a strong, positive effect <Col N="704" /> and will give Irish products a boost <i>vis-à-vis</i> imports by removing the advantage which imports are seen to have over home-produced goods under the present system.  It will also eliminate considerable tax evasion.</P>
      <P>Surely these effects will do much good for the national economy?  The new arrangements for value-added-tax on imports and the bringing forward of the payments date of corporation profits tax will not worsen the budget situation in 1983 by using up revenue that otherwise would be available in that year, as alleged by Deputy J. Bruton.  This is a misconception, as any revenue brought forward from 1983 to 1982 will be matched by a similar advancement of revenue from 1984 to 1983.  This leads me to the assertion by Deputy J. Bruton, that, because of these two measures, we are facing an opening deficit for 1983 somewhere in the region of £1,100 million rather than the £800 million which would have resulted from their January budget proposals. This projected £300 million increase in the deficit is based on the Deputy's misconception of the effect in 1983 of value-added-tax on imports and the corporation profit tax measures and, is, therefore, incorrect.  Apart from this, as a former Minister for Finance, the Deputy is aware that any projections made at this time of the year for 1983 inevitably must be based on a wide range of assumptions which can very considerably. I might point out also that the March budget proposals will have a less severe effect on the economy than those of the January budget, so that the underlying state of the economy and, therefore, of the public finances will be better going into 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes also referred to the collection of VAT at the point of import and, particularly, the cost which he alleges this will involve for exporters.  The Deputy is apparently unaware of the special arrangements which are available under the VAT system for traders who are in a permanent net repayment position, that is traders who are continuously claiming back more VAT on their inputs from the Revenue Commissioners than <Col N="705" /> they are due to pay to revenue on their output.</P>
    <P>Companies exporting a large proportion of their output would generally be in this position.  They are allowed to account for VAT on a monthly rather than a two monthly basis and this facility will continue. Since provision is being made in the VAT on imports scheme for deferment of the payment of VAT to the fifteenth day of the month following the import these companies will effectively be able to repay the VAT around the same time as they are paying it so any liquidity cost involved for them will be minimised.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is clear from what I have said that the amendment in the name of Deputy John Bruton is totally negative. I would have expected a more realistic approach, especially from a former Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond underlined, with some vivid examples, the problems of cutting public expenditure.  He instanced the abolition of food subsidies, reductions in CIE services, the imposition of fees for education and cuts in overtime in the public sector as the kind of actions that would be required to achieve effective results.  He is quite right in emphasising that the cutting of expenditure, no matter on how marginal a scale, is a painful exercise.  It inevitably requires the curtailment or the ending of services which we take for granted, as our entitlement. If we are not prepared to accept more taxation then reductions in services and much higher fees for services in the only alternative.  I agree with the Deputy that our dilemma is that, while people genuinely want reductions in income tax and PRSI, they will not accept the logical consequences of such reductions.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested alternative taxes which he estimated would yield £200 million or more.  I agree with him that we must widen the tax base and find new sources of taxation.  I must at the same time dispute his estimate of £200 million from the sources which he has listed.  Quite frankly, this is a highly inflated figure.  We are only misleading ourselves in assuming that there are large untapped sources of revenue which can <Col N="706" /> allow us to reduce income tax and sustain the high level of public expenditure to which we have become accustomed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes took up reference, as well as other speakers tonight, in my opening statement to the quarterly pattern of the current budget deficit this year and implied that I was preparing the ground for revealing significant excesses on the targets set in the budget.  This is not so.  The purpose of my reference was simply to point out that the quarterly pattern this year will be rather different from previous years because of the high concentration of new revenues in the later months.  This pattern would be obvious to anybody who took the time to analyse the budget proposals in detail.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asserted that the March budget targets were never attainable and that they will not be met in view of subsequent decisions on expenditure and revenue.  I reject this totally.  The targets set in the March budget are realistic and the Government are firmly committed to achieving them.  As I have already emphasised, the only significant change which has been made since then is the £45 million income tax concession for PRSI contributions.  The cost of this concession will be recouped by expenditure cuts and, if necessary, additional tax measures.</P>

      <P>The other changes in the budget provisions are relatively minor in terms of their impact on the current budget deficit.  Deputy G. Mitchell this morning castigated the Government because no specific deadline was being set for the elimination of the current budget deficit.  He also, by some feat of mathematical juggling, arrived at the fanciful conclusion that we might have been heading for a deficit of £2,000 million this year but for the intervention of the Coalition Government.  The Government's commitment to the gradual reduction and elimination of the deficit has been clearly and unequivocally emphasised on a number of occasions.  The action taken in the budget is totally consistent with this commitment.  We are <Col N="707" /> bringing the deficit down from £802 million in 1981 to a target of £679 million this year.  In terms of GNP the deficit is being reduced from 7.9 per cent to 5.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell and his colleagues, who are anxious to bring down the budget deficit, should follow through the logic of their conviction and propose specific measures which will achieve this result. While, on the one hand, they are advocating financial prudence they see no inconsistency, apparently, in proposing at the same time specific increases in expenditure and reductions in taxation. We cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>I said that the gradual reduction and elimination of the budget deficit has been clearly and unequivocally emphasised on a number of occasions by myself and other members of the Government.  Deputy Bruton raised some questions in relation to tax reliefs for approved profit sharing schemes.  He was concerned that the relief might be used as a vehicle for tax avoidance by limiting a particular scheme to directors and higher paid executives.  There is always the risk that reliefs of this type will be used in schemes of tax avoidance. I have tried to guard against the more obvious abuses.  Indeed, this is one of the reasons why the provisions are so long and complex.  A balance has to be struck between attempting to eliminate all possibility of abuse and not restricting the relief in such a manner that would be of no benefit at all.  I shall be monitoring the relief very closely and, if there is any avoidance with evidence of abuse, I will act quickly to defeat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the specific points raised by Deputy Bruton, the Third Schedule provides that one of the conditions for approval of the scheme is that it must be open to every full-time employee who has completed the qualifying period <Col N="708" /> of service and that all directors and employees must be eligible to participate on similar terms.  Another requirement is that shares may not be allowed to any individual who has an interest of more than 15 per cent in the company, where it is a close company.  The relief is not confined to companies whose shares are quoted on a recognised stock exchange, which is a point made by Deputy Quinn tonight and others.  It is also available in respect of companies whose shares are not quoted, providing certain conditions are filled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>Deputy Bruton has also referred to the income tax relief for the elderly in respect of private tenancy rents.  He was concerned that some persons might be denied relief because they would not be able to furnish receipts for rent paid in the first half of this year.  On 27 January, the Deputy himself drew attention to this proposal and specifically advised those concerned to retain receipts for rent paid from that date.  The Revenue Commissioners will also be taking steps to ensure that those eligible are made aware of this relief and of the conditions attaching to it.  In administering the relief, full account will be taken of the possibility that, in some instances, a claimant may not be able to furnish receipts for all rent paid in the early months of 1982.  The rules for proving the payment of the rent by the production of receipts or otherwise will be set out in the regulations to be made under the section. These regulations will give the inspector of taxes sufficient discretion in the matter to enable him to take a flexible view, especially in the first year of the scheme, in cases where receipts are not forthcoming for all rent that was paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes alleged that the provision of £1.5 million in the budget would not be sufficient to meet the cost of the rescue package for farmers in severe financial difficulties, which will arise for payment this year.  The budget proposals of 27 January contained the provision of £4 million to meet the direct costs of the scheme which, at that time, were estimated <Col N="709" /> would arise this year.  It was necessary to revise this figure by the time I came to present my budget proposals on 25 March, in the light of such matters as a later operative date of 1 April rather than 1 January.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>This had a significant effect on the 1982 cost in the case of the ACC, because it was then necessary to provide for one rather than two gale days. In addition, the mechanics for payment of the direct grants had not been worked out at the time of the January budget and consequently the provisions made then were somewhat tentative.  In fact, it was some time after the March budget before the mechanics for payment were finally settled.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware, from press reports, that the response to the scheme has so far been slow and that, as a result, applications will be accepted, exceptionally, up to the end of June.  Only when all applications have been received and examined will a clear and reliable estimate of costs emerge.  I should emphasise that the revision of the 1982 cost estimate which took place between the January and March budgets has in no way affected the basic conditions of the scheme or lessened its atractiveness for farmers. The later starting date of 1 April will still leave farmers with a full three year benefit period under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooney stated that hardship is being created for farmers by the refusal of roll-over relief for sales of development land and he claimed that it was not the intention to treat farmers in this way. If he reads the January budget speech he will, in fact, see that this exact proposal was contained in the Coalition budget. The reason for the provision is that if roll-over relief were allowed to continue for sales of development land, it would undermine the new tax arrangements which are designed to ensure that large windfall gains on the sale of development lands are properly taxed.  In no way will hardship arise because if a farmer disposes of development land, the availability <Col N="710" /> of indexation relief for the agricultural value of the land will, of itself, be sufficient to enable him to purchase a farm of equal agricultural value in the vast majority of cases.  In addition, where the farm sold has been held for more than one year, he will still retain, after tax, at least 50 per cent of the gain on the development land property.  I should like to mention that if a farmer sells sites for development purposes for a total price not exceeding £15,000 in any one tax year, roll-over relief will be available to him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton suggested that the size of the tax deduction to be given in respect of increases in employment be increased from £10 to £20 per week.  I might remind the Deputy that in the scheme as originally proposed by himself the deduction was to have been £500 a year.  For ease of administration, this has been converted to a weekly deduction of £10 so that the maximum annual deduction available per job will be £520.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that the provisions are in line with the scheme as originally outlined by him as Minister.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also expressed the view that provisions for eligibility under the scheme might be regarded as restrictive. I can assure him that the provisions are designed as simply as possible so as to benefit the generality of companies which provide increased employment.  I would like to clarify, in particular, the position of firms which do not have profits.  The situation is that a deduction will be treated, for the purposes of corporation tax, as a trading expense and so will be available not only as a deduction against profits, but will create or augment losses. This treatment ensures that it will be of maximum benefit to firms and that if the particular operation is not immediately profitable but is creating employment, then the deduction will be available and will, in effect, be carried forward and set off against future taxable profits.  In addition, it will be available for purposes of group relief.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked that VAT on lampshades be reduced from 30 per cent to 18 per cent as part of the reduction for furniture and furnishings.  The dilemma facing any Minister for Finance, as <Col N="711" /> Deputy Bruton knows well, in making changes of this kind is where to draw the line between the items to be reduced and those to be left unchanged.  No matter where the line is drawn, there will inevitably be some items on the wrong side of the line which are in many ways comparable with those which have been reduced.  The definition of furniture and furnishings which has been made for the purpose of this reduction has been quite generous, but it was never the intention to reduce the rate of VAT on all items used in the home.  While I sympathise with the case made by Deputy Bruton, I am not prepared to widen the scope of the concession further.</P>
    <P>The opinion has been expressed by Deputy Cooney that the 20 per cent excise duty on bets placed off course is too high and that a reduction would, in fact, increase revenue from this tax. While I agree that a 20 per cent tax on bets is quite high, I would not accept that a reduction would lead to an overall increase in revenue.  Since the duty was set at this rate in 1975, there has been a constant increase in the yield and the revenue is still buoyant from this source. A reduction in the tax would reduce the incentive to evade, but it would certainly not eliminate evasion.  In this regard, I would say that the Revenue Commissioners are active in tackling evasion.  This is a difficult area to control.  I have made provision in this Bill for an increased level of penalties, along with a reduction in the power of the courts to mitigate the penalty. These changes will be of considerable assistance in discouraging evasion. I should also say that combating evasion in this area, as in other areas, is made easier by co-operation from the public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond suggested that higher rates of VAT should be applied to luxury goods bought dominantly by the higher income groups and to goods with a high import content.  While I would agree with the objectives of this proposal, we must remember that VAT is a general sales tax on a wide range of goods and services.  If it is to be administered successfully by the thousands of traders throughout the country it must be kept as <Col N="712" /> simple as possible.  The present system is already difficult enough to implement and it would not be desirable to add to the number of rates of VAT or to charge different rates of VAT on goods in the same general category.  However, I will certainly keep the Deputy's suggestion in mind in future review of the VAT system.</P>
    <P>Tax evasion was mentioned by Deputy Mitchell this morning and the need to take more effective counter measures.  I totally agree with him that we must do more.  But having said this I want to point out that in the Bill now before the House we are making some significant steps forward. Penalties are being increased and more exacting requirements in relation to back duty settlements are being imposed.  Also I want to give due recognition to the Revenue Commissioners who have made a big breakthrough in the past few years in countering evasion. They would be the first to admit that much more needs to be done.  The Commission on Taxation will be giving special consideration to the issue of tax evasion and tax avoidance and I will look forward to their recommendations.  The imposition of VAT on imports would certainly help to curtail VAT evasion.  Apart from the loss of revenue to the Exchequer, both evasion and avoidance do harm in that they increase the burden of tax for other taxpayers.  In this context I treat evasion and avoidance as one problem. While tax avoidance is within the law it is far too often a cynical manipulation of the law and some practices which are patently artificial involve a huge cost to the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone. These practices are designed by experts who deliberately set out to break the spirit while observing the letter of the law.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the Commission on Taxation and have expressed the hope that the Government will implement their recommendations. I am looking forward to receiving the first report of the commission in the immediate future and I expect that it will be published without delay.  In advance of seeing and considering the recommendations I cannot give a commitment that these recommendations will be implemented <Col N="713" /> and I know that Deputies would not look for such a commitment.  I can assure the House that the report will be carefully studied and I expect that it will have a major influence on future taxation policy.  The report is, I understand, a very detailed and complex document and it would be unwise to give an overnight verdict on its recommendations.  It will require very careful examination.  Incidentally, I understand that the first report will be concerned with direct taxation. The commission are continuing their work and they will be reporting in due course on other aspects of taxation including indirect taxation.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the commission for the effort they have made and the time they have devoted to this very important task.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney alleges that the Finance Bill does not provide or even start to provide for any reform of the taxation system.  I categorically reject this.  In the field of capital taxation, for example, the Bill contains provision for taxing short-term gains at a much higher rate than gains which accrue over a longer period, and thereby focuses the impact of the tax directly on speculative transactions. There is a totally new package of arrangements imposing a special capital gains tax on disposals of development land while the new aggregation basis for capital acquisitions tax both limits tax avoidance and contributes significantly towards tax equity.  There are various income tax changes such as the benefits in kind in respect of cars which also are obvious reforms and have been generally seen as such.  In fact for the most part the Finance Bill contains changes which were proposed last January by a Government of which Deputy Cooney was a member. These changes were at that time heralded as major reforms of the tax system.  I wonder what has happened them since?</P>
    <P>I would now like to return again to the amendment tabled in the name of Deputy Bruton.  If this amendment, which incidentally is a most unusual procedure, were carried it is well that Deputies should be fully aware of the consequences. It would mean that the Finance <Col N="714" /> Bill would lapse.  The various proposals in the budget would cease to have effect, some immediately and some at an early date and there would be a consequent loss of tax this year of more than £300 million.</P>

      <P>Our problems would not be confined solely to a massive increase in the deficit which in turn would lead to a totally unacceptable increase in borrowing.  There would be chaotic administrative problems for the Revenue Commissioners.  They would be required to revert to the income tax allowances and bands that applied for the tax year 1981-82 and Deputies well realise what impossible problems this would generate. The special PRSI tax allowance would lapse after a period of four months.  No doubt the Opposition will assert that all this confusion is avoidable and that we can easily change course by taking on board the proposals which were put forward by them last January.  Apart from the fact that the mathematics of such a change would not work out in our favour <Col N="715" /> there would simply be no sense now in trying to substitute VAT on clothing and footwear and reducing the subsidies on basic foods to compensate for VAT on imports.  These alternatives have already been rejected and the community at large would react against any attempts to reinstate them and we would find that out quickly if the people had such an opportunity.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt the House will reject this amendment.  Again I want to emphasise the positive programme which is legislated for in this Bill.  Of its very nature a Finance Bill has some unwelcome provisions because it is concerned with changes in taxation and it is inevitable, especially in the present economic and financial climate, that it must impose new taxes.  The changes in the present Bill pave the way for a fair distribution of taxation and it is the Government's stated intention to build on this and to achieve a much more equitable system of taxation than we have at present.</P>

Might I remind all Deputies, particularly the Members of Fine Gael and Labour, of the major changes in this Bill and in our budget as against the budget defeated by the Dáil on 27 January and by the people in the general election.  In our budget, they are VAT at the point of entry and bringing forward payments of corporation tax.  Surely they will have an impact and will cause some problems?  But all those matters can be resolved.  The alternative as proposed on 27 January was that we would have VAT on footwear and clothing, a reduction in food subsidies, and tax on social welfare benefits.</P>

When will he make the announcement of his decision in regard to raising the £45 million necessary to pay for the concessions on PRSI and still keep to the budget deficit as set out for this year, bearing in mind that this money must be raised before the end of the year if the targets he set are to be adhered to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already referred to that in my concluding remarks and I will repeat what I said on a number of occasions.  The Government made it quite clear that the £45 million PRSI concessions to the PAYE sector would be made good either by expenditure savings or additional taxation.  I said at that time that the Government had undertaken, in addition to what was in operation by our predecessors, a complete expenditure review in every Department and to report to Finance and the Government by the end of May.  Those reports are due about now, and most of them are in.  When the Government have an opportunity to examine them it will be clear what expenditure savings can be made and then the situation regarding the additional taxation required will be known.  Then the Deputy and the House will be made aware of the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  It was one of the questions I had on today's Order Paper and I was totally dissatisfied with the answer given by the Minister.  I asked the Minister for the Environment if he would consider withdrawing the memorandum dated 21 April which was issued to local authorities in relation to the procedure to be followed with regard to the building of local authority houses because of the unnecessary delays that would be caused as a result of the implementation of the memorandum.</P>
      <P>In his reply the Minister stated he had no intention of withdrawing the memorandum. He stated he had examined it and approved it before it was issued to the local authorities.  I regret that very much.  He said he had no objection from any local authority in regard to the memorandum. The local authority of which I am a member wrote to the Minister objecting to some of the aspects of it, matters which we felt would retard and delay unnecessarily our housing programme. In the course of a letter I sent to the Minister I referred to parts of the memorandum.  The first matter I find objectionable in that memorandum is the fact that the Department must be consulted about the acquisition of all sites. For instance, a family living in a remote are and earning their living from agriculture and who are in need of proper housing must have an application for the acquisition of a site on their behalf approved by the Department.  Such a family would not have any option but to continue to live in a rural area and adjacent to their farm.  The decision to insist on consultation with the Department before the acquisition of sites is agreed is a delaying tactic.  We have never experienced that before at local authority level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I view this directive as a vote of no confidence in local authorities and their staff.  We are all aware that the staff and <Col N="724" /> members of local authorities are responsible people who spend the money allocated by the Department in a responsible manner.  I have been a member of a local authority for seven years and my complaint has always been that we do not get sufficient money for housing and not that that money is spent inefficiently by officials. If local authorities are obliged to comply with this memorandum it may lead to a delay of between 12 and 18 months in regard to the acquisition of sites.  We must bear in mind that after sites are acquired, assuming approval is obtained from the Department, permission must be obtained from the Department to accept a tender to build a house. This is another erosion of the powers of local authorities.  I am surprised that the Minister of State, who is a member of a local authority, approved of that directive. For too long and too often the powers of local authorities have been eroded. They have been treated with contempt by the Department of the Environment. We are all aware that it can take between two years and five years for some schemes sent by local authorities to be approved by the Department.  Do we have any guarantee that a request from a local authority to the Department to acquire a site for a dwelling will not be held up for two or three years?</P>
    <P>When we reach the tender stage sanction must also be obtained from the Department.  Very often contractors submit tenders based on the assumption that, if they are successful, they will be given the go ahead within two or three months. However, after the tender is submitted to the Department and the inspector is consulted it can take between 12 months and two years before the tender is approved.  By that time the contractor may not be prepared to build the house for the price he tendered and, in some cases, the people for whom the house was intended may have died or left the district mainly due to the fact that they had to live in diabolical conditions for some years.  The memorandum amounts to a complete disregard for local authorities, and their staff.  It amounts to an indication by the Department that they <Col N="725" /> are not competent to handle, allocate or utilise the money allocated for housing.</P>
    <P>As a result of the action of a former Minister for Local Government, Mr. Tully, a lot of red tape was done away with and now local authorities can acquire sites, advertise and build anything up to 60 houses without sanction. All local authorities welcomed that move because it cancelled delays and committed local authorities to build houses for those who are living in deplorable conditions. We are all aware of the report which assessed housing needs up to 1985, published in 1980.  According to that report we need to build three times the number of houses we are building at present to cope with the expected demand. We have to cater for a fast growing population and bear in mind that people are getting married at a younger age.  Due to the poor economic climate that exists and the appalling unemployment situation more people depend on local authorities to provide houses for them.  More local authority houses will have to be provided in the future.  The Minister should be ensuring that local authorities are given additional finance to enable local authorities to build more houses rather than putting a barrier in their way and preventing proper development.  The Department are delaying the process.</P>
    <P>This is a delaying tactic by the Government and an effort to find a convenient excuse not to give local authorities the money they need for housing.  Rural areas are being hit by this directive but sites are being acquired in urban areas and sewerage schemes carried out.  It really hits at rural counties.  It is one of the ways the present Government have for avoiding channelling money to those local authorities and channelling it instead into the city of Dublin to meet the requirements of the Gregory deal.  I will be delighted if the Minister can tell me that is not the situation and that he and his Department are prepared to allow the normal procedure which existed for the last five years to continue with regard to the building of individual rural houses or of up to 30 houses without consultation with the Department.  These <Col N="726" /> houses could fit into the programme drawn up by the local authority provided they stayed within the financial allocation by the Department of the Environment. It appears that the intention of the Department is to stick rigidly to their guidelines.  This directive as it now stands is detrimental to the building of local authority housing in rural areas.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the ordinary people living in rural areas are not prevented from having as good a home as those who live in Dublin.</P>

We are told there is devolved housing when in fact proposals have to be submitted for unit costing.  This directive which was issued to local authorities says that before purchasing land an inspector from the Department would have to come down and see that what you are doing will not involve the local authority or the Department in increased costs.  It is ludicrous to say that.  The officials of the local authority are perfectly capable of doing that.  I wish to lend my support to the case being made for the withdrawal of that directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>All the memorandum did was to spell out the considerations set out in earlier circulars to guide county councils in selecting sites. Once they comply with these requirements they can go ahead on their own responsibility and acquire the land to build houses.  The Department's circular about capital allocation made it clear that there were no restrictions on proceeding with isolated rural cottages on the understanding that the money to finance them would be provided.  There has been no change in the devolution procedures.  A local authority can, as in the past, acquire sites for schemes of up to 60 houses and plan them without referring their proposals to the Department.  All that is necessary is that the sites and the plans should be discussed and agreed between the local authority's engineer or architect and my Department's local inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> Deputy Allen also asked a question. The memoranda were incorporated in a single document for the convenience of local authorities, their officers and their consultants.  That directive was also issued by the Coalition Government during their term in office.  There never has been any question of reducing the acceptable standards of local authority housing and there is no suggestion of reverting to low cost housing.  I should like to emphasise that.  The taxpayers must meet the bill for the construction of local authority housing.  No responsible Government could tolerate a situation in which the Department's guidelines are ignored.  We cannot have a situation where architects, for their self-glorification, prescribe mahogany doors and windows and fitted kitchens to a standard to compare with luxury houses costing over £60,000.  There has to be a limit on the taxpayers' money.  No Government could agree to pay 100 per cent subsidy.  It would be quite wrong that young couples who have to skimp and save to buy their own houses should be provided with more inferior fittings than couples who are better off but who lack initiative and depend on local authority housing.  I sympathise with people who depend on the local authority to house them but at the same time I accept that it would be economically shortsighted for local authorities to cut back on minimum acceptable standards of planning construction and environment for local authority housing. There is no intention of doing this.</P>
    <P>I want to set standards for local authority housing and to see that there is value for money.  No local authority has complained to me about this.  The only complaints I get is that there is not enough money available, but there is a limit to the purse available to me.  We must ensure that all the money being spent on local authority housing at present is not <Col N="728" /> being needlessly wasted on bad land, bad lay-outs and extravagent and unnecessary design.  I hope Deputy Naughten and Deputy Allen do not want to bleed millions of pounds more from the taxpayers to provide unnecessary luxuries for local authority housing.  This circular laid down a set of standards for the guidance of the local authorities because I had been criticised for allowing houses to be built which had fancy brickwork and so on.  Some people even said that the standard of local authority houses was too high.  That is not my view.  I want to see houses built to a good standard but I must see that the money is spent well and I want to cut out luxury housing.  The guidelines set down by me are uniform and I wish to see them applied across the country and that everyone gets good value for money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said.  I am extremely anxious that the local authority and the Department of the Environment would get the maximum number of houses built with the amount of money available.  I want to ask one straight question.  In regard to guidelines laid down concerning seeking prior consent from the Department's inspector for the acquisition of local authority sites in a remote rural area, is that guideline drafted so that the local authority will have the authority to acquire the site, go ahead and advertise the house, so long as it is within the price guideline laid down by the Department?</P>

      <P>As the bulk of the land in question consists of a commonage held in undivided shares by the two persons mentioned these two sales are interdependent. In one case the price was agreed in March 1980 but in the other price agreement was not possible until January 1981. Delay in paying the purchase moneys is entirely due to title complexities which had to be dealt with by the parties' legal advisers before possession of the lands could be taken by my Department.  However, I understand that these difficulties have now been virtually resolved and, when fully disposed of, the sales will be closed and the purchase moneys paid over quickly.</P>

      <P>The person named claimed grants on approximately 14 livestock units under the 1981 Sheep Headage Scheme in the Disadvantaged Areas and was paid in respect of those units on 1 December, 1981.  He claimed grants on a further 30.6 livestock units under the 1981 Cattle Headage Scheme in the Disadvantaged Areas but was paid in respect of approximately 16 units only on 31 December, 1981 since an applicant under both schemes in 1981 could be paid on only a maximum of 30 livestock units overall.  As the person named was paid all his headage grants for 1981 in 1981, the question of delay in payment does not arise.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 15 October 1981 but did not submit medical evidence of incapacity to the Department until 10 May 1982.  Her entitlement to benefit in 1981 was governed by contributions paid or credited in 1979-80 contribution year and entitlement in 1982 is governed by the contributions in 1980-81.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the contribution year 1979-80 the claimant's employment was part-time and was not insurable for disability benefit purposes.  She was, accordingly, not entitled to payment in respect of the portion <Col N="589" /> of her claim from 15 October 1981 to 2 January 1982.

      <P>An inspection on 29 March 1982, revealed certain defects which needed to be remedied before the grant could be paid.  The inspector reported that when he again visited the house on 25 May 1982, he failed to gain admittance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the grounds for charging a water rate in the County Dublin local authority area for water supplied by Dublin Corporation when residents in the corporation area are not liable to a water rate; and when it is proposed to abolish the anomaly of having water rates charged when domestic rates have been abolished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In urban areas, the rates for various purposes were consolidated into a single municipal rate by the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, the City and County Management Acts passed between 1934 and 1941 and the Local Government Act, 1946.  As a result of this legislation and a subsequent clarifying provision of the local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962, specific charges for water could no longer be made by urban authorities, including Dublin Corporation, in respect of domestic <Col N="594" /> water supplies to dwellings within their areas.  Urban authorities can, however, make charges for water supplied to non-domestic consumers within their areas and for both domestic and non-domestic supplies to consumers outside the urban areas.</P>
      <P>The statutes referred to in effect left the position unchanged in county health districts, including the functional area of Dublin County Council, where specific charges may apply for water supplied for domestic as well as non-domestic purposes. The commitment to abolish county and municipal rates on dwellings did not extend to separate charges for services including water charges.</P>

      <P>By law, motor taxation receipts accrue to the Exchequer.  The Deputy might note that the total of road grants allocated in 1981 significantly exceeded the total income from motor tax receipts.  Grants to Galway County Council in that year far exceeded the amount collected by the council by way of motor tax.  Estimates for 1982 indicate a similar position.</P>

    <P>1.  The 1981 figures are provisional.</P>
    <P>2.  &ldquo;No. detected&rdquo; refers to offences in respect of which charges are preferred and in addition offences in respect of which the perpetrators are known but where charges are not preferred because, for example, those concerned are dealt with under the juvenile liaison scheme or are mentally incapacitated or have died.</P>
    <P>3.  &ldquo;No. of convictions&rdquo; does not include cases where the indictable offence was dealt with summarily and where the charge was proved and an order made without conviction.  Statistics of such cases for the areas in question are not available but the numbers of such cases is quite small.</P>
