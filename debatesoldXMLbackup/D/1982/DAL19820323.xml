Given that we are dealing with 14 questions and considering the seriousness of the matter, should we not at least anticipate more than the normal leeway to discuss these matters?  I think we should <Col N="98" /> be talking about 50 to 60 supplementaries. Could you give me an indication of what standard you are setting?  It is a different standard from the one that I remember operating a short time ago.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that I came under a barrage of criticism for devoting too much time to individual questions. Indeed, it was generally agreed.  I have now decided that we will have a little more order in the business.  I want to assure everyone here that I will act impartially and not in favour of anyone.  No Member here will be muzzled as far as I am concerned but will be given ample opportunity for expression and for asking questions consistent with order and the business of this House.</P>

      <P>Could I have an indication of the specific numbers?  Have we reached anything like the 50 to 60 supplementaries that would at least be the average allowing for three to five supplementary questions per question?  I would ask that the reform procedures might be delayed a little bit.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy were listening attentively she would have heard the same question repeated over and over again.  On no fewer than five occasions the same supplementary questions were asked.  I am not responsible for the replies of Ministers and the Deputy and everyone else in the House knows that.  I am going on to Question No. 15.  I am calling on Deputy Alan Shatter.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, before that matter was dealt with I was trying to get in with further supplementaries.  I had the first question on today's Order Paper.  Possibly I cannot shout as loudly or jump up as rapidly as some of my colleagues.  I take the view that I have not received an opportunity to pursue the supplementary questions I should have been permitted to pursue with the Taoiseach in the light of the reply given to my question.</P>

      <P>I refer the Taoiseach to an alleged agreement concluded between himself and Deputy Gregory which was referred to in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 10 March 1982 regarding matters other than inner-city development which was the sole matter he directed himself to when answering the previous questions.  There is a submission in that document under the heading &ldquo;Laws&rdquo; that the constitutional ban on divorce will await findings of the special committee on marital breakdown.  Arising from that, does the Taoiseach propose <Col N="100" /> to establish an all-party committee on marital breakdown?  What terms of reference does he envisage for them? How many Members of the House does the Taoiseach propose to place on the committee?  When does he intend that the committee will be established?  Will this Government accept the recommendations of such a committee?</P>

      <P>I have already explained to the Deputy that the question of what committees should be established by this Dáil is at present under consideration by the Government.  It is my belief that it is necessary to proceed cautiously in this area.  I have already explained in regard to this matter during the last Dáil that it is a simple matter to set up a number of Oireachtas committees to deal with whatever concept comes into the mind of any particular Deputy. The trouble is to get committees to work. It is essential to limit the number of such committees if we are to have effective committees.  This is something that is very much present in my mind in trying to decide what committees we should establish, how many and what areas we should cover.</P>

      <P>My experience in this House, going back over a long number of year, teaches me that it is a simple matter to set up an Oireachtas committee.  It is infinitely more difficult to try to ensure that committees function effectively and perform the duties they were set up to do.  The form of committees we may or may not establish in this Dáil and the areas they will cover is something to which I will give careful consideration <Col N="101" /> and which I hope to be in a position to discuss with the Opposition parties.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Taoiseach's reluctance to have committees of this House in which Independent Deputies could play a role, having suffered from him dragging his feet on this point for six months of last year.  In relation to the published version of this agreement when will the Taoiseach be seeking the agreement of all parties in the House to the establishment of an Oireachtas committee on child and family welfare which is item 3 under the heading &ldquo;Family and Children,&rdquo; subheading &ldquo;Welfare&rdquo; in the printed version?</P>

      <P>I have nothing to add except by way of helpful explanation. There are many areas which Deputies on all sides would wish to see the subject of examination by Oireachtas committees. It is very important that we decide for ourselves how many such committees we can effectively set up and service.  Following that we can decide what areas, particularly in the social area, the different committees should cover so that they will be effective and avoid overlapping.</P>

With the exception of one committee on which we disagreed as a matter of principle in the last Dáil, the Deputy found me oncoming in regard to the other committees he had in mind.

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly before the Dáil adjourned on 9 March last, Deputy Larry McMahon complained that, in a division that afternoon, some Members had entered the Chamber through the door of the Press Gallery after I had directed that the doors of the Chamber be locked.  I knew nothing of the incident at the time and promised to have the matter investigated.</P>
      <P>I have since ascertained that Deputies Proinsias de Rossa, Paddy Gallagher and Joe Sherlock did in fact use the door of the Press Gallery to enter the Chamber after the doors had been locked and that, as a result, they were present and able to vote in the first division that day.  The door in question, I am told, never has been locked for a division and its use for entry to the Chamber had never been foreseen.  The Deputies in effect took advantage of an unforeseen loophole in the normal arrangements for a division.</P>
      <P>No point of order was raised during the division; the four tellers signed the Division Paper and, in accordance with Standing Order 60, I announced the numbers on the paper and declared the decision. I have instructed that in future all doors leading into the Chamber are to be locked.  There will not, therefore, be any further unorthodox entries into the Chamber during a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In explanation of their action, the Deputies have indicated that the two new Members failed to hear the bells owing to the noise of the crowd present that day and that all three were impeded in reaching the Chamber by the crowds thronging the hall, corridors and the marble stairway. From my own observation and from reports, I am satisfied that, to say the least, our visitor control arrangements were not strict enough.  I am satisfied also that both in the House itself and in the visitors' gallery our security arrangements and safety precautions were put at risk.  For the future protection both of Members and visitors, I have had an urgent review carried out to ensure that the number of visitors admitted to the House and to the Gallery on occasions on which there is great public interest in <Col N="153" /> our proceedings be kept within safety limits and within a range that our resources in staff can control.  The decisions on this review will be communicated to the Whips today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the position of the three Deputies in question but I also sympathise with the position of the press who will now be locked into the Chamber with the rest of us during a division.  There is a further problem arising in this regard.  Many Deputies in our party particularly&mdash;I am not sure about the other parties&mdash;now work in what was the school of art building and when there are a lot of people in the yard outside and in the hall it is extremely difficult to get to the House.  Something will have to be done, either to have a fixed time for ringing the bells, to have ushers in that building notifying Deputies that bells are ringing or to have a longer period, which is preferable, for ringing the bells.  This will have to be looked into very urgently if we are to ensure that all Deputies can be present at divisions.  In this case the Taoiseach was the beneficiary of the vote but it is possible that Deputies could be missing and questions could be defeated by the Government or by us.  Deputies should be allowed every possible chance of being here when the division bells go.</P>

Deputy Harte has been a Member <Col N="160" /> of this House for more than 20 years and he has the respect of all sides of the House.  He is known for his non-partisan approach and for his concern for national rather than party interests.  At times this has been demonstrated almost to the temporary embarrassemnt of the party to which he belongs.  Deputy Harte would make an excellent Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House of the precedent set on the last occasion, some seven months ago, when the present Taoiseach proposed that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should come from the Opposition. I hope that the Independents will take account of that precedent today and will consider it appropriate that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should be a representative of the Opposition especially since we are putting forward such a very experienced Member of the House.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, on a point of order, recalling what the Taoiseach said on the last occasion when the same thing happened, he drew to your attention that the same procedure outlined in Standing Orders applicable to the election of the Ceann Comhairle applied to the election of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, namely, that in the event of there being an equality of votes, the question should be decided in the negative, but you replied to him that you did not require that advice, and you decided in the interests of fair play in the House that you would cast your vote against.

      <P>In the extraordinary result of the vote just taken to elect a Leas-Cheann Comhairle I want to offer my personal congratulations to Deputy Tunney. Deputy Tunney has been a Member of this House for many years.  For all of those years he and I have been on personal friendly terms.  He is a man for whom I have had the utmost respect.  On many occasions when the former Taoiseach was seeking advice and guidance on the types of Deputies who should be around him to advise him on North/South relations, he was one of the people I had in mind and often suggested his name to the former Taoiseach.  Our friendship goes back for that number of years.  I take this opportunity to wish him well in the office to which he has now been appointed.  However, I must say also that in the extraordinary decision of the Chair to cast his vote on this occasion for Deputy Tunney, when on the previous occasion he cast his vote against me, it is very difficult for me, a Cheann Comhairle, to accept such a rationale from you.</P>

      <P>What I have to say from now on has no bearing on Deputy Tunney. I want to say this, that when the present Taoiseach, as Leader of the Opposition, was speaking on the previous occasion on the appointment of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle here in the House he mentioned that if the Government had confidence in the Chair then the Opposition were entitled to have confidence in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I do not know what confidence the present Government have in the occupant of the Chair at present but my human nature would be stretched to a capacity far beyond its control were I expected to have confidence in you, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with the objection raised earlier by Deputy Shatter in relation to this matter.  It is very unfair to the House to circulate a Bill and to ask that all Stages be taken in one day. Business could have been arranged so that this Bill could just as well be taken tomorrow.  I understand it is intended that the Bill be taken in the Seanad on Friday but this Bill could have been ordered for tomorrow and thus give the Opposition an opportunity to study its contents.</P>

      <P>We cannot have something sacrosanct now that was something of no consequence ten minutes earlier. Apparently there was an agreement between the Whips that the Committee of Selection should have been chosen today and placed on the Order Paper but that was not done.  That was rejected at the outset of public business as something of little consequence, but now we are told that agreements between the Whips are sacrosanct and cannot be questioned. When the Taoiseach was Minister for Social Welfare I questioned this peremptory throwing in of legislation with a demand that it be handled and disposed of in one day.  I question this now and I do so in the interests of every Member.</P>

      <P>I do not think the question is really in order at this stage because we could have a debate on the entire original question.  The Deputy will be aware of the great urgency in passing the Bill at this stage and of getting it to the Seanad if the legislation is to be implemented by 31 March.  This arises because of the unusual circumstances in which we find ourselves this year.  Deputies opposite are well aware of that.  We had a budget that failed in the House and we had an election following it.  We are now practically up to 31 March and we must get this Bill through if the beneficiaries are to receive their benefits from 31 March. That is the reason the Whips agreed to take all Stages today.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle was pleading agreement between the Whips but that matter is irrelevant and is of no concern to him.  He should not be cognisant of agreements between the Whips.  He is above this inter-party discussion, I should have thought.  We are perfectly within our rights in asking for an explanation.  The Minister for Social Welfare said this matter is urgent and that the legislation must be put through before 31 March.  That is certainly the case but there is no reason why Committee Stage should not be taken tomorrow thus allowing people, having reflected on Second Stage, the possibility &mdash; and it may be no more than that &mdash; of putting down written amendments.  Now there is only the possibility of oral amendments to the Bill in Committee because Committee Stage will follow immediately on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>As the Chair is aware, that is a very unsatisfactory method of amending any legislation.  I believe this argeement should not have been proposed and it should not become the normal practice in this House.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to implement improvements in social welfare services which are due to come into effect at the beginning of April.  In considering the Bill we are to some extent making history because this must be the first time in which a Social Welfare Bill giving effect to such substantial improvements in <Col N="176" /> social welfare payments has been debated before the budget in which financial provision will be made for them. Deputies, however, will be aware of the circumstances which have given rise to this situation.  The time between now and the beginning of April, when increased payments take effect, is very short and I hope that I can rely on the co-operation of all parties in getting this deserving measure through.</P>
    <P>A number of the harsher measures provided for in the January budget drawn up by the former Minister for Finance could not be accepted, particularly having regard to the impact of those measures on the less well off sections of the community. I am, however, pleased to make provision for implementing those parts of that budget which contained proposals for increases in social welfare payments. This is the main purpose of the Bill now before the House.  It implements the undertakings given by Fianna Fáil in the recent General Election.</P>
    <P>The general increase in rates of payment is 25 per cent, apart from children's allowances in which case the increase is substantially greater.  Fianna Fáil Governments down through the years have been conscious of the need for providing a satisfactory level of welfare services. We have continually developed those services and provided worthwhile improvements.  All of this must be seen in the economic framework within which services are provided.  The Government's decision to eliminate the harshest effects of the budget proposed by the former Government by maintaining food subsidies at existing levels and cancelling the proposed new 18 per cent VAT on clothing and footwear will be a substantial relief especially for those who are dependent on social welfare payments.  It is equally clear that the increased social welfare payments that are being provided for in this Bill will be of considerably more benefit to those receiving them than the same level of benefits would have been if they had been awarded in the context of increased prices for food, clothing and footwear which would have resulted from the proposals of the previous Government to remove food subsidies <Col N="177" /> and put VAT on clothing and footwear.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the effect of the increases on individual payments. The increases in social insurance payments are provided in section 2 of the Bill.  The personal rate of contributory old age and retirement pensions for persons under age 80 is being increased by £8.05 to £40.25.  It will go up to £43.05 for persons aged 80 years or over.  The addition to the pension for an adult dependant is being raised to £25.70 where the adult dependant is under pensionable age and to £30 05 where the adult dependant is aged 66 or over.  Accordingly a married couple both over pensionable age will get £70.30 as compared with £56.25 at present and, if the pensioner is aged 80, the new rate will be £73.10 as against £58.50 at present.  The new rates for a married couple are therefore well over 50 per cent of average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>The new personal rate of widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit will be £36.25 for a person under pensionable age, £36.95 for a person aged between 66 and 80 and £39.45 for a person aged 80 years or over.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of invalidity pension is being increased by £7.10 to £35.50 for a person under pensionable age and by £7.25 to £36.20 for a person aged 66 or over.  The addition to pension for an adult dependant is being raised to £23.05 for a pensioner under age 66 and to £23.50 for a pensioner aged 66 or over.  The personal rate of disability and unemployment benefit is increased from £25.30 to £31.65 and a married couple will receive £52.15 as against £41.70 at present.  Maternity allowance is also being increased to £31.65.  The maximum rate of death grant is being increased from £75 to £100.</P>
    <P>In line with the general increases in social insurance payments, section 2 of the Bill also provides for increased occupational injuries benefits.</P>
    <P>Increases in social assistance payments and in the rates of children's allowances are provided in section 3 of the Bill.  The maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory old age pension is being <Col N="178" /> raised by £6.90 to £34.45 for persons aged under 80 years.  It will go up to £36.95 for persons aged 80 or over.  The maximum rate of payment in respect of an adult dependant under 66 years of age is being increased by £3.45 to £17.30.  The overall maximum payment for a pensioner with a dependent spouse will therefore go up to £51.75 and, where the pensioner is 80 years of age or over, to £54.25.  The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is being raised to £19.30.  In the case of a pensioner living alone, the additional allowance is being increased to £2.70.</P>
    <P>The maximum weekly personal rate of widow's (non-contributory) pension is being increased from £27.05 to £33.80 where the widow is under age 66, from £27.55 to £34.45 where the widow is aged between 66 and 80 and from £29.55 to £36.95 where the widow is aged 80 or over.  Increases in the prescribed relative allowance and living alone allowance for persons over age 66, in line with those payable with non-contributory old age pensions, are also provided.  The improvements in widows' pensions will automatically apply to the social assistance allowances for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives. The social assistance allowance payable to single women aged between 58 and 66 is being increased by 25 per cent, bringing the maximum rate of the allowance to £29.50.</P>
    <P>The increases in unemployment assistance rates bring the maximum personal rate to £26.25 in urban areas and £25.45 elsewhere.  The rates for adult dependants are being increased to £18.95 and £18.50 respectively, so that the rate for a married couple will be £45.20 in an urban area and £43.95 elsewhere.  The 25 per cent increase is also applied to the special rates of unemployment assistance payable to smallholders with land under £20 valuation in certain disadvantaged areas whose means for unemployment assistance purposes are assessed notionally by reference to land valuation.</P>
    <P>The rates of supplementary welfare allowances are also being increased by 25 per cent.  This will bring the maximum <Col N="179" /> rate of supplementary allowance for a married couple to £43.95 per week with additional payments for children.</P>
    <P>The increases in rates of benefit payable for dependent children are linked with the substantial overall increases which are being made in the general scheme of children's allowances.  The increases for dependent children of social welfare beneficiaries have been calculated in such a way that, taking account also of the increases in the general scheme, an increase of 25 per cent is provided in payments for children.</P>
    <P>The increase in children's allowance rates are also provided in section 3 of the Bill.  The present rates of allowance of £6 for the first child and £9 for each additional child are increased to £11.25 for each of the first five children and £17.50 for each subsequent child.  In the nine-month period from April to December 1982 the new rates of children's allowances will effectively mean an increase of some 45 per cent in payments to beneficiaries. Increases in children's allowances normally take effect from July but on this occasion the increases will have effect from April in the same way as all the other increases.  It is not, however, administratively possible to make payment at the new rates in April and the current rates will continue to apply until July when arrears from April will be paid. The reason for this is that children's allowances books are renewed in July each year.  The validity of the children's books at present held by beneficiaries accordingly lasts until June next and new books would normally be issued with effect from July.  Having regard to other commitments it is not possible to print and distribute a supplementary book issue for the three months April-June equivalent to the increase in rates of children's allowances for that period.  Additional orders will be included with the July children's allowances book issue to enable the increases due for the months of April-June to be paid retrospectively. This will be done in conjunction with the July renewal of allowance books.</P>
    <P>In line with the increases in social assistance pensions and allowances the <Col N="180" /> reduced rates payable where the weekly means exceed a certain amount are also, of course, being increased.</P>
    <P>Steps have been taken on a number of recent occasions to ease an anomaly which arose due to the application, in previous years, of uniform percentage increases to all reduced rates of pension. This resulted in a scale of means and pensions under which weekly pensions were reduced at one stage by £1.40 for every increase of £1 in means.  The reduction for each £1 increase in means is now £1.20 and the present Bill provides in section 4 for the removal of this anomaly so as to ensure that reductions in pensions will be made in steps commensurate with increases in means.  The abolition of this anomaly together with the increase in the rate of pension would have the effect of greatly stretching the scales of means and pensions to an extent that would render them far too cumbersome and complicated. To avoid such a development, section 4 also provided that the steps of means in the tables will be increased from £1 to £2.</P>
    <P>An easement of the means test in its application to single parents is provided for in section 6.  A sum of £200,000 has been provided for this purpose and this amount is being allocated in such a way as to enable single parents such as widows, deserted wives or unmarried mothers to increase their earnings without suffering a reduction in social assistance payments as a result.  At present the means test includes a provision, in the case of applicants with children, to disregard any earnings of the applicants up to £104 a year for each child.  The provision which I am now making is to increase the &ldquo;disregard&rdquo; to £312 a year for each child in the case of applicants for widow's non-contributory pension, deserted wife's allowance, social assistance allowance for unmarried mothers and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for extending the prescribed relative allowance of £19.30 to invalidity pensioners under age 66. This allowance is at present payable as an increase of pension to incapacitated pensioners who need full-time care and attention and who are over 66 years of <Col N="181" /> age.  An exception is made in the case of blind persons who may receive the allowance under that age.  It is provided in section 7 that the age limitation will also be abolished in the case of invalidity pensioners thus extending the allowance to those pensioners no matter what their age. I think this is a particularly welcome extension of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In section 8 I am making a provision to enable married women without child dependants who are separated from and not supported by their husbands to qualify for unemployment assistance.  Under present legislation such women cannot qualify.  The particular difficulty in the case of married women living apart from their husbands is that they cannot qualify for unemployment assistance unless they have a dependant, even though their position is analogous to that of a single woman who is subject to no such condition. A number of such cases have arisen and section 8 provides for the removal of the anomaly.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention briefly two additional measures which I am introducing from April but which do not require to be provided for in legislation.  I am extending the free telephone rental scheme, which at present applies mainly to social welfare pensioners aged over 66, to eligible blind pensioners under 66.  I am also extending the free travel scheme, which is currently available to all permanent residents in the State aged 66 or over and to invalidity pensioners, blind persons aged 18 or over and persons in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance, to residents in receipt of Northern Ireland or British invalidity pensions who are under 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>In line with the increases in social welfare payments announced in the January budget various allowances payable under the Health Acts are also being increased from April.  The maximum personal weekly rate of disabled persons maintenance allowance is being increased from £26.05 to £32.55; the rate for an adult dependant from £14.80 to £18.50 so that the rate for a married couple will be £51.05.  Infectious diseases maintenance allowances are being <Col N="182" /> increased from £26.25 to £32.80 in the personal rate and from £21.35 to £26.70 for a dependent spouse, making the new rate for a married couple £59.50.  Blind welfare allowances which are payable as a supplement to non-contributory blind pensions are being increased from £8.90 to £11.15 in the personal rate and from £17.70 to £22.30 for a blind married couple.</P>
    <P>In addition to what was provided for in the January budget I am pleased to be able to say that the Government have also decided to increase the domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children from £45 to £55 per month.  Also the mobility allowance which is payable to disabled persons will be increased from £200 to £250.  Finally the capitation allowances which are payable to voluntary organisations for the vocational training of disabled persons will be increased. Apart from recouping those organisations for their increased costs these additional payments will enable them to increase the allowances which they pay to their trainees.</P>
    <P>I have now covered the improvements which are coming into effect from April. These measures, when taken together with the Government's decision to maintain food subsidies and remove the proposed 18 per cent VAT on footwear and clothing will significantly improve the situation of social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>In addition to the general increases in rates of payment, it has been the practice in recent years to provide for double payments of long-term social welfare benefits at Christmas.  On each occasion, however, on which temporary increases of this nature have been provided, it has been necessary to introduce legislation. Since it is possible by regulation to provide for permanent increases in rates of payment, it is anomalous that temporary increases, such as these double payments, cannot be provided in the same way.  I am accordingly providing in section 9 of the Bill that the power to vary rates of payment by regulation will be extended to cover such temporary increases.  This provision will facilitate the introduction of temporary increases in the future and will give greater flexibility <Col N="183" /> in relation to the time of year at which such increases can be provided.</P>
    <P>The only other provision made in the Bill is to amend a number of minor printing errors in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, which have come to light since its enactment.</P>
    <P>The overall cost in 1982 of the rates increases and other changes being provided for in this Bill is £230 million.  This is a considerable sum, even in the context of overall expenditure on social welfare of approximately £1,565 million.  The cost to the Exchequer in 1982 of the increased expenditure will be approximately £128 million and some £102 million will be met by increases in social insurance contributions. Increases in contributions and in the ceiling of earnings on which contributions are levied to meet the employers' and employees' share of the cost of the proposals under the social insurance schemes are provided in section 5 of the Bill.  The ceiling is being raised from £8,500 to £9,500 to take account of increases in earnings.  This will also lead to corresponding increases in the amount of pay-related benefit to employees. Allowing for an Exchequer contribution of 25 per cent to the social insurance fund towards expenditure in 1982, the increase in social insurance contributions is 1.75 per cent for the employer and 1.75 per cent for the employee.  This brings the standard contribution for social insurance from 13.3 per cent to 16.8 per cent of which the employer will bear 11.3 per cent and the employee 5.5 per cent.  This is the same increase in PRSI rates as was proposed by the previous Government and accepted by the present Government in their modified budget proposals.  Proportionate increases are being provided in the rates of voluntary contributions. Reduced rates of contributions are payable under regulations in respect of certain employments &mdash; for example, pensionable public service employees and certain share fishermen and outworkers. These are not covered for all the benefits of the social insurance system and increases due in those rates will be made by regulation.  The contribution increases will be effective from 6 April 1982.  The <Col N="184" /> increases in rates and in the earnings limit are expected to yield about £102 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>In my introduction to the Bill, I have dealt with the improvements which the Government are making for social welfare beneficiaries with effect from next week.  These measures, particularly when account is taken of the more favourable budgetary strategy to which the Government are committed, will, I am satisfied, improve significantly the situation of social welfare recipients.  This is the third year in succession in which I have been privileged to introduce a 25 per cent increase for pensioners and other social welfare beneficiaries.  As an example, since April 1980 the old age pension for a married couple has been increased from £34.25 to £70.30 per week.  I intend to maintain the process of continuous improvement of the social welfare system which has always been the aim of Fianna Fáil Governments and which has been achieved in practice.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to take the opportunity to mention briefly some areas which I consider to be in need of attention.  The social welfare code is a complex one.  In my previous term of office I was responsible for the enactment of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act which was a major contribution to the simplification of the system by bringing many complex legislative provisions together in the one Act.  I hope further rationalisation can be achieved without at the same time losing the flexibility that is necessary if we are to respond sensitively to the many differing demands that are made upon the system.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme has come in for considerable criticism since its introduction and is now in need of major review and improvement. It is the one scheme which deals at the closest quarters with financial need at the most critical level.  Of all the social welfare schemes it is the one which must operate most quickly and flexibly to meet needs as they arise.  I intend to review this scheme to ensure that everything possible is done to improve its operation and ensure that it fulfils its original objectives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> The immediate priority now, for those who depend on social welfare, is to have this Bill put through as quickly as possible, so as to allow for the implementation of the improvements which it contains. These are summarised, for convenience, in the tables which I have circulated with <Col N="186" /> my speech.  The first of these improvements in payments takes effect from 31 March.  I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House for urgent and favourable consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention in this debate will be brief.  What the present Minister is doing is bringing in, by and large, measures which I had been hoping to bring in myself.  I congratulate the Minister on his return to office and wish him well.  More than most, I am in a position to appreciate the difficulties and demands of his present office and his need to be constantly responsive to the wants and desires of the most needy and vulnerable section of our society.  He is blessed with a very able and committed office staff in the Department of Social Welfare, whose assistance I valued very much in my seven months in office.  With that commitment, capacity and expertise at his disposal, I have no doubt that he will do a good job in office.  He is dealing with the section of the community which needs total commitment and the best which the Minister in office can give.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House is one of great urgency.  It must be got through before the end of this month, of which only days remain.  I understand the importance of getting all sections of the Bill through but take the point made by some Deputies, who have not had the opportunity of dealing with the measures covered by the Bill, that there should be a delay before the Committee and Fourth Stages go through.  I do not understand if it is possible to delay these until tomorrow, but that might convenience a Deputy who had not had the opportunity of making suggestions for improvements or amendments to the Bill.  Time is now at a premium and this legislation must be got through quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the 25 per cent increases in all payments under social welfare.  It is a unanimous wish of all Members that that should be done.  The Minister made reference to the budget as improving the VAT situation &mdash; but I do not know how effective this will be in the case of old age pensioners and social welfare recipients &mdash; and the dropping of the less desirable aspects of the budget as resulting in great improvements.  We do not know if this will be the case because we have not yet seen the budget.  No one knows what effect the budget which it is proposed to <Col N="190" /> produce on Thursday will have on social welfare recipients.  We know that a great deal of extra money will have to be brought in by that budget to give effect to the promises made before and after the election campaign and to take account of the delay there has been in introducing a budget this year.  I presume measures will be introduced in the budget which may or may not be beneficial to social welfare recipients.  We have no way of knowing whether social welfare recipients will do any better until we see the budget.</P>
    <P>The other improvements which the Bill wishes to bring into effect is 25 per cent increase in children's allowances. The Minister made the point that arrears in children's allowances will be paid in July.  I understand the reason for this and when the present children's allowance books expire in July new ones will have to be printed to cater for the increased amounts.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the Bill for which we were making provision, for instance, the improvement in means tests for reduced rates of payment.  A sum of £200,000 is being made available for single parents as an easement of the means test.  This was also a provision of the budget being introduced by the outgoing Government as was the extension of the prescribed relative's allowance scheme for invalidity pensioners.  We all agree these are improvements and we welcome them.  The free telephone allowance to blind pensioners under 66 is in the same category as is the question of free travel for resident Northern Ireland and British invalidity pensioners.  I welcome the extra sum being made available for domiciliary and mobility allowances, capitation grants and so on.  I also welcome the provision made in section 9 for the Minister to vary rates of payment by way of regulations to cater for these temporary improvements.  I feel that improved payments should be made to coincide with children returning to school for those families who are dependent on social welfare. The expense involved in clothes, books, etc. makes a big dent in their meagre allowance.  A double payment <Col N="191" /> would be very welcome at this time since the Minister has now power to vary the regulations from time to time without having to get approval for legislation in this House.</P>
    <P>This Bill meets with the general approval of the House and it coincides mostly with the Bill which we would have brought in if there had not been a change of Government.  I wish the Minister well in office and I hope that many other improvements which are necessary in so far as social welfare is concerned will come into effect.  We could do a lot in this area.  For instance, this year there are no improvements for those who live alone.  There is a case to be made for the old person who lives alone and has to bear all the overheads.  It is a quite different case from two or three old age pensioners living together or living with people who are not in that category.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will address himself to the question of retirement and the advancement of a national pay-related pension plan.  I hope the costing for such a scheme can now go ahead.  We are inclined to think of old people when we refer to social welfare but this plan would be of benefit to all.  There are other things I want to say but time is at a premium and I will have other opportunities.  I wish the Minister well and he will have my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Desmond in congratulating the Minister on his appointment and I wish him every success in his Department. Naturally I welcome the increases and my party welcome the increases which are the purpose of the Bill.  It is natural for us to support them as they are almost in total the proposals that were put before the Dáil on that famous day in January. To the extent that the Bill provides real and significant increases for social welfare recipients of all types of benefits and assistance, it is to be welcomed and will gain our support.  There is a problem, which has been mentioned by Deputy Desmond, that in general when we are approving social welfare increases it is done in the context of a full budget and an understanding of how the money <Col N="192" /> which is to be paid will be raised.  That whole context is missing here and makes it extremely difficult to assess whether the rates of increases here will be sufficiently adequate to cover people for the effects of the money raising elements of the budget.  We are, in effect, seeing the implementation of a three or four phased budget at this stage.  We have already seen the first phase &mdash; the Gregory phase &mdash; and we had the price increases of a week or so ago.  It is extremely unsatisfactory to be discussing this element without having an understanding of the wider context.  It is already a serious criticism of a very young government that they are giving indications of the kind of slapdash irresponsible approach to government that was such a feature of their last period in office.  It is very much in contrast with the commitment to a national plan going in a specific direction which was a feature of the outgoing Government. The importance of national planning in any kind of budgetary provision is obviously of paramount importance and the then Minister and I, representing that Department, took part in budgetary discussions and made arrangements for that Department and sought increases at a level in the context of a particular social plan.</P>
      <P>We do not know what context we are dealing with now, and that is a very serious question mark.  While we welcome the increased rates in benefits there is no way of knowing whether they are going to be adequate for the impact on prices, employment or national growth and the future stability of the country that the other financial policies of this Government may have.  I commend the civil servants in the Department for their response when they found themselves without any clear guidance for a number of months but who took the greatest care to prepare the pension books that were necessary for the payment of the new increased rates based on the public commitments of both parties.  That led to the minimum of delay and hardship for the beneficiaries concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael commitment in the field of social welfare is clear.  It is clear in the action of the Government of that time, <Col N="193" /> in their sort life from June to October; it is clear in their budgetary provisions and, indeed, it is clear here today when the first action of the new Government has been to take the January budget provisions <i>in toto,</i> with only the slightest modifications or additions.</P>
    <P>I would point out that last October social welfare recipients received significant improvements.  A provision for a double week's payment was written into the January budget, for the first time. There were significant increases in the free fuel scheme as well as in all rates of payment.  The Minister said this is the third time he has introduced increases of 25 per cent.  This is the first time there has been a genuine increase of 25 per cent.  I have talked to persons about occasions when they had been expecting increases of 25 per cent but who in fact came away with increases of only 16 per cent.  Previous Fianna Fáil Governments tended to differentiate, the 25 per cent increases being given on the basic rates, and that had serious implications in real improvement terms for people with large families.</P>
    <P>It was our priority particularly to protect people with families who tended to be most affected by the rising cost of living and who tended to be pushed into the poverty bracket.  The social welfare proposals, now before us were framed by the outgoing Government to protect families through an improved child benefit scheme.  Of course, here again we are back to the revenue side: we have got to consider the revenue side before we can assess the adequacy of the provisions now before us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new schemes, which we had introduced and provided for.  I welcome the increased capitation grants for voluntary organisations for training the disabled.  I welcome the increase in the domiciliary allowance.  I welcome the willingness of the Minister to examine the whole framework of social welfare legislation and his acknowledgement of the need for modifications and simplifications.</P>
    <P>Many changes are necessary and I am glad the Minister has expressed willingness to examine this.  We accepted the <Col N="194" /> limited nature of social welfare developments in the context of a national economic plan.  On Thursday, if the Minister for Finance does not satisfy us that the future will be secure for those on social welfare benefits, we will be unremitting in our criticism and we will reopen the whole debate in this area.</P>
    <P>Last year in October we recognised the living standard changes that had occurred and I hope that the Minister in a similar situation will show the same openness and willingness to protect those concerned. Generally, we support and welcome the level of the increases provided for but regret that we are debating this in the dark.  I hope that on Thursday we will be as satisfied with the levels of increases as we were in January.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I extend congratulations to the Minister on this his first Bill since his return to the House.  Of course I wish the Minister well in all his duties.  I have no doubt he intends to achieve a number of reforms during his term of office, and I will be pursuing him to achieve some reforms that are long overdue and that have not been dealt with properly over the years.</P>
      <P>In relation to this Bill, I understand that it is necessary to introduce the Bill early due to the fact that we are heading into a new financial year and that it is urgently desirable that the increases be paid to social welfare recipients.  In so far as the Bill provides for that I welcome it. In honesty, the Minister should acknowledge that the general financial increases provided for are those which the previous Government were committed to, as well as the party opposite, during the election campaign.  Regardless of which Government would be returned to power, the financial benefits for social welfare people would not have been any different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not try to place the Bill in the context of the overall economic situation or of whether our people generally will be any better off as a result of this Bill and the forthcoming budget on Thursday than they would have been if we had got our budget through.  Of course I do not know what will be in Thursday's budget <Col N="195" /> but I am concerned because there may be items in the budget that may penalise financially many of those dependent for support and who are getting that support from social welfare.  I am suspicious by nature and I am somewhat worried about the procedure through which the Bill is being processed fully before we know what will be in Thursday's budget.  I wish to put that on record.</P>
    <P>I understand that some of the payments that would be made normally at this time of the year through social welfare legislation would become due in about the first week in April.  It is worth noting that it is now only 23 March, and therefore I do not see any reason why the Committee Stage of this Bill could not be taken on Thursday or Friday of this week when we would know the contents of the budget.  The House could have agreed to sit on Friday.  It would then have been possible to make amendments, possibly necessary arising out of the budgetary provisions.</P>
    <P>To some extent, we are working blindly today.  It may be, following Thursday's budget, that the general position of social welfare dependants will be largely unchanged from the position today.</P>
    <P>I understand the need to get this Bill through, leaving aside any worries about the budget or any possible suggestions that my remarks may have some sort of party political bias.  I do not believe we should play a political football in this area.  However, I do not regard it as acceptable procedure that a Member of the House should receive a Bill of this nature on a Tuesday morning and then be told that all Stages must be passed by 7 o'clock that evening.  This Bill contains provisions other than financial ones.  It seeks to amend certain measures such as the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act. One of the reasons why our social welfare legislation has been defective over the years has been the introduction of piecemeal legislation that has not had a sufficient overview of its impact on other areas of social welfare.  Thus we have been producing anomalies and inconsistencies in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that I have had sufficient <Col N="196" /> time to study the legislation or to reach final conclusions as to desirable amendments to this Bill.  I will ask the Minister to consider one amendment, and I hope that on all sides of the House we can get agreement in respect of it.  I will come to that shortly.  I regard it as being totally unsatisfactory that this legislation is being completed today.  It is my understanding that the Seanad is being recalled to sit on Friday afternoon.  So the intention is to have this legislation through by the end of the week.  If that is the case there is no reason why we should not have been given another 24 hours to consider this Bill before Committee Stage was dealt with.  I say that regardless of what the Whips agreed in relation to the matter.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare legislation suffers a variety of structural defects, inconsistencies and anomalies.  Whether this Bill is the Bill that would have been introduced by the previous Government, or a new Bill introduced by this Minister, what I am concerned about is that none of the defects that have been highlighted in the general area of social welfare law has been tackled in this Bill in any true or sensible manner.  Some of them, in the context of legislation, do not involve matters of great complexity; they would not result in the parliamentary draftsmen having to pore over papers, with a candle beside them in case the electricity went off, into the small hours of the night, and day after day to produce the necessary amendments.  Many of the amendments required could be included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am going to refer to some of the defects I have in mind.  I accept that some of them have financial implications, as does one of the amendments that the Minister is making and which I will be coming to shortly.  But in regard to others, if they have financial implications they are not very great and are reforms required in themselves in justice and in equity in dealing with people in identical circumstances in an identical way.</P>
    <P>One of them is in an area that I have previously referred to in this House in a question I put to the former Minister for Social Welfare.  It is the area of the deserted wife's allowance.  This scheme <Col N="197" /> was introduced by the Social Welfare Act of 1970.  It has been reformed in certain ways in subsequent social welfare legislation. In 1973 we had the deserted wife's benefit introduced to accompany the deserted wife's allowance.  The legislative provisions concerning the deserted wife's allowance and benefit are contained now in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  Unfortunately many of the provisions relating to the general law concerning deserted wife's allowance and benefit are not only contained in the Consolidation Act but also in the labyrinth of statutory instruments which to the lay person are virtually uninterpretable and mean nothing at all.  It is the manner in which not merely the legislation but the statutory instruments operate that determines the method of application of deserted wife's allowance and benefit. The deserted wife's allowance and benefit are administered within a secret system which is one of the problems of our social welfare code in which decisions are made by deciding officers.  Often no reasons are given for the manner in which they have reached decisions.  Often when applicants for allowances are turned down they do not know why they have been turned down.  Appeals are dealt with and at the end of the whole procedure the deserted wife who has not succeeded in getting an allowance does not know why and does not know what she should do about it.  This is a general problem with the whole code of social welfare.</P>
    <P>In the context of the deserted wife's allowance there are a number of provisions which nobody seems to know how to interpret which give rise to considerable problems and difficulties for the people concerned.  If there is nothing that he can do about it in the context of this Bill I would ask the Minister, who was responsible for the legislation that consolidated the social welfare code in the 1981 Act, to consider now not merely removing some of the anomalies in the statutory regulations but asking his officials to work on the production of a consolidation of the regulations that exist.  I appreciate that this is a difficult task which will take us back to regulations in the 1952 Social Welfare Act, but it is <Col N="198" /> something that needs to be undertaken. If it was undertaken it would add a degree of clarity to the whole area of social welfare. It would not only do that but serve to highlight some of the anomalies and some of the difficulties of interpretation that exist.</P>
    <P>The deserted wife's allowance commenced in 1970 because it was effectively following what was the family law code in those days.  In about 1970 if a wife was unsupported it was not sufficient for her to obtain a maintenance order through the courts from her husband; she had to prove that she was deserted as well.  So, our social welfare code took the approach that if a deserted wife could not proceed through the courts because her husband had disappeared, the State should assume an obligation, so we adopted a scheme for deserted wife's allowance. But our family law, in so far as it affects wives, has changed drastically since 1970. We have the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 which casts on spouses a mutual obligation to support.  A wife who has not been deserted but who is not supported, whose husband has possibly left the family home by agreement, the parties agreeing the marriage has broken down, can get maintenance.  A wife whose husband is still living in the family home but who is not supporting her can get maintenance. But our social welfare code has not structurally kept pace with the family law code as it exists.  It is not enacted in a coherent way with that legislation.  We have major anomalies.  We have wives who have difficult marriages and whose relationship has broken up and who have succeeded in reaching agreement with husbands that they should live apart and who subsequently discover that the husband will not support them or they cannot get support from their husbands and there is nothing they can get out of them as a result of court proceedings.  Because these wives have separated by agreement and are not deserted, strictly speaking they have no entitlement to a deserted wife's allowance.  In some instances departmental officials overlook that and some wives in those circumstances get a deserted wife's allowance.  But the law <Col N="199" /> and the welfare code should not be dealt with in that way.  Let us change the name of the scheme.  Let us have a single spouse's allowance or a one-parent family allowance.  There is no logic in saying to a wife that if her husband has deserted her and does not support her she can get a deserted wife's allowance but if she and her husband recognise that the marriage has broken down and have separated civilly and amicably and her husband does not support her that she cannot get the deserted wife's allowance. That anomaly has been with us for too long and should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The other problem in this area &mdash; and there are a large number of them which it is not possible to go through at the moment &mdash; is the delay in granting the deserted wife's allowance.  Under the present legislation the wife who is deserted must be deserted for a continuous period of three months before she qualifies for the allowance.  As far back as 1972 the Commission for the Status of Women recommended that there should be no hiatus period during this time. During that time a wife can get supplementary allowance but this is payable at a rate far lower than the deserted wife's allowance.  If departmental officials are satisfied that a wife has been deserted there is no logic in her not being entitled to claim the deserted wife's allowance immediately upon her being deserted and upon it becoming clear that her husband will not support her.  There is no reason why we should retain that type of financial penalty which we are imposing on deserted wives, telling them that they are going to have to suffer for three months in this area.</P>
    <P>The other anomaly that I have raised previously in this House relates to the whole manner in which this allowance or benefit is dealt with.  It has at all stages been a wife's allowance or wife's benefit as opposed to a single parent allowance or benefit.  It gives rise to the anomaly that a husband deserted by a wife who does not contribute anything to the family home and left with two or three dependent children may find that his income is such that he cannot continue to <Col N="200" /> work and employ somebody to look after his children.  He may have no choice but to become unemployed in order to look after the children.</P>
    <P>There are a number of husbands in this situation.  What is their position?  They are not entitled to deserted wife's benefit. There is no such thing as a deserted husband's benefit.  There is no reason why that should be the case.  The position of a deserted husband staying at home to look after his children is no different from that of a deserted wife looking after her children without support.  There is no reason why a deserted husband should be confined to being entitled to supplementary welfare allowance but not entitled to obtain the additional money he would be entitled to if he were a wife.  The Minister should deal with this anomaly.  If deserted husbands were entitled to this additional finance it would render what is at present a very difficult existence a more tolerable one.  The Minister should look at this seriously.  If he sought to amend this aspect of the social welfare code he would have the goodwill of all Members.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the present system and code of deserted wife's allowance is unconstitutional.  It is sex discrimination within the social welfare code.  It is unconstitutional on principles enunciated in the courts in other court cases dealing with similar areas.  Before I was a Member of the House I spoke about the need for the Oireachtas to respond to social needs and problems and to treat people equally.  I have always taken the view that it is the House that should legislate and not the courts.  When a matter is deemed to be unconstitutional by the courts, though judges will say that they are merely declaring what the law is, effectively they are changing the situation and forcing this House to introduce new legislation or, by the court decision, introducing a new legal situation.  I would prefer to see the House introduce the necessary amendments in the social welfare code to place deserted husbands in an identical legal position to deserted wives rather than see the House forced to do it by the courts.  When the courts take over from the Legislature, legislators <Col N="201" /> appear to become irrelevant.  The Minister and his officials should take the remarks made in this area very seriously.</P>
    <P>I know a little about constitutional cases and the type of results that can be achieved.  The problem with bringing constitutional cases is that it is the people who have to litigate in the courts who have to pay for them.  I believe the only reason a constitutional case of this nature has not been brought up to now is because of the financial prohibition on people in receipt of deserted wife's allowance who cannot afford to pay lawyers' fees.  It is worth pointing out that the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, provided the Minister with some protection from such constitutional challenges by excluding the whole area of social welfare law and constitutional cases from the free legal aid scheme. Some lawyers, not too far from this House, may be willing to bring such constitutional actions if the Minister and the Government are not sufficiently responsive in this area.</P>
    <P>There are other anomalies in the social welfare code which apply both in the context of the existing deserted wife's allowance scheme and the allowance made available for unmarried mothers. There is a poverty trap which people who are eligible for allowances may find themselves tied into.  The Minister has upped the means test in the Bill, but it is not sufficient.  A wife in receipt of deserted wife's allowance can receive only a very small income by way of work before what she is getting eats into her deserted wife's allowance.  The same applies to the unmarried mothers allowance.</P>
    <P>None of us would suggest that what is paid is sufficient.  It may be adequate for people to get by, but if the State was in better economic circumstances it would be my hope that we would pay more by way of allowance to one-parent families. If a wife earns anything more than £16 a week her deserted wife's allowance is eaten into.  If a deserted wife or unmarried mother decides to go out to work she will require the assistance of a child minder. This will cost in the region of £20 per week.  Very often what they pay out to a child minder is the equivalent of what <Col N="202" /> they earn in a job or what will be deleted from their social welfare payment.  There is need to look clearly at the whole manner in which one-parent families can earn income and see how this income and income maintenance provided by the State should operate.  People who wish to supplement their income in these circumstances should be given an incentive to go out to work and not be penalised for working.</P>
    <P>The whole anomalous situation is highlighted when one compares the position of deserted wife's allowance with deserted wife's benefit.  The allowance is means tested but the benefit is not and is based on social insurance contributions. A wife who is fortunate enough to be entitled to receive the benefit as a result of her husband's social insurance stamps or her own can earn as much as she likes without having any money deducted from the social welfare payment, but a wife who is not entitled to benefit will have money deducted.  Very often a wife on benefit will be in better circumstances than a wife on allowance.  The reason for these anomalies is that we have had piecemeal social welfare legislation which is creating injustices and problems for many.</P>
    <P>A further anomaly is in the area of unmarried mother's allowance.  There is unmarried mother's payments for a mother with one child which is identical to the payment to a deserted wife with one child.  There is no such thing as unmarried mother's benefit.  No matter how many stamps an unmarried mother may have she will not qualify for the additional payment a deserted wife will get in identical circumstances.  There is no logic in that.  In both instances we are talking about a parent living alone with dependent children with identical needs. There is little reason to discriminate against unmarried mothers in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>In relation to the unmarried mother's allowance I will draw the Minister's attention to another problem in the scheme, which relates to the interaction between family law, the unmarried mother's allowance and social welfare law generally.  The unmarried mother's <Col N="203" /> allowance provides for the support of the unmarried mother and her child.  Within the family law code an unmarried mother can seek what is known as an affiliation order to force the father of the child to make some payment to her for the child's support.  I emphasise that it is for the support of the child only.  In no circumstances can the father be forced to contribute towards the mother's support.  A great degree of confusion exists at the moment as to whether, when a mother is means tested for the purpose of the unmarried mother's allowance, an affiliation payment that she is receiving from the father for the child's support is taken into account by the Department.  I would appreciate if the Minister would clarify this matter for the benefit of many people, particularly social workers who come across these problems on a regular basis.  The money paid by the father is purely for the child.  It is not income for the mother and should not be regarded as such.  This could be dealt with by way of an amendment within the context of the Bill before us without a great many technical problems.  The Minister might be prepared to consider that.  On the other hand he may wish to look into it further.  At this stage it is not particularly clear to me and I have seen various approaches adopted in different circumstances.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty is created for the unmarried mother who has qualified for the unmarried mother's allowance who wishes to proceed against the father of the child to require him to meet his obligations and assist in the child's support. She may be terrified that if she goes to court and gets an order against the father with which the father does not comply or on which he reneges in some way, she will end up to-ing and fro-ing in and out of court and that the very fact of her getting the court order against the father will tell against her and result in deductions being made from her unmarried mother's allowance if the Department become aware of the making of the court order.  Unmarried mothers have sufficient problems without the social welfare code and the manner of application of <Col N="204" /> legislation relating to the unmarried mother's allowance adding to the difficulties.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty which I want to bring to the Minister's attention arises under the 1981 consolidation Act which states that for the purpose of section 197 of that Act &mdash; the section concerned with unmarried mothers &mdash; a woman is regarded as being an unmarried mother, if, not being or having been a married woman she is the mother of a child who has not been adopted.  In other words, to qualify for the unmarried mother's allowance she must be the mother of a child who has not been adopted.  That is obvious to some extent.  If the child is placed for adoption by the mother and subsequently adopted by third parties, a married couple usually, of course the mother should not be entitled to the unmarried mother's allowance.  However, another problem in that area is the stigma which the law attaches to being an illegitimate child.  The position apparently, from comments made in this House by the present Taoiseach, is that it is highly unlikely that we will have any legislation within the lifetime of this Dáil to amend the law in relation to illegitimacy. In this area it has not been unusual in recent years for some mothers of illegitimate children through the Adoption Board to adopt their own children themselves, not jointly with a husband they have married but as single unmarried mothers and for one reason only: they have done it because in law it has removed the stigma of illegitimacy, or bastardy as the law still refers to it, from that child's legal status.  The problem is that if the mother adopts her own child in an effort to remove the legal inequalities which apply to that child by use of the adoption process she can disqualify herself from getting the unmarried mother's allowance even though the child continues to reside with her, to be cared for by her and remains in her custody throughout his childhood, because of the definition adopted within the 1981 consolidation Act which definition is identical with that contained in the original social welfare legislation which established the unmarried mother's allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> These are just some examples of the anomalies in our social welfare code that need to be dealt with and they have arisen through piecemeal legislation.  Today's Bill is another example, right or wrong, of piecemeal legislation.  I am concerned that none of these areas will ever be tackled properly unless we have a clear commitment from the Minister to do so within the context of the next social welfare Bill to be introduced into this House. I ask him to consider these seriously. Many another anomaly in the code creates real financial problems for people in need and gives rise to considerable injustice and difficulties for many of those people in our society whom we as public representatives seek to assist.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and I welcome his intention to review the scheme or have a further look at it.  However, I greet his statement in this area with a certain degree of cynicism. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme was introduced by the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowance) Act, 1975, which came into force finally on 1 July 1977, in or about the time the last Fianna Fáil Administration came into Government.</P>
    <P>During the period from 1 July 1977 until June 1981 when the former Fianna Fáil Administration went out of office not a single thing was done to reform many of the difficulties of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Not a single step was taken to introduce statutory changes, despite Members who in those days were also on this side of the House and despite health boards around the country and county health committees such as my own County Dublin Health Committee appealing consistently to successive Ministers for Social Welfare, one of whom is now Taoiseach, to tackle the problems under the supplementary welfare allowance code.  I have a great deal of cynicism for the comments made in the Minister's speech, though possibly there is more now to promises to reform this area than there used to be in the promise made by the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that one reason why <Col N="206" /> this reference is contained in the Minister's speech is that Deputy Gregory-Independent's agreement which was referred to earlier today &mdash; the only knowledge of which we have is the synopsis reproduced in <i>The Irish Times</i> some days ago &mdash; refers to some acknowledgment of the need to reform the social welfare code in so far as it applies to the supplementary welfare allowance.  Of course, Deputy Gregory has no experience of the unmarried mother's allowance or the deserted wife's allowance or some of the other things which have been mentioned so far, and that is why they have not found their way into the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is sincere in his commitment to this area.  If he is not I hope that not only Deputy Gregory-Independent but other Members of this House will be chasing him to make him produce the required action in this area. It is very sad that only as a result of the sort of agreement that the Taoiseach has concluded apparently &mdash; and which he is afraid to admit to concluding &mdash; with Deputy Gregory-Independent has any suggestion been put forward.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme has to a limited extent, it should be acknowledged in fairness to the officers administering it, improved upon the home assistance scheme, but only to a limited extent. Many of the hopes which existed when the scheme was first introduced have not been fulfilled.  Aspects of the legislation brought into force in 1977 and that legislation which is now contained in the consolidation Act 1981 have never been implemented properly.</P>
    <P>The legislation envisaged the establishment of supplementary welfare appeals tribunals but nothing has been done about this.  Directors of community care have been placed in the invidious position of having to make decisions on appeals from supplementary welfare allowance officers.  The original legislation envisaged open appeals where applicants could have a proper hearing, out of which a body of social welfare law would be developed so that not merely deciding officers or social welfare officers would know how to interpret the social welfare <Col N="207" /> code but this knowledge would be generally available to applicants and lawyers who might seek to represent applicants in front of supplementary welfare tribunals. No proper tribunals have been established and no public decisions are available to indicate the legalistic manner in which these important features of the social welfare code are being operated. This is a major failure in the supplementary welfare allowance system.  It creates the charade of an appeal when no proper appeal exists; it creates a situation where people who appeal unsuccessfully often do not know why they are not to get an allowance.  There is a feeling of injustice and a feeling that they have not been given an opportunity to present their case.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the supplementary welfare allowance officers or the directors of community care who have to make these decisions lack bona fides.  I have no doubt that they are doing the best they can within the existing confines but it is not good enough.  It is not the scheme originally envisaged and provided for in the 1975 legislation introduced by a former Coalition Government setting up the supplementary welfare allowance code.  I would appeal to the Minister to take rapid action to establish proper appeals tribunals and also to publicise better the supplementary welfare allowance schemes.  Still far too few people are aware of the scheme and its benefits or aware of their entitlements or even where to go to apply for supplementary welfare allowance.  Few who apply are aware that they can appeal against refusal and there is a very great need to advertise the availability of the scheme and to make sure that all who need to look to it for their daily bread and butter know where to find the assistance afforded by this scheme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme I have made a criticism of the Minister in the context of the financial provisions in this Bill.  He is providing for an increase in weekly payments of supplementary welfare allowances in so far as they are provided under the Bill.  However, there is no increase <Col N="208" /> provided by way of legislation unless the Minister intends to act by way of statutory instrument.  The failure to provide for the possibility of increasing a particular payment in the supplementary welfare allowance code is extremely odd considering the problem with which this House will shortly have to deal.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance legislation, in addition to the sum of money which an applicant can seek as of right that person, or someone who is in receipt of other moneys but still has a need, can seek a discretionary payment, can look for additional payments for items such as rent under the supplementary welfare allowance legislation.  Under the existing provisions a person whose rent exceeds £1.50 per week and who has a particular need can apply for an additional payment. Such a person can apply for a sum of up to £5 and this is a discretionary payment which can be made by the supplementary welfare allowance officer. That limit of £5 has remained unchanged since 1977 and this is the maximum which an officer can pay at his own discretion for rent or mortgage.  I do not understand why that sum has not been increased. The regulations relating to it are there by way of statutory instrument.  To increase the amount which may be paid might require an Act or it may possibly be done by regulation.  If there is a 25 per cent increase in social welfare payments there should be a similar increase in the amount which the supplementary welfare allowance officer can pay at his own discretion. The amount of £5 may have been adequate in 1977 but it is certainly not so in 1982 and if a person requires more than £5 the Minister's consent is required.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that this matter has not been dealt with in this Bill because this House must shortly deal with new legislation concerning rent restrictions because the legislation recently passed by this House has been found to be unconstitutional.  A large number of people, many of them elderly and dependent on social welfare payments, live in rent-controlled dwellings.  As the law stands at present landlords will be entitled to charge the full market rent on all houses and tenancies when the temporary <Col N="209" /> provisions Act ends its life span within a few weeks.  In the light of the decision of the Supreme Court it appears that any legislation introduced will have to allow landlords to charge the full market rent and this House will have to provide a form of assistance for many of those who will be unable to pay the full market rent.  The provisions of the supplementary welfare code uniquely provide a mechanism to permit these payments to be made available to tenants who live in what were formerly rent-controlled dwellings.</P>
    <P>It should have occurred to the Minister, especially in the light of promises made by members of his Party to tackle this issue, that this Bill should have provided for a substantial increase in the amount of the discretionary payment which can be made by a supplementary welfare allowance officer to deal with the problem which will arise very shortly. The alternative is that almost every person living in a dwelling which was formerly rent controlled will have to make a direct appeal to the Minister because assistance in excess of £5 per week will be required.  I do not understand why this has not been dealt with in this Bill.  It should have been dealt with for its own sake because the amount of £5 has very little relevance in 1982.  In the light of the commitment given by all parties to provide assistance for those who face payments of rent which are beyond their means as a result of the constitutional decision on rent-controlled dwellings, provision should have been made.  The failure to make such provision means that we will have another Bill dealing with this matter within a few weeks.  If the Minister could consider an amendment in this area I would welcome it.  It would give a certain degree of reassurance to many people living in rent-controlled dwellings who look to this House to provide them with a degree of security and assistance.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to another matter raised by the Minister which, in my view, should be amended on Committee Stage, and hopefully I will be in a position to put down an amendment then.  I realise that it is not appropriate to go into detail on Second Stage but the Minister <Col N="210" /> referred specifically to section 8 in his opening remarks.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is concerned with paying social assistance to married women and seeks to amend section 136(3) of the Consolidation Act.  It should probably never have been in that Act.  Like much that is in the Consolidation Act, it was automatically consolidated into that Act from previous legislation without anybody fully examining its repercussions or impact.  The provision in the existing Act discriminates against married women and the payment of social assistance.  Under the law at present a married women will not get social assistance unless she can establish that either her husband is dependent on her, or she is living apart from her husband and she has other dependents.  In other words, a married woman living alone with no dependent children cannot claim social assistance under the law as it stands, whereas a single woman living alone or a married man living alone can claim social assistance. As the Minister is aware &mdash; and I am constrained in my own circumstances from discussing the matter in any detail &mdash; there is a case pending in the courts in which a declaration is being sought that section 136(3) of the Consolidation Act is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier I welcome this House amending legislation with an aura of discrimination ahead of the necessity to bring court proceedings; but the Minister's amendment will not, contrary to what he said, place married women in a position of equality with married men.  I suggest that what is required is not a new provision replacing paragraph (d) of section 136(3) but the deletion of paragraph (d) of the principal Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment will continue to place married women in a different position to married men.  This in itself will involve sex discrimination and will continue to add a considerable degree of uncertainty in the law of social welfare and place many married women who might otherwise qualify for social assistance in a position of not knowing whether they will be regarded as correctly qualifying for such assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> Under the Minister's amendment to obtain social assistance a married woman must first establish that her husband is her dependant, but to claim social assistance a married man does not have to establish that his wife is his dependant.  If the husband is a dependant, under this provision the woman will qualify if she can establish she is not a dependant of her husband.  I do not know what that means and it is not defined in the legislation. If a woman does not have an income and is living apart from her husband but her husband has an income and is not providing for her, will she be regarded as her husband's dependant and be disqualified from social assistance, unless she pursues her husband through the courts for maintenance; or will she be regarded as a dependant of her husband because they are living apart; or will she be regarded as a separate person, as she should be?</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is prepared to amend this section but I fail to understand why he is replacing one form of discrimination by another &mdash; I am saying this as a lawyer without prejudice to what the courts may decide. There is no logical reason why married women in this context should be considered different to married men.  It is part of the old mentality in dealing with married people in these circumstances; it is part of the mentality in the income tax code which was abolished by the court decision in the Murphy tax case.</P>
    <P>By amending the section in this way the Minister is not alleviating any problems his Department may have in the context of the forthcoming court proceedings, but he is presenting himself with the possibility of future court proceedings. For the life of me I cannot understand why that new section is to be inserted.  I propose &mdash; and I ask the Minister if this could be done in a non-contentious way &mdash; that section 8 be amended to provide that section 136(3) of the principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of paragraph (d).  That would effectively end the problem in this area and place married women in a position of equality with married men.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> I wish to refer to section 9.  The Minister gave a very good reason for introducing this section but it is widely drafted and I am very concerned about it.  The Minister referred to something with which I have a great deal of sympathy, that is, whichever Government are in power there is need to introduce a short Social Welfare Bill to enable the Government of the day to grant double allowances to social welfare recipients at Christmas.  It always puzzled me that it was necessary to pass a Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas to enable a double benefit to be provided for these people.  I always believed that Governments should be able to make this double payment by way of regulation.  No matter what the financial circumstances might be, all parties would agree to paying this double benefit because special provision should be made at Christmas for these people because that is a time when they most need it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the wide manner in which this amendment to the principal Act is made.  To my reading this would allow any Government to increase by ministerial <i>diktat</i> social welfare payments at any time of the year.  In other words the Government could decide on Tuesday to dissolve the Dáil, go to the country and the following Monday increase by 100 per cent all social welfare benefits by ministerial <i>diktat.</i> I have no doubt that would guarantee they would win the election and in the context of this provision the Government are allowed to do that. I do not believe that is right.  The Minister's amendment has gone from one extreme to the other.  There is no reason why an amendment could not provide that double benefits are payable to social welfare recipients in the second week of December each year.  A simple statutory statement in this Bill to that effect would deal with the double payment at Christmas. It would set a precedent and standard under which every Government would have to make the double payment and if they decided not to do so they would have to bring a Bill before the House to change that, with all the public odium such a Bill would generate, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> There is no reason why this Bill should provide such a wide regulatory power.  I am worried about that provision, particularly as this Bill is being raced through this House and Members have not been able to give it the time and consideration it requires.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider that provision because I do not regard it as being a correct provision.  I am not saying that the Minister present would envisage his dealing with the State finances in this way but some Minister some day or, more to the point, some Taoiseach, for cheap electoral gain might decide that this sort of trick would be a very neat one to pull in an election campaign. This section is badly drafted.  It is much too wide.  The narrow scope of the area the Minister intends to cover and to which he referred in his speech should be the only area dealt with in the section.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the Minister is in the context of the comments he made about people being so much better off financially this year.  He tried to paint a picture of all the benefits arising solely from Fianna Fáil policy.  That is not a correct approach nor an honest assessment of the situation.  The Minister knows well that the increased payments for which he is providing are strictly in line with those proposed by the previous administration. However, the Minister has not referred to one area in which the former Government intended providing assistance, an area in respect of which the Minister's silence is noteworthy.  Prior to the election being called it was the intention of the previous Government to bring in legislation to provide for supplementary payments for those on low incomes, for those earning less than £4,000 per year. This would have been different from anything in the social welfare code to date and bore no relation to supplementary social welfare allowances.  This was to have been an income supplement to provide real benefit for people on lower incomes and who may find themselves outside the net of social welfare assistance. We have not heard anything about any such plan from the Minister, but if he has something in mind in this regard <Col N="214" /> I should be happy to hear from him about it.  It was the intention of the previous Government that this income supplement would be in operation from 6 April this year but it appears that the new administration do not intend implementing that sort of scheme.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of our social welfare code that require reform. It would not be appropriate for me at this stage to go into all of those matters.  They cannot be dealt with in this Bill but I have tried to highlight those few aspects that I am convinced could have been dealt with in this Bill.  These are matters that are not unduly technical but with goodwill and a little more time the Bill could have been amended on Committe to deal with some of them.  However, I trust that when replying the Minister will indicate his attitude to the introduction of the reforms I have indicated are necessary.</P>
    <P>While the principal Act of 1981 simplified matters to some extent for lawyers, it still contains many anomalies and inequalities and makes for difficult interpretation. The regulations covering the whole social welfare code stretch so far back and are so labyrinthian that it is virtually impossible for any lawyer, apart from any lay person, to find his way through all of the avenues that can be found on an excursion through the various statutory instruments.  It is clear that the situation is impossible for those without legal training.  There is a very real need for free legal assistance and representation so far as applicants for social welfare payments are concerned.  The State should ensure that the social welfare code is not abused but at the same time that applicants are in a position to assert their rights.  We must aim at finding a happy medium.  We operate a Kafkaesque type of social welfare code.  Decisions are made in private both by deciding officers and often on appeal.  In this whole area of social welfare there is no provision for the publication of the basis on which decisions are made.  We should be more open in our decision making so that people who are not successful in their applications for benefit will at least know that they have been dealt with fairly, that they have been turned down not because <Col N="215" /> somebody wishes to be unfair to them but because they do not come within the provisions of existing legislation which may or may not, depending on the circumstances, need to be amended.</P>
    <P>In 1976 the Pringle Committee recommended that legal representation be made available to all those whose cases were going before social welfare tribunals and appeals tribunals and who had not the means of paying lawyers' fees.  There is no reason why the present legal aid scheme should not be extended to include social welfare legislation.  While it is not within the power of the Minister for Health to make this change, he should be able to tell the Minister for Justice of the need to extend the legal aid scheme in this way.  This is something that has long been acknowledged not only within our jurisdiction but within other countries where there have been reports on legal aid schemes.  It has been recognised that it is essential that legal aid be made available to social welfare applicants.  The reason for this is obvious.  Many people in employment may have difficulty in meeting legal fees but those who are out of work and who are dependent on social welfare for their daily bread are not in a position to afford legal fees.  Until such time as we extend the provisions of the existing legal aid scheme to include the whole area of social welfare there will be continuing uncertainty from the point of view of applicants for the various social welfare benefits and there will be continuing anxiety on the part of applicants in regard to the fairness with which their claims are dealt.  It is within the power of the Minister to arrange that decisions in respect of social welfare applications be published in some form of law report or in some social welfare reports.  This is done in England and in other European countries as well as in the US.  The amount of money involved would not be great.  There must be a body of precedents hidden away somewhere in the Department of Social Welfare in regard to various decisions, but let us make them available to the general public and to Members of this House because it will be only when the various judgments are <Col N="216" /> made available publicly that we will become clearly aware of many of the problems and anomalies in the social welfare legislation.  Some of these we learn about only from our constituents though some of us learn from other areas in which we may be involved.  If we are to have a humane and coherent social welfare code that will deal equally with people and treat them on the basis of their needs, and in the manner in which they should be treated in the last quarter of the 20th century, many of the reforms I have sought from the Minister will have to be implemented.  I hope that during his term of office we will have his goodwill in implementing some of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and his predecessor on steering through very large social welfare increases at a standard rate of 25 per cent at a time of financial difficulties.  I am glad the policy of the previous Government is being carried on by the Minister.  He will have the support of people on this side of the House, and he will certainly have my support, if he continues to look after the less well-off sections of the community, and to provide social welfare increases at a higher rate than the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In times of depression when public finances are stretched, our priority should be to care for the weaker sections of the community.  Our peculiar population structure and our large dependency rate, make it even more important that, while we examine all areas of public finance carefully, we should be particularly concerned about how we treat our old, our young, our genuinely unemployed, and people who for one reason <Col N="217" /> or another find themselves in situations of inadequacy and poverty.  As a general principle I hope the Minister will continue to implement in his caring fashion the decisions and policies of the previous Minister and make his own contribution for as long as this Dáil lasts.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter.  I listened to him.  He is a colleague of mine and his speech was the best speech on social welfare legislation I have ever heard.  He brought to the House his perspective as a lawyer and he underlined many of the anomalies in our social welfare legislation.  I cannot follow on the same lines.  All I can contribute is some experience as a councillor and as a Deputy.</P>
    <P>At present our social welfare legislation is riddled with anomalies.  Deputy Shatter drew the Minister's attention to many of them.  I should like to underscore one or two anomalies to which he referred, and to mention one or two others. I do not blame the Minister entirely. Legislation in this area is complicated. The consolidating Bill simply brought everything together without a thorough examination of the anomalies.  If the Minister lacks the financial resources to make major changes, I hope that at least he will iron out the inequalities and the anomalies. This would not cost very much.</P>
    <P>The situation of the deserted wife is very serious.  As it operates at present the scheme is unfair.  The fact that one must prove desertion before one can qualify is anomalous.  If a husband and wife part amicably and the wife is not supported, she is in a very difficult situation.  I will give one example.  What do I tell a constituent of mine who got a divorce in Austria and whose only recourse for support is to take her husband to the Austrian courts because he will not support her and she is being refused a deserted wife's allowance?  She is not deserted, because she was divorced outside the jurisdiction.  That type of situation should not obtain.  While it is the legal position it is blatantly unfair.  I hope the Minister will correct that type of thing.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the maternity allowance.  I cannot understand why the maternity allowance cannot be extended <Col N="218" /> to mothers who adopt children.  I do not understand why a woman who adopts a child and takes time off from work to do so, and who has her stamps in order, cannot avail of the maternity allowance and the pay-related allowance.  A working woman who adopts a child is entitled to no allowance whatever, whereas a woman who gives birth to a child can avail of two different schemes and, if she has the appropriate stamps, can also avail of pay-related benefit.  That is an anomaly which the Minister should look at.  He is a concerned and caring man.  This type of thing would not cost a great deal of money.  The extension of that benefit would not cost very much.  There is a blatant discrimination there which could be corrected by a caring Minister who looks at these anomalies and has the will to change them.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the means testing for old age pensions and widow's pensions.  I am particularly concerned about a situation in which an old person or a widow has savings and those savings are means tested by the rule of thumb of applying a standard interest rate to the amount in the bank, or the post office, or wherever.  A different rate is applied in the case of an old age pension from the case of a widow's pension.  A woman of 67 years of age who did not qualify for an old age pension could qualify for a widow's pension.  A single woman of 67 years of age is at a disadvantage.  A single woman of 67 or 68 years of age, with a certain amount of money in the bank, will not qualify for an old age pension, while her widowed sister would qualify for a widow's pension under the means test because the system of assessment is different.  I cannot understand why this is so.  Traditionally, and rightly so, we have been concerned about widows, but I do not see why a widow should be treated more favourably than a single person of the same age in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the reduced level of PRSI payments made by the public sector.  I am concerned about this because the benefits do not apply either. I do not know what the attitude of the new Government is to an embargo on employment in the public sector.  I do not <Col N="219" /> know what their attitude is to the McKinsey Report.  If certain decisions and certain lines of policy are followed, for the first time for many years we could be faced with redundancies in the public sector. If there are redundancies amongst the salaried staff in CIE, at the moment they have virtually no protection under the social welfare code.  They could be entitled to absolutely no benefit.  That should be looked at.  A recent decision by the Labour Court added to this problem. I intend to question the appropriate Minister about the implications of that decision particularly in relation to CIE workers and indeed all public servants.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill causes me great concern.  I can understand the Minister's desire to have double payments at Christmas made easily by Ministerial diktat and without introducing separate legislation into the House.  The section allows him to do that.  He can increase temporarily the levels of payments.  The section goes on to say that he can vary all payments. If the section is intended to deal purely with double payments at Christmas, I fail to see why it was necessary to use the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo;.  To repeat Deputy Shatter's point: Is this a clever ploy to allow the Minister to increase social welfare payments any time he likes, particularly coming up to an election?  Alternatively does this section give the Minister power to cut social welfare payments without reference to this House?</P>
    <P>Can a future Minister for Social Welfare, acting under this section, vary upward or downward any social welfare payment?  Can he completely abolish social welfare payments under this section if he can vary all or any of the payments under this section?  This section goes far beyond what is necessary to allow the Minister power to make double payments of social welfare at Christmas-time. There is no reason that it should be so widely drafted.  It is a dangerous section and gives the Minister far too much control.  A future Minister, or indeed the present one, when this Bill is passed, can virtually do what he likes under section 9 with the level of the payments, can vary them upwards or downwards, or even <Col N="220" /> reduce them to a derisory level which would amount to the equivalent of their total abolition.  I am not sure that that was the intention of the section but it appears to be so.  If it were not the intention then there would be no need for the phrase to vary all of the payments.</P>
    <P>I deplore the fact that we have not been given more time to debate this Bill fully.  I see no reason why the Committee Stage could not have been taken tomorrow, Thursday or Friday.  Legislation rushed through is bad legislation.  Deputy Shatter made many pertinent points. There are other points other Deputies would like to make had they the time. There are many amendments which could be made for its improvement and which would have the agreement of both sides of the House had we the time.  That is and should be our concern.  The areas in which there may be political clashes do exist and are well known.  But there are areas and social welfare is one of them in which there is a great degree of agreement on both sides of the House.  Our concern should be and must be that, working together, we would pass the best possible legislation to control our social welfare code.  That is not and will not be done as long as all stages of a Bill are rushed through in one afternoon.  I deplore that fact.  I cannot understand why the Whips agreed to it so readily.  I hope it will not recur without everybody in the House being afforded adequate time to debate the Bill and put down appropriate amendments.  Because that time has not been made available to us I ask the Minister to consider the points we have raised and, if he agrees, to introduce his amendments to cover those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their congratulations and good wishes and also for their wide-ranging contributions. One point raised by successive Deputies was the urgency of this Bill. The reason the Whips agreed to this Bill being taken as a matter of urgency was that the Seanad must convene on Friday to pass this Bill amongst other items. Then five clear days must elapse before <Col N="221" /> the President signs the Bill.  Friday next is March 26; five clear days takes us to March 31 and our first payments must be made from that day.  Other payments will fall to be made on following days.  Therefore if we in this House are interested in having these benefits paid in this year, in all of the circumstances of this year &mdash; and all Deputies must be aware of the circumstances which led to this situation and all Deputies have said they welcome the benefits and want to see them paid &mdash; then we must pass this Bill immediately. In fact an accident could occur in that period of five clear days.  That is why I am putting a special measure before the Seanad to allow the President to sign the Bill within the five days.  If the President were not available, if everything was not in order on March 31 we could be in difficulty anyway.</P>
      <P>There is no attempt to conceal anything. I am quite prepared to come into the House, to discuss and to listen to Deputies' views.  In fact probably I have listened to more views than most other Ministers because I took on the Consolidation Bill.  I shall explain what that meant to Deputies who were not here at the time.  It involved countless hours of detailed debate on the Bill in this House. We had no authority to change any existing legislation in the course of passage of that Bill.  For example the anomalies had to be carried forward and we had to certify that they were being so carried forward. Certainly it was my intention to pursue them subsequently as soon as opportunity arose.  I was involved for a short time only afterwards and I shall certainly want to take up that matter again at this stage.  Therefore I take the points Deputies have made in that respect.  The reason the Whips agreed that this Bill be passed immediately was that its provisions are in the interests of everybody concerned.  Other points raised by Deputies here can be taken up on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the congratulations to the staff of the Department by the former Minister and Minister of State.  They both said they regarded the staff as being very able and committed to their work.  This <Col N="222" /> is particularly welcome because quite frequently the opposite is said of them.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised as to what changes, if any, were taking place.  Basically we are doing all of the things which were being undertaken by the previous administration and a few more.  I have mentioned some extra provisions, such as the domiciliary care allowance being increased, the mobility allowance being increased, the capitation grants for training centres for the disabled being increased, a number of measures costing money.  All of the commitments of the outgoing Government are being met in full with some additional ones so Deputies need have no fear in that regard.</P>
    <P>The former Minister, Deputy Desmond, raised the question of the national pension plan.  As the Deputy is aware I had brought that plan to a stage of publication when I vacated this office.  The figures will have to be recalculated.  I shall now get down to that task with a view to producing a White Paper for consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised, especially by Deputy Flaherty, whether people would be better or worse off after the budget.  I can assure the Deputy that they will be better off.  One reason is that there will be no 18 per cent VAT on shoes and clothing.  Food subsidies are being maintained and there will be no tax on social welfare benefits, an important aspect as far as beneficiaries are concerned. In addition, general Government strategy will be to provide employment and bring down the rate of inflation, which will constitute further improvements for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised a number of questions and, as Deputy Noonan said, made a most interesting contribution. There is no time now to go into all of the points raised by him.  I trust the Deputy now understands this Bill must be rushed through.  Deputy Shatter was concerned about the budget and wondered if there was something going on in order to have this Bill passed before the budget, for the reason that something might be taken back or altered in some way.  I tried to make it clear in my opening remarks that to an extent this makes history in that we <Col N="223" /> have a Social Welfare Bill being introduced before the budget.  If we did not do it this way we would be unable to effect the improved payments in time. Deputy Shatter raised the question also of considering now the consolidation of all existing regulations.  I shall certainly give that consideration.  It is something I should like to do by way of improving, updating and consolidating all of these regulations.  Deputy Shatter said that the Consolidation Bill was a valuable one.  It is particularly valuable in that we have consolidated all the legislation into one neat package with a lot of its older language updated.  Consequently it is now appropriate to review it and have its various elements studied and considered. That had been my intention originally and I will be very happy to proceed with that as quickly as is possible and feasible given all the practicalities of the workings of the House and the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised the question of a variety of smaller improvements that are quite important in themselves.  As he said, they may have financial implications. Very often the problem is that the Minister for Social Welfare can only hope for a certain number of improvements in a budget because of the costs involved. Some of the items may be small and normally the Minister will get a certain number of them through in addition to major items that cost considerably more. The Deputy mentioned the matter of improving means tests.  I would point out that the removal of the anomalies in the means table cost £760,000.  These matters are not as small as they sound when they are talked about from the theoretical point of view.  We are providing £760,000 for the removal of anomalies in the means table and I am very glad to see this provision so far as the elderly are concerned. Up to now for every extra £1 a person lost £1.40 in benefit but now that is down to £1 for £1.  Prior to this Bill it was down to £1.20 and the present improvement will cost £760,000.  The easement of the means test for single parents will cost £200,000.  I would not like the Deputy to think that something is not being done in this area.  Substantial and significant steps <Col N="224" /> are being taken in relation to means and they cost money.  Deputy Shatter also raised the question of the allowance for unmarried mothers.  He thought the means might be only £16 per week at the upper limit.  It is considerably higher: at the upper limit it will be £46 as a result of provisions in this Bill with £6 for a child. Up to now the amount has been £2 per child.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter welcomed the statement that we intended to tackle the matter of supplementary welfare allowance. He felt it might be just a cynical exercise but as far as I am concerned I intend to tackle the matter.  How successful I shall be and how quickly it can be done is another matter but we will set about it immediately.  There are many elements that need to be corrected.  As far as I am concerned there is a definite commitment on this matter.  Another important question was raised about rents and the decontrol of restricted rents.  This will be looked at in the context of legislation being prepared by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>There were references during the discussion to section 8.  I should like to point out that the section refers specifically to separated married women only and not to all women.  In 1984 the EEC directive must be operated fully and the wider aspects can be looked at but so far as this legislation is concerned the situation of separated married women only is dealt with in this section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised the matter of family income supplement.  This is based on the tax code and the Minister for Finance will deal with that question. There is an undertaking in relation to this matter and it will be honoured.  However, there are certain practical difficulties. The people directly affected are those with a taxable income of between £2,000 and £4,000 and the Revenue Commissioners will have difficulty in pulling out these people for benefit.  A scheme is being designed to deal with that but it comes in the context of changes in relation to taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan made the important point that we must care for the weaker sections of the community even in times <Col N="225" /> of difficulty.  We have taken this line and the previous Government in their attitude towards this Bill took a similar line. It is important at a time when things are difficult that those people who are not able to look after themselves will be cared for by this House.  The Deputy also raised the question of extending the maternity allowance to mothers who adopt children. I think a question has been tabled about this.  It is not a direct comparison but there are interesting aspects of the matter that I shall look at in terms of what might be done in this area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of the special provision in section 9.  It is important to remember that at the moment the Minister can raise the benefits but the question of a temporary benefit is considered in section 9.  As Deputy Desmond pointed out, children return to school in September and if there is a need to do something then the measure could be used in that connection.  There are separate provisions to prevent the Minister from reducing benefit and the Deputy need not be concerned about that aspect.  The problem is to make a temporary increase before a temporary period and that is the kind of situation that was in mind.</P>
    <P>Because of the time constraints I have not much time to go into further details. I should like to thank Deputies for the extensive views they presented.  I have noted them and, where possible, I will take action on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to what I said earlier.  My reading of section 136 of the Principal Act &mdash; I am open to correction on this &mdash; taking into account the relevant statutory regulations, is that generally speaking a married man who is available for employment and whose means come within the stipulations laid down in the Act could qualify for social assistance.  The position on the amendment is that a married woman similarly can qualify for assistance but we have the additional provision that her husband must be dependent on her.  We do not have the reverse of that; a married man does not have to have a wife dependent on him for him to get social assistance. We also have another aspect in that a woman must establish in the alternative that she is not a dependant of her husband. The Minister has said that the section is concerned with separated people but I presume it is concerned effectively with the woman who is available for work but who is not working and does not have means.  Means would be calculated as laid down in the social welfare code.  There should be no difference between means and dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the total deletion of subsection (3) would place men and women in a position of equality. It would not lead to any undue financial implication in that there would be no additional expenditure involved.  There is no reason why when amending the section we do not delete the paragraph. The Minister should consider adopting that course.  I do not think we would be bringing within the area of those who <Col N="227" /> qualify any person not entitled to benefit. We are not extending the provision any further but removing a provision that is only creating confusion.  The Minister should consider the position of a woman who is living apart from her husband, is not supported by him and is seeking employment.  She cannot get social assistance if she does not have dependants living with her.  I presume that under the amendment it is the Minister's intention to permit such a person to get social assistance.  The question of whether she qualifies depends on her means and I do not see why having gone through a means test she must have an argument or discussion with a deciding officer as to whether she should be regarded as a dependant of her husband.  it is not relevant. All that is relevant is whether she is available for employment and her means.  The question of dependency is introducing an unnecessary discrimination and leaves this area as uncertain as it was before the amendment was introduced. The Minister should amend the section by deleting paragraph (d).  That would mean that men and women would be in a position of equality.  The means test would be available and only those who qualify would get the assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not see why there should be an insistence on dependency when means are being assessed.  It is discriminatory.  What advantage is there in retaining paragraph (d)?  What benefit is it to any person seeking to avail of social assistance? What loophole would be created if it was omitted?  In our view its removal would end discrimination in this regard and improve the position rather than create a loophole or anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are proposing to enable separated wives to qualify for employment assistance.  It will not be extended to all women at this stage.  Such a move would result in further claims and other financial implications.  That aspect will be taken up in further provisions which will be necessary to remove discrimination certainly, under the EEC Directive, <Col N="228" /> before December 1984.  This measure will remove one element of discrimination and it has financial implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If we adopted that course we would be bringing all the women concerned into the same category consequently increasing the number of claims. The financial provision at this stage would only cover an extension to enable separated wives to qualify for unemployment assistance.  That is an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely what we should be concerned with in the context of qualification for social assistance is whether a person is available for employment or not and, if they are available and are unemployed, whether their means are such as to enable them to support themselves.  In other words, we have a means test.  If a husband was earning an income and was supporting his wife, for the purpose of determining entitlement the income would be aggregated and regarded as part of the wife's income in the context of a social welfare application.  The Minister should accept this valid amendment.  If it does open the doors any further it will put women in a position of equality which they should be placed in.</P>

This has manifested itself to the public eye more by the rapid rise in the numbers on the live register in the recent past.  It is a matter that was of great concern to the previous Government and the decision by that Government to establish the National Development Corporation was a reflection of the concern which that Government showed in regard to tackling this problem.  It can be clearly observed in our history that Governments down the years played an active part in promoting employment and my party down the years supported the concept of a mixed economy where the private enterprise sector was encouraged to <Col N="231" /> progress and prosper and, where necessary, the State sector was seen to play a positive role in ensuring State participation in commercial and non-commercial and industrial activities.  That was an important contribution to the economic wellbeing of the nation.  I can immediately call to mind a few of the ventures which my party were involved in starting up and supporting.  The ESB, the Irish Sugar Company and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are only a few of the State bodies which my Government actively supported in their establishment and promotion through the years.  There are many more since then and it has become clear that the State have an active and positive role to play in the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>My party certainly support free enterprise and the role of private investment is seen as of paramount importance to our prosperity.  Therefore, it is important that we ensure that the environment for industry, which includes agriculture and agriculture-based industries, and the environment for commerce is such as to promote progress and prosperity in those areas which would result in the re-attainment of an acceptable level of employment. This is not now the case and there are some basic reasons why our economy has not been able to sustain an acceptable level of employment in recent years.</P>
    <P>I would identify immediately the international recession which has become evident again since 1979 and which was evident in the mid-seventies as a result of the energy crisis.  We have had about three energy crises in the past eight years which have done immense damage to the fabric of our industrial structure.  The international recession, which is now affecting Europe and America especially, has done great damage to our potential as an exporting country and has also caused a sharp downturn in investment in Ireland by companies from abroad.  Of course this is outside our control but it is a development which we should clearly understand and we should take the necessary steps to ensure that our own industry is aided in every possible way so as to preserve our own industrial structure <Col N="232" /> intact and so that we shall continue to have an acceptable level of industrial investment here.</P>
    <P>The other main reason why industry here is not prospering is the rate of domestic inflation.  In 1981 it ended up on an annualised basis slightly in excess of 20 per cent.  It is important to note that level is seriously in excess of the levels prevailing within the countries of fellow-members of the EEC. I should like to quote from a publication entitled <i>European Economy No. 2</i>, February 1982, Supplement A which is published by the Commission of the European Communities and which gives a table of consumer price indices in regard to 1977-81.  The most extraordinary aspect of it is that the rate of inflation in Ireland is indicated in this table as 23.3 per cent. This was in fact the annualised basis up to mid-November 1981; it was slightly lower than that.  Nevertheless, the important thing is the comparison which one must make in order to see the damage which inflation in Ireland is causing to industry and to our prospects for further industrial investment in coming years. That rate in Ireland of 23.3 per cent can be compared, for instance, to a rate of 8.1 per cent in Belgium or in Germany a rate of 6.3 per cent, in France a rate of 14 per cent and in the United Kingdom 12 per cent.  I have chosen these countries as ones to which we export in substantial quantity and volume.  That comparison indicates quite clearly that our inflation rate is unacceptably high in the context of industrial development.  It must be obvious that with such a high domestic inflation rate we will outprice ourselves on the markets which are our main customers, and these are the countries to which I have referred.  If we insist on pressurising the monetary system, which will result in continued high inflation levels, our prospects for industrial progress are not good.  They will be seriously damaged if we allow this situation to continue.  It has been quite clearly identified, for instance, in the winter Quarterly Report of the Central Bank of Ireland that the pressure caused by the budgetary policies of the last few years <Col N="233" /> has been the main determinant of this high level of inflation.</P>
    <P>The level of budget deficit financing is simply not acceptable.  Unless the present Government have a will, we will have a bleak eighties so far as industrial progress and employment are concerned.  Unless the present Government are committed to reducing the budget deficit to acceptable levels and eventually to eliminating it, one cannot have confidence in Ireland's future as a land in which foreigners will invest money in industrial enterprise.  It is well to say that here rather than to dodge the issue.  If we are to remain attractive to foreign investment we must first put our own house in order.</P>
    <P>A second item, which again may not be popular for a politician to mention but which is a fact, is that our excessive income increases in the past few years are slowly making us uncompetitive.  Our salary and wage rates are slowly but surely approaching those of our competitors, but the unrealised fact is that our productivity is not on the same high level as our competitors', nor indeed is our productivity on a level comparable with the countries to which we are looking for capital investment.  Unless we come to our senses it will be very difficult to continue to attract capital.</P>
    <P>The result of the international recession and our domestic inflation rate has been a steady increase in the numbers on our live register in the past few years.  For instance, at the end of December 1979 the seasonally adjusted live register series showed 84,900 on the live register; at the end of December 1980 the figure had increased to 118,500, and in December 1981 to 137,400.  I am mentioning that progression because it shows a steady and deteriorating situation.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that the makeup of this unemployment increase is balanced seriously towards young people. For instance, people under 25 years of age on 24 July 1981, male and female, amounted to 26.9 per cent of the numbers on the live register.  That is a serious situation, especially in regard to school leavers coming on to the market, who will have less opportunity for employment <Col N="234" /> than was the case ten years ago.</P>
    <P>As a politician who has survived two general elections in seven months I could not but be aware of the extreme frustration felt by young people who have great ambitions for themselves &mdash; ambitions which we would share for them.  It was most distressing to encounter young men and women who wanted to work, to pursue a career, to become economically self-sufficient and who found that successive Irish Governments were unable to give them the opportunity necessary to become full members of society.  That is something of which we cannot be proud and for which we have a responsibility. We have failed in that responsibility.  I could say that it is Fianna Fáil's fault and I am sure that they would say that it is the fault of the Coalition Government. That is irrelevant.  The fact is that since 1973 the level of unemployment for young people has gone steadily in the wrong direction and is causing serious social pressures on society.</P>
    <P>I am mentioning inflation, the international recession and the unemployment level as the reason for the Coalition Government's announcement that the International Development Corporation would be established, that it would have £200 million capital potential and in 1982 £20 million available for capital purposes. The concept of this corporation is a sound and progressive one.  It is sound because we were serious about implementing it and giving it effective power and finance. That is completely in contrast with the National Enterprise Agency which Fianna Fáil set up, without a statutory base and without sufficient capital to make any impression in the area of industrial growth or employment.  The amount of money allocated by Fianna Fáil was in the region of £2 million, which of course would be entirely inadequate for the purposes which we have in mind for the National Development Corporation.  It should be seen that the corporation would have responsibility in the area of venture investment &mdash; in other words that, its criteria having been established by the Minister for Industry and Energy and with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, it would have venture capital <Col N="235" /> available, not only to State trading boards and commercial boards but also to enable them to enter into partnership if necessary with the private sector in ventures of mutual interest and of a new nature.</P>
    <P>The public sector has grown substantially over the years and within that sector there is a vast reservoir of skilled manpower and expertise which should now be brought into use for the benefit of the nation.  One immediate development which comes to my mind, because I had responsibility for the State board concerned, is the Electricity Supply Board. Their consultancy service overseas was a development which was sound, new and successful.  It would be very wasteful if we did not bring into play for our benefit the vast amount of expertise available in State concerns.  This consultancy activity of the ESB is something that springs to mind very easily and clearly indicates the potential which is there for further involvement by State companies in new areas of activity.  The companies which were initially to come under the National Development Corporation were the Sugar Company, Irish Steel Holdings, Mín-Fhéir Teoranta, Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta and the Irish National Petroleum Company, which is due to be given statutory backing in the near future.  I will be taking this up soon with the Minister. Other companies which were to come under the corporation were the Electricity Supply Board, Ceimicí Teoranta, the Irish Gas Board and Bord Na Móna. These are the major State enterprises which would be involved in trading or manufacture and the shares would have been transferred to the National Development Corporation.  The idea of the corporation was not to support lame ducks. In fairness, we have to take a broad look at State bodies which are now active and some of which are losing substantial amounts of money annually.  Two which come to mind are Nítrigin Éireann and Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Energy has a responsibility to ensure that public money is well spent and not wasted.  He also has a responsibility to ensure that all <Col N="236" /> State companies under his aegis are operating efficiently, that there is no waste of management or resources, that the taxpayer is getting a good deal for his money and that the nation is getting an efficient service as a result of the Minister's activities.  If there is a social element involved in the activities of State trading companies, that should be clearly identified. This is something which should be dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare rather than by the Department of Industry and Energy.  The National Development Corporation should be a vehicle for investment in new ventures of State bodies.  That is obviously the first important responsibility which it should have.  It should also ensure that these State bodies look to new enterprises which could be of benefit to the nation. The corporation will initiate State participation in existing privately controlled commercial enterprises, either by taking a share holding or establishing a joint venture together with private enterprise. State bodies should be allowed to use their expertise for the benefit of private enterprise which, in turn, would allow private enterprise to have the backing of such expertise to go into new areas and new ventures which would create substantial employment.  It will also act as a commercial vehicle, where appropriate, for projects involving productive employment.</P>
    <P>The co-ordinating role of the corporation is also important and the development strategy which could be used by a number of State bodies, not only within themselves, but also in partnership with private enterprise, could have a significant impact on technological progress and on new complete firms being established. We are, for instance, enjoying investment in technological type industry at present, mostly associated with computer industries but very few of these industries are complete companies.  We need to develop a research base and a product development base as well as simply assembling parts of computers or whatever.  I see the role here of a number of State industries being involved together with private enterprise in ensuring <Col N="237" /> that we broaden our technological base.</P>
    <P>The corporation will also have a supervisory role over the activities of the State enterprises held by this corporation.  It will also provide venture capital in areas where there are viable product opportunities and where an investment may need to be made which may not be profitable initially but which would be viable in the long term.  We have, of course, employment promotion agencies and industrial development agencies.  The Industrial Development Authority have played a pivotal role in industrial investment for a number of years.  Recent reports from the IDA show concern for future investment here and this has been recognised by the Department of Industry and Energy.  The IDA now, unfortunately, have a prosperous rescue division which plays its part in keeping together firms in trouble.  The experience there up to recently has been that the older type firms had been running into trouble and having redundancy problems but, more recently, a serious development has taken place with regard to newly established companies which some years ago were held in high regard.  They were held up as examples of the types of industries we would like to see here.  Those companies are now in trouble.  I will mention Fieldcrest, which has gone to the wall but for which the IDA had high hopes.  That company is a clear example of investment by the State.  There are many others.  A disturbing trend now is that newly-established industries, some of them in the highly technological category, are finding it difficult to get markets because of world recessions.</P>
    <P>These are developments which must cause concern to the Minister.  They indicate the crisis we are facing in regard to industrial policy.  We have had the IDA playing a pivotal role in regard to the attraction and sustenance of industries. The ICC have been playing the role of merchant bank, and Fóir Teoranta have been playing an important role as a State rescue agency.  Thus, we have agencies which act on behalf of the State in attracting capital, but in recent years the results in employment have not been such <Col N="238" /> as to ensure that our young people can get employment: there has been a gap between job creations and the numbers entering the labour market.  That gap is a serious problem for any Government and it must be tackled positively immediately; it cannot be put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>For those reasons Fine Gael feel that there is a need for a new initiative in industrial policy, and that need manifested itself by the proposed establishment of the National Development Corporation. That was an initiative and an effort to harness the vast potential of expertise in the State sector, which is locked in and which should be used more adventurously and with more originality that heretofore.  We must concentrate all the State's resources to ensure that progress in industry will be maintained and that we will move back towards full employment.</P>
    <P>The employment creation policies of successive Governments have failed to ensure a level of employment that would cater for our young people particularly. That is not an indictment of the IDA.  It is a simple reflection of the fact that the growth in our population is posing a greater problem than heretofore.  It is because we have not been able to create sufficient jobs through Government policies that we must now try to find a new initiative.  The National Enterprise Agency was a flop, a red herring, a failure, because there was lack of commitment by Fianna Fáil.  We propose in our motion to embark on something worthwhile to harness the public and private sectors and to allow a much greater degree of flexibility in public sector involvement in the private sector for the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>It must be understood clearly by the Minister that this is not an effort to bolster lame ducks.  Fine Gael insist that all our State agencies should be efficient, and in that respect the Government have a grave responsibility.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the Minister as a sincere attempt by Fine Gael to bring about a new initiative to achieve greater involvement by the public sector and partnership between the public and private  <Col N="239" /> sectors, especially in new ventures. I will conclude by congratulating the Minister on his appointment to a Department which will give him many problems but also many opportunities.  I wish him well in that office in the coming few months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;supports the Government establishing the National Enterprise Agency and providing it with necessary finance for its operations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>First of all I thank Deputy Collins for his good wishes for my new reign in the Department of Industry and Energy.  As he said, there will be plenty of problems there.  They are there already, as Deputy Collins is aware.  Indeed I am sure he was glad to walk away from them and hand them over to somebody else.  It will take full dedicated effort by everybody concerned to produce the right solutions to these problems.  Of course that is the responsibility of the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Collins began I could not help but feel that he was giving us a resume of our economic ills.  He referred to inflation as a major problem.  Here we have no disagreement whatsoever: inflation is a cancer in this society which has caused major social and economic problems. I assure Deputy Collins and the House that the Government are fully committed to keeping the current budget deficit if not at its present level then possibly below it.  We will do whatever is possible within the constraints of a very difficult economic situation to bring inflation down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Collins will agree, these problems cannot be solved instantly.  I am sure he will also agree that the problem has existed for some time.  Before we left government in 1981 we had taken steps to control inflation through the introduction of subsidies on food and transport.  Deputy Collins must also agree that the first act of his Government <Col N="240" /> was to introduce the July budget which had the effect of adding 6 per cent to inflation.  If the budget on which the Government fell had been passed a further 6 per cent would have been added to inflation. Unlike Coalition Governments we are committed to pursuing inflation actively.</P>
    <P>It is rather surprising that the motion that was moved by Deputy Collins on behalf of himself and Deputy Kelly for the establishment of the National Development Corporation should have been tabled by members of the Fine Gael Party who have never been over-enthusiastic about proposals for such a corporation. The corporation had been agreed purely as part of the joint programme for Government in July last with the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The idea of a national development corporation has been hawked around by the Opposition in one shape or form for the past ten years or more.  Indeed, neither the shape nor the form were ever clearly spelled out.  It seemed to be something which the Labour Party always claimed was the answer to all our economic and unemployment problems but nothing has ever emerged on the Statute Book or even by way of draft legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the Fine Gael motion calls on the Government to establish the National Development Corporation without delay.  The former Government of which both Deputies Kelly and Collins were members, were about eight months in office; however, despite their commitment to establish the corporation as a matter of urgency and numerous assurances to the effect that it would be established before the end of 1981, the corporation had just been &ldquo;stillborn&rdquo; when Dáil Éireann was dissolved and the promised legislative proposals to set up the corporation were still awaited. The calling of the general election heralded the corporation into the headlines but that was the only action we saw.  I know that it was announced in a blaze of glory and that Deputy O'Leary, the then Tánaiste, at a press conference eight days before polling day tried to put some face on the proposals the Coalition Government had in mind for the National Development <Col N="241" /> Corporation.  I am sure Deputy Collins read the press comments on it and he knows that it finished up in &ldquo;Gaels of Laughter&rdquo; similar to what started in the Gaiety Theatre.  That was the reaction of the responsible journalists at the time and it is well known that had an election not been called we might not have heard any more about the National Development Corporation for some time to come.</P>
    <P>I gave the foregoing brief summary of events in order that the present motion from Deputies Kelly and Collins could be seen in its proper perspective, particularly in relation to the request for the establishment of the corporation without delay.  Its establishment appears to have acquired a new sense of urgency since the return of the members of the former Government to the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>As previously indicated, the Government do not propose to go ahead with the proposal of the former Government to establish the National Development Corporation and consider that a large part of the £20 million which was earmarked for the corporation for new projects in 1982 could yield more immediate job creation if applied in other areas of the economy.  However, the Government will reactivate the National Enterprise Agency, which was established in 1981 pursuant to a commitment given to the social partners in the national understanding but which effectively has been kept in cold storage during the term of office of the Coalition Government while they sorted out their priorities on the remit for the National Development Corporation. The &ldquo;freezing&rdquo; of the agency was regrettable, occurring at a time of rapidly increasing unemployment and when a new radical structure already existed, encompassing venture capital/ development functions and with a potential to make a significant contribution to fostering economic growth and reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the National Enterprise Agency are to establish organisational responsibility for the commercial exploitation of new development opportunities by the State where such opportunities are not being exploited by the private sector, and to provide a mechanism <Col N="242" /> to ensure that commercially-oriented research and development are applied in the economy.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve these objectives, the agency's principal functions are: First, to provide commercially viable productive employment by promoting and developing new business opportunities, specifically through the commercial exploitation of projects deriving from the work of research agencies such as the National Board for Science and Technology, An Foras Talúntais, An Foras Forbartha and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the development of projects involving the use of natural resources and participation in projects having a substantial import substitution effect.</P>
    <P>Second, the agency will act on its own or in joint ventures with other private or public sector agencies.  Whilst its main focus will be on the industrial sector, it is not necessarily confined to this; it may set up subsidiary companies to run particular ventures and may sell them off when they become commercially viable. Similarly it may wind up unsuccessful projects; the general intention is that the agency will fulfil the role of a venture capital agency.</P>
    <P>Third, the agency will have responsibility for commercial exploitation by the public sector of new development opportunities not being taken up by the private sector.</P>
    <P>Thus the objectives and functions of the NEA parallel very closely the development functions which were envisaged for the National Development Corporation. The primary emphasis in both cases is on productive employment creation.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that in a radio interview during the recent general election campaign Deputy Kelly stated that when the National Development Corporation does emerge he and everybody else in the Government would be anxious to ensure that the jobs which it creates are productive jobs which justify themselves economically.  He said that any other kind of job may, in the short term, take figures off the unemployment list but, in the long term, it would be a millstone <Col N="243" /> around people's necks.  This is what the NEA is all about.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether Deputy Kelly was aware of what his other people in the Labour Party envisaged for the National Development Corporation and what Fine Gael envisaged for the National Development Corporation.  That interview during the general election campaign would give rise to the same opinion that I formed, that Fine Gael were in no way committed to the National Development Corporation.  If they were much more action would have been seen in the seven months that they were in government to put some of the things together that would be necessary to bring it on stream.</P>
    <P>However, the Agency will not have an advisory or supervisory role in relation to the commercial State enterprises, which was proposed for the National Development Corporation.  The Government, however, are committed to reviewing the operation of the commercial State-sponsored bodies and, in particular will be seeking and indeed supporting viable diversification proposals by these bodies into growth areas of the economy.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Collins make the point about the excellent professional services being marketed abroad by the ESB in the developing countries in the Far East.  I hope he was not trying to give the impression that Fianna Fáil would not support that.  We always do.  I might even go as far as to say that as a Minister on a visit to Libya I brought back many interesting areas for the semi-State bodies, such as Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, CIE, B &amp; I and Irish Shipping, to become involved in projects being developed in Libya.  As a result, Aer Rianta got a substantial contract out there and others are in the offing.  I know that everybody in this House and this country hopes that the other agencies I introduced out there will be successful in getting some contracts in these developing areas.  Ireland has a significant role to play in the development of the Far East.  We have the professional and management services to offer.  My colleague, Deputy Des O'Malley, who has a particular interest in the area of trade and commerce will <Col N="244" /> be interested, as I am.  It is an area that has potential for expansion and no effort will be spared on our part to ensure that the maximum advantage will be obtained for Irish employment in developing countries.</P>
    <P>We will not get into the area of inflicting on the National Enterprise Agency the added problems that they would have in supervising the role of the operations of these, as Deputy Collins mentioned. If they are serious about doing a job in the job creation area &mdash; and that has to be the top priority of this Government &mdash; this is the big challenge facing democracy in Ireland today.  If we do not succeed in solving this problem we will have to face social upheaval.</P>
    <P>The NEA will not be shackled with an albatross of major loss-making enterprises and in this way the agency will be able to get quickly about their principal task of establishing and participating in viable projects.  If the agency were also to have the function of evaluating and making recommendations on the operations of and investment programmes by the many and diverse range of enterprises under the remit of the NDC, it would make it impossible for them to concentrate immediately on their development activities and get on with the job we envisage them doing.</P>
    <P>I feel it necessary that I should assure the House that there will not be any conflict of role between the NEA and the IDA.  The IDA are a promotional and grant giving body whereas the NEA will perform the functions of a development and venture capital agency.  There will be very close consultative arrangements between the two bodies and these arrangements will facilitate, where appropriate, NEA participation in IDA promoted projects in the private sector. These arrangements will also enable the NEA to have access to the IDA's considerable body of sectoral expertise and will provide for regular meetings at chief executive and senior management levels.</P>
    <P>The Government will be providing not £2 million as Deputy Collins mentioned but a £5 million capital allocation in 1982 to the agency for new job creating projects. If it subsequently emerges that this <Col N="245" /> provision is inadequate urgent consideration will be given to whatever additional finance is required to boost job creation by the agency, thus again underlining the major priority which we attach to tackling our serious unemployment situation.  The sum of £5 million being provided to the National Enterprise Agency for capital investment in 1982 is, in my view, adequate for this purpose given the normal time lag between the assessment, development and implementation of projects. Moreover, the intention is that once the agency are operational they will be largely financed from commercial sources.  The ability of the agency to raise funds from private sources will be greatly enhanced by not having responsibility tied round their neck for commercial State enterprises whose borrowing requirements not alone for investment but also for day-to-day running expenses are frighteningly colossal.</P>
    <P>Lest Deputies may be under any misapprehension about the scale of Government funding for the agency I should perhaps explain that the difference in funding proposed for the agency and that proposed by the former Government for the new business activities of the National Development Corporation is more apparent than real, namely: (1) The agency will be expected to rely more heavily on private investment sources, that is the main financial institutions, to fund their activities and these will be actively tapped.  (2) The intervention of the general election, the time-scale envisaged by the Coalition Government for enacting legislation establishing the National Development Corporation and the subsequent establishment of an organisational structure for the corporation would <i>in toto</i> have meant that the corporation would scarcely have been in operation by mid-1982, thus resulting in the likelihood that a significant part of the proposed £20 million capital allocation for the corporation would not have been utilised or even committed in 1982. The NEA, on the other hand, have already been incorporated as a limited company reporting to the Minister for Finance.  They are therefore ready to take off.  (3) The £20 million earmarked for <Col N="246" /> the corporation by the former Government appeared to have been based largely on the resources which the Government would have liked them to devote to new job creation in 1982 rather than on a firm and definitive assessment of what new business opportunities were realistically likely to be generated by the corporation in that year.</P>
    <P>The Government are at present giving consideration to the introduction of an expanded exchange guarantee scheme for foreign borrowing for working capital by small and medium sized manufacturing industries particularly where these firms would not find it attractive to borrow in Ireland.  At present there is about £20 million available for disbursement to small and medium sized firms under the additional working capital scheme introduced by the former Fianna Fáil Government in 1980 and under which the Exchequer bears the exchange risk.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that the associated banks will seek to participate in any new foreign exchange guarantee scheme.  The banks are well placed, given their extensive branch network and special and trusting relationships with their manufacturing customers, to get the money out quickly to those who badly need it.</P>
    <P>However &mdash; and I am not prejudging the Government decision on the new scheme &mdash; I would expect that the banks will have to offer something, and something substantial, in return if they are to be parties to any new scheme.  At a minimum I would expect some significant initiatives to help manufacturing industry. These initiatives might take the form of the introduction of expanded venture capital funds which might be used by the banks to invest in projects sponsored by the NEA or projects in high risk areas promoted under the IDA's enterprise development programme.</P>
    <P>I am not satisifed that up to now the banks have been doing all they could as regards the provision of venture capital. The existence of venture capital agencies in the US was the main reason why the boom in electronics in places like Silicon Valley in California really took off.</P>
    <P>Like Deputies Kelly and Collins, the Government are deeply concerned at the <Col N="247" /> level of unemployment which has jumped from 124,000 at the time we left office in 1981 to a record current level of almost 150,000.  We regard this level of unemployment as unacceptably high and intend to mobilise all available resources to deal with it.  Indeed we must view with concern the apparent resignation by the last Government to a serious worsening of the employment situation with all the consequences it would entail particularly for the rapidly growing young segment of our society seeking jobs and older people who find it difficult to secure new employment. Our people are clamouring for positive policies and action to tackle the unemployment crisis and not negative measures and endless pessimism and gloom about our economy and its prospects for recovery from the recession.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the task facing us and the country, the Government are committed to producing, in consultation with the social partners, an emergency plan to tackle unemployment.  This plan should help to restore a sense of confidence and enterprise to our people.  We recognise that much hard work and co-operation will be required by all sectors of the community and that there is no instant overnight solution to our current problems. My colleague the Minister for Finance in his budget statement on Thursday next 25 March will outline the Government's general strategy and intentions for tackling unemployment.</P>
    <P>We hold a totally different philosophy and approach to the whole area of solving the serious unemployment problem.  We do not go along with the view or philosophy of the previous Government, expressed abroad by many Ministers, of gloom, doom and pessimism.  We fully appreciate that confidence is very easy to lose but very difficult to regain.  I have seen evidence of the lack of confidence that existed in the economy in the short time since I have become Minister, both from people abroad and people we expect to invest in the economy.  We must invest today to create jobs tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I never understood the philosophy of the last Government or their throwing in the towel when it came to the rising <Col N="248" /> unemployment situation.  The Taoiseach at the time said it could go to 200,000 but he could do nothing about it.  I see Deputy O'Leary in the House and would remind him of an interview last June when he said that, if the new Government did not seriously tackle the unemployment situation and convince people they were serious about it, they would be put out of office.  He said that if the unemployment figure went above 100,000 the price they would have to pay was that they would be put out of office.  They were put out.  If they had not been put out the damage they have done by the gloom and doom they spread and the confidence they lost would have taken longer to repair than it will at this stage.</P>
    <P>We are committed to restoring confidence to people in their ability to run their own affairs.  We do not share the negative approach of the previous Government. We fully appreciate and recognise the serious financial difficulties that exist but also point out that there is a way to deal with it and it is not by throwing in the towel.  We do not intend to do that. The approaches that have to be made by various Ministers will be made.  There is an area I could point to straight away and that is the amount of imports coming into the country.  A large amount of materials and finished products are brought into this country and paid for on State projects, under State contracts.  Only the other day I read in a paper that a builder in a town in Ireland was building 24 houses for a local authority and the baths put into these houses were imported from abroad.  The net price difference between imported and home produced was 48p. This happened to be in a town where baths are produced.</P>
    <P>We have too many verbalisers and it is time to get out the message that we have serious economic problems.  We need full co-operation and commitment from everybody.  Our big buyers in the area of supermarket products have a national responsibility to sell and buy Irish whenever the opportunity arises and they should not take the easy way out.  The State companies should examine each and every area of their purchasing sections <Col N="249" /> and whenever possible must buy what is produced in Ireland.  There is sufficient room in certain areas to identify many small industries that can be created in the towns and villages of this country to cater for the requirements of this State from year to year.  We must adopt a new approach to our problems and create a climate of hope and pride in our economy.  There is a need and demand for national patriotism at this time.  We should work for the country rather than propose to die for it.</P>
    <P>Our approach is that of mobilising all the resources that exist.  First of all we aim to restore national confidence in the people to solve their own problems and to go forward from there.  We will be going into all the areas where we see opportunities to create jobs as soon as possible and we will not just talk about producing agencies such as the National Development Corporation which would make little, if any, contribution to our serious unemployment problems.  We take the other view and we tackle the job immediately.  The position is very serious indeed.  We have factory closures.  We must recognise that we are in recession. We must do today what can be done for our economy, using the resources of the State so that when the upturn in world economy comes, as undoubtedly it will, we will be ready with the most efficient infrastructure we can give to take full advantage of this upturn.</P>
    <P>We will be looking at every situation as it arises.  I heard Deputy Collins mention Fieldcrest.  A receiver is there at the moment and I do not propose to comment on it until I get a full report from him, but a lesson is to be learned from that operation, and Deputy Collins is just as aware of that as I am.  We must mobilise co-operation in the private and public sectors.  We must make everybody realise that we have an economic and jobs crisis and that a contribution is demanded from everybody in this area, in manufacturing, the financial institutions and the State and semi-State sections. A responsibility is on every one of us to make a contribution in whatever area we can.  It is only by a total national effort to defeat this unemployment situation <Col N="250" /> that we will succeed.  We have the confidence to do it.  We believe we can do it.  Given the commitment of the social partners and everybody else, we believe a solution can be reached.  We have much hard work ahead but hard work never killed anybody.  The job is there to be done and we aim to do it.</P>

      <P>First of all, I congratulate the Minister and wish him well in the performance of his onerous duties and I assure him of our support when we think he is facing up to those problems and our constructive criticism when we think he is not.  I agree with him that he has a formidable task on his hands because the Department of Industry and Energy is the whole centre of the State's effort in the area of industry and on the input of that Department and the head of that Department depends the success or otherwise of the State's efforts in the period ahead on the all-important front of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not dealing here with a contest between two bodies favoured by one Government or another.  In the few minutes at my disposal I want to make the point that in the setting up of the National Development Corporation the conviction on my part and that of my colleagues in Government was that this body was required if we were to be serious in tackling employment in the long term.  Unemployment has both a short-term and a long-term aspect.  In the exuberance of coming into office, which is quite understandable, it is understandable also that a new Minister would look with less charity than usual on the efforts of his predecessors, but he will take the point that I accept that that sort of exuberance is responsible solely for such points in his speech as that this is a Government of action and their predecessors were a Government of doom-sayers, and for his use of colourful phrases like &ldquo;throwing in the towel&rdquo;.  Presumably he will learn, in <Col N="251" /> whatever time is available to him, to consider with greater charity the problems and efforts of his predecessors.</P>
    <P>To take the short-term aspect of unemployment and how to deal with it, the commitment of the previous Government in their efforts to deal with the short-term aspects of unemployment can be summed up in our work in preparation for the Youth Employment Agency.  They are the prime body for dealing with that problem this year and they are at the service of his Government today.  Our effort there indicated the serious concern that we had about the growing problem of youth unemployment, a very serious problem which afflicts not us alone but other countries also, and taking into consideration the large proportion of young people in our population, it has social repercussions within our borders more serious perhaps than in any other country in the EEC. The setting up of that agency explains a good deal of time spent by the previous Government in preparation for employment.</P>
    <P>Another body which came directly within my own departmental responsibility was the National Enterprise Agency.  I was very anxious to ensure that fullest consultation would take place with as many people as possible in industry. The original idea belonged to the party of which I am leader.  We realised this necessity to provide a public venture capital agency and that its operation as such would involve a supervisory role in the State sector.  I was anxious for a good reception for this idea and these proposals within Irish industry.  I was anxious to explain also to those within industry who were lukewarm about the idea that this concept of ours would assist in extending realistic employment for our people. Therefore, we saw the National Development Corporation as a venture capital development agency which would put particular emphasis on new growth sectors which had not been as successful as they might have been through shortage of equity funding.  I also saw the NDC as having an important supervisory role in relation to the commercial aspects of <Col N="252" /> State enterprises.  With the nine State companies that we added to the responsibility of the NDC we were concerned to ensure that these companies would be as efficient as possible and that their contribution to the national economy would be seen to be a major one.  We thought that such a grouping of companies in the energy area, the ESB, the National Petroleum Corporation, Chemicí Teo and Bord na Móna, would form a very good nucleus of a new growth in the State sector itself.  Who, looking at the performance in the State sector, would deny that there is need for new development there, for a new lease of life?  We concede that the companies under the aegis of the NDC would be made more efficient and make a better contribution to the economy.</P>
    <P>This is not a contest between the National Enterprise Agency and the National Development Corporation.  It is not simply a matter of saying that our proposal is better than yours for the sake of novelty.  It was our considered opinion, looking at the problems of our economy, that there was a need for the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>We have given what is regarded throughout the world as a generous and attractive manufacturing incentive package. We have given State grants and tax reliefs in excess of £1 billion during the past ten years, yet the level of new employment creation in manufacturing industry during that period barely kept pace with job losses.  This has very serious long-term implications for employment creation.  This is an inescapable fact.</P>
    <P>It is true that over the years a number of State enterprises established a wide range of industrial and commercial activities which made a vital contribution to our economy but during the same period many Irish firms did not expand as they should have into international traded activities.  Instead they had gone into non-traded activities at home and investments of a like character abroad rather than into Irish-based internationally traded activities.  We believed that a new approach was required, firstly to deal with the long-term task of substantially increasing employment in productive <Col N="253" /> areas.  Secondly, we believed that commerical State enterprises, if they were to provide a worthwhile contribution and return on the large amounts contributed through public funds, needed welding together into more effective co-ordination. We believed also that in tackling the long-term aspects of unemployment a new method of channelling State investment into the private sector was required. Above all, we believed there was a need to break down the artificial barrier between State and private enterprise. There was a hard commercial reason and a vital national necessity behind the setting up of the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>It would be childish to suggest that we knocked aside the NEA simply because it was not of our making.  Successive Governments have not had any confidence in the contribution of the National Enterprise Agency.  Documents make that clear but I will say no more about it.</P>

      <P>It is simply a means of siphoning off some money into certain private firms which are in difficulties.  We had provided £20 million for the National Development Corporation in their first year of operation.  The capital of £200 million and the borrowing capability made it a body entirely different from the NEA.  There is no comparison between a small salvage operation for certain private firms and a large grouping with an objective purpose for its existence.  There is a precedent in other countries for such an effort by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I predict that this Government or any succeeding governments will recognise in time the necessity for the National Development Corporation.  There is a need for a national investment agency of this kind and it should be connected with State companies to ensure that those companies make the best contribution and that <Col N="254" /> the corporation is tied institutionally to such companies.  I speak of the National Development Corporation in the present tense because I do not regard the idea as having been put aside and I believe we will be coming back to this body once more.  I believe that officials will be working energetically on the implementation of the work of this body and it remains my objective to get the National Development Corporation into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It constitutes a serious effort at tackling unemployment in the long term.  We require this kind of agency for work in the advanced technology area and in that vast part of our economy in which we are seeing import substitution.  We require it because there are projects which are not being taken up and we must ensure that vital productive projects in either the State or the private sector are not inhibited or constrained by inadequate equity funding.  We require a longer period for risk capital than our banking system at present allows.  In the food processing area there is probably scope for more expansion than is allowed by the banking system, and the National Development Corporation would give the necessary seed capital for that kind of investment.  That was one of the points made by the IDA in their remarks on the NDC.  Its primary task was to act as a venture capital vehicle, together with an advisory and supervisory role in relation to commercial State enterprises.</P>
      <P>A similar need was recognised in other European countries and similar bodies were established to provide development and venture capital on a larger scale than that envisaged by us, but there was no ceiling to the capital that would have been provided for this agency in the years ahead.  These other bodies abroad have larger capital and have been longer in existence.  I consider that the £20 million operational capital provided in 1982 was quite adequate.  Such bodies in other countries have played an important and successful role in industrial and economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> I wanted to avoid the fate of many State agencies who have simply been assigned the role of bailing out major loss-making enterprises, either in the public or private sector.  That was a temptation to be resisted.  Ministers in the industrial area are at times under pressure to commit public money to enterprises on unfair terms and there is a temptation at times to make such decisions, yet in the long-term interest of employment in an area it may be necessary to hold out for a different kind of partnership. The National Development Corporation would not have confined their attention solely to the State sector but would have concentrated also on moving into new areas of private development either on a joint venture basis or by moving themselves into major holding.  They would have invested funds in private commercial enterprises or set up joint State-private enterprise commercial organisations.  They could have held the shares of commercial manufacturing and trading semi-State bodies coming under their aegis.  In regard to the State bodies under their control they would have the important function of co-ordinating the development strategies for those State-sponsored bodies.  The necessity for starting up the development corporation was our failure over any given period to contrast between the large grants given and the fact that unemployment had risen. Job loss had exceeded job creation even against the attractive background of such grants.</P>
    <P>The funding and the objectives of the development corporation would not have involved us in any conflict with EEC regulations. It would not have involved any conflict either with the grant-giving function of the IDA.  The IDA in certain instances have given some equity funding but I believed it was more appropriate that a body which would concentrate on this would do so exclusively.  The IDA are ideally suited to become the specialised State agency for assessing the appropriateness of State equity participation in any firm.</P>
    <P>We have had our successes and failures <Col N="256" /> with our State bodies.  Some of them at the moment give every appearance of needing a new lease of life.  Some of them face difficulties which are not of their making but others require a new sense of direction.  I hope I will not be accused of making too large a claim for the development corporation when I say that I look forward to the very real possibility of the development corporation giving that new sense of direction to the State bodies.  We may forgive the Minister's exuberance but we must answer the point he made about the need to restore confidence as though this was a catchphrase to banish the gloom.</P>

      <P>If talk were a means of ridding us of the problems which at present face our economy we would be one of the first economies in Europe, perhaps in the world, where this happened. The Minister spoke about the need to get rid of verbalisers.  I do not know if he was talking about himself but he is no bad performer when it comes to verbalising.</P>
      <P>We face very difficult problems especially in the unemployment area.  I do not believe we gain respect for our case by pretending the problems do not exist or attempting by any statement to diminish the problems.  We face an enormous task. We have a growing young population with high expectations, a very serious unemployment problem, an economy which is saddled with the various mistakes which have been made in public financing.  There is nothing substantially wrong with our economy in its productive areas.  The great difficulty we face in that regard is a legacy of the various errors which have been made in public finance and that continues with the present administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we looked at this problem we decided we should tackle the short-term aspects of unemployment and set up the Youth Employment Agency.  Under the long-term aspects we considered that the establishment of the National Development Corporation was a sensible and responsible step.  There remained, however, the task of tackling the budgetary <Col N="257" /> problems and the constraints imposed by budgetary difficulties on our national economic advance.  We were engaged in that work when we were defeated.  The problems and the difficulties we faced up to remain with this Government.  No matter how many happy speeches are made those problems remain.  I have sufficient confidence and trust in the sense of our people to believe that they will not be discouraged by a Minister of this or any Government talking about the difficulties which must be faced.  I believe they respect people who face up to problems, talk in an unvarnished way about the scale of the problems and say what must be done.  We spoke of the difficulties before us and we spoke of the steps we were taking to deal with them.</P>
    <P>During my short term of office in Industry and Energy a good deal of my time was taken up in discussions at individual firm level where we tackled some of the problems of unemployment, which are often dealt with under their macro as well as under their micro aspects.  This is a very difficult problem when one has to face individual employees who are facing close-downs because of mistakes which have no origin with the employees but are there because of management errors stretching back over two or three years. There are such problems in Galway and in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>The IDA have recently been talking about a number of those problems throughout the country.  I am sure the Minister realises that he faces many problems of this kind.  I did not shrink from meeting the representatives of such firms and I hope the Minister will continue that tradition.  As he meets the representatives of various firms throughout the country he will begin to realise the scale of the problem that we face, the fact that there is not a good match between job creation and the kind of financial incentives we have given.  He must seek new policy initiatives to deal with this difficult situation.  It simply will not be a case of going to one part of the country and making a happy speech.  It will be more important for him to outline in sober <Col N="258" /> truth the difficulties facing firms and also to do something to combat them.</P>
    <P>Our unemployment problem will not disappear overnight.  I do not believe anybody expects miracles.  We do not expect cliches either.  We must be charitable of the efforts of Governments who are attempting to tackle those problems. We would be cynical in this Parliament if we pretended the difficulties we face are not serious.  We do not require long hours of policy consideration to know what is the best thing to do.  When we talk about deficits it is not simply a question of boring old financial problems or difficulties dreamed up by economists, who are not a very popular breed with some members of the Government.  They are, however, a necessary breed who talk soberly about some of the difficulties we face.  A lot of my time was taken up in efforts to retain jobs in localities and firms as well as listening to chronicles of innocent employees who recounted tales of management error which had led to the present impasse.  In other cases it was nobody's fault because the market had just disappeared and there was unemployment in a particular area.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a compliment to Fóir Teoranta, a businesslike State agency facing a very unwelcome task, performing it as well as they can.  I found Fóir Teoranta, extremely professional and hardworking and I found the IDA doing their utmost against great odds to get more of the investment required from the USA.  Any IDA representative can tell us that in the USA at the moment, because of their recession, we face great difficulties in getting the necessary investment. The prospective investor naturally asks: &ldquo;What is the inflation rate in your State?  What are your plans for dealing with it?&rdquo; I do not know what the Minister will say to any audience on the west coast or the east coast of the USA when he explains the various items of the budget.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for this opportunity to raise this very important matter this evening and the Minister for taking the time to remain in this House to consider it.  I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his appointment and to wish the Minister well in his very important job.  His two ministries are vitally concerned with the problems I have to outline this evening.</P>
      <P>No mining operation can last forever because the resources reaped from the ground are not limitless.  Unfortunately Mogul are coming to the end of what has been, for them and for everyone in North Tipperary, a benefit which has given great prosperity.  The Silvermines operations are based a few miles outside Nenagh. That town has developed many businesses from the prosperity the mines have brought to the area which has made Nenagh a very successful town.  The workforce in Mogul mines amounted to just over 500 &mdash; mainly male-dominated &mdash; coming from all parts of Tipperary.  Their wages are in excess of £5 million per annum and have proved to be of great benefit to the area.</P>
      <P>Within a very few miles of the Silvermines there is a very poor area, Sliabh Felim, part of which has been designated as a disadvantaged area under the EEC disadvantaged areas scheme.  The existence of the Mogul operation for the past 15 years has been of tremendous benefit to this area.  It is a sorry day for North Tipperary that that period of prosperity is coming to an end.  I want to ask the Minister to try to extend the period of operation of the Mogul mines to ensure that we can obtain the maximum benefit from this natural resource and to allow us time to attract an alternative industry and ensure that the impact of the closure of Mogul mines will be softened as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody has known for several years that the Mogul mines operation had to come to an end.  In 1978-79 there was great concern because the value of ore on the world market was at a new low. <Col N="260" /> People were concerned that Mogul might not be able to continue in operation. Thankfully the price of ore rose and the immediate concern passed.  In 1979 it was anticipated that the Mogul operation would continue for another four or five years and it was estimated that there was sufficient ore left in the ground to keep the business in operation for at least five years and possibly six or seven years. Now, three years later, because of the rise in energy costs the Mogul operation can no longer continue.  I say it can no longer continue because it is a private enterprise that must make money if it is to continue in being.  Unfortunately the imposition of increased electricity charges has forced the mine in the last year or two into a loss-making operation which the company feel they cannot tolerate. That is the problem we have to deal with tonight.</P>
    <P>A few minutes ago the Minister said that action was needed.  Whatever about the National Enterprise Agency or the National Development Corporation and the action he is about to provide for them, let me assure him that he is right: action is needed in relation to the problem I am outlining.  Given the expressed commitment of the Government to maintain employment at its highest peak and ridding ourselves, in so far as we can, of unemployment, I have every confidence the Minister will commit himself to giving the kind of assistance I am asking to enable this company to continue in operation.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House I want to indicate the type and extent of the operation we are talking about.  The Silvermines operation is enormous, employing over 500 people.  Each year salaries and wages amount to over £5 million.  One can imagine the effect this money has on what is largely a rural community.  The State is a great beneficiary.  In 1980-81 the State received £1.4 million by way of income tax and PRSI contributions.  CIE, our national transport company, in freight charges alone received £302,000 in 1981 and the local authority, of whom I am a member and who are always concerned about financial difficulties, in 1982 would stand to benefit by a sum in excess <Col N="261" /> of £80,000 in rates.  This operation is very important in an area which can be readily identified as having a declining population. I do not want to go into that point at the moment because we do not have the time.</P>
    <P>The cost to the State in unemployment benefit in 1982-83 if the Mogul operation closes has been estimated at £5 million. The problem facing the people of North Tipperary was not the inevitable closure of the mines &mdash; we knew that was going to happen &mdash; but the people were shocked and horrified at the proximity of the closure date announced by Mogul.  I regret having to say all this because Mogul have played an important part in the economic and social life of my constituency but the fact remains that they did not conduct themselves well when they announced on 4 February that the mines would not last longer than the end of July in any circumstances.  The requirement under statute is to give two months' notice which means that the mines could be closed before the end of July.  That sort of time scale is not sufficient for the IDA to do all they need to solve our problems nor is it sufficient for the Minister or the Government, to try to solve that problem.</P>
    <P>I am particularly shocked that the board of Mogul gave that sort of notice in view of the fact that there were constant negotiations between public representatives, the county manager, the IDA and Mogul on an ongoing basis for the past few years.  For example, on 4 February the county manager met representatives from the board of Mogul and he did not get any indication that an imminent closure was planned.  On 26 February Mr. White, managing director of the IDA, met representatives of the company, six days before the announcement of the closure, but no indication was given that it was planned to close the mines next July at the latest.</P>
    <P>In my view this company have given a lot to County Tipperary but they have also got a lot out of the county.  They have made many millions of pounds profit from our rich natural resource but they have a responsibility to discharge <Col N="262" /> and they have not done so.  Having criticised Mogul, in fairness, I must compliment them.  The redundancy payments for their workers have been extremely generous.  The redundancy provisions they have made are over five times their statutory obligations.  While I compliment them for that, I in no way accept that as discharging their responsibility to help to organise some sort of handover in employment to agencies like the IDA who have a massive job trying to find alternative positions to cushion the blow for the people in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The IDA have been conscious of the difficulties which would arise by the closure of these mines.  In their industrial plan published in 1978 they articulated the problems that would be faced in the North Tipperary region by the closure of the Silvermines which they regarded as a predominant consideration.  Although the IDA have come nowhere near a situation which will ensure that the impact of this closure will be minimised to a significant extent, they have done a fair amount.  They have been working hard to promote new industries in the region.</P>
    <P>Having complimented the IDA I have a word of criticism also regarding what they have indicated in a recent press statement about what they have done.  I do not know whether the Minister has seen the press release concerned but I assume he has the information.  In that press release the IDA indicate, though they do not so state expressly, that 550 jobs have been provided as a result of promotion by them since 1978-79.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Very many of the industries listed in that press release pre-existed the IDA industrial plan for 1978-82.  While they were grant-aided, some 300 of them pre-existed the plan.  The fact is that the IDA have attracted five new industries into the Nenagh area in the past three or four years.  These are industries in respect of which the IDA said that at full production there would be 711 jobs involved, whereas the outturn has been 211 jobs. One can see readily therefore that the work has not been done, that the IDA have not had sufficient time to minimise the impact of the closure of the mines. <Col N="263" /> The reality is that not enough industry has been introduced to make an impact on the area.  In these circumstances the IDA must be given a greater opportunity to fulfil their responsibilities, a responsibility that I am very confident they can fulfil.  In order to promote the area it will be necessary to designate it.  I am confident that the Minister will give them the resources they need but the critical factor is that of time.  I am hoping that the IDA will be given the necessary time as a result of this discussion tonight.</P>
    <P>The only alternative to the closure of the mines is the provision of additional jobs in the area and that is why the IDA must attract new industry to the region. In this way we will be ensuring that the £5 million that is available there by way of wages will not be lost but that cannot be done in the course of two or three months.  The mining operation must be continued until the £1 million or more tons of ore are exploited and in that context we are talking about a period of 18 months.  The company have lost money in the past year or two.  Their biggest burden for this year is an ESB bill estimated at £2.3 million.  I am asking the Minister to subsidise that energy bill so that the mine may continue in operation for at least 18 months after July next and in order to give the IDA a breathing space in which to get on with the job of attracting alternative industry to the area.</P>
    <P>There are compelling arguments in favour of that subsidy.  Although the company have been losing money the fact remains that there is a natural resource under the ground in the Silvermines and that the machinery for its extraction is available.  As a general principle the Government should ensure that the ore is extracted because regardless of what price fluctuations there may be in the price of this mineral in the future it will never again be economical to mine it if we allow the machinery to be run down or sold.</P>
    <P>The IDA have plans for the building of a 24,000 sq. ft. advance factory at Lisbonney. Planning permission is being applied for but there is no prospect of all <Col N="264" /> that procedure being completed and the factory being built within a few months. The factory must be built in order to attract new industry to the area but we must give the IDA sufficient time. Another factor is the availability of talented fitters and other workers at the mine.  These are people who could be employed in other industries but we must have these other industries first.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter is that the State would save about £5 million in 1982-83 in terms of unemployment benefit, pay-related benefits and so on.  That is a strong argument for keeping the mine open for a further period.  In addition, the State will gain about £1.14 million by way of PAYE returns and pay-related payments in that time while CIE will benefit to the tune of between £300,000 and £450,000 by the mine being kept open.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a site in North Tipperary which has a tremendous infrastructural advantage.  There is an unlimited water supply and an electricity supply which would cost a fortune to introduce into a new area.  This makes it ideal for the introduction of another heavy industry but if it is not possible to attract such an industry the IDA must endeavour to bring in a number of industries to the site.  Otherwise it will go to loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude as quickly as possible.  The revenue generated in the <Col N="265" /> area is of great importance.  The figures given to the Minister are sufficient grounds for the subsidisation I am asking for.  There are many instances of companies being subsidised in this way.  In their last days in office the Coalition were presented with the proposal to close the mine and they sent in consultants to examine the feasibility of subsidisation. I understand that the report which resulted from that exercise is on the Minister's desk and I hope that he will give it favourable consideration.  The chairman of the board of the company has indicated that if they are subsidised in this way they will be prepared to keep the plant in operation for as long as possible but not in a situation in which they continue to lose money.  The Lisbonney factory in itself will not be sufficient.  I have never known the IDA to go into an area where there was an impending closure without saying that they were giving that area top priority, but more is needed in this case.  The region must be designated for a limited period.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation of Government offices is something that Deputy O'Kennedy knows all about.  He has indicated that the Government will provide the necessary finance to establish offices of the Revenue Commissioners in Nenagh.  I urge the Deputy to put his weight behind this move so as to ensure that the necessary office building can be provided and that we can look forward to up to 200 civil servants coming into the area.</P>
      <P>I trust that the commitment made by Fianna Fáil in the course of the general election campaign to provide £5 million for the development of the sugar factory in Thurles will be honoured.  The Sugar Company plans to invest only £3.6 million in the Thurles factory in the next four to five years.  That is why I hope that the finance promised by Fianna Fáil will be forthcoming and that investment will be made in that plant in Thurles within the next couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to meet the deputation which the local county development team will be requesting him to meet.  I was at a meeting in Nenagh last night.  I <Col N="266" /> understand Deputy O'Kennedy could not be there.  I ask the Minister to involve himself actively.  He must provide the impetus between the company, the local authority and the IDA to ensure that this operation stays active for a year and a half to provide alternative employment in the area to prevent the dreadful economic shock which will hit north Tipperary in the event of the closure of Mogul of Ireland and to provide an opportunity for the people employed there to start new industries and get alternative jobs and keep the employment clock ticking over, difficult though that is, in the constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister is giving me five minutes of his time.  This matter has been of considerable importance in the area for some time.  I am glad to have the opportunity to add my voice to what Deputy Molony has said.  I should like to give some encouragement and reassurance to the people in the area having regard to the record of the Government now in office. The Minister has shown that the activity of the Government is being maintained. He has just got the consultants' report.  I know he will receive a deputation from the county development team which he was asked to do at the meeting last night. Deputy Molony went into a number of details which the Minister can hardly have considered since the report has just arrived on his desk.  If the Minister receives this deputation it will be an encouragement and reassurance to the people of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The activities of the Fianna Fáil Government in regard to this mine give scope for encouragement and reassurance.  I <Col N="267" /> was a member of the Government in 1978-79 when the difficulties arose.  The arrangement made by the Government with Mogul at that time ensured that their activities would continue up to now at least.  I cannot say what happened over the past six-and-a-half or seven months. It is a little surprising that the then Government should have been taken by surprise because there were indications that this might happen.  I agree with Deputy Molony that, when the proposed closure came, it came as a shock.  I cannot imagine why Deputies on the Government side of the House at that time could not have alerted the Minister and asked him to be a little more active.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The company did not say anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They should have been aware of what the public were conscious of at the time.  Time has been lost but I am confident that the Minister and the Government will make up for it.  The five industries spoken about by Deputy Molony were established in the area during the period 1977-81 by the Government of the day.  We must look at the projections for increased employment in these industries which were established for that specific purpose.  I know the Minister will address himself to that matter to maximise employment in the industries which were established in the Nenagh industrial estate &mdash; which is behind my own house &mdash; and which I was instrumental in having established, and in the new industrial estate which, as a member of the Government, I was also instrumental in having established, and in the advance factory.  We have a 60-acre site which is almost unique.  I am quite sure this consistent pattern will be maintained, including the development of an advance factory for the IDA.  This will involve a review of existing targets and I am sure that will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point refers to redundancy provisions.  It is vitally important that the provision I included, if I may say so modestly, in the Finance Act, 1980, when I was Minister for Finance, to increase the <Col N="268" /> exemptions for first-time redundancy to £10,000 is used to advantage in the area. This means that there must be consultations with the workforce on what they would see as being in the best interests of themselves and the company.  I am quite sure the Minister will ensure that the funds available to them will be used to provide alternative employment.</P>
    <P>I did not announce and I could not announce that the Government are going ahead with the decentralisation programme. I said that I am very confident the Government will cancel the decision of the previous Government who in turn cancelled the decision of the Fianna Fáil Government to put decentralised offices in Nenagh.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Molony for his good wishes for my success in my new Department.  I can assure him and Deputy O'Kennedy and the people of north Tipperary that no effort will be spared by me or any of the agencies under my control to solve the problems in north Tipperary.  I am very conscious of the tremendous shock caused to that area when the closure was announced.  It was not really news to the people of the area because it was known for three or four years that it would happen sooner or later.  We have to get in there and do as much work as possible in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go into all the efforts made by the IDA.  The chief executive of the <Col N="269" /> IDA was down there.  He had meetings with SFADCo and he did everything he could for the area.  He put various suggestions and propositions to the company. He has assured me that the company will assist the IDA in their promotional efforts in Canada and the USA to try to provide alternative employment as soon as possible.  I am sure everybody appreciates that every effort will be made by the IDA, SFADCo and myself to solve the problems.  We all know the social repercussions of a major closure of that kind.  We know the effect it has on the local economy.  I am concerned about the situation and I will do all I can to alleviate it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony made various suggestions and he appeared to be putting all the answers in my mouth.  His own Government were not unaware of the situation and, if some of the suggestions he made to me had been put to his own Government, they might have had some effects on the operations of Mogul.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows that <Col N="270" /> a limited amount of poor quality ore is available up to 1984.  The consultants' report arrived on my desk this morning. It was overoptimistic for Deputy Molony to jump the gun and expect that the conclusions in the report could have been analysed in a matter of hours.  He mentioned the ESB and the high cost of energy.  I want to remind Deputy Molony that last July his Government gave a 25 per cent increase to the ESB.  We did not want to give it to them and subsequent events have proved that we were correct. We saw what happened to the energy crisis in the past seven months.  If that Government had appreciated the problems in Deputy Molony's constituency and other constituencies we would not be feeling the repercussions we are having now.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has since made application to retain the car in the State on a temporary basis.  In order to qualify for temporary importation facilities for a car a person must establish to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that his only or principal place of residence is outside the State.  On the basis of the information supplied to date the commissioners are not satisfied that the person mentioned is so qualified and consequently the application has not been allowed.</P>

      <P>On 7 December 1981 a claim for disability benefit was received from the person concerned covering the period 30 November to 5 December 1981.  Payment was made at the maximum appropriate rate from 3 December, fourth day of incapacity to 5 December, after which date he was certified fit to resume work. He subsequently notified my Department that he had not been fit to resume work on 7 December and submitted medical evidence to that effect.  There was some delay in reconstituting the claim but all benefit has since been paid in respect of the period from 7 December to 4 January 1982 after which date it is understood the claimant resumed work.</P>

He appealed against the assessment of means <Col N="137" /> and his case was referred to an appeals officer for determination.  The appeals officer, whose decision is final, upheld the decision of the deciding officer assessing means at £30.80 weekly.</P>

All disability benefit due, less refund to the health board of supplementary welfare allowance advanced during December 1981, has been paid to 27 March 1982.

The Deputy's recent application on their behalf for an increase in their pensions has been investigated and is being referred to the local pension committee for decision.

All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due was paid to 22 June 1981, date of latest medical certificate received.  As no further medical evidence appeared to have been submitted his claim was closed at that date.</P>
      <P>It has since been ascertained that he submitted a final certificate, certifying him fit to resume work on 5 July 1981. However, he quoted a different RSI number on this certificate with the result that it was not associated with his claim. The balance of the benefit due to 4 July 1981 has since been paid.

      <P>Payment was made initially at the maximum personal rate as the claimant did not complete a claim form giving details of his dependants when making his claim. He then submitted a claim form giving details of his three children only and the adjustment due in respect of these children issued on 23 December 1981.

    <P>Normally in such cases payment of disability benefit is allowed pending inquiries as to the nature and origin of the <Col N="140" /> incapacity, but as the claimant had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions to his credit in the 1979-80 contribution year he has not qualified for such payment.

      <P>Inquiries regarding the nature and origin of the incapacity were, however, necessary and disability benefit and pay-related benefit were paid on an interim basis for the duration of both claims.</P>

      <P>His entitlement to pay-related benefit could not be determined as details of his reckonable earnings for 1979-80, the tax year relevant to his claim, were not available to my Department.  He was requested on 22 January 1982, to furnish an employer's statement giving details of his earnings in that year but so far no reply has been received from him.  A further request has now issued and on receipt of a reply pay-related benefit due, if any, will be issued.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the extremely high rent increases imposed recently on tenants of Dungarvan Urban Council and due to be imposed shortly on tenants of Waterford County Council; and if he will have the matter examined in the light of a recent circular from his Department to ensure that no increase will be in excess of £2.50 a week.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to implement the terms of the 1982 national differential rents scheme in accordance with the guidelines contained in circular letter H.R. 8/81 issued by my Department on 16 October 1981.</P>
      <P>The principles underlying the scheme is that tenants of local authority dwellings, should pay a reasonable contribution towards the cost of their housing in accordance with their ability to pay.  The maximum rent determined under the scheme, based on the up-dated cost of the dwelling, is the most a tenant has to pay.  Tenants who paid maximum rents under the 1980 scheme will, under the new scheme, have their rents increased by, at most, £2.50 per week, but only if their incomes warrant an increase of that amount.  On the other hand, tenants who were not previously paying maximum rents may, if their current incomes and family circumstances, including new subsidiary earners, warrant it, be required to pay increases greater than £2.50 per week.</P>
