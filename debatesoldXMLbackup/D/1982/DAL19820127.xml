      <P>I welcome the decision to raise the amount of money being allocated from central funds to Bord Iascaigh Mhara from £15 million to £40 million. The Minister has described the Bill as a relatively small piece of legislation and felt it would not take a lot of time to pass through the House.  In my view it is important, involving as it does a vast amount of money and increasing the allocation available to BIM for the provision of loans and grants by £25 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech contains a number of interesting items and overall gives a thorough rundown of the activities of BIM and the Irish fishing industry.  He informed the House that the board had withdrawn completely from active participation <Col N="196" /> in fish processing and marketing. He said that they now operate as a development body for the industry.  It is a pity that BIM have withdrawn from the processing and marketing sector because they are the main areas in which the fishing industry has failed over the past 50 or 60 years.  Marketing here is done in a very slipshod manner and at most times fresh fish supplies are not available to the majority of people here.  Provincial towns and villages do not get a regular supply of fish on any day of the week not alone on Fridays.  Some efforts were made to rectify the situation but I do not think they were serious enough.  The result is that home consumption of Irish-caught fish is limited.  Invariably if one wants to ensure that one has fish for a particular meal one has to resort to tinned fish, most of which is imported although originally the fish may have been caught in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>In my view the need for a proper marketing system is a basic requirement for that industry but we have never developed it.  The only place where people can get a constant supply of fish is on the shelves of local supermarkets and shops and that is not a satisfactory situation. On many occasions in this House I have drawn attention to the fact that we export thousands of tons of fresh or frozen fish annually whether it is herring or mackerel, as it is more likely to be at present, and much of that fish returns here in processed form.  Therein lies a reason for great concern by us all.  Our fishing industry has as many people employed at sea as it has on shore in processing and other ancillary activities.  The ratio is 1:1 while in Holland and Denmark the ratio is of the order of 1:6 or 1:7.  In other words, for every man out fishing there are six or seven people employed in processing or other ancillary industries.  That statistic should make us sit up and pay attention to our lack of business acumen and initiative as far as fish processing is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some play about the board helping private people and private companies to enter this business, but we must admit that this has not been the success wished for.  This problem has not <Col N="197" /> arisen recently; it has been in existence for many years.  Our fishing industry employs approximately 6,500 people around our coasts, part-time or full-time, in the processing end.  If we worked to the same ratio as on the Continent, the number employed would be between 36,000 and 40,000.  The Minister should bear in mind, in connection with employment and lack of it, that this is a sphere which must surely be very seriously examined.  We have a potential for approximately 30,000 extra jobs and there has not been a serious national effort to provide those jobs in the processing sector.  On the other hand, we are exporting jobs.  We hear a great deal about exporting cattle on the hoof and providing jobs for people in the processing sector in other countries.  We are, and have been, exporting fish probably on a greater scale and thereby exporting jobs.</P>
    <P>I am told that last Sunday 140 container lorries left the port of Castletownbere with fresh mackerel, mainly for the Continent. I am sure that Deputy Sheehan will have something to say on that subject later on.  On another day during the weekend 102 container lorries left the same port with the same raw material. That raw material will be processed, primarily in fellow member countries of the EEC, thereby providing a vast number of jobs which could well be provided here.  Through the winter there have been photographs of dozens of Dutch and East European vessels anchored off the pier of Rathmullen in County Donegal.  Thousands of tonnes of fish have been taken out of this country in the past year by the East Europeans and our fellow members of the EEC, fish in the raw state, or sufficiently frozen for transport to the Continent, where they will be processed. While this may be of benefit to the fishing industry, and probably is their lifeline at present, that is not the answer to the problem.  Those fish should, and must, be processed at home.  There is a serious imbalance in this regard in comparison with our European partners.  We employ a fraction of what should be employed in the processing business.  Furthermore, most times you cannot even buy this fish on our market.  We have failed very badly <Col N="198" /> in the marketing and processing sectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister should get An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, or whatever agency is responsible, to concentrate on those two very important areas, marketing and processing.  The other side effect of the lack of marketing and processing means the dumping every day of valuable fish. Only two months ago, in Rossaveal, County Galway, thousands of pounds worth of good, fresh herring were dumped into the sea because there was an over-supply situation.  Our few processing plants, the fish meal factories, were unable to deal with the quantities caught.  It was terrible to hear on television fishermen from Rossaveal and other Galway ports telling RTE reporters that they had no option but to catch fish knowing that they must dump them.  They went out and caught the fish, brought them to port, the fish were marked with dye, and dumped back in the sea the following day.  Surely that indicated that the fishing industry is not properly managed or organised.  It is a disgrace.  Millions of people around the world are under-nourished, or actually starving, and we are dumping top quality food.  I do not know whose job it is, but that situation must be stopped because it cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is absolutely ridiculous that we are importing huge quantities of herring, in particular, from third countries, primarily Canada, Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands.  The Minister stated last night that he is opposing this type of third country importation. He should veto it.  It has grave implications for our fishing industry.  Our fishermen have suffered severely in recent years, particularly in the last two or three years, due to seemingly unlimited importation of fish from third countries.  The Minister spoke about a 15 per cent import duty to be put on these imports, but that is not sufficient.  It will not stop the flow. We need extremely strict quotas and a vast reduction in the present quotas. Fishermen have not been able to sell their produce in recent years at a reasonable price and have not been able to meet their loan repayments to BIM because the price of fish in many cases is less than <Col N="199" /> what pertained three to five years ago.</P>
    <P>While everything else, in particular the price of diesel oil, has gone up, the price for fish in many cases has actually decreased and in most cases has remained static, because of the flood of imports from third countries.  Our partners within the EEC, in particular Germany, the Netherlands and France, are responsible for that state of affairs.  It suits them to trade their consumer goods and other finished commodities to Canada, Norway and Iceland and in return to accept a cheap over-supply of fish.  That is completely against the interests of our fishing industry and that situation should not be allowed to continue.  We must stop that in-flow of cheap herring and other fishery products.</P>
    <P>Canada, Iceland and other foreign countries have a 200 mile limit which is strictly implemented.  We have a six mile limit in most places, 12 miles at the maximum, and by the end of 1982 that limit will be zero if we do not come to an agreement on a common fisheries policy. As a result of the vast area of fishing grounds available to these countries, their catches are enormous and they can afford to sell them off at a very low price which certainly cannot be competed with by our fishermen.  We have enough problems with our tiny limits, with fleets from the other EEC countries around our shores, and most of our fisheries are closed to the fishing of herring.  A ban has been necessary because of over-fishing by foreign fleets in years gone by and, unfortunately, by some of our native fleets in recent years.  We must face up to the fact that we have been over-doing it ourselves at times.  We will have to face up to the threat to the Irish fishing industry because of cheap imports from third countries.  Again much of these cheap imports are processed by the countries I have mentioned, Germany or Holland, and they are imported into Ireland.  Much of the fish on the shelves of shops or supermarkets, which we have to buy because of a lack of a continuous supply of fresh fish, is imported.  The vast majority of the tinned and processed fish we use here is imported and it has come in <Col N="200" /> as a cheap product from the countries that I have already mentioned.  So we have a most serious situation in regard to marketing and processing and I have seen no real attempt to solve the problem over the past ten, 15 or 20 years.  To see the fleets of lorries coming from Killybegs or Castletownbere, or the fleets of ships, boats and luggers going out at Rathmullen in County Donegal indicates that there has not been any solution to the problem.  Sooner or later we must wake up to that fact and provide the processing facilities that are so lacking in this country.</P>
    <P>I referred to the closure of many fisheries around this country at present.  We on the south coast in particular have a grievance regarding the closure of the Celtic Sea.  The present situation is not satisfactory.  Officially the Celtic Sea is closed and unofficially it is open.  There is quite a conflict of interests because what the big trawlermen want does not necessarily suit the inshore fishermen. One cannot ever satisfy everybody but I would like to see the Minister draw up a solution which would go a long way towards satisfying the majority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Send for Solomon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no Solomon either.  It is most unlikely that we will get a solution which would satisfy everybody. But at present we do not know exactly what the stocks of herring are in the Celtic Sea and I have repeatedly brought that to the notice of this House.  We are told that the figures are reliable but the fishermen are not happy that the estimates given are correct.  Large numbers of herring were caught in the Celtic Sea last year and this year, which seems to verify the opinion of the fishermen that stocks are much greater than was stated by the research branch in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  I would like to see a situation where the small inshore fisherman would be allowed to catch a definite quota of fish and where the same would hold for the trawlerman but in a different region.  A system will have to be devised whereby the small man and the trawlerman will not be in conflict.  There <Col N="201" /> is a living to be had for both from the Celtic Sea but unfortunately at the moment the price of herring is too low. The small fishermen on the south coast &mdash; and there are very many of them &mdash; are having a disastrous year.  Some system will have to be introduced whereby they will have an opportunity to catch and sell fish and make a decent living. They are being offered £5 a box for herring at the moment whereas four or five years ago they got £15 or £20 for a similar box of herrings.  Many of them have had to give up fishing and draw the dole because there is no future in fishing; they cannot make a living at that price.  I ask the Minister seriously to review the situation and set up a system whereby the small inshore fisherman and the trawlerman can live in harmony and make a living.  The fish are there if there was a proper system for catching them.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about the increase in the size of boats and in the cost of boats.  He says that because of the rapidly rising cost of these boats and the tendency to use increasingly larger boats, together with the modernisation of the existing fleet, he intends to raise the limit to £40 million.  Later on he says that other measures are in hand to make fishing operations more efficient and thereby more profitable.  He has other comments to make also.  But the theme of the Minister's statement is that boats are getting bigger and techniques are getting more advanced and therefore we are catching more fish.  Of course, there is a certain element of truth in that but there is also a dangerous underlying background and we should be very careful that as the boats get bigger and as the catching techniques improve we do not exterminate the supplies of fish around our coast.  That is a real danger and it has been highlighted in recent weeks by none other than Joey Murrin who is one of the leading experts here on fish management measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dutch virtually exterminated the stocks of herring around the Irish coast ten or 15 years ago.  The Dutch were primarily responsible for this but we were also partly to blame.  Now we seem to be in the process of exterminating the stocks <Col N="202" /> of mackerel around this coast.  Mackerel are at present the greatest money-spinner here for fishermen.  There are vast quantities which we were unaware of &mdash; or maybe were not there &mdash; years ago.  There are vast quantities and we seem to be catching them in unlimited quantities despite the fact that we have been warned about overfishing by the ICES, which is the international body which researches the quantities available and advises as to the total allowable catch.</P>
    <P>From statistics recently released by that body it is obvious that we have been seriously over-fishing our mackerel stocks which are primarily off the Donegal coast and are often up to 150 miles from the coast.  I have asked in this House before how do we monitor those stocks and how do we monitor the catches.  I am told that the Naval Service do it periodically.  I have the greatest respect for the Naval Service but they are over-stretched.  They have to patrol 2,000 miles of coastline and they do not often get out to that distance of 150 or 200 miles.  It is a physical impossibility.  It has been maintained by people who know that this huge resource is being decimated because it is being over-fished.  I am definitely of the opinion that we do not know exactly what is out there and even if we did we are not in a position to control the catches.  If that mackerel fishery closes, if it collapses due to over-fishing, the fishing industry here will once again be on its knees and this time there may be no recovery because there may not be a further fishery to be found.</P>
    <P>When the herring fishery was ruined by over-fishing the fishing industry here was in a dire plight.  People returned to inshore white fishing and that was badly over-fished.  Now we have discovered this huge mackerel fishery.  If that is destroyed we may not have any alternative. The Minister in raising the amount from £15 million to £40 million should provide bigger and better boats and better techniques.  We must bear in mind the danger of exterminating our valuable mackerel fishery.  There is a great temptation to go out and make a lot of money but that would be a very shortsighted <Col N="203" /> policy.  This must be controlled and monitored and that is not being done at present.</P>
    <P>Not only are our fishermen catching huge quantities of fish but other European countries are as well.  Huge boats from the Channel Islands and from Britain have been found fishing off our coasts.  To make matters worse such boats do not originate from the Channel Islands or Britain but from countries such as Spain.  Our laws and regulations have been circumvented so that boats are registered in places like Britain and are therefore legally entitled to make huge catches of fish off our coasts.  There must be some way of blocking the shady practice of registering third country boats within the EEC.  If it is allowed to continue it could do untold harm.</P>
    <P>In many places we only have a six mile limit.  There is a maximum of 12 miles. At the end of 1982 we will not have any fishery limit unless there is agreement on a common fishery policy.  After five years of haggling no agreement has emerged. Perhaps the Minister might be able to tell us if he has any hopes that such agreement will be reached by the end of 1982 and give some indication of its terms.</P>
    <P>While speaking about bigger boats and better techniques I should have mentioned the most devastating fishing technique of all which has been banned in many parts of the world because of its destructive nature.  I refer to purse seining. While many countries have banned this method of fishing because it destroys fisheries, we still tolerate it.  In reply to a parliamentary question before Christmas the Minister said there were no plans to restrict purse seining off our coasts.  Such thinking is retrograde.  `There must be some restriction on purse seining because one can wipe out a fishery within a year by using this method, which means that one encircles whole shoals and collects them into one huge purse seine net.  We allow this method to be used <i>ad nauseum.</i> There must be some restriction put on it. The Minister should give some indication of how the salmon industry can be saved. Many of the fishermen who will benefit <Col N="204" /> from this scheme operate small inland salmon fishing boats.</P>
    <P>The 1981 season was to all intents and purposes a disaster.  They caught only a fraction of what was taken in previous years.  The price was static and in some cases went down, primarily because of cheap imports from Canada.  The salmon industry is in a state of crisis.  Has the Minister any solution to the problem?  I read newspapers reports recently which stated that one of the main reasons for the depletion of salmon stocks was not, as has been repeatedly stated, over-fishing by driftnet fishermen off the west and south coasts but is due to the fact that the Faroese are netting these fish out in the open sea at great depths.  For many years the path taken by the salmon coming and going from our rivers was a mystery.  The fishermen of the Faroe Islands have discovered the run of the salmon in the ocean.  They are catching them in huge quantities.  In 1981 it was estimated that they caught 1,600 tons of salmon.  If mackerel or herring was involved 1,600 tons would not be a great quantity but it is a tremendous amount of salmon.  If this kind of catch is maintained by the Faroese there will be no salmon fisheries left. Our fishermen will not be able to repay loans to BIM.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are in dire straits with regard to repayment of loans because of the collapse of the inshore herring industry. If the salmon industry goes they will be on their uppers.  What steps is the Minister taking to deal with this?  What steps are the EEC taking to see that this kind of fishing by the Faroese is limited? I do not know if the Faroese are members of the EEC because of their relationship to Denmark, whether they are associate members or have any connection at all with the EEC.  Their activities must be restricted as must those of fishermen from Greenland who have been netting unreasonable quentities of salmon.  It is this kind of mass catching of salmon which has put our industry into jeopardy. Out of the 6,500 people employed as fishermen at present, one-half are depending on salmon for a livelihood.  If the decline in salmon catches continues it will have grave repercussions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> The Minister referred to the improvement in the quality of navigational aids. There was an insinuation in recent days by people in Britain that navigational standards here are below those warranted by international law.  That is a very serious allegation.  The Minister might use his reply to the debate to refer to these malicious statements.  It has been stated that boats are being registered in Ireland under a flag of convenience and that the standards in this country are not what they should be.  That is an extremely grave allegation.  People should be made to explain fully what they need.  I hope the inquiry into the loss of the <i>Union Star</i>, which was the basis of the allegation, and the Penlee lifeboat will show that standards here are as good as anywhere in the maritime world.  We do not want to be classified with Liberia or Panama as being irresponsible in the manner in which we register and control our shipping. Our seamen are second to none in navigational and other skills.  They are to be found in top positions in every merchant shipping outlet in the free world. The Minister should make some reference to the allegation being made that there is a substandard level of manning of ships working out of this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  BIM are doing a fine job.  The money is needed badly, and I hope that the catches, marketing and processing by our fishing industry will justify the amount being spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House understand the reason for the amendment to the Sea Fisheries Bill.  We realise that BIM have need of more than the £15 million available up to now and it is reasonable to extend that amount to £40 million because of inflation, the increased prices of boats and the tendency to go in for bigger boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sea fisheries, many people seem to look upon this £40 million as money that we will need to build up our fleet and improve our fisheries.  It is vital that we talk today about how the money will be spent and particularly where it will be spent.  Two years ago I inherited a situation where we saw with great flag-waving, super-trawlers coming <Col N="206" /> into our fleet.  Maybe that was very necessary because at the time we had a commitment to doubling our catch and we had to prove our ability to do that.  These trawlers cost very big money and that money was all spent abroad.  The trawlers had very sophisticated equipment and so were particularly suitable for catching mackerel, and possibly we were very lucky that that was so.  I must compliment the people involved, particularly the small fishermen.  Many of them came up through the ranks of BIM in training school and they showed faith in the future of the fishing industry when they were prepared to invest so much money in it.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves now when the fishermen fishing off our coast are not getting a good living whether we should encourage others to go into the fishing business and buy bigger boats.  There is a danger.  When we entered the EEC we got a commitment from them, because of the smallness of our catches and of our fleet and the low percentage &mdash; 2 per cent &mdash; of our catch in comparison with the total catches in the EEC countries, that we would double our quota by 1980.  We achieved that target and great credit is due to the people involved, particularly the fishermen who went out and caught those fish.  However, from now on we can expect only small annual increments to be added to that quota for Ireland.  There are restrictions in many areas some of which have been mentioned here.  There is a restriction on herring in certain parts of our sea.  Everybody who has spoken has indicated a great uncertainty about the future.</P>
    <P>I must say with reluctance that as far as the Irish fishing industry is concerned our entry into the EEC and our experience therein have been a fiasco. We talk of total allowable catches and quotas, and I am positive that this is purely on paper, that there is no proper monitoring of the total allowable catch or of quotas either, nor are these quotas adhered to.  When people come in and fish where they are not supposed to be and pay fines far in excess of anything we would hope to collect from them and pay them readily, we may say to ourselves that with the limited facilities we have <Col N="207" /> probably we are catching only a small percentage of what the people breaking the law are catching, and then all this talk of quotas and total allowable catches becomes meaningless.  However, as we have accepted them and we make a great fight about them and look for extra quotas and extra tonnage on the different species, assuming that everybody is living according to the law, we may ask ourselves if we have the capacity at the moment to catch our quota.  I think that we have.  Are we likely to get a bigger quota in the future?  The answer must be no.  Probably we will get a percentage but I do not believe that the figure will be inflated to any great extent.</P>
    <P>We must ensure then that this £40 million will be spent to the best advantage. The best thing we can do with that is to encourage our existing fleet at all levels to modernise, to get bigger gear and equipment so that they will be better able to catch our quota efficiently.  This is vital because of the increase in the price of diesel oil.  BIM are making and effort to encourage new types of fishing and the catching of new species, but I do not know whether it is accelerated to the extent that I would like to see.  I have heard much talk about how the Spaniards make a great amount of money catching hake, that traditionally we do not catch this species and we should endeavour to get people to catch it.  Have we really encouraged people to go long-lining?  We have not done so to the extent that I would like to see.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates this year reveals a cutback in the amount of money available to BIM and in general in the amount available to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  There is not a hell of a difference between the extra money needed to go full steam ahead and the money allocated to keep things barely ticking over and give the impression of doing something.  I get the impression that the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and BIM are at anchor now and marking time.  We should not stifle the Department or BIM for lack of money. BIM have done much good work and they were prepared to chart new grounds <Col N="208" /> and give the charts to fishermen to encourage them to go further out and avoid rocks and wrecks in fishing grounds that were not known to them formerly, particularly off our west coast where some of the bigger boats should be encouraged to go.  I have seen them experimenting with new methods and I am glad to say that they have discovered new markets.  They have encouraged fishermen to diversify their catches.  I am pleased particularly to compliment them on their wonderful work with the training of young fishermen and on the fact that they were not prepared to rest on their oars but got mobile units to travel around the country bringing training facilities and sophisticated training necessary today to the harbours and to the fishermen themselves.  That is what development means.  We talk about it and we want to see it proceeding.</P>
    <P>However, there is a danger that BIM might forget their primary function.  The Minister says that they should concentrate more on promotional, advisory and developmental activities.  I had the impression at one time that they tended to forget their primary function and they were more inclined to blow their own trumpet than to do the work they set out to do.  That seems to have changed and I am glad that they are knuckling down to do that job and that they are more interested in helping the fishermen than merely giving the impression of great activity.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers who have urged the encouragement of processing and stated that everything we can do to increase the value of the catches before we export them should be done. I have seen quite a lot of work done, not, perhaps, processing to the extent that we might like to see, but the gutting and freezing of fish for Africa where we have a large market for mackerel.</P>
    <P>I agree with remarks deploring the dumping of herring.  If we could be assured that the sprat catches of the last two years could be repeated annually we could encourage the setting up of a cannery in the west.  Rossaveal might be a good place for processing because it will become a major fishery harbour.  During <Col N="209" /> the holidays this year I had my first opportunity of visiting it and I was impressed by what I saw.  In years to come it will be a major harbour and a great asset.  While we have a fishmeal factory in Killybegs in Donegal, such a factory would be warranted in Rossaveal as well.  It is fairly certain that a fishmeal factory will be built in the Castletownbere area and we would then be very well served in this respect.  I would also hope that there would be processing facilities in Rossaveal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy said that BIM have a duty to make Irish housewives more conscious of the food value of fish.  This is not easy because there still appears to be a stigma attached to eating fish on a Friday. At one time BIM used the advertising jingle &ldquo;My Mum has got a fresh idea&rdquo; but we must ask why fish is not readily available in inland areas or sometimes even at harbours.  The taste of Irish people has been changed to the extent that they now drink far more wine than heretofore &mdash; and this is a product which is not home produced &mdash; but the percentage increase in the consumption of fish is meagre.  BIM have done quite a lot by organising fish cookery competitions and encouraging young people in schools to learn the culinary arts in regard to fish but much more must be done to encourage suppliers to make fresh fish available throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy spoke about the dumping of fish and some people seem to assume that this should not happen.  The EEC pay fishermen a floor price for their fish if it does not reach a certain price on the open market.  When this compensation price is paid by the EEC the fish cannot be sold for human consumption and this is a good thing for fishermen. When fishermen go to sea they cannot be sure of making a catch or of the kind of fish they may catch and they would be at the mercy of the market but for this compensation. Deputy Deasy deplores the spraying of the fish with dye and dumping them offshore.  He also mentioned again the many people who are hungry.  I recall that our party were severely criticised in this matter.  However we pointed out that the fish was offered to charitable organisations <Col N="210" /> such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul but they had difficulty in taking it away.  Fine Gael now have an opportunity to find a solution so that no more fish will be dumped.  The backbenchers on the Government side have charged the Minister with that responsibility.  I got the distinct impression this morning that Deputy Deasy would solve that problem very easily if he had the opportunity.</P>

      <P>I did not solve it but I got the impression that Deputy Deasy would do so.  He mentioned the lack of facilities for fish processing and said that no attempt had been made to deal with the problem.  That is not correct.  In 1980 our mackerel catch was 24,000 tons and it increased in 1981 to 50,000 tons.  It is difficult to expect people to go to the expense of providing processing facilities unless continuity of supply is assured. Our capacity to process and freeze fish has been doubled in the past year, particularly in Killybegs, and I am confident that there will be continued expansion. When a catch increases from 24,000 tons one year to 50,000 tons in the following year it is only natural that some of this will be blast frozen and exported.  Fishermen cannot be expected to be patriotic at the expense of their pockets and they must be conscious of price.  If the freezer ships had not been in Rathmullan many of our fishermen would have been in trouble, but I hope that this will be a temporary arrangement until we are able to process our whole catch.  To make a comparison with the cattle industry, when marts and factories had a monopoly the primary producer suffered, although I am not making a case for the export of live cattle on the scale which now obtains. The fact that good prices are being offered by the freezer ships in Rathmullan may encourage the processers to offer a good price also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the advantage of having our fishing grounds on our own doorstep while others have to steam for a day or <Col N="211" /> two before they reach these areas, thus adding to their fuel bill.  Some will point out that the bonus we should enjoy is lost because of our distance from the European market.  I hope the Minister will be successful in his efforts to preserve our fishing grounds for Irish fishermen.  It is sad that meetings of Fisheries Ministers have failed to settle on a common fisheries policy.  The reason given last year was elections in various countries, but that excuse does not stand up.  There is too much jealousy and greed involved in this matter and, even when Ministers set dates for the finalisation of a policy, those dates pass without coming any nearer to a solution.  They fight about traditional rights and talk of third country imports and the Canadian agreement.  The EEC fishery policy has been a bit of a farce as far as Ireland is concerned, as any Irish fisherman would agree.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the Faroese and the amount of fish, particularly salmon, caught there.  Does anybody really believe it was 1,600 tons?  Who kept the log book and who really knows how much they caught?  When one would not know what happens in Fenit, County Kerry, sometimes with regard to salmon one would be very optimistic if one thought one knew what was happening with the Faroese.  There was a lot of talk at one time about how the log book should be drawn up, who should monitor it and ensure that it was open for inspection. Is that in operation?  Are the accounts being looked at?  Are people open to spot checks?  I do not believe they are.  I have come to the conclusion that a lot of what goes on at Fishery Ministers meetings is hot air and never finds its way into the world of reality and those matters which have a bearing on the day to day life of fishermen.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that other member states who have fished out their own grounds are looking with greedy eyes at our grounds.  Some of these people can make excuses and hide behind EEC directives, or they can put on a great show which almost amounts to a pantomime. I have seen richer states threaten us in regard to what they might do in <Col N="212" /> reprisals if certain agreements with foreign countries are not reached and if they are not allowed to import from third countries huge quantities of cod and other fish that would depress prices here and would stop many of our fishermen from earning a decent living.  There are others who fish for fishmeal and want to take everything they can from around our coasts and bring it home irrespective of the consequences.  They are probably the biggest culprits.  They are more cynical than anybody realises.  Their forefathers came here and raided years ago but they were honest enough to wear horns on their helmets so that they could be easily recognised for what they were.  The present brigade dispensed with the horns but they are much more dangerous to the future of our fishermen.  It is about time that all Fishery Ministers in Europe stopped codding the people, stopped their pious platitudes and decided that they have a job to do, and that is to give the fishermen left in Europe a decent standard of living and ensure that in future their families will be able to live off the sea's wealth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher mentioned Community preference.  There is a saying that you should christen your child first.  Member states should realise that.  Before we talk about imports from any third countries or before we talk about any members' fleets having the right to fish in foreign waters we have a duty to look after our fishermen and give the member states the preference they are not enjoying at the moment.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the £40 million it is vital that money spent on new boats and on modernising boats be spent at home and that BIM continue with their efforts to spend this money at home. Every boatyard in Ireland is in trouble at the moment.  Some have folded up.  We have boatyards in which generations of families have operated and their expertise is now likely to be lost.  There is a particular boatyard I have in mind which were capable of building a replica of an old sailing vessel, but that expertise is likely to be lost now.  I believe the Killybegs boatyard is in great difficulties.  The position is the same all around the coast. <Col N="213" /> We have a duty to help those people as much as we can.  Is it right to bring in more super-trawlers which are built abroad?  Is it right to embark on a policy that will make millionaires of a dozen people and put hundreds more out of business?  BIM have a duty to sell Irish. They have fostered a buy Irish campaign and they have a duty to sell Irish also.  I hope some effort can be made to keep our boatyards functioning and to see that our boats are modernised and built at home.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sale of fish and the consumption of fish at home I am glad of the new move among the fishermen in a co-op to sell fish and open outlets where fish can be available at a price which will suit the housewife's pocket.  I wish them well.  Any attempt to sell fish in that way up to now has not been successful.  I believe this will help to ensure that our fish is eaten at home and has not to be dumped.  We should ensure that a large percentage of the £40 million is spent at home and that it benefits as far as possible the people who catch the fish.</P>
    <P>I am under the impression that we are at the end of the line with regard to the huge subsidies and extensions to the quota we are allowed and that we can only hope for minimum increases each year.  We have the capacity around our very indented coastline to improve the standard of living of our fishermen.  I would like to refer in particular to mariculture, where we have great hope for the future.  We can encourage people to become involved in this.  This will supplement the income of people living around our coasts.  I regret that it is big firms who have gained the advantage up to now.  I know that they had to take the risk and that they had the money to enable them to do that.  We have a duty to help co-ops and encourage groups of fishermen to come together and fully exploit the potential of our coastlines.</P>
    <P>There should be some type of national policy for mariculture.  Up to now there have been many local discussions without any overall plan or uniformity.  There is a lot of expertise in this line in BIM and the Department have exceptional expertise at Abbotstown.  When our exploratory <Col N="214" /> fishing vessel becomes available there will be a greater opportunity to get the scientific knowledge we need.  We have a great national resource in mariculture. We should encourage shell fish culture around our coasts.  Deputy Gallagher mentioned oysters.  There is also a great future for scallops, mussels and even farm salmon.  Other countries have increased their farm salmon tonnage every year.  We should do that also.</P>
    <P>The overall national plan will deal with how licences are given in specific areas. It is good to see the involvement of the State in fisheries such as the St. George Fishery, which was recently acquired.  We should try to acquire other fisheries. Money for research is very vital.  Have we considered how much we spend on the monitoring of red tide, which could be fatal to our shell fish industry?  If we expand our mariculture programme we must also increase the money available for research as well and the monitoring of the dangers we will meet.</P>
    <P>For many years there has been a great deal of talk about Bord Iascaigh Mhara and loan repayments.  I would like to compliment them on their attitude to loans, despite the adverse criticisms they got about arrears of payments and subsidies on loans, about the lack of equity on loans and about the subsequent percentage repayments on loans.  I see in Bord Iascaigh Mhara an anxiety to help. They are a much maligned body.  I got the impression that every unfortunate fisherman, and lazy ones too, looked on Bord Iascaigh Mhara as a handy scape-goat when things did not go well.  The moratorium we embarked on with regard to loans and the loan subsidy we gave during this difficult period, were warranted and people should appreciate the difficult job facing Bord Iascaigh Mhara. These people should ask themselves if they would find similar loan facilities available in any other business.</P>
    <P>Last evening, when we were discussing the Foyle Fisheries, I complimented the Minister on honouring a promise I gave during my ministry with regard to increased fines and penalties.  By introducing that Bill yesterday he has brought uniformity as between Derry and <Col N="215" /> Donegal.  I thank him for that.  I would like to ask him to honour another promise I made which would bring uniformity between Donegal and Sligo and Mayo.  I am talking now about fishing regulations for salmon and licences granted.  In his wisdom many years ago the late Dr. Went decided that because of weather conditions and currents off the coast of Donegal 1,500 yards of net would be allowed.  For some reason that was never extended to other areas, although it would be very hard to see where the line could be drawn between the Mayo coast, which is every bit as exposed to the weather and as indented and dangerous as Donegal but where only 800 yards of net were allowed.  It is my belief that people are more likely to flout the law if they see it is more harsh in their case than in another case.  If there is uniformity and everybody seems to get a fair crack of the whip, that is better.</P>
    <P>On a couple of occasions I met fishermen from Killala Bay.  They had 800 yards of net but, because of the particular conditions which applied there and because of an old bye-law, they were permitted to cut their net and use 200 yards of net staked in the estuary.  Only four or five people were involved, because, to be honest, I do not suppose it was quite legal.  However, because of tradition I was anxious to facilitate them. I spoke to them in the presence of officials and went into the matter in great detail.  Subsequently we spoke to the chairman of the regional board, who was anxious to help.  He was anxious that the 1,500 yard concession granted to Donegal fishermen should be extended to the area under his jurisdiction and we decided to do that.  Other areas around the country got an opportunity to opt for this but some of them did not.</P>
    <P>When I expressed the opinion that we should make this 200 yards of net multiplied by four and thus make 800 yards legal in the Killala area, officials convinced me it would possibly be unconstitutional and could lead to frightful difficulties. I was foolish enough to agree. Provided we were prepared to turn a blind eye to the people who had been <Col N="216" /> fishing in the traditional way for years, on this basis&mdash;and this is on the file&mdash; we reached a gentleman's agreement. With the chairman of the local board we decided that for the few years these four or five people would be fishing in that manner we would give them a breathing space, the tradition would be phased out and all would then abide by the law as it is applied to everybody.  It is funny to use the phrase &ldquo;gentleman's agreement&rdquo;. Would that apply to females?  My experience leads me to believe that it would not apply in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case I saw a distinct reluctance to meet the wishes I expressed.  As the Minister agreed to honour an agreement I made involving greater penalties for salmon poaching between Derry and Donegal, I hope he will honour this other agreement I made. I left the Department in no doubt of my intention that these few fishermen would not be persecuted or prosecuted, as appears to be the Department's intention now.</P>
      <P>May I advise the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and Wildlife?  We are told of the dangers from wild mink, which are supposed to be particularly dangerous, and stoats and weasels &mdash; which thankfully we do not have &mdash; but it is my experience that a vicious vixen is probably the most dangerous animal to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity fishery organisations do not speak with one voice.  During my Ministry I tried to help them along that road when we set up the National Fishery Council.  The Minister would appreciate it if fishery representatives got together and spoke with one voice.  It is amazing the number of fishery organisations there are in existence.  One group who spoke for the bigger fishermen stood aloof when we tried to bring the National Fishery Council together.  At present fishing organisations are far too sectional and tend to be devisive.  The greatest example of this can be seen in the attitude to the opening to the Celtic Sea.  Deputy Deasy <Col N="217" /> said it was not open either officially or unofficially.  It is officially open.  After frightful pressure we got a concession that there would be 1,000 tonnes of herring available for small boats up to a certain size.  That was an effort to give a bonus to the small boat owners who were having serious difficulties and it was done in the hope that the bigger boats whose owners had an opportunity of going further out to sea and fishing in grounds that were not available to the smaller boats would move out there.</P>
    <P>I recall meeting these fishermen on one occasion and finding them critical in respect of the quotas.  I explained to them that the 1,000 tonnes quota in the Celtic Sea was all we would get and that if they refused to accept it, we would not get anything.  When I asked them to make a choice between the two they did not reply.  I notice now from television programmes that these people are flouting the law.  This highlights the difficulty caused by the different sectional interests in the fishing organisations.  It would be a distinct help if all these bodies could come together and co-operate with the Department and with BIM in doing what is best for everyone.  I am sure the Minister would be helped greatly, too, if the various interests could come to him with one voice.  This would strengthen his hand in fighting Ireland's case at Council of Ministers meetings.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of wishing Deputy Gallagher well in his new role as spokesman on fisheries for this party.  It is said that a trouble shared is a trouble halved.  I am not shedding any tears because of Deputy Gallagher taking over responsibility in this area.  I do not know of any other Deputy on either side of the House who is as well equipped as he to deal with this responsibility.  Mar is ias-caire é agus tá cleachtadh aige ar shaol na n-iascairí.  Tá me cinte go ndéanfaidh sé dea-obair ar son na tíre agus go gca-bhróidh sé an Aire freisin in aon obair dheacair atá á déanamh aige.</P>
    <P>It has struck me often that having regard to the numbers involved in the whole area of fishing &mdash; the Department, BIM and the fishermen who number about 9,000 &mdash; we should be able to monitor <Col N="218" /> the entire industry and to co-ordinate all the activities involved in the industry. This idea has been referred to by Deputy Gallagher in the context of the Office of Public Works and the various local authorities.  In regard to the development of our harbours, for instance, it is very necessary that we have the co-operation of everyone concerned and that we have co-ordination of effort.  This sort of work is very costly and, obviously, we must work to a plan.  There did not seem to be very much throught put into the arrangement whereby five, six or seven super-trawlers were to come into Killybegs and that with full loads of fish they would need 22 feet of water.  Nobody seemed to realise that there were not 22 feet of water available at the place at which they would be docking.  Sometimes, then, it seems as if the cart is put before the horse.  In a compact Department such as Fisheries there should not be too much effort required to put the pieces together in devising a common plan.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with a measure to provide more funds for BIM but our first priority as far as the EEC is concerned must be the common fisheries policy.  I am confident that the Minister will work towards attaining the best possible deal for Irish fishermen but if this business were concluded we would at least know where we were going.  Thereafter it would be imperative for us to do a cost-benefit analysis in order to ascertain whether we were getting value from the money we were spending.  Any such cost-benefit analysis would have to be tempered and weighed against the social needs of fishermen in depressed areas but our aim must be to develop the fishing industry to the maximum.  That involves getting proper prices for our fish and removing the uncertainty from the industry. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the common fisheries policy and taking into consideration such factors as imports of fish from third countries and also the likelihood of a decision that would have far-reaching effects, £40 million or even £400 million would not be sufficient unless we have a plan to work to but any plan will only succeed if based on what is <Col N="219" /> best for the future of Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>We support this measure and we compliment BIM on the good work they have done.  We hope they will be able to do even better in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a constituency which has the greatest area of coastline in the country I am well aware of the serious difficulties in the fishing industry.  It is well known that down through the years our fishing industry has been regarded as a Cinderella industry. We did not invest in that industry the moneys that were required to develop it and make it viable.  The raw materials are there in abundance but we have failed to take advantage of this situation.  We have failed hopelessly so far as the processing of fish is concerned, just as we have failed in the area of the marketing of the product. There are many large provincial towns in which one would not find fresh fish.  Steps must be taken to improve the marketing situation as well as the processing end of the business.  It is amazing that fish must be taken from such places as Killybegs and Castletownbere to the Dublin fish market.  We have had no system so far as delivering the fish back to the provincial towns is concerned.  Fish was put into deep freeze and left at various plants for weeks before being transported to the provincial towns.  As far back as the twenties and through to 1940 there was a lucrative market in the US for our marinated mackerel products but for some unknown reason successive Governments failed to give the necessary aid to the fish marinators and exporters to enable them to build up the industry. Consequently, that export industry was lost.  The Dutch marinate our herrings, pack them and export them to countries all over the world, including Ireland.  The Germans process herrings in beer and wine, pack them and send them back here for sale in our supermarkets.  One can find John West tinned mackerel in any shop or supermarket here but if one looks at the label one will find that the fish was packed in Japan.  We have brook trout packed in tins from Iceland.  We have millions of pounds worth of fish <Col N="220" /> fingers imported every year, backed up by television advertisements to sell them. We have millions of pounds worth of frozen plaice, turbot, brill and so on, imported from Canada and Norway. What is wrong with our industry that they cannot do something about alleviating that situation?</P>
      <P>We need modern blast freezing canning and smoking plants erected in our fishery areas, Killybegs, Castletownbere and other major fishery ports, which would process fish in this respect.  Our fishermen must be protected by an updated marketing system where fresh fish can be readily available in all our major towns.  Our fishing stocks must be protected from marauding foreign trawlers. I come from a peninsula in the south-west and for years I have seen the rape of our fishing grounds by foreign trawlers operating off the south-west coast.  Endless damage has been done by those foreign trawlers who are scooping up valuable fish from our seabed.</P>
      <P>Our traditional salmon fishermen should have a chance to make a living. Fishing must be done primarily in spring, summer and autumn because of the weather.  When our fishermen who have been working and fishing salmon for years apply for a salmon licence they are often refused.  This is disgraceful treatment because if they do not make a living out of fishing they will have to emigrate. The fishermen on the south-west coast are faced with other burdens also.  The net they are allowed to fish with is far too shallow in the strong tidal waters from Baltimore to the Dingle Peninsula where tides are very strong.  A greater depth of salmon fishing net should be allocated to them because if they are compelled to operate within the present limit the net will float on top of the water and will be useless for catching salmon.  I appeal to the Minister to see that they will be given the opportunity to make a living in this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Huge amounts of mackerel are being caught all over the south-west coast at present.  The north Atlantic Ocean is probably teaming with mackerel but weather plays a very vital part in fishing <Col N="221" /> at this time of the year.  Were it not for the present mild weather the huge shoals of mackerel would not be landed at Castletownbere. They would be landed every year from January to May if the weather was mild.  I was informed that 125 articulated trucks left Castletownbere on Friday loaded with mackerel for different destinations.  On Saturday and on Sunday evening about 140 articulated trucks loaded up again bound for Killybegs, where the processing plants are, for Scotland, England and the Continent.  This is a major industry in Castletownbere which we welcome.  There were four Russian factory ships in the harbour and each of those was getting its quota of fish also. The trawlers fishing off that coast at present are from as far north as Killybegs operating off Dingle and the Kenmare estuary and landing their catches in Castletownbere. This is a welcome innovation but the amount of labour given locally is not that great.  There are about 30 to 40 people only employed in the loading of those lorries.  There was a major fish plant built in Deenish Island which is a bit of a disappointment because it is not handling the amount of fish which it should be handling or giving the employment it should be giving.</P>
    <P>By reason of its geographical position, Castletownbere, one of our major fishery ports, is at a great disadvantage because it has not got a national secondary road leading into it from Glengarriff to Castletownbere, a distance of 23 miles.  A few months ago I described that stretch of road as the Burma strip.  If we want to see our fishing industry survive in that area it is of vital importance that we upgrade the road to national secondary status immediately.  I hope the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment will see that this is done as soon as possible. It is badly needed to facilitate business which is being transacted in that port.  A Norwegian factory ship, anchored in Castletownbere for the past three weeks is capable of taking vast stocks of sprat if they could be caught in our waters.  I do not know what investigations the Department and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have made into the size <Col N="222" /> of the shoals of sprat which are on that coast but I should like the Minister to develop this industry because it would give employment in the area.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that all our smoked fish products are imported.  What have we done in the past 20 or 30 years to promote a good smoking and canning industry? Our fishermen deserve the best landing facilities possible.  Killybegs, Howth and Castletownbere have already got modern piers and landing facilities.  I am pleased that the Minister has given the green light for the extension and upgrading of Schull Pier in 1982.  This is a major step forward for that town which is the home of several big trawler-owners.  Their families have resided there for generations.  It would be a great loss to the people of Schull and the hinterland if their facilities had not been improved and if 20, 30 or 40 families were to depart from the area and go elsewhere to seek a living.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity for a second fishery training school.  Greencastle is serving a good purpose, but a second training school should be established in Castletownbere or in Bantry.  Dumping of fish and treating them with dye under EEC rules is not on.  A scheme should be initiated by the EEC under which fish would be processed and given to the Third World at greatly reduced prices. This would be a more natural way of getting rid of extra stock.</P>
    <P>Fish farming is another very valuable asset but it is running into great difficulties because of what is called a red tide which has been enveloping the south west coast in recent years.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the great service being provided by Mr. Matt Murphy of Sherkin Island for the fishing industry.  He is operating a private marine laboratory.  He is making great strides and getting very valuable information which will be of great benefit to our Irish fishing industry in future year.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on the Minister the desirability of doing all he can to streamline this very valuable industry and to explore the possibility of setting up fishery committees in all our maritime counties, similar to those ACOT established to represent agriculture.  These <Col N="223" /> committees should have equal representations of elected public representatives and fishermen.  This would help to keep the Minister acquainted with all the problems confronting our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister responsible for fisheries should be able to get to the root of the problems confronting the industry by having these committees meeting at monthly intervals and informing the Minister what should be done to update and upgrade the industry.  The Minister should listen to the fishermen and their complaints.  When the weather gets finer he should take a trip with the fishermen and see for himself the rigours and hardships they have to endure to make a living.  I will welcome the Minister to Castletownbere to take such a trip someday in the late Spring when he will see for himself how necessary it is to give our fishermen every incentive to make a decent living.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and also our spokesman, Deputy Gallagher.  I appreciate the enormity of the task facing the Minister in trying, as others have tried, to develop an industry which is becoming more and more difficult to promote.  We have had <Col N="224" /> successive Ministers for Fisheries, and I am sure anything said in this House today was said here 30 years ago about the wishes and aspirations of those interested in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I want to be constructive in whatever criticism I offer and to be helpful to the Minister and his Department.  I do not wish to cover all the aspects of the fishing industry because my colleague Deputy Gallagher, will cover the aspects to which I will not refer.  As I said, I will be constructive and helpful, contrary to many of the speeches made here before.  When Deputy Power was Minister for Fisheries the Opposition spokesman made a sca-thing attack on him rather than proposing a constructive policy on fisheries.  That is not my intention and never will be.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to stocks of fish, control of fisheries and the in-thing, mackerel fisheries.  Let there be no doubt about where I stand.  At the moment we are enjoying a bonanza in mackerel fisheries, but I do not believe it will continue. How long it continues will depend largely on the ideas and policies we develop, or even the changes we make.  Let us be honest.  Mistakes have been made. Nobody in this House is infallible, although there are a few who think they are.  If policies are wrong and if development courses are wrong, with goodwill they can be changed.  This is the attitude we should adopt.  I have spoken to many fishermen in the area I represent, south-west Donegal, in which two of our major ports are located, Killybegs and Burtonport.</P>
    <P>These people are prepared to discuss the development of fisheries at any time with politicians or Department officials. However, almost every proposal put to the Department of Fisheries is met directly or indirectly by the contention that it is contrary to EEC regulations.  In the absence of a common fisheries policy &mdash;nor can I see one around the corner&mdash;it would appear that we are endeavouring to be the best Europeans of all in relation to fisheries.  I realise that the achievement of a common fisheries policy will entail an amount of negotiation and hard thinking and that we shall have to suffer because we may be contributing <Col N="225" /> more than we shall benefit from that sector, although we have gained on the agricultural side.  I appreciate that at present the common agricultural policy is encountering difficulty in its operation but it is a long way ahead of the fisheries policy.  If we are endeavouring to be great Europeans in relation to fisheries then I contend we are succeeding but at an enormous cost to our fishermen.</P>
    <P>My concern primarily would be with the development and protection of the natural resource, coupled with the long-term or short-term guarantee of approximately 1,000 jobs in fisheries in my area. One thousand jobs, if lost, would be a disaster to south-west Donegal.  When one leaves Ballyshannon and Bundoran until one reaches Burtonport there are not many employment areas&mdash;with the exception of a couple of factories in Donegal town&mdash;outside the fishing industry. Every family, almost, every young boy, living within ten or 15 miles of Killybegs or Burtonport is associated directly or indirectly with fishing.  If we were to be in any way instrumental in allowing our fishing industry to deteriorate it would have disastrous consequences for my area.  More importantly, fishing has been a way of life for these people for generations; these people know no other way of life but fishing. Therefore should the fisheries industry collapse the question of their retraining or deployment in other industries does not arise.  Also, many of the people involved are getting on in years, are set in their ways, and there would be nothing for them but the dole queues.</P>
    <P>The stage has been reached now in Killybegs and Burtonport where the shore industries set up with the help of the IDA and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are at a well developed stage and beginning to expand.  I was amazed to hear Deputies Deasy and Sheehan say that we were not doing our best in this field.  I must contradict that.  I must compliment Department officials, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the IDA on their endeavours in the development that has taken place to date in my constituency, and particularly in Killybegs.  It is indeed a good sign that the industry there is beginning to <Col N="226" /> expand.  The whole question of the continuation and expansion of this industry in the next few years will be dependent on some form of control being exercised in relation to fishing.  Here I am talking about over-fishing where the key word is control.</P>
    <P>Of course there are other areas of infrastructural development requiring attention.  Perhaps this is not the appropriate occasion to develop that side of the matter because it is primarily a matter for the Department of the Environment.  I appreciate that the Minister has sufficient headaches in relation to his Department and I shall confine my remarks as far as possible to that Department.  In mentioning control I must refer to the quota system operating at present.  I shall not quote any departmental figures but I should say that I am in close contact with fishermen, that there are six members of my family associated with fishing.  It must be said also that there are very few tricks of the trade about which the fishermen do not know.</P>
    <P>I might well ask the Minister when was he, or one of his officials, last out in one of these fishing boats, or has he or his officials any personal knowledge of the problems and difficulties encountered by these men leaving the bay each day? These are the men I represent.  It must be remembered that the investors, the luggers, the whiz kid operators who may come in for the kill, can, if anything goes wrong, leave and go back to their homeground. The people I represent and to whom I refer are those who will remain in Killybegs, Burtonport and other areas like that and who are totally dependent on Killybegs and its continued development. I understand the present Scottish quota is approximately 150,000 to 160,000 tonnes.  This is a type of United Kingdom-imposed quota which is not being adhered to at all.  I understand that for the season ending 1981 the Scottish fleet fished over 350,000 tonnes.  Their fishing bases at Ullapool and Mallaig do not have development on-shore industries such as we have at Killybegs.  Ninety per cent of their fish is sold to luggers. They do have processing facilities at Fras-erburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow but <Col N="227" /> they handle about 10 per cent of their catch only.  Therefore it is very convenient for them to dispose of their catches to luggers at Swilly or anywhere else around our coast.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I should make the point that there is no follow up on over-quota fishing and that we are providing them with a guaranteed facility for cooking the books.  It must be remembered that fishermen are human like the rest of us, and that as long as the pounds come in at the weekend nobody worries about the regulations. It is when the pounds cease to come in that one hears the uproar.  I have heard the rafters of this House being raised in relation to the school entry age for children and the Tuam sugar factory and I noted the amount of interest those subjects generated here with the gallery packed, but nobody seems to care that in south-west Donegal 1,000 jobs could be wiped out by wrong handling or lack of control in respect of what can be classified only as the cleaning up of our waters. The Dutch fleet which operates at approximately 40,000 tonnes quota last year caught in excess of 120,000 tonnes. The fishermen in the area see ships that can process 10,000 tonnes per day &mdash; I speak here of the Dutch fleet &mdash; at sea without ever coming ashore.  At present this produce is being shipped to Nigeria without these ships going into any of their own ports, or without there being any checks on their quotas either.  Here again we must raise the question of the great Europeans.  Those people are not too worried about regulations.  The other fishing fleet which operates off our coast around Donegal is the German one.  It is admitted by the fishermen in Donegal that, as far as can be seen, that fleet operates fairly strictly within the limits of the quotas imposed on them.  This brings one back to the thought of being a good European.  There was a time when Germany was not considered to be a very good European.  It is like the old proverb: if one gets the name of being an early riser one can sleep until it is late.</P>
    <P>The Irish quota is approximately 70,000 tonnes.  If we combine the Irish, French, West German, Dutch and the <Col N="228" /> Scottish fleets and their catches, we are talking approximately of 550,000 tonnes per year.  I wonder if any Member here has an idea of what 550,000 tonnes of mackerel looks like?  In the past three years the catch has been in the region of 1,500,000 tonnes.  I ask the Minister how long he and his experts think that can continue.  My belief, which is based on local information, is that this cannot be sustained.</P>
    <P>We had a clear example of what happened to the mackerel fishing off Cornwall. It was exhausted after five years and now the mackerel being caught are no larger than cigars.  There was no development of onshore-based industry there and 80 per cent of the catch was exported to West Africa.  There was no permanent development.  There was also the depletion of the Minch herring fishing.  As a representative from south-west Donegal, I could not associate myself with a policy leading in that direction.  Even the mackerel stocks will decrease.  I hope we will try to prolong the fishing for mackerel but the only way we can do that is to exercise some form of control.</P>
    <P>It must be clear to the Minister and to the Department that some form of control is essential but successive Ministers have not taken steps to implement such measures of control.  I remember when Deputy Lenihan was in charge of Fisheries, as were Deputy Power and the former Deputy Donegan.  At the moment Deputy Fitzpatrick has responsibility in this area.  There was never the determination, either politically or even from the point of view of the civil service, to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>Other countries overcame the problem. For example, in Canada they introduced a coastal state control.  This could be implemented here without contravening any EEC regulations.  The people who are reaping the harvest of our waters will never formulate a common fisheries policy.  They would be stupid to introduce such a policy.  A person does not cut a stick to beat himself and when the going is good the temptation is to wait to see what develops.  The measure of coastal state control could be implemented in the interest of conservation of an endangered <Col N="229" /> species.  It could be closely monitored. The Minister will probably say that this would be a very expensive operation.  I remember attending a seminar at the Let-terkenny RTC shortly after I became a member of Donegal County Council. Deputy Lenihan was present and the Commissioner who was with him spoke at length about our fisheries policy.  On that occasion we were told that an abundant sum of money would be made available to exercise control and to assist us in protecting our stocks.  I should like the Minister to follow up on that point.</P>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates there is a provision in the Estimates for the Department, or in conjunction with the Department of Defence, for some form of additional surveillance.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on that.  The foreign fishing boats could be brought into port occasionally for inspection regarding the way they are operating and to check if they are operating within the quotas as laid down.  This operation could also be carried out at sea by the Naval Service. It would not require too much intelligence to figure out the tank capacity of the vessels and the amount of catch on board.  If these people knew there was a prospect of their being questioned and prosecuted or of a fine being imposed, it would act as a deterrent.  Eminent scientists associated with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry have sounded many warnings in relation to the depletion of stocks but it seems nobody will cry halt.  It may be too late to do anything in three or four years.</P>
    <P>The Minister should surround himself with advisers and officials who have not a vested interest in the fishing industry and he should implement measures that will be in the best interest of a long-term fisheries policy or even prolong the existing regulations.  I have often wondered if the importance attached to the fishing industry is measured by the GNP of that sector.  If that is so, then God help the people of south-west Donegal, of Killybegs and Burtonport.  As a country, we are scarce in natural resources but the resources we have, and fishing in particular, should be protected by every available means.  It may be argued that the <Col N="230" /> shore side of the industry at present is not capable of handling the catches and that was borne out today by Deputy Deasy and Deputy Sheehan.  I say that is a very good sign.  If the reverse were true, if we had factory after factory with nothing to do, we would be in a worse position. We have an example in Donegal in another sector where seven or eight advance factories are idle.  I am not worried about the onshore side of the industry. The people in private enterprise will be able to develop their enterprises. Deputy Deasy was disappointed that BIM have got out of that sector but I believe it was the right decision.  We should encourage the people of Killybegs, Castletownbere and in the small ports around the country to do something for themselves and not expect the State to provide every facility.  Therefore, a certain number of luggers would be required during peak periods.  The assessment could be cut down to a fine point if controls were exercised.  A very good pattern could be established and we would not have wholesale dumping of fish.</P>
    <P>I suggest that some form of licensing must be introduced in respect of these luggers.  Of course the Department will say that it would be contrary to EEC regulations.  I say that we should introduce a licensing system for a period.  Let the operators be brought to court but it would take three years to bring them before the court, and if we do not take the steps I have been advocating, at the end of three years there will be nothing left to assess.  Deputy Deasy correctly spoke about a period this year when there were 36 overseas luggers operating off Rathmullan whose skippers were not worried about complying with quotas. One would not need to be very bright to appreciate that.  However, in the past three or four years successive Governments have stood by watching all this happening because they did not want to rock the boat.  If this sort of thing is allowed to continue the results will be disastrous, a situation whose gravity neither Deputies nor fishermen could have foreseen.</P>
    <P>When I started to teach in Killybegs in 1962 the children came in in the morning <Col N="231" /> talking about their fathers having got £6 a cran for herring the previous night.  In a short time the price was £52 per cran, but I am afraid we are back to the £6. Three or four years ago mackerel were being dumped wholesale.  I saw 13,000 cran of mackerel being dumped.  We have come a long way since, but we have arrived at a stage where we must adopt a restrictive policy and stringent controls. Unfortunately, nobody wants to call a halt, particularly the fishermen.  I do not blame the hard working fishermen in Killybegs and Burtonport for having a go. They have to meet heavy repayments on their boats.  They cannot decide to leave their boats tied up for a day.  They are enjoying a bonanza now and we do not hear very much from them but we should not allow them to hang themselves.  We have seen what happened to the small boats.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are providing facilities for Scottish people who have exhausted their own stocks.  The Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Kelly, once referred to the rhine-stone cowboys from the west.  The type of fishermen I have been talking about can be described only as overnight cowboys. They have reaped the benefits of their own stocks and are enjoying ours while they are giving a rest period to their own.</P>
    <P>We must be given answers to a number of questions.  For instance, what is the BIM investment?  What has it been in the past few years in respect of boats in Killybegs and Burtonport?  What commitments did the IDA and Gaeltarra Éireann enter into during the years?  How can the Government justify such investments annually, on the one hand, yet offer no protection to the resource on the other?  As I said earlier, one has only to look at the pattern of herring fishing to see the obvious dangers.  I attended meetings in Killybegs with the then spokesman of Fisheries, Deputy White.  We met up to 30 fishermen who were faced with the problem in relation to white fish takes.  It was costing them £200 to take a boat out for a night.  They might get some fish but not nearly enough to make it worthwhile <Col N="232" />&mdash; they might as well have left their boats tied up.  They were looking for price supports.</P>
    <P>A new problem has arisen now in regard to mackerel fishing but there is no common fisheries policy and consequently no controls, and the only conclusion one can reach is that there is free-for-all fishing in regard to all species. Those engaged in processing are in perpetual doubt about whether to expand or to sit back, wait for the fishing to collapse and then to fold up.  I have great admiration for those people because they are in a risky business with enormous amounts of money tied up in construction, the provision of freezing equipment and so on.  They have to ask themselves is it wise at a time when they do not know what will happen.  Nobody honestly could say their investment is guaranteed because of the element of chance and uncertainty.  I am not referring specifically to the Minister here now when I say that successive Governments did not have the right attitude in this respect. There are fears and uncertainties among those business people as well as among fishermen.  They need price supports.  It is a case of these people having their backs against the wall.  On the other side of the coin, in regard to the question of control, if the United Kingdom decided to place a conservation order on the Minch in relation to all fisheries we would have the entire Scottish fleet and luggers fishing in our waters.  They would fish us out in a couple of seasons and then return to their own white fishing.  We would be left to carry the baby while their stocks would have enjoyed a complete recovery.  These matters are causing concern to my constituents and all through this we must try to cope with the attitude of the Department in relation to EEC regulations.  Deputy Higgins, who is present, attended a seminar in the Abbey Hotel in Donegal town prior to our accession to the EEC and spelled out then all the dangers and loopholes that existed. Members on both sides of the House saw the big cake, the development of agriculture, fruit markets and so on, but nobody worried about the fisherman or the fishing industry because there were only <Col N="233" /> 6,000 or 7,000 votes involved altogether. However, as far as my constituency is concerned, that industry is the lifeline of half of the area.  That fact has fallen on deaf ears for many years.  I may be accused of being too parochial when I refer to processing in Donegal, but those who are endeavouring to develop that industry can either take this gamble or jump on the bandwagon and sign a contract with a couple of luggers that would be anchored off Killybegs.  All they would need would be a couple of two-way radios and a telephone and they could do all the business they wished.  That is the choice they have.  The easiest way out, and the one that has a guarantee, is the latter. But for the development of our area, the success of Killybegs and the continuation of the 1,000 jobs, the State must help out that weak section of the community.  The State must help those who are involved in the industry at a low level.  We have a total fleet of 65 or 70 fishing boats in Killybegs and Burtonport and about 12 or 14 of those boats are uneconomical. They are too small to fish for mackerel and do not have the power to compete. They would not survive at white fishing, support price or not.  These fishermen have gone to the wall with their wives and families and their crew and their families with them.  Those fishermen face another difficulty in that their interest rates and repayments are mounting.  I could rattle off the names of those people now because I write consistently to the Department and officials on their behalf in an effort to keep off the dogs.  That cannot continue; somebody must cry halt.  It would not be an unwise decision for BIM to buy out those boats &mdash; it may cost £3 million or £4 million &mdash; and reequip them so that those fishermen have proper boats to go sea fishing.  Alternatively those boats could be sold to countries that are at present developing their fishing industry.  The main thing is that those fishermen should not be allowed to accrue more interest and repayments. They face a very embarrassing situation. Fishermen are a unique type of people in that they do not know any other type of life except fishing.  They would not survive one week in a factory but we are <Col N="234" /> allowing them to hang themselves.  They cannot compete and do not have the boat power to go into the mackerel business. We are talking about £40 million in relation to this legislation and it would only cost 7.5 per cent of that figure to put that fleet to sea again.  The foreigners have outsmarted us in that area by modernising their fleets.  We have allowed our fishermen get into difficulty.  We can rescue them and the State has a duty to do that.  There is little point in introducing a Supplementary Estimate for the purpose of writing off interest rates.  That is only fooling them.  It is like putting them on a list of 10,000 for an SDA house we know will never be built.  We would be only allowing them to fool themselves.  It would be better if the boats were recovered from them and re-equipped so that they could compete and make a living.</P>
    <P>The unique thing about fishermen that I admire is that they want to work.  They do not want to stay ashore and draw the dole and in 1982 that is a scarce commodity. Those people are mad to work and they would not cry if they had a bad week.  Their frame of mind is right and the Minister should seriously consider the suggestion I have made to help them.  I am aware that such help would not be popular in the financial corridors but it is the only genuine way to tackle the problem. Such fishermen could be given medium sized tank boats to fish mackerel and once again become economic.  As it is, some of them carry only about 500 boxes.  They also use wooden boats, and that raises another problem.  The Department were very slow in relation to the boatyard in Killybegs.  For many years it must have been clear that that project was in difficulty and the decision the Department arrived at should have been reached earlier.  If that was done some of the fishermen I am referring to would have been able to invest in the better type of fishing boat for mackerel fishing.</P>
    <P>The policy of keeping the boatyard open was wrong.  Make no mistake about it, if someone offered me a car for £10,000 which I could buy elsewhere for £7,000, I would not pay the £10,000.  That <Col N="235" /> was just what was happening in Killybegs and in the boatyard.  It is unfortunate that those fishermen now have to suffer for wrong Government policy, regardless of what Government were in office.  They are being refused conversion grants, because the board want to examine their books and, if the fishermen are not making money, the board are not interested. These fishermen cannot make money because of the way they are operating and the Department cannot sit back and allow them to get into further debt.  The whole thing could be written off and made economical again.  One basic element on the fishermen's side is that they are anxious to work.</P>
    <P>I would possibly disagree with Deputy Power in relation to a gentleman's agreement and hope he will accept that disagreement in a gentlemanly way.  This was a very hot potato when he was Minister for Fisheries.  Unfortunately, it was not tackled then and may prove very expensive now.  On the other side of the coin, I must give credit where it is due.  I am delighted with the Killybegs development. The place has greatly changed in ten years, not alone in the fishing fleet but in the industrial site.  A lot more is needed, but we have been patient over the years.</P>
    <P>In recent months, Killybegs has seen the completion of many great harbour facilities.  A synchro-duct has been provided and the dredging of the harbour is almost complete.  A new ice plant and auction hall have also been provided, in answer to a profound need of the fishing industry in Killybegs.  In the best interests of the project it was unfortunate that the auction hall was placed where it is rather than at the head of the pier, but it is easy to talk with hindsight.  It has totally encroached on access to the pier.  As regards its design, at first sight it looks more like a synagogue than an auction hall.  I wonder if a prize for the design was involved.  However, it is a fine structure, but in the wrong place.  It must be stated publicly that interested parties <Col N="236" /> approached the Department of Fisheries and the Board of Works before construction was begun with a view to having the auction hall relocated but the officials involved could not agree to this.  This building is used for white fish only and could have been located anywhere, since all the handling is done by forklifts.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Power who mentioned co-operation between politicians, fishermen and the Department of Fisheries, but the Department officials determined where this auction hall was to be situated.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In all fairness, the Deputy should realise that in the end it is the Minister who makes the final decisions.  The officials of the Department do not.  The Minister must accept responsibility for the final decisions.</P>

      <P>I accept that totally.  It is unfortunate that whoever reached the final decision did not reach the right one, even with the best of intentions.</P>
      <P>I had occasion to meet the Department officials in connection with a young man who was interested in providing an alternative oil supply for Killybegs and was looking for a site for storage tanks.  Many reasons were quoted why he could not be accommodated including that blasting might damage the construction of the ice plant.  The information given to this young man was incorrect, to my first-hand knowledge.  There was not and still is not the will to facilitate him.  Deputy White was at the meeting with us and I argued about the price of oil on the grounds that competitiveness would only come if there were two or three companies supplying oil.  If the fishermen's co-operative in Killybegs had developed their own oil storage facilities, they could have provided diesel oil for their operators at 10p a gallon less than the present price.  All it needed was the right will and a co-operative approach.  These are decisions which rest, in the final analysis, with the Minister of the time.  As members of political parties we sometimes profoundly disagree, but must accept the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised a question in this House in relation to the Department of Fisheries, <Col N="237" /> the Department of the Environment and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara combining to present a harbour plan for Killybegs.  I felt, and still feel, that it would be of great benefit to all, including Donegal County Council.</P>
    <P>Work on a shore road was started in Killybegs some time ago, which can now only be described as the road to nowhere, because it was stopped in midstream.  If it had been completed, even with rough core, to allow container traffic from the shore road on to the industrial estate, there would be no traffic problems in the town of Killybegs.  It was only in June 1981 that I established from the then Minister for Finance that the road was not the responsibility of the Department of Fisheries but of the Department of the Environment, and had to be financed by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Everybody believed, and still believes, that that is the property of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and that if anybody wants access to the shore road at Killybegs they have to get permission from that Department.  There seems to be a conflict of interests there.  I am not saying that it is wrong that the Department should not have the right to be in on anything that happens in Killybegs but, at the same time, they should not be seen to be in conflict with the local authority.  I still believe that without any development plan or setting up of a harbour board there could be, in the interests of the Department, in the interests of finance and in the interests of the local authority, a final plan presented to Donegal County Council whereby they would all know where we are going in relation to the development of Killybegs. As it stands at the moment nobody seems to know what is happening.  I am a member of Donegal County Council and of the county development team and there are some excellent people there, representatives of different Departments, who would be very anxious to contribute towards developing Killybegs.  Contrary to what Deputies Deasy and Sheehan have said, it is developing.  BIM and the IDA and Gaeltarra Éireann are doing their utmost to develop and I am <Col N="238" /> delighted to see that there is involvement of local people with the expertise and the local knowledge who are prepared to have a go at developing this very important industry in south west Donegal.</P>
    <P>I have faith in the Minister's interest in the industry and I believe that he has the long-term interests of fishermen at heart. It is just a question of tidying up some of the policies and the problems.  I would hope that our spokesman on fisheries and the Deputies associated with fishing and fishing areas on this side of the House would be constructive in their contributions on any proposal coming before this House.</P>
    <P>Let me go back again to the present mackerel fisheries.  We are enjoying at the moment the only mackerel fishery left along these islands.  It is common knowledge that about 500,000 tonnes are available each year and the markets have geared themselves for this quantity.  If we introduced controls and reduced this figure to, say, 250,000 tonnes, this would not have an adverse affect on anyone concerned in Killybegs or Burtonport or on those who can only be described as vultures, because the price of mackerel would not fall; it would probably rise. This has happened in nearly every other sphere of buying and selling; if a commodity becomes scarce the price does not necessarily drop.  We have three or four years of mackerel fishing left and we must make a decision as to whether we will let it be finalised in three years or take the initiative now and extend it for two years. At present everyone is enjoying the bonanza &mdash; the fishermen, the processors, the lorry drivers, the business people, the shops, the cafés.  But should anything go wrong, the North Sea fisheries will open up again and the foreigners will be secure.  But where will our fishing fleet go and what will happen to the thousand people in my area who will be left on the dole queue?  We have a natural and very lucrative resource and we should be endeavouring to protect it.  I hope that the Minister will see his way not to break regulations but to accommodate himself within the framework of those regulations and secure the jobs that I have referred to.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo.  Nuair a labhraíonn Teachtaí faoi chúrsaí na hiascaireachtá bíonn siad chomh macánta go gcuireann sé iontas orm i gcónaí.  Bhí an óráid a thug An Teachta Coughlan uaidh suimiúil agus bhí an-tábhacht ag baint leis na pointí a rinne sé.</P>
      <P>Ag an am chéanna glacaim go bhfuil suim thar barr ag an Aire, An Teachta Fitzpatrick, i gcúrsaí iascaireachta.  Tá easpa muiníne le feiceáil agus le cloisteáil faoi láthair agus caithfimid deireadh a chur leis an easpa muiníne sin agus mis-neach a thabhairt dos na daoine óga a bhfuil sé ar intinn acu bheith páirteach i dtionscal na hiascaireachta sna blianta atá le teacht.</P>

      <P>I want to say at the outset how impressed I have always been with the speeches of people who live in coastal communities where the fishing industry is important as a means of livelihood. Indeed in the speeches that have been made so far on this brief Bill, there has been a directness and a lack of partisan-ship which is very impressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to welcome the Bill and to say that I have been impressed with the present incumbent in the Department.  This Bill, which will enable Bord Iascaigh Mhara to expand their activities by raising the limit of expenditure that they can incur, is welcomed by everybody.  But there are important matters which should be discussed.  Anybody who has any contact with the fishing industry can discern at present &mdash; and it is mentioned in the Minister's own speech &mdash; a degree of uncertainty that is visible everywhere. Certainly the people who have entered into repayments for vessels that cost great sums of money are worried about both their present situation and their future. We are in a very difficult position in so far as on the one hand we are encouraging people to become involved in the fishing industry and on the other hand there are many areas of uncertainty which tend to <Col N="240" /> undo our promotional efforts both of an educational kind and of a training kind. It is time that we addressed these.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Coughlan make reference to some speeches that I had made in the early seventies in County Donegal.  At that time I was worried about the lack of protection given to the fishing industry in the protocols that had been negotiated to the European Treaties of Accession.  I was worried in particular about the imbalance in resources that were available to the existing members of the European Community and those available to Ireland.  Put rather simply, they had a developed fishing industry with a developed catching capacity and they would now bring these to bear on waters where there was an undeveloped catching capacity and an undeveloped industry.  I felt quite frankly, without putting a tooth in it, that we were incurring a great degree of vulnerability for a fragile fishing industry in the interests of benefits that we were, in fact, getting for milk producers.  There is no point in going back over those arguments which are matters of historical fact. But there are points which are still relevant. In prosecuting a policy, and if BIM are to make the best use of this new capacity which the Bill will provide for it, there are matters to which we can, even today, address our attention.</P>
    <P>One of the two external environments within which the fishing industry will operate is the Law of the Sea Conference. I suggest to the Minister that in his discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General he should bear in mind that Ireland's interests are not necessarily similar to the interests of the major countries comprising the EEC.  Unfortunately the resumption of the Law of the Sea Conference and the stage to which the discussions have come have shown a great deal of greed on the part of developed nations towards underdeveloped and developing nations.  Our lot lies with those who want to utilise the resource that surrounds them, the sea.  We should be clear about our participation in these discussions.  We should have an independent policy which <Col N="241" /> is forward-looking and represents our interests.</P>
    <P>I recall in the seventies, as a Member of Seanad Éireann, discussing fisheries. I remember, as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, sitting across the table from the commissioner responsible for fishery policy in the EEC.  The documents which informed his view at that time were structured to represent the interests of the major partners in the EEC.  The manner in which statistics have been gathered referred rather descriptively to the total state of stocks in the EEC.  The question of conservation was discussed against a total picture.  Left out of the analysis was the precarious state of stocks which had been brought about by over-fishing by countries within the EEC which had the capacity to over-fish.  There was also over-fishing by non-Community countries. Here was a tiny country, with a weak fishing industry and weak capacity in comparative terms, being asked to bear the brunt of other countries' massive disregard for the state of fish resources in the waters in question.  We were put into this position.  What followed was a technical argument about quotas, sizes, limits and so on.  The guilty partners shared the same procedures as a tiny developing country which had not participated in making the state of the fishing stocks precarious.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the Treaty of Rome and the way the various protocols are worded there is still room for manoeuvre for Ireland.  I should like to repeat a suggestion I made in the early seventies.  If one has an integrated approach towards the future of the fishing industry, one can address oneself to the question of dependence of coastal communities on fishing for a livelihood.  One can manoeuvre in the areas between social and regional policy.  If there is a great deal of dependence on the fishing industry in coastal communities, this could be used as a principle of negotiation.  Orders that might be made need not be made in the areas of fisheries specifically but in terms of dependence.  I have never had a satisfactory <Col N="242" /> answer to the question of whether or not we could establish some form of limitation.</P>
    <P>In the discussions we had with the commissioner he made the suggestion that we should gather information.  Studies were initiated on the degree of the dependence of coastal communities on the fishing industry and on what the future held for fisheries.  These studies were not suited to meet Ireland's needs but were structured rather to answer Community questions. We cannot within our foreign policy relationship with the Community seek to make gains, which would be indirect, but would set up some form of protection for fisheries.</P>
    <P>If the external atmosphere in which we discuss fisheries is affected by the law of the sea and the EEC, let us face a hard fact.  There are people who argue that the traditional concept of fisheries is gone and that fishing is entering a new era.  If in the next generation we intend to move towards a concept of ocean ranching, we need to protect ourselves now in terms of international law.  Ireland's interests in the next generation must be staked out in a definite approach towards the new structures that will arise in relation to the law of the sea.  Our interests are different from those of Britain and the major countries of the Community.  This is something the Department must take seriously.</P>
    <P>I have long held the opinion that everything to do with fisheries and the sea should be integrated into one department of marine affairs.  I shall give an example of confusion which has emanated from bureaucratic competition and the way we have allowed our public service structures to evolve.  The Minister mentioned aquaculture.  We had studies about its prospects globally.  Take the case of a person who wants to become involved in aquaculture.  If he wants to put out a raft to become involved in mussels he must comply with planning permission and deal with the local authority.  If he puts out a rope he must deal with the Department of Transport.  If he wants information he must write to BIM.  If he wants to ask more questions he must write to the Department of Fisheries.  There is a big <Col N="243" /> difference between making a commitment to aquaculture and eliminating the obstacles facing young people who want to become involved in that way of life.</P>
    <P>I am not being mindlessly optimistic when I say there are thousands of jobs that can be created in this area.  There are problems that need to be settled as a matter of urgency.  There are constitutional questions about access to the coastline. There are questions of ownership and control.  There are questions about physical matters such as the structure of piers and so on.  All these questions should be answered with optimism.  My idea for a department of marine affairs might not be met in the short-term but there must be some way in which the whole package can be put together so that all these questions can be answered by a single agency.</P>
    <P>In relation to aquaculture we have answered some questions.  Some difficulties can now be solved and we have some demonstration farms.  The knowledge that we now have must be disseminated through the community.  What we need are workers, rather like the workers who work the poverty action programme, who will mobilise people into co-operatives and so bridge the gap between questions and the motivation which is necessary if there is to be broad based participation in the future of aquaculture.</P>
    <P>We need to integrate matters in relation to fisheries and also to simplify procedures so that people who want to enter into the fishing industry can do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the local authorities in Dublin not act immediately on the Friday night and the following morning especially on the dual carriageway, where the local authority had no equipment in operation?  People had to remain overnight to get machinery from a company, which was not able to do this type of work.  I believe that the Minister's co-ordinating efforts did not work.</P>

If the Deputy cares to put down a question relating to Dublin I will give him precise information on what was done and he may fill in the gaps in relation to what he <Col N="256" /> considers was not done in that regard.  At the moment I am investigating all the efforts that were made over that period to see if (a) the co-ordination operated, (b) if local authorities had the facilities that were available to them and used them and (c) to try to identify any gaps there were in the snow clearing efforts of local authorities during that period.

The Minister stated in his reply that machinery similar to what they have in Britain was available to melt the snow off the paths.  In Britain they have equipment which can spray the paths. Have local authorities got that equipment here?  I believe most of the local authorities have not got that equipment but it can be hired.

      <P>Why did the Tánaiste and the Minister for the Environment not co-ordinate the work of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council in such a way that on the evening of the blizzard and the following morning this equipment which I have mentioned, which was used in Counties Laois and Offaly, as well as other counties, could be made available to them?

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some community centres and clubs providing these facilities for young people are being asked to pay rates? Since these premises have been built by local labour and in many instances without State help, would the Minister not agree that rates are an unfair imposition on them?  In these circumstances would he have the matter examined with a view to the waiving of rates in these cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, defined a community hall as being a hall or similar building other than the premises of a registered club, that is, one with a bar, which is not used for profit or gain but <Col N="269" /> which is used for social and recreational purposes by inhabitants of the locality generally.  It is open to the operators of any hall to apply to the local authority to be included within that definition for the purpose of waiver of rates.  The local authority make a decision one way or the other, but if they decide against a waiver the trustees of the hall may, if they wish, appeal to the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it, then, that where a group are operating a centre of this kind and are not making a profit, they are not liable for rates so long as they can prove to the local authority that they are not making a profit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that the Act defines community halls and that it is open to the trustees of any hall who think they qualify within that definition to apply to the local authority for waiver of rates.  It is a matter then for the local authority to decide whether rates should be waived.  If they decide against the applicants it is open to them to go to the District Court in order to have the court determine whether the hall comes within the definition as laid down in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore it is a matter for a local authority to decide whether rates should be imposed in any case.  From my knowledge of local authorities they will keep within the law and it is hardly likely that club or community centre operators would take an action against a local authority in a matter of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>A decision as to whether a premises qualify for relief is a matter for the local authority concerned.  It is their business in the first instance.  People who consider themselves to qualify within the definition as laid down in the Act should apply to the local authority for a decision regarding the payment or otherwise of rates.  There is provision for an appeal to the District Court against a decision.</P>

I am sure the Minister and the House will agree that persons who give their time voluntarily, risking their lives as often happens for the sake of their fellow men, should not be at risk financially or that their families should not suffer in the event of them losing their lives in the search for a body?

The request for approval to a subvention of £11,962 submitted by Mayo County Council has been fully examined by my Department, and it is considered that a subvention is not warranted having regard to the number of grant eligible members, the number of new house connections to the scheme and its potential for further development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say at the outset to you, Sir, and to Members of the House that I regret the great length at which I will have to address the House on this occasion.  This arises from the very large number of measures which have to be taken because of the difficult situation we are facing. However, I am confident that, as a result of this budget, the budget speech I will have to make this time next year will be somewhat shorter than this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> The Government aim, in this budget, is to achieve five objectives:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to reduce our reliance on foreign borrowing so as to maintain our national economic independence and ensure that interest payments do not absorb too much of our limited tax revenue;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to improve Ireland's position in international trade, by increasing our exports and reducing our imports and thus provide self-sustaining jobs for our people;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to improve, despite the financial difficulties, the living standards of those who cannot help themselves and depend on the community for support;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to change our income tax system so as to make it fairer and lessen the burden it now imposes on the low paid;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to improve the incentive to work for people who, now, often find it more profitable to stay at home.</P>
    <P>In setting out these objectives we recognise that Government action alone cannot achieve them.  Government programmes which do not have public consent and support will not succeed. Even with public support they will fail unless there is a concerted effort by the community.</P>
    <P>Each of the five aims of this budget has one common theme.  It is that of meeting the enormous challenge of unemployment. In the last six years the number of young people leaving our schools, and seeking jobs, has increased from 53,000 a year to about 67,000 a year.  It will continue rising.  Yet, at the moment, we are losing more jobs in industry than we are creating.</P>
    <P>This is a challenge to every Member here in this House, and to our democratic system.  Unless we can meet it, a harsh judgment will be passed on us.  I am convinced that the only way to meet this challenge is to change our economy to make it more efficient, so that we can beat our competitors on the export markets of the world.  Unless we can export <Col N="297" /> more than we are importing, we will not have the jobs we need.  In the end it is not the Government that provide jobs, it is the consumers who buy what Irish workers produce.  Consumers of Irish goods, abroad as much as at home, are the guarantee of jobs in this country.  We will not sell our goods if the price is wrong, or the quality inferior.</P>
    <P>In the last six months the Government have campaigned to bring realism back into economic debate in Ireland.  Only by starting from reality can we make our economy efficient and competitive.  If the Government are realistic about their own finances, this will inject realism into the economy as a whole.  If we are prepared to reform our own financial procedures in the interests of efficiency, it will encourage the same in the rest of the economy.  Just as the Irish economy cannot continue spending £1.13p abroad for every £1 that it earns abroad, the Irish Government cannot continue spending over £1.40p for every £1 received.</P>
    <P>Budget deficits are demoralising.  They encourage the myth that one can spend what one has not earned, and that it is right to ask the taxpayers of the future to pay the price of present weakness and extravagance.  It is our duty to ensure that there is a secure and prosperous future for the children of this country.  They will have neither prosperity nor security if we continue to spend their birthright.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current Budget Deficit</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are committed to eliminating the current budget deficit over the next four years.  Of course a dramatic reduction this year could precipitate a downturn in economic activity. Therefore we seek a balance between proving our determination to reverse the borrowing trend on the one hand, and maintaining economic activity and investment on the other.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PLANNING</P>
    <P>There are structural flaws in the Irish economy which make it inefficient.  These will only be cured ultimately through consensus and public agreement.  As a community <Col N="298" /> we face a new order in the world, an era of easy growth based on cheap energy, which lasted from 1945 &mdash; after the Second World War &mdash; until approximately 1970, is now definitely over.  We must now expand in a contracting market.</P>
    <P>The purpose of our national economic plan, which will be published in the middle of this year, will be to set out the economic challenge before our people and seek their consent for the measures necessary to meet it.</P>
    <P>The plan will provide a discipline and a clear objective for Government spending. In the past Government plans bore little relation to what the Government were actually doing with their own finances.  This plan will be completely integrated with the Government's own financial programme.  Thus the Government will be committed to the objectives of the plan, and the plan will provide a solid framework for the national economic effort.</P>
    <P>The institutional arrangements for planning will be improved.  The National Planning Board, when established, will provide an input for key groups in society. The whole emphasis will be to get the community working together on national and social economic objectives. Consultations on an industry by industry basis prepared us for free trade in the sixties.  A similar effort is needed to do what must be done in the eighties.  Indeed I believe that these consultations in each industry&mdash;which will be undertaken as part of the planning process&mdash;will make a major contribution towards saving, preserving and providing jobs.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REFORM OF FINANCIAL PROCEDURES</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I have a very strong personal commitment to the reform of the financial procedures of the State.  The Government's proposals were detailed in the discussion paper <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances.</i> The public response to this paper has been very supportive of its proposals, and I have been encouraged by the many <Col N="299" /> people and organisations who wrote to me privately.</P>
    <P>I hope the time will soon be available for a debate in this House on these matters and I look forward to receiving the considered views of Deputies on all sides. It is clearly desirable that there be broadly-based, non-partisan support for such measures of reform.  The reforms are intended to restore the primacy of the Dáil in regard to the scrutiny and control of public finances and to strengthen the role of individual Deputies in consideration of financial matters.</P>
    <P>In regard to matters within my own area of responsibility, work has started on the development of a new, more informative presentation of the Estimates and budgetary documentation. Some minor improvements have already been made in this year's Estimates Volume, as Deputies will no doubt have noticed.  My Department are also preparing legislation to give effect to some elements of the reform programme.</P>
    <P>The discussion paper referred to the need to ensure that the balance of each year's budget &mdash; introduced in January &mdash; is maintained throughout the year. This has been a major problem in recent years.  Up until 1979, although there were budget deficits, the Government at least succeeded in keeping to the planned level of deficit set at the beginning of the year. Since 1979, however, even planned deficits have been dramatically overshot&mdash;by 81 per cent in 1979, 58 per cent in 1980, and 62 per cent in 1981.  This simply undermines confidence in budgets.  The discussion document mentioned the possibility of a regulator tax as a way of tackling this problem.  I have decided to establish a special committee, with an independent chairman, to examine the feasibility and implications of instituting a tax of this kind.  But I will also be tightening up on public spending to ensure that recourse to such a tax is not actually necessary at all.</P>
    <P>I might mention also that a committee to find ways of preventing major cost overruns on State capital projects&mdash; which have been a considerable problem in recent years &mdash; has been established. <Col N="300" /> I look forward to firm recommendations from this body by March of this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">THE ECONOMIC SITUATION</P>
    <P>There have been some positive features in our economic performance in 1981.  The latest data show a recovery in investment and a significant growth in agricultural incomes.  They also demonstrate that a start has been made in correcting the budget and balance of payments deficits without damaging the sources of lasting economic growth.  This shows the underlying strength of the Irish economy and indeed indicates how unreal is the notion that the Irish economy is so weak that it requires continually increasing Exchequer support and foreign borrowing to prop it up.</P>
    <P>There will be worthwhile opportunities for our industrial exporters this year, provided our output is competitive and disruptions to production are avoided.  A revival in agricultural exports is likely. Partly because of this, and partly because of the measures being taken by the Government, the significant growth in agricultural incomes achieved last year should be repeated in 1982, in contrast to the very serious fall which occurred in 1979 and 1980.  These factors should lead to improved employment prospects in 1982.</P>
    <P>If, as expected, the rate of inflation falls abroad, this will have beneficial effects here.  The strength of sterling and the dollar in 1981 was a significant force for high inflation here.  This is not likely to be repeated in 1982.  But it must be stressed &mdash; in looking at the optimistic features of our economic situation&mdash; that, without a change in policy the benefit of the growth in exports will be offset by the inescapable increase in the cost of servicing foreign debt which we as a Government have already incurred.  Thus the action taken in this budget is necessary to our economic recovery.  The general hope that the international economy will be on a higher growth path in 1983 makes it absolutely imperative that we act this year to correct the distortions and imbalances in our economy.  We must enter 1983 with an economy capable of benefiting <Col N="301" /> to the full from the international upturn, not one still bogged down in the problems which this Government inherited from the past.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INCOMES POLICY</P>
    <P>For example, we cannot continue to pay ourselves more than our competitors and still remain in the market-place.  This is not merely a question of pay levels. The fact is that our output per person is low by international standards.  It is not absolute wage levels but costs per unit of output that determine our competitiveness. Excessive income increases over the past three years are the primary cause of the massive deficits on the balance of payments and on the current budget. They have contributed to inflation and unemployment.  Last year Irish wage rates increased by twice the average in the economies of the other countries in the European Monetary System.  It is no surprise, therefore, that the number of industrial jobs lost here in the last two years was over 12,000 more than were created.</P>
    <P>Proposals have been negotiated by the Minister for the Public Service for a pay agreement between the Government and the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  These proposals will lead to an increase of just over 9 per cent on the charges that would otherwise have had to be met in 1982 in respect of the Exchequer, or the Government's pay bill.  They are at the very limit of what is acceptable, in the public service, to the Government.  It is important to note that the proposed public service agreement provides for a moratorium on special pay increases.  Under the moratorium, apart from certain very limited exceptions, no payment on foot of special claims will arise in respect of any period prior to 1 January 1983.  It is essential that the provisions of the draft agreement are not exceeded in settlements anywhere in the public sector, and all public sector employers have been advised by Ministers to that effect.</P>
    <P>Pay levels in other employments will be a matter for settlement between managements <Col N="302" /> and unions there.  I would hope that they will take full regard of the requirement of competitiveness.  There should be a clear recognition, in present circumstances, of the need for flexibility in the interests of job-preservation.  I emphasise that the need for moderate pay settlements is as pressing in the so-called sheltered sectors of the economy as it is in manufacturing.  Indeed, excessive pay increases in the sheltered areas of the economy&mdash;whether public or private&mdash;would have to be borne throughout the economy in the form of increased costs.</P>
    <P Just="Center">MONETARY POLICY</P>
    <P>The central aim of monetary policy in 1981 was to maintain an adequate level of external reserves in the context of our membership of the European Monetary System.  The official external reserves recorded an increase of £127 million or almost 10 per cent to give an end-year level of £1,473 million.  It should be clearly understood, however, that the achievement of this level of external reserves is due largely to the extensive foreign borrowing undertaken in the course of the year to finance the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The demand for private sector credit was sluggish in the first half of 1981, but it has since accelerated and it is likely that growth over the year as a whole will be close to the guideline set at the beginning of the year of a 15 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>The trends in interest rates reflect the difficulties of the situation and in particular our balance of payments problem. Domestic rates rose significantly in 1981, but are still below the peak they reached in 1980.</P>
    <P>The reality here is that the drain of our balance of payments deficit results in a continuing shortage of funds in the Irish money markets and, as a consequence, in a tendency to high interest rates.  In other words, we must get our balance of payments under control if we are to avoid the continuance of high interest rates here.  It is an exercise in self-delusion to suppose that manipulation of interest rates by the Government, through subsidies, <Col N="303" /> can somehow insulate us from this reality.  Only firm action to correct the underlying imbalances in our economic and financial situation can create the right conditions for a stable régime of lower interest rates.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVIEW OF THE 1981 BUDGET OUTTURN</P>
    <P>The targets contained in the original January 1981 budget proved to be meaningless. It became evident in the early months of the year that expenditure commitments had been seriously underestimated, as the Government did not adhere to their published estimates.  In addition, substantial extra expenditure was made as the year progressed.  As a result this Government, on assuming office, were obliged to introduce a supplementary budget.</P>
    <P>At that time, the likely current deficit for 1981 was about £950 million and the likely overall borrowing requirement stood at £1,970 million.  The supplementary budget in July reduced these projections substantially.  The eventual outturn for the year showed an adjusted deficit of £802 million or almost 8 per cent of GNP and an overall borrowing requirement of £1,722 million or 17 per cent of GNP. Despite the measures taken in July, this outturn represents the largest current deficit and overall borrowing ever incurred in this country.  This experience shows that entrenched divergences between spending and revenue cannot be eliminated in a short six months.  That requires patient and sustained effort over a longer period.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exchequer Borrowing</i>
    </P>
    <P>In 1981 only one quarter of the total Exchequer borrowing requirement could be financed at home.  Before raising any new money to meet the 1982 requirement, we have to arrange new loans of approximately £1 billion to meet repayments on existing debt.  It is frequently forgotten that, besides paying interest on loans, the principal must also be repaid. This year we have to make repayments of not less than £350 million in respect of <Col N="304" /> foreign loans raised in earlier years.  On the domestic front, almost £700 million of our national loans are due for repayment this year.  The borrowing necessary to finance repayments is frequently at higher interest rates than applied to the loans being repaid, so this adds to the burden of our national interest bill.  The real cost of borrowing must take into account not just the interest payments on the loans but also the cost of repaying the principal.  The disappointing level of receipts from domestic borrowing sources and the need to maintain the external reserves required an unprecedented £1,285 million of foreign borrowing in 1981.  Of this, some £85 million &mdash;a relatively small amount&mdash;was borrowed from the European Investment Bank.  The balance was raised on the international capital markets on commercial terms.</P>
    <P>This very high level of dependence on foreign borrowing compares very unfavourably with previous years.  I shall give just a few examples of this.  About 75 per cent of the Exchequer's total borrowing was foreign in 1981 as compared with 47 per cent in 1980, 50 per cent in 1979 and just 27 per cent in 1975.  This level of foreign borrowing exposes us dangerously to international fluctuations in the availability of funds.  These fluctuations can occur almost without warning for reasons quite beyond our control in this country.  This budget aims to reduce our total borrowing requirement, and thus reduce the need to borrow abroad.  We will seek also to ensure a larger share of our borrowing in 1982 takes place at home.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PUBLIC EXPENDITURE POLICY 1982</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Government want to restore public confidence in the budget estimates as a genuine statement of their intentions.  A regulator tax may be relevant in this context in the longer term. But of much more importance now and indeed in the future is the resolve on the part of Ministers to keep spending within agreed estimates.  Ministers have been directed to take immediate and specific <Col N="305" /> measures to ensure that throughout 1982 the level of expenditure by Departments and organisations under their control will not exceed the budget allocations.</P>
    <P>Specific decisions on individual programmes have also been taken to under-pin departmental allocations and each Minister will be reporting back to the Government by 30 April on the results of public expenditure reviews which are already being undertaken in conjunction with the Minister for the Public Service and myself.  Those reviews are designed to identify low-priority programmes which, if curtailed or suspended, could produce a build-up of savings, both in staff and other costs.  I have, however &mdash;and this is perhaps in contrast to previous budgets&mdash;not thought it prudent to make any allowance for such savings until specific possibilities for redeployment and reorganisation have actually been identified.  Pending the outcome of these reviews, and the identification of savings, the Government have decided to retain the general restriction on public service numbers, which will partially offset the provision which has had to be made for some additional posts this year in key areas such as teaching, the security forces, the prisons services and the Post Office.  Two-thirds of all vacancies occurring generally in the non-industrial civil service from 23 December 1981 are being held open and a system of equivalent effect is to apply, where possible, to other parts of the public sector, with the exception of the commercial State-sponsored bodies.  That is not to say that even they are in a position to start recruiting freely. With few exceptions their financial situation is so weak that a restrictive policy on numbers employed must be high on their list of commercial priorities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Central Fund Services 1982</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the past few years an ever-increasing burden of debt service payments has had to be met out of current revenue.  This increasing burden is reflected in the Central Fund estimate for 1982 which is £1,360 million, a 35 per cent increase on the 1981 outturn.  Virtually all of this&mdash; this very dramatic increase&mdash;is due to <Col N="306" /> higher interest payments, which are estimated to rise by some £315 million in 1982, of which some £250 million will be required for foreign interest payments. In effect, £315 million of the increase in revenue this year will be pre-empted, just taken away, by these extra interest payments. This is a very real constraint on the Government's freedom in the management of their economic policies. These interest payments now require 27½ per cent, more than a quarter of all tax revenue&mdash;not just income tax revenue &mdash;compared with only 17½ per cent in 1975.  Moreover, a growing proportion of these payments is a transfer across the exchanges, which represents a real loss of purchasing power to the Irish economy.  In other words, it is interest paid abroad which is enjoyed by people abroad rather than at home.</P>
    <P>Apart from interest payments, the other main item of increased expenditure in the Central Fund services is our contribution to the EEC budget, which will rise from £118 million in 1981 to £140 million this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>A superficial reaction to the estimates figure published last week might be that, in general, capital demands for 1982 were being treated less generously than current demands.  This criticism, however, does not hold water.  In the first place, we already have one of the highest rates of capital formation in the OECD and it is clearly unrealistic to expect it to continue rising indefinitely.  Secondly, capital expenditure is by definition non-recurring and the figure in any one year depends, therefore, on the projects which happen to be in train at the time. We are just over the major push in a number of large investment areas&mdash; notably transport, telecommunications and State industry &mdash; and clearly demands in those areas are now starting to taper off for the time being.  Thirdly, as I have stated earlier, much of what is classified as capital is of dubious borrowing merit and is open to retrenchment anyway.</P>
    <P>There is one general point I should like to make here.  Over the years since the <Col N="307" /> first oil crisis the Public Capital Programme has pumped money into the economy to maintain employment and general momentum at a time when private sector investment was very slack.  In a mixed economy, however, it is unrealistic to expect that Government finance can indefinitely substitute for missing private sector investment.  Therefore the aim of policy now must be to create the conditions in which private sector investment can grow more rapidly of its own accord.</P>
    <P>A stocktaking is also necessary in regard to demands from ailing commercial State bodies for capital injections from the Government to improve their balance sheets.  For 1982 the Government have, therefore, decided to allocate an additional £90 million of Exchequer finance outside the Public Capital Programme, to help deal with under-capitalisation in the State trading sector.  The exact distribution of this amount will not be decided until the Government have had the opportunity to examine a number of consultancy and other reports, which are now being prepared, on the position of individual bodies.</P>
    <P>Here too there must be a general change of approach.  Since all injections of equity capital into State companies from the Exchequer must be financed from borrowed money at high and volatile interest rates, State bodies&mdash;receiving these funds&mdash;will in future be asked to justify their investments not only by reference to the earning capacity and employment creation of the investment, but in a more fundamental way by reference to the financial return expected and its relevance to the company's objectives. Future issues of Exchequer share-capital to State bodies will be accompanied by a set of financial targets which subsequently will be closely monitored within an agreed corporate plan.  I am confident that the committee on cost over-runs, to which I referred earlier, will make useful recommendations in regard to cost control in capital projects undertaken by State bodies which, as the House is aware, have been something of a problem in recent years.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OPENING DEFICIT ON CURRENT ACCOUNT</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> As I have already pointed out, the deficit in 1981 was the highest ever in this country.  The opening position for 1982 is even worse.  The recently published White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure showed a 1982 deficit of £933 million. This figure does not take account of the maintenance of the present level of services which is the basis on which I projected the 1982 deficit in my July budget speech.  To maintain the real level of social welfare benefits at 1981 levels in 1982 would require an additional provision of £68 million to take account of inflation.  This provision brings the opening deficit to £1,0001 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SPECIAL FEATURES</P>
    <P>Before turning to the main budget headings I should like to mention a number of special items for which provision is being made.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Heritage</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our Programme for Government promised new measures, including legislation, the better to protect our cultural heritage.  This legislation will involve wide consultation with conservation interests and the intention is that their views will receive maximum consideration when a first Bill to protect historic monuments is introduced in the present session.</P>
    <P>The pressure of development on urban archaeological sites is a particular concern where such sites come to light in the course of building development.  I am providing £25,000 this year to enable the Commissioners of Public Works to commission a special report on areas and sites of archaeological significance which require special procedures to be adopted in relation to their development and protection. This will give good advance warning of the areas in or near towns in regard to which special care should be taken and will help both conservationists and potential developers.</P>
    <P>There has been concern, too, about the rate at which field monuments are <Col N="309" /> being destroyed in rural areas.  I have, therefore, instructed the Commissioners of Public Works to concentrate on publication of monument inventories and to arrange for more speedy completion of the countrywide survey of monuments to this end.  This will promote knowledge of national heritage on a county-by-county basis.  I am providing an extra sum of £100,000 for this purpose in the current year.</P>
    <P>On the taxation side, the Finance Bill will include a proposal to grant income tax relief, in so far as not allowable already, in respect of the cost of maintenance and repair of buildings which are intrinsically of scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic significance. As indicated in our Programme for Government, a building must be capable of conservation in order to qualify for this relief and there must be arrangements for reasonable access by the public to it.  This measure will cover a wide range of buildings, large and small.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Veterans of the War of Independence</i>
    </P>
    <P>In view of the special service rendered to the community by veterans of the War of Independence, the Government have decided to make a number of improvements for them and for their widows at a total cost of £250,000 in 1982.  Details will be found in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Council for the Status of Women</i>
    </P>
    <P>I should also like to mention that since the publication of the Estimates, the Government have reviewed the provision of £65,000 included for the Council for the Status of Women in the Vote for the Department of Labour.  They have decided to increase the council's allocation to £95,000 to enable them to operate with greater effect.  The extra £30,000 will be found by adjustments elsewhere within the Vote.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fostering Better Understanding between People North and South</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have agreed to provide the sum of £125,000 in this year's budget to assist organisations involved in <Col N="310" /> reconciliation work and in efforts to create better understanding between people North and South of the Border.  Some of this money will also be used to provide funds for the extension of the youth incentive scheme to Northern Ireland youth groups who wish to visit this part of the country.  Financial provision has also been made for the establishment of an &ldquo;Anglo-Irish Encounter&rdquo; organisation as recommended in the Joint Studies carried out by officials of the Irish and British Governments last year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Ombudsman</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have decided to establish the Office of Ombudsman during the current year and the Minister for the Public Service will bring the necessary resolutions for the appointment of the Ombudsman before the Houses of the Oireachtas at an early date.  I am providing £130,000 for the expenses of the Office of the Ombudsman for 1982. The appointment of an Ombudsman in this country will represent a major advance in ensuring the protection of the rights of the ordinary citizen.  Initially, he will have power to investigate the actions of Government Departments but it is intended that his remit will be extended next year to local authorities and health boards.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>A significant package of improvements at primary and secondary levels has been provided for in the Estimates.  This includes £1 million for micro-computers in post-primary schools, an increased capital allocation for secondary schools and at primary level provision for increased capitation grants.</P>
    <P>In addition to the £400,000 for pre-school facilities already provided for in the Estimates, I am providing today for a further £600,000.  This reflects the importance the Government attach to supporting parents in deprived circumstances in regard to care and development of their children before they enter primary education.</P>
    <P>I am also providing £225,000 as additional funding for youth activities.  This will allow the honouring of commitments <Col N="311" /> to young people in this area.</P>
    <P Just="Center">AGRICULTURE</P>
    <P>The Government's concern at the difficult agricultural situation has been shown in a number of measures introduced since they assumed office.  A major incentive to increased output is the scheme of assistance for farmers for the expansion of the cattle breeding herd, for which £5.5 million has been provided in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Other measures include two 5 per cent interest subsidy schemes, a partially EEC-financed scheme for development farmers and a nationally-financed scheme for other farmers.  These schemes will cost about £9 million a year.  In addition, the Exchequer is bearing the exchange risk on funds provided by the European Investment Bank to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for on-lending to agriculture to finance additions to the basic herd and to assist young farmers to develop farms taken over from their parents.</P>
    <P>The July budget contained an important VAT concession in favour of agriculture, in that the effective VAT rate on certain agricultural contracting services was lowered to 3 per cent.  These and the further measures I will be announcing today will do much to encourage investment and increase productivity and output.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Horticulture Subsidy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The horticultural sector in Ireland has had difficulty in competing with imports from other countries, particularly because of fuel price differences.  Accordingly, I propose to provide relief to the commercial horticultural sector, including mushroom growers, at an estimated cost of £200,000 to help towards countering those differences.  The details will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmers in Severe Financial Difficulty</i>
    </P>
    <P>Even with the 5 per cent interest subsidy schemes there are still farmers who are not in a position to meet repayments to the banks but who, with additional <Col N="312" /> help, would be in a position to survive. Discussions have taken place with the banks and the ACC to draw up a scheme which would lead to a substantial reduction in the interest rate on existing loans. These discussions are now being finalised and the Minister for Agriculture will shortly be announcing the details of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The cost will be borne by the lending institutions and the Exchequer, but until such time as a clear picture emerges of the total of loans likely to benefit under this scheme, I am not in a position to give a firm indication of the cost.  I am, however, making a provision of £4 million in respect of the Exchequer cost which may arise this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of Farming Profits</i>
    </P>
    <P>I think it will be accepted by all that, with the phasing-in of the abolition of rates for full-time farmers, the credit for rates paid against income tax liability must be phased out on a similar basis. Accordingly, I am proposing that the rates credit be reduced by 50 per cent in the income tax year 1982-83 and abolished altogether in the following year. This will increase the income tax yield from farmers by £2.5 million in 1982.  The portion of rates not allowed as a credit will be available as a deduction against profits in the normal way this year.</P>
    <P>Further encouragement will be given to the expansion of the national herd in line with the undertaking in the Programme for Government.  Increased herd numbers will help our balance of payments. This will be done through increasing the rate of stock relief, as it applies to farmers, from 100 per cent to 110 per cent.  The new rate will apply to all livestock and not just to breeding animals. This concession will cost about £0.5 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>Stock relief is a temporary measure, renewable on an annual basis.  While the stock relief provisions for farming are a strong incentive to build up livestock numbers, I am most anxious that the income tax code should include provisions which would give a positive inducement on a permanent basis so that this important national objective of building <Col N="313" /> up and maintaining our herd numbers may be attained.  I am, accordingly, examining how this might best be done through changes in the system for valuing livestock.  I am examining in particular a system in operation for some years in New Zealand, known as the `nil value' system.  Discussions in the matter are proceeding between the farming organisations and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Farmers may claim capital allowances in respect of one third of the expenditure incurred on the construction or conversion of their private dwelling houses.  No other section of the community enjoys such an advantage and, in the interests of general fairness in the tax system, I propose that it will be withdrawn.  The yield will be about £0.2 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>The two payment dates for farmer income tax will be retained for another year.  This, together with the refund of the resource tax, will improve the position of farmers by £8.4 million this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Reliefs on the Transfer of Farm Property</i>
    </P>
    <P>As indicated in the Programme for Government, the stamp duty liability on transfers of land to young trained farmers will be removed for a two-year period. This exemption will be granted to gifts of farmland where the donee or recipient is under 35 years of age at the date of transfer and has a recognised farm-training qualification.  It will apply to transfers made in the two years following the date of enactment of the 1982 Finance Bill. The transferor must indicate before 1 December 1982 that he intends to avail of this provision.  The cost of this concession is estimated at about £0.5 million in a full year and about £0.25 million in 1982.  The concession is designed to effect early transfers of land to young farmers and thus help improve efficiency in agriculture. The strict time limit on the concession is designed to get land quickly into the hands of young farmers at a time when their contribution is much needed. The Finance Bill will also contain a provision increasing by £50,000 to £200,000 the upper limit on the special agricultural relief in capital acquisitions tax for farmer <Col N="314" /> beneficiaries in relation to gifts and inheritances taken after 1 April next.</P>
    <P>This represents a doubling of this limit compared to the position in 1975, when the tax was first introduced, and is in line with the increase in land prices since that year.  In a very difficult budgetary situation, this is a significant step towards the fulfilment of the commitment given on this matter in the Programme for Government. The cost of this change will be about £0.25 million in a full year and about £0.2 million in 1982.  It, too, will encourage land transfers to younger farmers.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TAXATION</P>
    <P>Government policy places a high priority on a more equitable system of taxation and we intend that a greater burden of taxation will be borne by those who can best afford it.  This will require a large-scale re-structuring of the taxation system, particularly as regards income tax, which I will deal with later.</P>
    <P>Any such re-structuring is a major undertaking and it is not possible to implement immediately all of the reforms included in the Programme for Government. The difficult financial situation is the principal constraint, but some of the proposed reforms of their very nature can only be put into effect gradually.  I propose, however, to introduce some changes today which will go a considerable way towards fulfilling the Government's commitments.</P>
    <P>First it must be said that the present tax base is too narrow.  This is, in part, a result of deliberate policy choice&mdash;principally to ensure a favourable tax régime for industry and agriculture&mdash;but the inevitable result is a higher incidence of tax than would otherwise be the case on those remaining liable.  The effectiveness of the tax system as a means of raising revenue&mdash;which is its main purpose&mdash;has gradually been weakened over the years by tax reliefs to special interest groups. This, again, has had the effect of ultimately increasing the level of tax on those who cannot get full benefit from the reliefs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" />
      <i>Avoidance and Evasion</i>
    </P>
    <P>I turn now to tax evasion and tax avoidance. It is my responsibility to ensure that taxation is spread as equitably as possible and that every person with a taxable income should carry his share of the burden.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with my proposals, I would like to point out that tax evasion has moral implications.  What is at issue is the payment of a fair share of the cost of common services which all enjoy. Unless, as a community, we face up to the the moral implications of tax evasion, and cease to be privately tolerant of it, we will not stamp it out.  Statutory regulations, no matter how detailed, will only be partially successful without changed public and private attitudes.  More effective action can, however, be taken in the regulatory sphere and a number of new developments are proposed which will make the path of the tax evader less smooth in future than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>In a number of cases, earnings are escaping taxation because they are being paid by way of fees or commissions and are not subject to deduction of tax under PAYE.  This loophole will be closed.  I will provide in the Finance Bill for an increase in the monetary penalties or fines for tax evasion.</P>
    <P>When back duty cases are settled, the level of the settlement must be such as to compensate the Exchequer for the tax of which it has been deprived and to impose a sanction which will act as a deterrent to evasion.  Where a back duty settlement covers a period of, say, ten years it is totally unrealistic to think that a tax liability of £500 evaded in 1972 is now made good to the Exchequer by payment of £500 in 1982.  Indeed, that tax bill of £500 is, in 1982 terms, the equivalent of about £1,800.</P>
    <P>This means that in an inflationary period the tax evader, even when caught, may continue to profit from his evasion by paying his debt in a depreciated currency. This will be coped with in two ways.  The Revenue Commissioners in future, when arriving at a settlement in back duty cases, will take into account <Col N="316" /> what the underpaid tax for past years would represent in real money terms at the time of the settlement.  This will apply to any settlements made after today.  Secondly, it is proposed to include a provision in the Finance Bill raising the rate of interest in back duty cases from its present level of 1¼ per cent per month to 2 per cent per month.  This higher rate of interest will be applicable only to back duty cases and not to ordinary cases of assessment where there is simply delay in paying the tax assessed.  In order to encourage people to finalise settlements in the immediate future I am deferring the introduction of the higher rate until 1 November 1982.</P>
    <P>Action will be taken to make more effective the present legislation which counters tax avoidence by dividend stripping. In relation to dividends paid after today, I am extending from six to ten years the period of application of that legislation.  This is intended to prevent substantial losses to the Exchequer from artificial arrangements designed to exploit the tax reliefs for trading losses and the payment of tax credits.  The necessary amendments will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The most radical proposal on taxation in the Programme for Government was to change the income tax structure.  With the full realisation of the extent of our financial difficulties, the Government are unable, as they had intended, to introduce the new programme in full at this time, especially as the cost of any such reduction must be matched by increases in indirect taxation.  We are, however, taking a major step towards the full implementation of the new system.  We have provided in the Finance (No. 3) Bill, 1981 for the replacement of the personal allowances by a new system of tax credits.</P>
    <P>The introduction of tax credits will result in a much fairer system of income tax.  It will eliminate the bias in the present system in favour of the better-off taxpayer which is a serious weakness in the present system.  Credits, unlike allowances, will be of equal worth to all taxpayers. For instance, the present married <Col N="317" /> allowance of £2,230 is worth only £780.50 to a person paying tax at 35 per cent, whereas it is worth £1,338 to a person paying tax at a rate of 60 per cent.  Under the new system the credit will be £1,000 for all married couples, irrespective of their tax liability.  The tax credit provides a basis for an entirely new and progressive approach to taxation.</P>
    <P>Another innovation being made in the Finance (No. 3) Bill, 1981, is the payment of half the married tax credit to the spouse working in the home.  The married tax credit is intended for two people anyway.  We believe that the non-working partner, usually the housewife, should have direct benefit from her share of this credit if she so wishes.  Those who have opted for this arrangement will receive £9.60 a week, equivalent to £500 a year, from April next.  For most couples this does not mean an increase in family incomes, but simply a transfer from the working partner to the spouse at home.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made, however, for a positive income supplement for low-income families.  A minimum supplement of £4 a week is guaranteed where the taxable income does not exceed £4,000. Where the taxable income is as low as £2,000, or roughly £40 a week, the family income will be increased by £500.  This family income supplement is intended to be of particular value to those poorer families who do not have access to social welfare benefits and it will increase the incentive to work.</P>
    <P>Because of the unsatisfactory state of our public finances and the overriding need to reduce the current budget deficit, there is no option but to defer some elements of the tax reform programme. Regrettably, it is not possible on this occasion to adopt the 25 per cent rate as the standard rate of tax immediately, because of the cost of this change and the consequent increases in indirect taxation that would be required to pay for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have been advised by institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and, at home, the Economic and Social Research Institute to defer, or at least phase in, the programme because of the poor state of our public finances.  We believe this advice to be given in the best interests of the economy.</P>
      <P>In addition to the matters to which I have already referred, we propose to introduce some further aspects of the programme today as a major step towards its full implementation.</P>
      <P>The programme envisaged that the existing social welfare children's allowances and the income tax child allowance be amalgamated and replaced by an enhanced system of child benefit.  This proposal was made in the context of a 25 per cent basic rate of income tax.  As I indicated earlier, I am not in a position to reduce the basic rate to 25 per cent this year.  In that situation the proposed full withdrawal of the income tax child allowances would mean less favourable treatment for middle-income families with between two and five children.  To avoid this, I propose to retain the income tax child allowance at a reduced level of £100 and to provide that the new child benefit will be payable from July next, with retrospective effect to April, at the monthly rate of £11.25 per child for the first five children and £17.50 for each child thereafter.</P>
      <P>These rates compare very favourably with the existing allowances of £6 a month for the first child and £9 a month for the second or subsequent child.  As an illustration of the substantial benefit involved, a mother with four children will receive £45 monthly compared with a previous £33, and with six children she will receive £73.75 monthly compared with £51 up to now.  The improvements in child benefit will cost £37.50 million in 1982 and £50 million in a full year.  The income tax allowance for an incapacitated child will not be reduced from its present level of £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also providing for an improvement <Col N="319" /> for widowed persons and single parents. It was indicated in the Government programme that widows, widowers and single parents would be treated for tax purposes in the same way as married persons.  While it is not yet possible to implement this commitment in full, all single parents, including widowed persons with dependent children, will in addition to the £500 tax credit qualify for an allowance of £1,500 which will be deductible in computing taxable income. This allowance will replace the present one-parent family allowance of £650 and the child housekeeper allowance of £165. For technical reasons it is not possible to provide this year that single parents will have the same tax credit of £1,000 as married couples, but the approach outlined will achieve substantially the same effect in terms of reduced tax liability.</P>
    <P>The allowance of £1,500 will improve significantly the position of widowed persons and other single parents with dependent children.  For example, a widow with two dependent children will now, generally speaking, be free of income tax on an income of £77 a week, or about £4,000 a year, a saving of £255. These gains are, of course, in addition to the improvements in the child benefit and other measures in the social welfare code to which I will be referring later.  In the case of widowed persons without dependent children, an additional allowance of £500 will be provided.  Benefits similar to those at present available will be provided for widows in the year of bereavement.</P>
    <P>This is as far as we can go for the present in the implementation of the tax reform programme.  The existing tax rates and tax bands are being retained, but so also is the special PAYE allowance of £600.  Certain features of the exemption limits will also be retained.  The cost of these changes, including the improved child benefits, will be £80 million this year and £113 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Because of financial circumstances, we have had to be selective in the implementation of the programme, but we have gone ahead immediately with those elements of the programme which will most <Col N="320" /> benefit low-income families.  This is in keeping with our policy of achieving a fairer distribution of taxation.</P>
    <P>There will also be improvements in the secondary allowances.  I am increasing the age allowance to £100 in the case of single and widowed persons and to £200 in the case of married couples.  The blind allowance is being raised from £400 to £500 and, where both spouses are blind, from £1,000 to £1,200.  An allowance of £500 is available where a person is employed to take care of an incapacitated person or his spouse, and I am proposing to increase this to £700.</P>
    <P>The dependant relative allowance is being improved by £15 to £110.  Since the introduction of income-splitting in 1980, which provides substantial benefits for married couples, couples can qualify in the year of marriage for three times the entitlement of single persons.  In this situation, I consider that the nuptial allowance of £115, which also applies in the year of marriage, is no longer appropriate and I propose to withdraw this allowance. I am also introducing a number of other significant measures in the income tax system which are designed to make it fairer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare Benefits</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is no reason in logic why short-term social welfare benefits should not be charged to taxation.  As far as the recipient is concerned, they constitute spendable cash just as any other income.  The fact that these benefits are not regarded as income for tax purposes, however, can result in certain circumstances in a person being better off not working than working. This is clearly undesirable and I am arranging that, with effect from the beginning of the next tax year, these benefits will be charged to taxation in the same manner as all other income.  For convenience of administration, there will be an initial 20 per cent tax on the pay-related element of these benefits, withheld at the point of payment.  Subsequently, the correct liability will be determined by the Revenue Commissioners and refunds made where appropriate. This arrangement will yield £10.5 million in 1982.</P>

        <i>Personal Interest Reliefs</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our income tax code provides relief in respect of interest paid on personal borrowings.  The terms of this relief are generous: an individual taxpayer may claim up to £2,400 interest for each tax year and a married couple up to a ceiling of £4,800.  The cost of the relief to the Exchequer is now running at over £50 million a year, of which more than two-thirds is attributable to mortgage interest.</P>
      <P>There is no sustainable justification for allowing income tax relief for personal loan interest.  It is unreasonable that the tax system should encourage personal borrowings, at such substantial cost to the Exchequer, by reducing their real cost.  The inevitable result is excessive growth in demand for these borrowings, which merely fuels inflation, adds to interest rate pressures and restricts borrowings for other purposes.  It is proposed therefore to limit the present benefits somewhat.</P>
      <P>There is an obvious case for a distinction between the treatment of interest on mortgage loans and interest on borrowings for other purposes.  People usually have no choice but to raise a mortgage in order to establish a home and there are good reasons of public policy why they should be encouraged to do so by means of tax relief.  Non-mortgage borrowing, or personal borrowing, on the other hand, is often used to finance consumer spending on imported goods.</P>
      <P>I consider that there should be no tax subsidy of non-mortgage loans and, accordingly, I am providing that relief will be disallowed for 1982-83 and subsequent years on any such loans taken out after today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mortgage interest is, as I have said, in a different category and it would be unreasonable to discontinue relief in respect of such interest because of the <Col N="322" /> severe impact this would have on many houseowners.  There is, however, a need for some restriction because, while there is a case for assisting the general house-purchaser, there is no case for saying that the better-off he is, the more he should be assisted, as in fact happens under present arrangements.  The following changes are therefore being made.</P>
    <P>In the case of new mortgages taken out after 5 April 1982, the following rules in respect of income tax relief will apply:</P>
    <P>(i)  relief will be allowed only in respect of the borrower's only or main residence;</P>
    <P>(ii)  relief will be allowed only at the 25 per cent and 35 per cent tax rates, as appropriate; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the capital limit for relief will be £35,000.</P>
    <P>There will be no change in the tax relief provisions in respect of existing mortgages.</P>
    <P>These new rules should not affect the position of the average taxpayer, as they still allow a generous relief.  There will be some reduction in relief, however, for those who incur borrowing, whether by mortgage or otherwise, up to the limit of the present reliefs, especially where these taxpayers are on higher tax rates.</P>
    <P>In view of economic circumstances and the high cost of these reliefs, the aim is to concentrate on giving more or less the same relief to people at all levels of income.  Up to now, those at higher levels have tended to derive the greater benefit.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the changes in the personal interest reliefs will yield £2 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business Entertainment Expenses</i>
    </P>
    <P>The allowance for business entertainment expenses for tax purposes was restricted two years ago to 50 per cent of expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is hard to justify a tax relief, at a cost to the Exchequer, for entertainment in present financial circumstances.  It is accepted that, in the course of business, entertainment expenses must be incurred from time to time, but in view of the <Col N="323" /> substantial Exchequer-funded assistance given to business generally and to industry in particular, the subsidisation of entertainment bills must have low priority. Moreover, it is known that abuse of this allowance is relatively easy.  Accordingly, I have decided that in future entertainment expenses will not be allowed in the calculation of income tax and corporation tax.  There will be no yield to the Exchequer in 1982 but the full-year yield will be about £3 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rent on Private Tenancies</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government Programme proposes a tax allowance for private tenancies up to a maximum of £1,000 rent.  The full implementation of this would, it is estimated, cost in the region of £15 million to £20 million in a full year, in tax forgone.  In present Exchequer circumstances this could not be afforded.  In order to focus attention first on the area of greatest need, the allowance will be made available to taxpayers aged 65 and upwards who live in private rented accommodation.  Relief will be allowed in the tax year 1983-84 in respect of vouched expenditure on rent incurred by those people during 1982.  Details of the relief will be announced in due course. For the present, I would advise those who consider that they are eligible for this to retain receipts for rent paid this year so that they will be able to claim it later.</P>
    <P>TAXATION OF SELF-EMPLOYED</P>
    <P>In the course of the Budget Statements of 1980 and 1981, my predecessors have drawn attention to the desirability of devising a uniform treatment of employed and self-employed taxpayers. They have given notice that the question of bringing the PAYE sector and the self-employed to an equivalent basis of assessment was under examination.  At present, self-employed persons are normally taxed in any year on the basis of profits earned in the preceding year and, especially in a period of high inflation, this results in a significant advantage.  The main reason for introducing the special PAYE allowance was to compensate the PAYE sector for this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> I propose, starting in the tax year 1983/84, to take steps which will place the self-employed on a current basis of assessment.  This is the only practical solution of the problem.  The precise mechanics of the change have yet to be determined but the aim will be to put all income taxpayers on an equal footing.</P>
    <P>CAPITAL TAXATION</P>
    <P>Capital taxes contribute a very small proportion only of our total tax revenue and the position is similar in other western democracies.  Despite this fact these taxes are important, primarily because they help to achieve a more equitable tax system.  It would be a mistake, however, to believe that there is a huge fund of untapped revenue to be collected from this area.  The reality is that short of introducing penal measures, which would be both unfair and economically disruptive, there is no prospect of dramatic increases in the yield from capital taxes in the short term at least.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed, however, to increasing revenue from capital taxation and, in accordance with this commitment, a number of changes are proposed.  Because of the way capital taxation operates, some of these changes will not produce much additional revenue this year, but they will provide a significant increase in the yield from capital taxation over the next few years.</P>
    <P>First, I propose to abolish the tapering relief in capital gains tax and to increase the rate of this tax by one third from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.  Tapering relief involves a reduction in the rate of tax for every three years of ownership of the asset disposed of, leading to complete exemption after 21 years.  This is unnecessarily generous, since indexation relief is also available.  No other country in the EEC has both of these reliefs.  These changes will take effect after today and will yield an estimated extra £3.5 million in a full year and about £0.5 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>The Government share the public concern about the large windfall gains made on the sale of development land.  A special capital gains tax for disposals of development land, is therefore, being <Col N="325" /> introduced to ensure that an appropriate part of these windfall benefits will be paid in future to the Exchequer.  After today, gains from the disposal of development land will be liable to capital gains tax at a new special rate of 45 per cent and indexation relief will be allowed only in respect of the appreciation in the then existing-use value on the date from which the gain will be computed.  Thus, for instance, indexation relief will be allowed for that portion of the gain which would enable a farmer to replace a farm sold for development by a farm of similar agricultural value.  In addition, roll-over relief will not apply and losses on other disposals will not be allowed for off-setting purposes.  Where the gain arises as a result of the compulsory acquisition of the property, the rate of tax will be 40 per cent, as I believe a lower rate should be charged in such instances because of the circumstances involved.  It is estimated that these measures will bring in about an extra £3 million in a full year and perhaps up to £1.5 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>I am proposing two important changes in capital acquisitions tax which will both increase revenue and combat tax avoidance. First, there will be a new aggregation basis for the tax.  Under existing arrangements, only gifts and inheritances acquired by an individual from the same disponer or donor, as a gift, are added together.  This enables someone to obtain, for example, £150,000 from both of his parents free of tax.  In future, all gifts and inheritances received by a beneficiary from all sources will be aggregated to determine the tax liability on each benefit.  This will reduce avoidance possibilities and will tax the accumulation of property.</P>
    <P>Second, I am introducing a special capital acquisitions tax on discretionary trusts.  At present, the tax is not charged on the transfer of property into a discretionary trust and no liability arises until payments are made eventually out of the trust.  Because of the way they operate, these trusts are difficult to monitor for capital acquisitions tax purposes and may be used as a mechanism for tax avoidance. The new tax, which will be additional to any tax liability payable by the <Col N="326" /> beneficiaries of the trust, will be charged on the market value of the trust property. The rate will be 3 per cent on the setting up of the trust and 1 per cent annually thereafter.  These initial and annual rates will also apply to existing trusts and the 3 per cent charge in their case will be levied on the property in the trust on 28 January.</P>
    <P>The legislative provisions for these capital acquisitions tax changes will be contained in the 1982 Finance Bill.  The tax on discretionary trusts will come into effect tomorrow and the commencement date for the new aggregation basis will be the date of enactment of the Finance Bill. Payment of these new charges will fall due after the Bill becomes law.  These measures will increase the yield from capital acquisitions tax by almost 50 per cent and will yield about £4½ million in 1982 and a similar amount next year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am proposing to make a number of changes in stamp duties which will come into effect shortly.  The stamp duty on new life insurance policies will be doubled from 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent, while the duty on new non-life policies will be reintroduced at a flat rate of £1 per policy.  There will be a change in the relief for transfers between certain close relatives, which at present are charged at a concessionary rate of 1 per cent, This type of transfer will in future be liable at half the normal stamp duty rates.  Finally, a number of fixed duties of 25p or 50p which have remained unchanged for many years will be increased to £5.  It is estimated that these various changes will yield an extra £3 million in a full year and an extra £2.3 million in 1982.</P>

    <P>The standard rate of corporation tax is at present 45 per cent having been reduced from 50 per cent in 1977.  In order to increase the yield from this tax, I am restoring the rate to 50 per cent with a corresponding change in the small companies rate from 35 per cent to 40 per cent.  The change will take effect as from <Col N="327" /> 1 January 1982.  The reduced effective rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing companies as provided for in the Finance Act, 1980 will remain as it is.</P>
    <P>There will be no yield effect in 1982 and an estimated increased yield of £10 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>An employment incentive scheme, details of which I will announce later, will mitigate the effect on firms which increase employment levels.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stock Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>Stock relief will be continued again on the existing basis for another year, at a cost in revenue forgone of £6 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>TAXATION OF BANKS</P>
    <P>In my budget of last July 1 I announced a special levy of £5 million on the banking sector.  This approach was adopted pending the outcome of a comprehensive review of the taxation system affecting banks.  I am not yet in a position to announce proposals in this area so there will be a further levy of £15 million to be paid this year.  Details of the levy will be announced later.</P>
    <P>I believe it is urgent that long-term decisions be taken as soon as possible on taxation of financial institutions.  This is a complex matter bearing on industrial development and in this regard the Government await with interest the report of the Commission on Taxation.  While we believe that the bank levy is justifiable as a temporary measure in order to obtain tax revenue from the banking sector, we do not believe that a levy of this type should be a permanent feature of the tax system.  The Government are resolved to make a decision on a permanent system within the year and therefore will not be introducing taxes in the form of levies on the banks in any future years.  The future system will be based on normal business taxation rather than on special levies.</P>
    <P>INDIRECT TAXATION</P>
    <P>I come now to indirect taxation.  In arriving at the following package of <Col N="328" /> increases and reliefs, I have been particularly concerned to achieve an equitable spread as between discretionary and less discretionary items of expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Value-Added Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Four changes in the value-added tax system, involving all the main tax categories, will be made.  In distributing these changes across the system, an attempt is being made to reduce some of the anomalies which exist and to avoid adding to the complications of the system.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Low Rate of VAT</i>
    </P>
    <P>The low rate of VAT was increased to 15 per cent from 1 September last.  In normal circumstances one would be reluctant to increase this further but, in view of the severity of our financial problems, I have decided that an increase in this rate is the most appropriate course of action.  Accordingly the 15 per cent rate will be increased to 18 per cent with effect from 1 March 1982.  As in the case of the previous increase, provision is being made for the effective 3 per cent VAT rate on building to remain unchanged and also the 3 per cent effective rate on agricultural services.  The flat-rate VAT rebate for farmers will be raised to 1.8 per cent in order to maintain the existing offset for the increase in VAT on farm inputs.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the last increase in this rate, because of the special situation in the tourist industry, a deferment of the increase as it applied to accommodation, car and boat hire provided to non-residents under the terms of fixed price contracts entered into before 1 January 1981, was allowed.  A similar deferment up to 31 December 1982 in respect of the present increase for such services provided under fixed price contracts entered into before 1 January 1982 will be allowed. Discussions will be held with the trade regarding implementation.  Appropriate legislative arrangements will be made in the light of these discussions.</P>
    <P>This increase in the low rate of VAT will yield additional revenue of £80 million in 1982 and £120 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" />
      <i>Clothing and Footwear</i>
    </P>
    <P>We have an exceptionally large zero-rated category in our VAT system, covering some 27 per cent of all items.  This is far larger than in any of our EEC partners apart from the UK, which also has a large zero-rated category.  While these zero-ratings are doubtless welcome to the consumer, they are naturally at the expense of higher taxes in other areas. The major zero-ratings, particularly clothing and footwear, therefore have been reviewed.</P>
    <P>Clothing and footwear are undeniably necessities of life.  Yet this category covers everything from the most simple garments to the most expensive and ephemeral creations of fashion.  Substantial expenditure on high-cost clothes should not be allowed to continue untaxed.  A high proportion of clothing and footwear is now imported&mdash;when the zero-rating was introduced in 1975, more than half of the clothing and footwear purchased in this country was produced domestically, while now the balance has swung far in the opposite direction.  The rate of increase in the value of imports of clothing and footwear in recent years has been far in excess of the figures for imports generally, thus contributing to the widening of the balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>The latest information available on household expenditure patterns suggests that a tax on clothing and footwear will, not alone in absolute terms, but also as a proportion of average total household expenditure, bear less heavily on lower and lower middle-income households than on higher-income households.</P>
    <P>It has been decided, therefore, that clothing and footwear do not warrant continued zero-rating in present financial circumstances.  It is proposed to apply the increased low rate of 18 per cent to clothing and footwear from 1 March next.</P>

I am aware that this is done in the UK, but I am aware also of the major difficulties which it poses in practice and of the anomalies it has created.  I consider it preferable therefore to compensate parents directly through the new child benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>This measure it is estimated, will yield £67 million this year and £106.6 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Exempt Services</i>
      </P>
      <P>The range of services which are at present exempt from VAT has been reviewed.  Most of these are exempt compulsorily under EEC law and this cannot be changed unilaterally by us.  However, there are some services which are at present exempted at our discretion and which merit reconsideration at this stage. Unless there is a strong reason for such exemption, all services should be subject to VAT.  Accordingly the new 18 per cent VAT rate will be applied to the following services which are at present exempt:</P>
      <P>&mdash;solicitors</P>
      <P>&mdash;barristers</P>
      <P>&mdash;debt and rent collection agents</P>
      <P>&mdash;accountants and actuaries.</P>
      <P>Auctioneers are already liable for VAT on their sale fees to a limited extent. Liability will now be extended further to include, in the main, fees on the sale of exempted property.  The existing treatment for auction sales of horses and grey-hounds, livestock and vegetables, fruit and fish, etc., is being maintained.  This measure will yield £2.5 million in 1982 and £7.5 million in a full year.  The necessary provision will be made in the Finance Bill for implementation with effect from 1 July.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>25 per cent Rate of VAT</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard rate of VAT is already quite high, at 25 per cent.  Furthermore, the rate applies to many goods which are essential to everyday living.  On the other hand, the rate undoubtedly covers many items on which expenditure is in part, and in some cases entirely, discretionary. <Col N="331" /> In the circumstances, I have decided to increase the rate from 25 to 30 per cent and transfer furniture and joinery, soft furnishings, bed linen, blankets, rugs and floor coverings generally, including carpets, to the new low rate of 18 per cent. These combined measures will, it is estimated, yield a net £13.5 million this year and £20.2 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>EXCISE DUTIES</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I turn now to the excise duties.  I am aware of the difficulties at present being experienced in the drink sector.  While a case has been put forward for no tax increases on these commodities, it has to be appreciated that expenditure in this area is discretionary and, notwithstanding the fact that the sector is a valuable employer and user of Irish raw materials, regrettably the level of taxation has to be increased somewhat when so much additional finance is needed to fund the level of public services required by Irish society.  The increases have been kept to the minimum possible.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Beer</i>
      </P>
      <P>There will be a duty-based increase of 2p in the retail price of the pint of beer, to take effect immediately.  This is expected to bring in extra revenue of £11.8 million this year and £14.4 million in a full year.  This increase, together with the VAT change on 1 March, will give a total tax increase of 4p to 4½p on the pint of beer.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Spirits</i>
      </P>
      <P>There will be an immediate duty-based increase of 4p in the retail price of a glass of spirits.  This is an extra 2p on the normal half-glass measure and will bring in extra revenue of £7.8 million this year and £8.9 million in a full year.  Taking account of the VAT change on 1 March, this amounts to a total tax increase of 8p to 8½p on the glass of spirits, or about 4p on the normal half-glass measure.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Wine</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to increase by 30p the duty-based <Col N="332" /> element in the retail price of a bottle of wine, to have immediate effect. The increase will be <i>pro rata</i> for stronger wines.  For sparkling wines it will be 60p per bottle.  The yield is estimated at £3.9 million in 1982 and £4.3 million in a full year.  Combined with the VAT change on 1 March, this will give a total tax increase of about 42p for a bottle of wine at present costing £4.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cider and Perry</i>
    </P>
    <P>There will be an immediate excise duty increase of 6p per gallon for ordinary cider and perry.  The increase will be <i>pro rata</i> for higher strength cider and perry. This will yield extra revenue of £60,000 in 1982 and £70,000 in a full year. Together with the VAT increase on 1 March, the total tax increase will be about 5p on the ordinary 2 pint flagon of cider.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cigarettes and Tobacco</i>
    </P>
    <P>The duty-based tax on 20 cigarettes will be increased immediately by 8p, with a <i>pro rata</i> tax increase on tobacco.  This is estimated to yield £19.5 million in 1982 and £23 million in a full year.  This tax increase, together with the VAT change on 1 March, will result in an aggregate tax increase of about 11½p on 20 cigarettes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Petrol, Road Diesel, Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) used in Motor Vehicles</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am conscious of the cost of motoring at present and aware that for many people it can no longer be considered a luxury.  Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the fact that expenditure on motoring and hydrocarbon oils is a major contributor to our balance of payments deficit. There is still scope for conservation and more efficient use of these fuels, particularly by urban users.  Accordingly, immediate duty-based increases of 8p on the gallon of petrol, 8p on the gallon of road diesel and 8p on the gallon of liquid petroleum gas used in road vehicles are proposed.  The practice, by making appropriate arrangements, of ensuring that the excise duty increases will not <Col N="333" /> affect handicapped drivers or scheduled road passenger services will be continued. These duty increases are estimated to yield £27.5 million in 1982 and £30.2 million in a full year.  Together with the VAT changes on 1 March, the total tax increases will be about 14p on the gallon of petrol and about 13p on road diesel. LPG is not subject to VAT</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure on video players has been soaring in the past few years and this trend seems set to continue. In present circumstances I consider it appropriate to impose additional taxation on these players, both to reduce the burden on the balance of payments and to add to the Exchequer contribution from this highly discretionary expenditure. I propose to introduce an excise duty of £20 on video players with immediate effect.  The yield is estimated at £0.6 million in 1982 and £0.7 million in a full year.  Together with the increase in the VAT rate to 30 per cent, this will add £66 to the price of a video player now retailing at £1,000.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Televisions</i>
      </P>
      <P>There will be an increase of £17 in the specific duty on the top category of colour TV, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for all other categories of colour and monochrome sets.  The increase, which comes into effect immediately, is estimated to yield £1.2 million in 1982 and £1.5 million in a full year.  Together with the increase in the low VAT rate to 18 per cent on 1 March, this will add about £36 to the price of a top category colour TV set now retailing at £600.</P>
      <P>IMPLEMENTATION OF PRICE INCREASES</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These excise duty increases will take effect from midnight tonight, but increases in retail prices must await new maximum price orders where appropriate. These will be made by the Minister <Col N="334" /> for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, who will determine the appropriate implementation date.  Even where price control does not operate, there should be no increase in the price of goods already in the shops, as the excise duty will apply only to goods imported or removed from bond from midnight tonight.</P>
    <P>EXCISE DUTY CONCESSIONS</P>
    <P>Before I leave the main excise duties there are a number of related concessions to be mentioned:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-alcoholic Beer</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is being arranged that the duty on beers which do not exceed an alcohol content of 0.5 per cent by volume will be reduced to the level now applying to table waters.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Hydrocarbon Oils</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am making a limited concession on the hydrocarbon oil duty for non-automotive use.  The general rate of excise duty on residual fuel oil used by industry was reduced to 4½p with effect from 1 December 1981 and this will be of benefit to manufacturing industry.  It is now proposed to allow a concession for manufacturers by refunding them the excise duty paid on oil contained in exported products.</P>
    <P>These two concessions, which have immediate effect, will cost an estimated £400,000 in 1982 and £460,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>MINOR EXCISE DUTIES</P>
    <P>There are some minor excise duties where increases are warranted on this occasion.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Gaming Machines</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to increase the licence duty on gaming machines, colloquially known as slot machines, with immediate effect by £50 for a full year or £12.50 per three-month period.  The weekend licence will be increased by £34 per machine or £8.50 for a three-month period.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Exemption Orders etc.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Special exemption orders, club extensions and the like are required for drinking <Col N="335" /> at discos and other functions outside normal hours licensed for drinking.  The duty payable in these cases will be increased from £25 to £50.  This new rate of duty will apply immediately to all exemption orders, etc. issued in respect of dates on or after 1 July 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dance Hall Licence Duty</i>
    </P>
    <P>In regard to the ordinary dance hall licence, I am anxious to provide encouragement to community organisations running dances in their own halls for community purposes; accordingly there will be a reduction in the duty by £25 to £75 for the annual licence and by £5 to £10 for the monthly licence.  The reduction will take effect from 1 October 1982.  I will make the necessary provision in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>These changes in minor excise duties will yield a net £0.6 million in 1982 and £1.1 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>FOREIGN HOLIDAY TAX</P>
    <P>An area of discretionary expenditure which I consider does not bear its fair share of tax at present is expenditure on foreign holidays.  It is a measure of the unreality of our living styles that, not-withstanding the recession in the economy generally, more people than ever before were able to take their holidays abroad in 1981.  It is not many years ago since tourism was a major invisible contributor to our balance of payments. Now the amount of money being spent abroad by Irish people on holidays is roughly equal to the amount spent here by foreign visitors and is rising at a much faster rate.  It has to be recognised that this growing expenditure abroad places a considerable strain on our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances a tax of £10 will be charged in respect of each person leaving the State on and after 1 April 1982 on a chartered aircraft where the charter originates in Ireland.  It will not apply to small aircraft, which are used generally for business purposes.  Children under two years of age will also be exempt. Apart from these, I cannot consider any exemptions because it would make the <Col N="336" /> scheme unworkable.  It is estimated that the tax will yield £2 million in 1982 and £2.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this tax will not apply to all foreign holidays, but it has not been possible to implement a wider scheme at this stage.  I intend, however, to examine the possibility of extending the scope of the tax in the future.</P>
    <P>MOTOR VEHICLES</P>
    <P>I am proposing a number of changes in respect of the tax on motor vehicles. These are designed both to increase revenue and to bring about a more rational approach to the taxation and use of these vehicles.</P>
    <P>Last year, imports of motor vehicles and spare parts totalled an estimated £320 million and the impact of this on the balance of payments is self-evident.  We have no indigenous motor manufacturing industry and it is only commonsense that we should take steps to reduce the rate of imports and encourage longer usage of cars, provided of course that we can satisfy safety requirements.  In addition, the small size of the country and the relatively short distances that need to be covered, as well as energy conservation and cost considerations, all argue for weighting tax more heavily on the larger, expensive cars rather than on smaller more economic cars.</P>
    <P>As well as the VAT increases already announced and some increases in road tax, which I will deal with later, I am proposing, therefore, some changes in both the excise and income tax arrangements in regard to motor vehicles which reflect these considerations.</P>
    <P>I propose to reduce the excise duty on motor vehicle parts by one-third to 25 per cent from the present level of 37½ per cent.  The duty on tyres and tubes will also be reduced by one-third, to 5 per cent for domestically produced tyres and 10 per cent for imported tyres.  This change will apply from 1 October 1982, in order to allow the trade to run down their stocks of parts, etc. to which the higher duty has already been applied. This measure will cost an estimated £1.5 million in 1982 and £5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> I propose to recover part of the cost of this concession by increasing the excise duty on private motor vehicles above 16 horse power from 50 per cent to 60 per cent with immediate effect.  This will yield additional revenue of about £1.3 million in 1982 and £1.6 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of these changes is to alter the incidence of tax in a direction which, I hope, will lead to smaller cars being purchased and cars being retained for longer periods.  The value-added tax proposals which I have announced will affect all parts of the motoring trade equally.</P>
    <P>The present tax arrangements for employees who have the use of a car for private as well as business purposes as part of their conditions of employment are extremely generous.  The use of a car is, in effect, a substantial additional remuneration and, under existing arrangements, it is completely undervalued for the purposes of assessing tax.  I am reviewing these arrangements with a view to arriving at a more realistic procedure for assessing tax due.  For the present I am providing that, in reckoning the annual value of the use of a motor car, the rate will be 20 per cent of the cost price instead of the rate usually adopted up to now which has been 12½ per cent. This change will only have a minimal effect on those, such as commercial travellers, who have little private use of a company car.</P>
    <P>ROAD TAX</P>
    <P>I am proposing increases of £1 per horse-power on the annual rates of road tax on cars not exceeding 8 horse-power, £2 per horse-power on the rates which apply on cars from 9 to 20 horse-power inclusive, and £3 per horse-power on cars exceeding 20 horse-power.</P>
    <P>The road tax rates re-introduced last year for motor cycles were originally fixed in 1973 and ranged from £2 to £15. I propose to double the present rates to provide a new range of charges of between £4 and £30.  In the case of taxis and hackneys I propose to replace the present maximum rates of £16.50 and £30 <Col N="338" /> per annum respectively, which have been in force for a long time, with more realistic maximum rates of £30 for taxis and £50 for hackneys, together with corresponding increases in the lower rates of tax on these vehicles.</P>
    <P>These increases are to apply on and from 1 March 1982.  The additional revenue from these measures is estimated at £13.3 million in 1982 and £15.9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I intend to provide in the forthcoming Finance Bill for the option of paying road tax on a two-year basis in order to facilitate motorists in the payment of tax.  In this context I am also reviewing the penalties for road tax offences, several of which were fixed some years ago.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of motor cars, I might mention that a wide-ranging investigation is at present being conducted into the cost of motor insurance in Ireland. This investigation, which will be completed by the end of the year, will cover every aspect of motor insurance and, in particular, the premiums and other charges made and the methods of providing such insurance.</P>
    <P Just="Center">POST OFFICE CHARGES</P>
    <P>I refer now to post office charges. These are classified as non-tax revenue. In principle the postal and telecommunications services are expected to pay their way but in recent years they have been incurring significant deficits on their commercial accounts.  A deficit of £23 million occurred in 1981 and a further deficit of £57 million is projected for 1982 if present rates of charges continue.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid burdening the general taxpayer with deficits of that magnitude it is proposed to increase postal and telecommunications charges by 20 per cent on average with effect from 1 April 1982. This would all but close the projected deficit on commercial accounts and is expected to yield £38 million in revenue to the Exchequer in 1982.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will announce the details later.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVISED EXPENDITURE ALLOCATIONS</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> I will now deal with the expenditure side of the budget in which the Government propose to make additional provision for social expenditure and to provide extra funds to support growth in employment and in the economy generally. However, to finance this expenditure while reducing the budget deficit to an acceptable level requires, in addition to the taxation already proposed, further measures to reduce expenditure and otherwise limit the burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Food Subsidies</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present the Exchequer provides subsidies on bread, flour, margarine, milk and butter in order to reduce the price of these commodities to all consumers. The benefits of the subsidies are available to everybody, from the very well-off to the very poor.  Indeed because the well-off are bigger buyers than the needy can afford to be, they derive a bigger cash benefit from the subsidies than those in less fortunate circumstances. The food subsidies are therefore a somewhat wasteful mechanism for transferring resources.</P>
    <P>The Government have accordingly reviewed their policies in relation to food subsidies.  They recognise that for some of the items the complete abolition of such subsidies would give rise to unacceptable price rises which could bear heavily on some sections of our people.</P>
    <P>The following new arrangements are proposed:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The existing Exchequer subsidy on butter will be reduced by 8½ pence to a new level of 14 pence per lb. and will be set at that level.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The subsidy on milk, which, on average, is 4.25 pence per pint, will be eliminated.  However, an Exchequer subsidy of 2.4 pence per pint will be paid on milk supplied under the new school milk scheme, thus attracting an EEC subsidy of 9.7 pence per pint for such milk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" />&mdash;Subsidies on bread, flour and margarine will remain.  They will be set at levels equal to those now in force for these commodities.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the cut in the butter subsidy will be effective as from tomorrow. The cessation of the milk subsidy will take effect from Friday.  The necessary maximum retail prices orders in respect of milk and butter will be made by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, to take effect as from Friday. The new food subsidies arrangements will result in a major net saving for the Exchequer of some £47½ million in 1982.</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious to ensure that recipients of weekly social welfare benefits are not adversely affected by these subsidy changes.  Accordingly these changes have been taken fully into account in the very generous increases in social welfare benefits and assistance to which I shall refer presently, and which go well beyond the level of prospective increases in living costs.  The introduction of the family income supplement and the new child benefit will also be of assistance to many low income families.</P>

      <P>The Government came into office with a strong commitment to protecting and improving the living standards of social welfare recipients, despite the need to check the growth in expenditure.</P>
      <P>We have already acted on this resolve in a variety of ways&mdash;for example the increases last October in weekly payments, the double payment at Christmas for pensioners, and the increase in the value of vouchers under the free fuel schemes.</P>
      <P>In recent years welfare recipients have experienced increases in real terms which have been significantly higher than the growth in real take-home earnings or in economic output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reviewing the present levels of welfare payments the Government have had to consider current developments in the general field of incomes.  This has been <Col N="341" /> necessary both from the point of view of the work incentive and of the ability of the taxpayer to finance welfare payments.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, however, the Government remain determined that this year's budget increases in such payments will go beyond what would be needed to match expected increases in living costs and will therefore be a real improvement for recipients.</P>

        <i>Social Welfare Payments</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have accordingly decided that, from April next, personal and adult dependant rates of weekly payments should be increased by 25 per cent.  This will also apply to health allowances.  This will mean an extra £8.05 a week, for example, for a contributory old age pensioner who is under 80 and £6.90 per week for a non-contributory pensioner.  For a married couple, both of pension age and under 80, the new rates will mean an increase of £14.05 a week in the maximum contributory old age pension.  For a widow under 66 on contributory pension there will be an extra £7.25 a week, and £6.75 for her non-contributory counterpart.  A married man on flat-rate unemployment or disability benefit will get an increase of £10.45 a week.</P>
      <P>In revising the weekly dependency payments for children of social welfare recipients, the Government have decided that account should be taken of the substantial increases in payments under the new augmented child benefit scheme, to which I have already referred.  Total payments in respect of a child dependant of a social welfare recipient will thus be increased by 25 per cent with effect from April next, the child benefit element for the months April to June being payable retrospectively in July on commencement of payments generally under that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking all these increases together, a widow under 66 years with three children on a contributory pension will receive an extra £15.06 a week; and a non-contributory <Col N="342" /> widow will receive an extra £13.96 a week.  Again, for a married couple with three children on flat-rate unemployment benefit or disability benefit, total increases will amount to £16.61 a week.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Financing Welfare Improvements</i>
    </P>
    <P>All in all, the Government are planning to spend very substantial extra sums of money this year on social welfare, including health allowances.  The full cost of the improvements I have announced, including the child benefit, will be £238.8 million in 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying that, if no action were taken on social insurance contributions, this amount would have to be financed in full from general taxation on the ordinary taxpayer. On this basis the gap in the social insurance fund between expenditure and income would grow to nearly £320 million or 36 per cent of fund expenditure, an intolerable demand on the taxpayer at any time but in particular in present circumstances. The Government have decided therefore, that, in 1982, contributors will meet 75 per cent of social insurance expenditure, and statutory provision will be made that any shortfall which might emerge on this figure will be recouped later from contributors.</P>
      <P>This decision will require an increase in the standard rate of pay-related insurance by 3.5 percentage points from April next, with commensurate increases in other modified rates of contribution.  In order to moderate the impact of social security contributions on employers, the Government think it right that on this occasion employers should not be required to meet more than one-half of the increase in social insurance contributions, with employees meeting the balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have also reviewed in the normal way the income ceiling on which contributions are levied, which is <Col N="343" /> £8,500 at present.  To take account in broad terms of increases in earnings, the ceiling is being increased to £9,500.</P>
    <P>Social insurance contributors will thus meet £102.1 million of the 1982 cost of the total improvements in social welfare, and the balance of £136.7 million will be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Improvements</i>
    </P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing measures, the Government have also decided on a number of lesser, but nonetheless significant, improvements in the social welfare code.  For instance, there will be an easing of the means test for single parents; there will be higher death grants; and there will be an extension of the prescribed relative allowance scheme to invalidity pensioners under 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>I am also making provision, of £1.6 million, to finance the increase already announced in fuel vouchers for this month because of the abnormal weather conditions.</P>
    <P>A full list of the various improvements will be found in the document the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Decontrol of Rents&mdash;Contingency Provision</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are making a contingency provision of £6 million against the eventuality that help may be required from public funds in 1982 to assist tenants affected by the recent court decision in regard to the decontrol of rents.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Development of the Economy</i>
    </P>
    <P>As part of the longer term strategy for the development of the economy, I am making a number of provisions which are designed to encourage industrial expansion and a stronger export performance. If we are to achieve the levels of economic and social reconstruction to which the Government aspire, then we must give particular attention to the productive areas of the economy and we must provide the means whereby they will grow and prosper.</P>
    <P>While the main impetus must come from those who are directly engaged in producing and selling goods, the State must also make a contribution.  It is <Col N="344" /> already making a very substantial contribution by way of financial incentives. There are of course other means whereby the State can encourage development.  It can encourage greater harmony at work, it can help create a climate which will improve our prospects of competing in international markets, and there are situations where it should become directly involved in the actual business of production and marketing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Export Marketing</i>
    </P>
    <P>I would like to turn first to the very important matter of export marketing. Last autumn I approved an allocation of £1 million to Coras Tráchtála Teoranta from the Employment Guarantee Fund to finance a special one-year scheme designed to assist firms in Irish industry to increase the number of export salesmen working abroad.  CTT have been actively implementing that scheme and the response by firms has been very encouraging.  I therefore propose to allocate it an additional sum of £500,000, bringing the total cost this year to £1.5 million.  Arrangements have been made to secure that, within the extra sum now allocated, CTT will give special priority to assisting the expansion of the export selling capability of the drinks industry.</P>
    <P>I have also decided that a further sum of £500,000 will go to CTT to fund a series of immediate order-winning promotions; CTT have set a target of achieving additional exports of the order of £60 million or so by this means.  The series of promotions for this end will include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the bringing into Ireland of additional overseas buyers covering the consumer and industrial products sectors;</P>
    <P>&mdash;efforts to win additional orders in the Middle East and Africa through a special sales task force and the organisation of extra sectoral sales missions; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the organisation, for small firms, of three regional trade exhibitions in Ireland to generate additional orders.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that new working capital <Col N="345" /> will be needed by small and medium-sized enterprises in order to fund a higher level of performance in export markets. Accordingly, I have arranged that funds for this purpose will be provided by the Industrial Credit Company on advantageous terms.  For this new facility, an initial sum of £10 million will be available. The precise details of the incentive will be announced shortly by ICC.</P>
    <P>NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION</P>
    <P>Existing policies have failed to keep pace with the employment requirements of a young and fast-growing population. This is not in any sense to belittle the tremendous work done by the industrial promotion agencies, which have produced remarkable results in world economic conditions that are not conducive to growth in internationally mobile investment.  Nevertheless, we have failed to date in our efforts to realise the full development potential of the economy. Radical structural initiatives are required if we are to improve employment opportunities for all our people.  The Government are committed to a process of structural change which will have as its primary focus the expansion of investment and output in the directly productive sectors of the economy thereby creating additional viable long-term jobs.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government envisaged that a National Development Corporation would be set up which would engage in new projects with the objective of productive employment creation particularly in potential growth sectors of the economy, either on its own or in joint ventures with other public, private and co-operative enterprises.  The Government are giving detailed consideration to the organisational set-up and functions appropriate to the Corporation with a view to the introduction of legislation at an early date.  I am, accordingly, providing £250,000 to meet the administration and general expenses of the Corporation in 1982 and £20 million for its capital requirements.  These funds should enable the Corporation to make an effective start in 1982 and will be added to in later years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE</P>
    <P>Further reflecting this Government's concern to promote viable economic growth, I am providing £220,000 to finance the work of the tripartite Sectoral Development Committee in identifying the growth potential of individual economic sectors and seeing how these growth potentials can be realised.  This provision is in addition to the £600,000 already allocated for this purpose from the Employment Guarantee Fund.</P>
    <P>DELAYS IN PLANNING DECISIONS</P>
    <P>In the interests of employment the Government are concerned that unwarranted delays in planning permissions do not hinder legitimate development.  The Minister for the Environment is, therefore, undertaking a general review of planning legislation with a view to facilitating speedier decisions.</P>
    <P>PROFIT SHARING</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my Budget Statement of last July that I was having an urgent examination made of the question of exempting from income tax shares given by companies to their workers under profit sharing arrangements.  The necessary provisions to give effect to this commitment in the Government Programme will be included in the Finance Bill.  This concession should help in promoting a greater involvement by workers in their employer companies and, in a substantial way, contribute to the attainment of more harmonious industrial relations and increased employment.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DEFICIT AND BORROWING 1982</P>
    <P>I started with an opening deficit in this budget of £933 million, or £1,001 million if one provides for the maintenance of the real level of social welfare benefits. Starting from £933 million, the expenditure proposals will result in a net addition of £102 million, and the revenue concessions add £60 million.  Taking account of an estimated £50 million which Departments have on hands in balances from 1981, which reduce, to that extent, the amount which has to be issued from the <Col N="347" /> Exchequer in 1982, and the increase in revenue in the budget of £330 million, the estimated current deficit emerges at £715 million, or 5.9 per cent of our GNP. This is a significant real reduction and represents the first step in implementing the Government's commitment to eliminate the deficit over the next four years. It accords, moreover, with the recommendation of the EEC Commission.  It compares favourably with the 1981 deficit of £802 million, or 7.9 per cent of GNP, as against the projected 5.9 per cent for this year; indeed, it compares favourably with the deficits recorded in 1979 and 1980 of 6.9 per cent and 6.3 per cent of GNP, respectively.  It also marks a step in bringing us into line with the position found among practically all our EEC partners, many of whom have virtually no current budget deficits or are even in surplus.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the additional capital provisions of £110 million which I have made today, the Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes comes to £946 million.  Together with the current budget deficit of £715 million, the estimate of total Exchequer borrowing for 1982 is £1,661 million, or 13.8 per cent of GNP compared with about 17 per cent in 1981, 16.9 to be precise.  This compares with borrowing of £1,722 million in 1981.  The reduction in borrowing marks a major step on the road to reconstructing the public finances on a secure basis and making our economy more self-reliant.</P>
    <P>While the substantial progress made today will result in a marked improvement in the Government's finances, the underlying position remains difficult.  To illustrate: if borrowing in 1983 were to be at the same absolute level as now planned for 1982, the cost of Central Fund services in 1983 &mdash; that is, basically debt services &mdash; would rise, because of debt charges alone by almost £340 million. There is, therefore, simply no room for deviation from the broad targets set in this budget and the Government must continue the process towards the elimination of the current budget deficit for the remainder of the four year period.</P>
    <P>CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> It may be argued by some that the budget increases the cost of living.  It does.  But it does so with a clear purpose in mind, that of restoring stability to our national finances and thereby ensuring that such tax increases will not be necessary on such a scale in future years.</P>
    <P>It may be argued, as it was last July, from the other side of the House, that this budget is not necessary.  I wish that this were true.  Indeed, it would be true, but for the fiscal policy followed in recent years.  Let me take a somewhat controversial example, that of the period between 1977 and mid-1981.  In that short period alone, £5,000 million was added to our national debt and 25,000 people were added to public service numbers. This has resulted in an additional £550 million on the annual cost of debt service which we have to bear now in 1982, and about £250 million additional on the public sector pay bill again, which has to be borne in 1982.  The sum of these two figures deriving from 1977 to 1981 more or less equals our current budget deficit and it is clear that, were it not for this burden, if what happended in those years had not happened, I can assure the House I would be introducing a very different budget today.  Indeed our national debt and public service numbers have been increasing at an ever-accelerating pace since 1970.</P>
    <P>In the opening words of this statement, I outlined the objectives of today's budget.  These are to reduce our dependence on foreign borrowing, to strengthen our position in international trade, to improve living standards for the poorer sections of the community, to achieve a fairer system of taxation and to improve the incentive to work.  The proposals which I have announced represent substantial progress towards the achievement of each of these objectives.  We have taken the major first step in reducing our dependence on foreign borrowing and on foreign banks.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position in international trade will be helped in a number of ways. The lower budget deficit will reduce spending on imports, and the reduced <Col N="349" /> debt will cut the need to pay interest out of this country to foreign banks.  The tax measures themselves have been particularly chosen so as to reduce our spending on imported items such as videos, motor cars and foreign holidays.</P>
    <P>The living standards of those who cannot help themselves will be raised by the budget to an extent which more than matches the prospective rise in the cost of living.  Not only are social welfare benefits incresed by 25 per cent; a new family income supplement is being introduced for those on low pay at work, giving a minimum gain of £4 per week to many families, and a new child benefit scheme is being introduced.</P>
    <P>The first steps have been taken in a major reform of our income tax system. Tax credits, a payment to the spouse at home and child benefits have been introduced. They help those whose interests are neglected under the existing tax system.</P>
    <P>The incentive to work has been increased.  The new income tax relief for <Col N="350" /> the low paid, the family income supplement, the new profit sharing arrangements and the taxation of some social welfare benefits will all tip the balance in favour of those who go out to work to help support our community in this difficult time.</P>

      <P>The most important part of this budget is the fact that it strengthens our economy.  The drag of foreign debt has been diminished.  The State's capacity to support, not just temporary jobs, but long-term self-sustaining employment has been greatly enhanced. An employment tax credit has been introduced and new job-creating agencies&mdash;a National Development Corporation and a Youth Employment Agency&mdash;are, being established.  As a well-managed, strong community we will now be able to offer a much more secure future to our young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just listened to the most appalling statement from the Minister for Finance.  It is appalling not just for the savage tax increases which it imposes but also because it is a clear catalogue of broken promises and back tracking on all the things that the people opposite, from both parties, were saying to the people just a few months ago.  They are not only back tracking on what they said so recently but are giving, again, a message of pessimism.</P>
      <P>Where is the element of hope for the future for any of our young people in what they heard this afternoon?  It is nowhere.  Above all I have to say that if all of these things were in any sense justified by our circumstances we might be willing to tolerate them.  But they are not because this budget is quite clearly the wrong budget for the circumstances of Ireland today.  We listened to a long recital of numbers and percentages and statistics.  But a budget is not simply arithmetic. A budget should be concerned with and should deal with the real, economic and social problems before the country.</P>
      <P>Yet, the Minister managed to go right through his speech without anything more than a passing reference to unemployment. He did not even tell us what he expected to happen to employment this year, and rightly so, because if we look into the details of the budget we all know that it must mean thousands more on the dole queues before this year is out, and I say that without fear of contradiction. The Minister managed to go through his budget without saying anything about the cost of living, and rightly so, because this budget adds at least 5 per cent immediately to prices.  So we already know, before another day passes, that the country is condemned to inflation in excess of 20 per cent this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Minister said nothing about how he hoped to cope with what is a very substantial problem, our balance of payments, our ability to pay our way in the world.  Again there were passing references but not a single, clear, cohesive statement of a policy in that area.  The <Col N="374" /> fact is of course that they have no policy. Why do I say that?  I say it because in so far as they claimed to have a policy six months ago we were told that they were going to cope with the Government's budgetary problem by a cutback or curb on the Government's day-to-day spending, that in doing that they would ensure that they would maintain, if not increase, spending in productive capital areas and that there would be no recourse to heavy taxation.  We heard the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, saying in the weeks just before the election that extra heavy taxation was not the way forward at this time.  What have we seen?  We have seen, between July and today, tax increases of more than £800 million inflicted on the Irish people, an incredible, staggering increase.  At the end of all that what have we to show for it?  There is no real improvement in the Government finances, contrary to what the Minister is claiming.  There is certainly no prospect of improving our real economy because anyone who thinks that we are going to get Ireland out of trouble by worsening inflation and by damaging our ability to attract investment and our ability to provide jobs must be living in an incredible cloud-cuckooland of his own.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get to my solutions in a few minutes.  First, I want to summarise &mdash; more clearly than the Minister did because I know he did not wish to summarise&mdash;what the budget is doing.  For the average family it is going to inflict more heavy increases in their ordinary day to day expenses.  We are told that the basic VAT rate is going up from 15 to 18 per cent.  We are told that clothing, even children's clothing, is going to jump from a nil rate today to 18 per cent.  We are told that the average worker is going to have to dip into his pocket and find another 1¾ per cent &mdash; that is roughly another £2 a week on the average man's pay packet &mdash; to pay for social welfare benefits.  We are also told that the subsidies that exist, such as they are, are going to be wiped out this week in the case of milk, so there is more than <Col N="375" /> 4p a pint on the price of milk this week for the ordinary family.  Butter is jumping up by at least 9p a pound at the same time.  Those reductions in subsidies and increases in ordinary VAT spending will more than wipe out any benefit which the Minister might think the average family would enjoy as a result of his much emphasised increase in the child welfare benefit.  It will do no such thing.  Even the increases on children's clothing and on children's footwear will more than cancel out any extra benefit from the child increase.  So let us be quite clear.  The average family will be quite definitely worse off as a result of what the Minister has done here today.  They are not being made worse off in order to provide a job for anybody because, although we heard a lot of talk especially from ther Labour Party with their famous slogan &ldquo;We want jobs, not promises&rdquo;, we could not even get a promise today of any job.  We hear talk from them and we have the setting up of more bodies and more agencies. We know already that we are setting up some sort of youth employment agency and we are collecting the money for it but we did not see any reference to even one person being employed as a result of this levy.  That has a horribly familiar ring because this Government swept into power saying, among other things, that they knew how to find the right cures for all our problems and part of that recipe of course was to set up other bodies.  We had the famous committee on prices and incomes, more quickly known as &ldquo;The Three Wise Men&rdquo;, and they were to tell us how much we could afford to pay ourselves this year by way of wage increases.  But what happened to them? They were disowned the day they were reporting and of course the policy which they put forward has long since been dumped into the waste paper basket. Instead we had a rather indecent rush to buy off some sort of pay deal in the public sector without the slightest regard to what that would do to employment prospects or costs in every private firm, in every manufacturing firm throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So, in a nutshell, because I know we <Col N="376" /> will have opportunities as the debate continues in later weeks to develop on all these things, we are going to have these savage tax increases worsening the position of virtually every family in the country and there is no prospect of this solving our problems.  The other side of the coin that we are told about, apart from the fact that all these tax increases are necessary to cope with our situation, is more or less the argument which says that there is no alternative and what else can we do.</P>
    <P>What else can we do?  First, if we look at the world around us today we can see that inflation is coming down very rapidly. There is no suggestion that oil prices are going to go up this year the way they did over the last two or three years.  In fact, overall, the expectation is that there might even be a slight easing off in the price of oil for the year as a whole.  But let us at least say that there is no inflationary threat from that source.  Likewise, it does not seem that there will be any serious risk of import inflation through the American dollar or the British pound going up in value and affecting the cost of our imports.  This year our EEC partners can look forward to and think in terms of an inflation rate of 10 per cent or less.  That is the kind of figure we must aim for.  We would be able to aim for it if we went about our business in the right way.</P>

      <P>If we end up with an inflation rate greater than that it must be as a consequence of what happens in Ireland.  Today's budget will add 5 per cent to prices this year.  As regards the wage agreement, surely the sensible course of action for the Government to have taken when they were faced with a difficult situation on the wage agreement front last autumn&mdash;we had enough hard, <Col N="377" /> sound and fighting speeches from them, words again but no action&mdash;would have been to enter into discussions with unions and employers.  They should have promised to commit more money to subsidies in order to keep down the cost of living for everyone and not just give increases to the privileged few who enjoy secure employment.  If more money had been put into subsidies we could have held down our inflation rate to close to 10 per cent.  The cost of financing such a subsidy scheme would have been met by a very large saving on the public sector pay bill and on the cost of maintaining the living standards of those on social welfare benefit.</P>
      <P>Those two areas would have provided the Government with 60 per cent of the cost of any subsidy package.  The other 40 per cent could have been raised more selectively than the Minister did today when he imposed social welfare contributions on all workers and employers including those in the weaker firms in industries which are struggling to stay open and compete against foreign firms who enjoy lower inflation rates.  He should have gone about collecting the money he needed by levying higher contributions on more fortunate firms, banks or other financial institutions, which can reasonably expect to survive and meet higher charges of this kind.  In that way he could have allowed manufacturing industry to get away with little or no increase.  That is the bones of an alternative which would open the door to a lower inflation rate and better employment prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee which the Government established to inquire into these matters looked at the evidence in this area and suggested that every lowering of our wage costs of 1 per cent could bring about an improvement of several thousand jobs this year and a bigger improvement in each subsequent year.  If prices had gone down or even if they were to end up 5 per cent lower than what the Government put forward we could look forward to 10,000 more people at work this year in productive jobs.  That is the bones of an alternative policy.  I am not suggesting <Col N="378" /> it is an immediate, overnight cure for our ills.</P>

      <P>It would have given young people and workers a more realistic prospect of hope for a future in their own country.  Instead of that, we already know that we are going the wrong way.  Despite all the increases which were imposed today the Minister is still in the position where he claims that the current budget deficit is £714 million.  He should forget about the £50 million departmental balances and say that it is £750 million. In other words, there is virtually no change on last year's.  If the Minister thinks he will eliminate the current budget deficit by his policy over the next three or four years, he is already telling us he is condemning the country to inflation which must continue to be worse than that of any of our EEC competitors and which will guarantee that our unemployment situation will worsen rather than improve.</P>
      <P>The Minister promised us a plan to cope with this situation within four months of assuming office.  That is another broken promise along with the one for tax reform and the one to hold down current Government spending and avoid savage tax increases.  I could go on and on cataloguing all the broken promises but we will have more leisurely opportunities to spell those out.  The Minister is on the wrong road.  Our problems cannot be solved in the way the Minister has started to tackle them.  There is a clear choice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to spell out clearly to the erstwhile Socialists and others who seem to feel they are doing better by supporting the viewpoint put forward by the Coalition that they are not supporting the policy put before the people last May.  They are not supporting the programme that emerged from the famous show in the Gaiety Theatre because that has been abandoned.  Above all, they are not supporting a policy that can solve the employment problem for our people or the problem of inflation so that we can pay our way in the world. They have a choice.  They can go ahead and vote for this.  I hope the people will rightly condemn them at the first opportunity. They have an alternative which we will gladly elaborate on and debate with them in front of the people.  Do they really believe they are doing the right thing by supporting this infamous budget?  Vote against it.  Let us have a general election.  Let us ask the people to elect this Government on what they are doing now which is very different from what they conned the people into believing six months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the message I have today.  The Independents and so-called Socialists in the Labour Party, which is concerned for workers, should make up their minds. They should go out and campaign on this package.  We will debate the alternative with them.  That is my summary at this stage.  I do not care whether there is an election or not but I care what the Government do to Ireland and its future.  I suggest that the Government call off the policy they have started on and renegotiate it.  There is an important precedent for that because the last time we were facing a serious inflation situation which was made worse by the Government's policies was at the beginning of 1975.  At that time we in Opposition campaigned for the introduction of subsidies.  The Government opposed it bitterly for over six months until they were forced into this policy by combined pressure from the trade union movement and other interests outside the House.  Please go out again and talk to the trade unions and other independent groups.  I hope once again they will force the Government to <Col N="380" /> adopt the policy we put forward from this side of the House.  Do it for the sake of Ireland.  If the Government do not do that they should go quickly to the people and sort this issue out once and for all.</P>

      <P>I can give that information in relation to them singly but not cumulatively and I will go through them if the Deputy wishes.  In relation to beer it is estimated that the immediate increase effective from today in the CPI will be <Col N="384" /> .202 per cent.  This method of debate has the disadvantage that the VAT items are being debated separately but if the Deputy wishes I can tell him in advance what the VAT impact will be.  The VAT impact under the beer item is estimated at .226 per cent so that the cumulative impact of the budget under the head of beer would be .428 per cent.

The total effect on the CPI in respect of spirits will be .197 per cent in total.  In respect of wine the total effect will be .058 per cent.

The immediate effect is .384 per cent.  I will accept responsibility for the typing error.  VAT will account for .173 per cent giving a total of .557 per cent.  The plug tobacco item is included in the cigarettes item so it does not figure separately.  The effect on the price of petrol will result immediately in an increase of .211 per cent and the 1 March effect will be .161 per cent so that the total effect will be .372 per cent.  The road diesel item does not figure in the CPI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to make in relation to this is that, with the greatest respect to the Minister, I have some doubts about some of the figures he read out.  They certainly do not tally with the kind of increases and the CPI effect of them we have had in previous years. It is accepted by economists generally that the total effect on the CPI will be not less than 5 per cent and perhaps as high as 6 per cent.  Drink has an abnormally high element in that.  It is worth noting that this is the first budget I can recall where the Minister for Finance did not in his speech give the effect in CPI terms of the increases he was proposing.  Likewise, it is the first budget speech I can recall where no forecast for inflation for the year under consideration was given. The obvious reason is that the Minister for Finance, in spite of an 83 page script, is afraid of his life to give the forecast because the forecast is an inflation rate for 1982 well over 20 per cent.  I have not been able to estimate yet how much over the 20 per cent it will be.  In the short-term we have seen the announcement for <Col N="386" /> the last quarter of an inflation rate to mid-November of 23.3 per cent.  If we add the 5 per cent to 6 per cent which this budget seems to create the inflation rate will be around 28 per cent or 29 per cent, which is a real healthy Coalition figure.</P>
      <P>The tax increases on things like beer and spirits announced by the Minister were given in very handy easy stages and there was talk of excise duty amounting to 2p on a pint of beer.  Many people conclude that the increase is 2p.  That is not the case because the VAT increase will more than double that and the retailers' margin must be added to that.  This is conveniently omitted in all cases from this budget speech.  The actual increase the consumer will have to pay on a pint of beer is not the 2p which the Minister for Finance sought to give the impression today it would be, but is likely to be 6½p or 7p when the retail margin and the various other margins are taken into account.  That is the true figure.  Similarly, in regard to spirits, the actual figure that will be paid by the consumer by way of increase will be something in excess of 10p per glass and not the rather lower figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the speech and went through it very carefully but I could not find any reference in it to the retail prices that will be charged.  I can be corrected by the Ministers opposite if I am wrong.  The only reference is that the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism will fix the prices in due course.  He certainly will fix them.  I remember all the problems I had in relation to the immediate aftermath of budgets in trying to fix <Col N="387" /> those prices because there were allegations that there was profiteering due to the fact that the profit was fixed at a higher figure than that mentioned by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The same situation arises today.  The Minister for Finance, as well as his Department, must have been well aware of the confusion on former occasions and they should have made the actual retail prices clear but they did not do that.  That is why I say the increases are much higher than the impression given.  In regard to petrol the actual figure will be 16p per gallon when the dealers' margin is taken into account.  The inflationary effects are much higher than the kind of figures the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism has been talking about.  These figures are not being made available to the House.  The figure for cigarettes will be 13p for a packet of 20 and not the figure mentioned in the Minister's speech.  The sooner the House and the public are aware of that the better.  We should now invite the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, who appears to be dealing with this matter, to give us what the actual retail price to the consumer will be as a direct result of these excise and VAT increases on all the long list of items that we have and then give the CPI effect of the total increased price which the consumer at retail level will be paying.  I think those figures will be very different to what we have been led to believe up to now.</P>
      <P>While this party do not have a fundamental objection to some reasonable increases in excise on goods of this kind, at times like this we feel the public have been misled to some extent, that the increases are a great deal higher than has been implied by the Minister for Finance and that the inflationary effect is very considerable.</P>

    <P>I would remind the House that drink constitutes between 10 per cent and 11 per cent of the CPI.  It is the single most heavily weighted factor in the consumer price index.  Therefore, these very substantial increases in the retail price of beer, spirits and so on, will have an untoward effect on the CPI, the figures <Col N="388" /> the public will have to pay will be higher than has been mentioned by the Minister today and the effect on the CPI will also be very much higher than he said.  It would be better if we were given these figures and their effect in full now rather than have them come out in dribs and drabs as undoubtedly the Government hope will be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give a very brief outline of our general approach to these Financial Resolutions which are coming before us.  Everything I say is affected by the fact that, although the House will be sitting until 12 o'clock midnight, because of the unprecedented number of Resolutions before us there is not much time to deal with them as we would like.  That is why we suggested Resolutions No. 1 to 13 be taken together.</P>
      <P>They are a rag-bag of taxation provisions covering beer, spirits, wine, perry, cider, cigarettes, tobacco, televisions, video players, motor vehicles, gaming machines, special exemption orders, foreign holidays and development land.  This is a very wide ranging series of taxation measures and we will not have an opportunity to go into them in detail.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, our approach to these Financial Resolutions is not to oppose them, because in some cases we have to recognise that were we in Government we would probably be looking around for similar sorts of revenue.  I would not like the Government to think that because we will not be opposing them <i>seriatim</i> and consistently as we might do on another occasion, it does not mean we favour the impact these increases must make on the cost of living. Taking them together they are going to have a very real and serious impact on the cost of living and when you add the others, it is clear that this is a savage and anti-social budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no problem or crisis in the public finances nor is there any difficulty on the balance of payments front which could justify the savage imposition on ordinary families that this budget represents. I cannot understand how the Government would attempt to bring forward <Col N="389" /> any alleged difficulty in regard to public finances as a justification for the very real hardship which this combination of taxation measures is going to cause and for the very real lowering in the standard of living right across the community they are going to bring.</P>
    <P>Taking them together the trouble is that there is not one single optimistic aspect; they are purely taxation measures directed to lowering people's standards and to causing inconvenience and hardship to families and individuals.  If there was some glimmer of hope or optimism offered anywhere in the budget, these increases would perhaps be less unacceptable than they present themselves to us this evening.</P>
    <P>We will vote against Resolution No. 1 which proposes to increase the tax on beer.  We would be perfectly justified at any time in voting against that proposal but on this occasion we are voting against it more as an indication of our opposition to the totality of the measures.  As I said, we are not going to vote against the other resolutions because we accept that the Minister for Finance has to raise considerable amounts of revenue on this occasion. We will be responsible in our approach and will not vote against the individual Resolutions Nos. 2 to 13.  We are voting against the tax on beer because we think it is very undesirable in itself, particularly when you take into account the cumulative effect, and as a sign of our objection to the cumulative effect of these measures and their impact on the cost of living index and all that means right across the board for pay negotiations and for many other areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what my Leader and Deputy O'Malley had to say on these resolutions, particularly Resolution No. 1.  We are voting against Resolution No. 1 to show our abhorrence of the attitude adopted this afternoon by the Minister for Finance.  He seemed to forget completely the impact these taxes would have on the cost of living and employment.  No hope was given; no plans were laid; no hope was given to the many young people who are and will be <Col N="390" /> seeking employment, and no hope was given to those who are already unemployed.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy representing an area with an interest in employment in the drink trade, I want to add my voice to what has been said. I want to remind my Cork colleagues on the Government benches that we have to think very carefully about this matter and we must be given very strong assurances, because we are being asked to vote for an increased tax on beer.  In this city Guinness's are a good employer and have been good employers for a long time.  Their subsidiaries, whether in Dundalk or elsewhere are also good employers.  Likewise in Cork there are two breweries one of which is going through a particularly difficult time.  This increase in duty would be bad enough on its own without being added to by the savage increase in VAT, the second such increase in six months or so.  In levying these increases the Government have disregarded the employment situation in the drink industry.  I want an assurance from the Government side that we are not now in a diminishing return situation in so far as beer and spirits are concerned.  That sort of situation was referred to many times by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry while he was in opposition.  Not only in terms of its impact on the drink trade but in terms of its overall strategy this budget is doing more than has ever been done to bring about a diminishing return situation.  I should like an undertaking also that in the case of Irish Distillers in Midleton&mdash;our only distillery &mdash;employment will not be affected.  We know there are difficulties there.  As our Leader has said, we are voting on No. 1 and not on No. 2.  I want an assurance that the impact of the budget on spirits will not affect the existing employment or future employment prospects at the Midleton plant.</P>
      <P>We have had submissions from the drink trade.  Apart from the impact of these increases on the CPI, there is the important aspect of employment.  One must ask whether this industry has been hit too hard in successive budgets and whether today's increase is the last straw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> The overall impact of the budget will be to tone down activity, to deflate, so that there will be less money available for what some might call the luxuries of life. We are putting the drink trade in a precarious position.  We may be pushing that industry too far and bringing about job losses.</P>
    <P>We have had far too many promises from the Taoiseach in the past number of months.  These have been glib off-the-cuff promises in respect of which there was no research.  The situation is different now.  He is in charge of the country and what we are getting are excuses from various Minister for the failure to keep those promises.  In Cork city, for instance, there are 7,200 people unemployed while the total number of unemployed for the city and county is 20,000. We do not want any action from this Government that will lead to further job losses but I fear for Irish Distillers and the two Cork breweries in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and I want to avoid any contention at this stage of the debate because we are discussing specific resolutions arising out of the budget statement made by the Minister for Finance.  The budget traditionally has been the annual stocktaking of the nation's finances and is supposed to be used by the Government of the day as the instrument for economic policy.  Yet, in the speech made by the Minister for <Col N="395" /> Finance, we have a single page in an 83 page document devoted to the economic situation and there is no mention of employment.</P>
      <P>Brewing and distilling are traditional industries where there is substantial employment and home produced inputs by way of raw materials available for these two industries.  The budget is inflationary with regard to putting up the cost of living by anything from 5 to 6 per cent and we have deflationary aspects such as this one where employment and jobs in the brewing and distilling industries are in serious danger of being adversely affected.  As Deputy Fitzgerald has already stated, we want a positive assurance from the Minister for Finance and the Government that jobs will not be affected in any way by the proposed impositions of VAT on spirits and beer. The budget is inflationary in regard to the effects on the CPI and deflationary in regard to the absence of any incentives towards enterprise and job creation. Because of the importance of employment in the brewing industry in this city and in other towns throughout the country, we propose to vote against the imposition of VAT on beer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Lenihan said with regard to employment. It is well known that farming is going through a very lean period at present. One of the strong standbys of farmers in certain areas is the contract for malting barley.  I gather from the impositions that financial experts had come to the conclusion that the law of diminishing returns was beginning to take effect and this indicates we are very near a period when consumption will drop considerably.  If this happens some contracts, or parts of them, will be in danger and this should be taken into account also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most extraordinary days I have ever seen in Leinster House.  The National Coalition demoralisation-of-the-nation policy continues unabated.  They know the breweries are in serious trouble.  In Dublin, Guinness are laying off workers <Col N="396" /> and the savage increase on beer and spirits is going to increase unemployment in the city and other areas where breweries are a source of employment.  Some of the people who the Minister said might be contaminated are now going to support this budget.  The Labour Party have well and truly been contaminated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There are rumours that this contamination may be shaken off later on when the vote is taken.  I want to stress that the whole issue of putting on ever succeeding increases on beer and Guinness militates against people who most need it.  It is the least harmful of alcoholic beverages and old people and those on lower incomes depend on having a few pints every weekend.  It is their only outlet with the price of theatre tickets and other entertainment soaring.  It is socially harmful to continue to increase the price of beer.  It is a retrograde step and I regret it very much.</P>
      <P>We must consider very carefully the question of introducing a tax on foreign holidays.  Admittedly the initial imposition of £10 per holiday does not appear to be a geat deal.  It is very important that Irish people should be encouraged to travel abroad to see what is happening in Europe, or America, or wherever they want to travel.  It is part of the development of this nation that people should go abroad and learn from their experience. At the moment an imposition of £10 is not a great deal, but knowing the approach of the Coalition Government to these matters we realise this is only the tip of the iceberg.  It is a very retrograde step.</P>
      <P>One of the most extraordinary statements we heard today was made by the Minister when he suggested that taxing short-term social welfare recipients would encourage them to go back to work, when we all know there is no work to be had.  We will come back to that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These extraordinary statements made by the Minister for Finance are frightening. This budget is a terrifying example <Col N="397" /> of the incompetence of the Government. If I may refer to a statement made some time ago by the Minister, Deputy Kelly, I can only say that the piglets are panting.</P>

      <P>I want to discuss it now. I want to explain to the House what we are endeavouring to achieve in amendment <Col N="400" /> No. 1 to Financial Resolution No. 6.  Financial Resolution No. 6 proposes to increase the excise duty on petrol by 8p.  Of course, that is only the thin end of the wedge.  I have not got the calculation with me but I believe eventually, between one thing and another, and when all the effects of today's budget are taken into account the price of petrol will increase by 14p.</P>
      <P>We accept that, in the situation in which he finds himself, the Minister for Finance can look legitimately to petrol, diesel oil and LPG for some revenue.  We believe an increase of 14p is far too much. We are taking the responsible course of suggesting to the Minister and the House that an increase of 10p in total would be sufficient on this occasion.  Therefore we put down this amendment to Resolution No. 6 to reduce the 8p to 4p.  Ultimately that would have the effect of reducing the overall figure of 14p to 10p.</P>
      <P>With all the other impositions being piled on the unfortunate motorist in this budget, we believe that is enough, that is going far enough.  Many motorists could claim validly that it is going too far, much too far.  We want to take a reasonable and responsible attitude on this matter. We suggest that the House should accept the amendment reducing the tax increase from 8p to 4p and thereby reducing the overall increase in the price of petrol from 14p to 10p.</P>

Bearing in mind especially that the International Year for the Disabled has just concluded and the efforts made in respect of those people, has the Minister any proposal to exclude from this levy disabled people who may travel to Lourdes or some such place, or is it intended that this levy of £10 will be applicable to them?

      <P>I apologise to Deputy Murphy for having given him the trouble of repeating his question.  The question of what is morally implied in politics at election time and afterwards we can deal with at greater length and, believe me, I shall not be short of things to say when the general budget debate begins.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Murphy's second point, of course the Minister for Finance recognises the strength of the point Deputy Murphy has made and considered it.  I think what was uppermost in his mind was not so much the question of the status of disabled people but the question of pilgrimages.  The problem here is to discriminate between a pilgrimage which is purely a pilgrimage and something which may have a certain holiday content as well.  I am sure the Minister, if he were here, would accept that there are absolutely clear cases on one or other side of the line.  But probably there are so many cases in which it would be difficult to draw the line it might not be feasible to make the appropriate discrimination. However, for myself, I would accept the force of Deputy Murphy's point.  Perhaps it can he thrashed out in more detail when the appropriate legislation is being enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall deal as quickly as I can with the speeches made by Opposition Deputies on these 13 Resolutions.  I shall not be all that brief but certainly I will not string it <Col N="403" /> out.  Deputy O'Malley, I think, alleged that the Minister had omitted or avoided giving cumulative totals of the impact of excise and VAT on drink items, and perhaps he said on cigarettes as well.  That simply is not so &mdash; Deputy O'Malley has forgotten what the Minister said &mdash; and I would direct him to page 54 and following pages of the Minister's statement in which he clearly said, without the slightest sign of wishing to evade the issue, that the immediate increase &mdash; in order to give a picture of what the budget was going to do &mdash; would have to be topped up by the VAT increase on 1 March next, and the total would be as he said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley said something else and I shall deal with that in a moment.  Let me just quote part of what the Minister said in his speech:</P>
      <P>There will be an immediate duty-based increase of 4p in the retail price of a glass of spirits.  This is an extra 2p on the normal half-glass measure and will bring in extra revenue of £7.8 million this year and £8.9 million in a full year.  Taking account of the VAT change on 1 March, this amounts to a total tax increase of 8p to 8½p on the glass of spirits, or about 4p on the normal half-glass measure.</P>
      <P>I know it is possible in the course of a long statement to miss something &mdash; and I do not make a point about it &mdash; but Deputy O'Malley did miss that.  Under all these heads the Minister very clearly gave the total effect of his budget both under excise and VAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley wanted <Col N="404" /> to know why the Minister had not said what would be the effect of an increase in margins.  The National Prices Commission is the body which advises &mdash; advised him when he was Minister responsible for this &mdash; on price increases.  In calculating margins they do not normally take tax increases into account on most products. Even if they did do so I do not consider there is any obligation on a budget Minister to go out of his way to try to anticipate a margin increase which quite likely will not arise in respect of this heading in the course of a budget speech.  Deputy O'Malley is certainly going very far afield to try and find a criticism if that is the best he can think of, that not alone should the Minister produce bad news on the taxation side but that he should be scouring the horizon for further bad news which may arise under a quite different heading altogether.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey complained &mdash; I must say with some justice, in the sense that I can see his point &mdash; about the shortage of time in which an Opposition is required to deal with a budget statement.  I just happened to have in front of me the Official Report which includes the last two budget statements, Deputy Bruton's first one in July and Deputy Gene Fitzgerald's last in the preceding January. The Official Report at least does not disclose that there was any sos at all, let alone half an hour, between the completion of the main budget statement and response and the beginning of the debates on the budget resolutions. Although I have a very unreliable memory &mdash; and am in very good company being in that condition &mdash; I have been in the House over eight years and I do not remember such a thing either.  I can <Col N="405" /> remember occasional sosanna but I do not recall that there was ever a practice here that there was a break between the budget statement and response on the one hand and the Financial Resolutions on the other; perhaps there should be.  I have often heard it said that it is unfair that the Opposition spokesman should be required to reply without having a chance to think about it, that it does not really give him a chance to show himself in his true colours.  I must say that proposition was amply borne out by the speech which Deputy O'Donoghue gave here this afternoon which I would hate to think was supposed to do him justice.</P>

      <P>It was an extremely feeble production.  At any rate I accept that that is so.  Why then do we have this rule? Why not change it?  I would not mind giving the House my bet on why we have it.  Probably it is because, in the days when these rules were drawn up, the English had them which, as I never tire of complaining, is a reason for far too many things in this country.  If anyone on the Opposition side wishes to raise such a matter at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges certainly he will have me behind him, and I am sure many other Members, who would be anxious to see a reasonable way of doing things in this House and not just the English way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey also complained in a general way &mdash; which would be more appropriate to the general budget debate &mdash; that this budget offered what he called no glimmer of hope.  In connection with what is the outlook, whether one sees it in terms of sunrise or sunset I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that Deputy O'Donoghue spoke about this crisis we are in in terms that almost suggested that the lot of us, Government and Opposition, were innocent passengers who were shanghaied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not going to filibuster. I accept that the convention here is that the Opposition get the major part of this time and I am not going to hog it.  Deputy Haughey went out of his way to say that the budget contained no glimmer of hope and to say things that would be more appropriate to the general budget debate and I think I am entitled to a few minutes to reply.  I will tell the Deputy in a few minutes what is the glimmer of hope in this budget.  It is that for the first time in my memory at least we have a Minister for Finance who knows what is meant by taxation equity because taxation equity is the corner stone on which any kind of social understanding here must be built, on which fairness must be built, on which any kind of reason in trying to control wage explosions and people fighting each other on the industrial scene must also be built.  He has produced things here today <Col N="408" /> that no other Minister for Finance has had the courage to do and I am proud to be his colleague.  He has produced proposals about tax avoidance and evasion, about business entertainment expenses &mdash;farewell to the era of the golden boys &mdash;and he has given allowances for rent on private tenancies for elderly people. He has produced proposals regarding taxation on the self-employed and about capital and bank taxation.  These were not produced in a spirit of ideological conflict but with the intention of creating an atmosphere of equity.  It is only when we get that atmosphere of equity, where people will feel that everyone is being asked to carry the burden according to their ability, that we will have industrial and social peace.  That is the glimmer of hope.  That is what the Minister for Finance has given the House and the country today.  His budget speech, long though it was, did not contain any bogus promises about £200 million in the private sector of which Deputy Fitzgerald made himself a present this time last year. There was nothing about a rationalisation programme in the public sector that would save us £25 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The remaining points made by other Deputies related to the specific question of taxing drink.  When Deputy Haughey was Minister for Finance in 1968 or 1969 I remember he was questioned by a journalist about the forthcoming budget and he was asked if there would be increases in the price of beer, spirits and cigarettes.  I recall him replying in the following way, and I did not <Col N="409" /> fault him for it: &ldquo;These are rightly called the old reliables because no matter how often they are hit they always come up smiling&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in my budget speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember the phrase the Deputy used.  The Deputy will be surprised to hear me say that it is not the only thing in his record I remember with agreement and approval.  The truth is that the old reliables do come up smiling and the record shows it.  There have been very hefty increases, some of them heftier than the increases today, but consumption did not drop noticeably.  The Chair was complaining a few minutes ago about my pained expression but now the Chair is looking at his watch with a pained expression.  The point is that five speakers talked about the effect of the increases on the drink industry, and Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned in particular the manufacturing end of the drink industry.  The best calculation that the Department of Finance have been able to make is that under the headings of beer and spirits the likely contraction in consumption, on foot of the impositions, will be about 1 per cent in each case.  It is estimated that there is no reason to suppose that a contraction of that order will be reflected in employment.  Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned the possibility of diminishing returns which obviously would have a corresponding impact on employment. Naturally every Minister for Finance dealing with excise duty has to bear in mind the danger that there may be a point of diminishing returns, that if he hits some item too hard he will end up with less tax.  I presume that the advisers of this Minister have calculated that possibility just as carefully as they did when Deputy Haughey was Minister.  That is the calculation given to the Minister and I take it it is entitled to the same faith as was given to similar statements made by former Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan mentioned employment in the drink industry and Deputy Wilson and Deputy Niall Andrews mentioned <Col N="410" /> the possibility of diminishing returns.  The last four Deputies, except for Deputy Haughey's second speech, harped on this single point.  The Government's attitude is that the contraction in consumption under these two heads &mdash; wine is much more difficult to assess because obviously there is not the same employment content there &mdash; will be minimal and therefore there will not be any great employment implications.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that when the Minister was giving details of the considerable assistance he is giving at a difficult time to export promotion, for which my Department are extremely glad, he said specifically that the £500,000 he is making available for export promotion will have a special edge, the details of which he has not yet devised, directed towards assisting the export promotion of Irish drink. Of course that is extremely important to us because it has important employment implications.</P>
    <P>Therefore, even though we may get a one per cent contraction in consumption at home, I hope that the injection into export promotion on the other side will allow the drink manufacturing industry to feel they have come well out of the budget.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need to reply specifically to Deputy Haughey's point in regard to the LPG content of oil.  Naturally, it would be much easier for the consumer if the reduction the Deputy proposes were to be made, but the Minister adequately explained here today that he felt obliged to impose a severe measure of extra tax.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, would the Minister reply to the point made by Deputy Murphy in regard to Resolution No. 12?  Deputy Murphy referred to the tax of £10 per head on persons travelling out of the country in charter flights.  He referred to invalids travelling to Lourdes, and the Minister said it could be discussed when the legislation will come before the House.  He said he would favour it.  Is the Minister aware that in his statement the Minister for Finance said he could not make any exemptions because it would make the <Col N="411" /> thing unworkable? Why did the Minister now in the House offer such a hope to Deputy Murphy?</P>

It is not for me to predict whether he may be open to persuasion at a later stage.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 3 December 1981 but was not qualified for payment at the time as, according to the records of my Department, he had not the required minimum of 26 contributions paid since his entry into insurance. Following inquiries it has been established that he had in fact sufficient weeks of insurable employment to qualify him for benefit.  Payment of all disability benefit due to him to 9 January 1982, date of latest medical evidence received, less refund to the health board of supplementary welfare allowance advanced, has been made.  He is not entitled to pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 273 and 274 together.</P>
      <P>In order to reduce the cost of rural delivery, it has been policy since the early 1960's to examine the feasibility of motorising rural deliveries whenever postman vacancies arise.  Preliminary examination indicates that it is practicable and economical to absorb the delivery route of a vacant part-time postman post at Tourlestrane in a proposed full-time motor post which will operate from Tubbercurry. Accordingly, the indications are that the vacant postman post at Tourlestrane will not be filled.  Pending completion of the motorisation proposals, delivery in the area concerned is being performed by a postman from Tubbercurry in conjunction with his own post. This arrangement has reduced the cost of delivery and, generally, delivery times in the area have been maintained.</P>
      <P>There are no other plans affecting postal services at Tourlestrane and post office counter services will continue to be provided there.  Consideration is being given to the possibility of the postman from Tubbercurry collecting mail at Tourlestrane.</P>

To give an example, a farmer with 110 ewes and 12 adult cattle will receive £1,413 under the 1981 schemes compared to £918 for 1980 and to £1,083 under the 1981 headage rates announced by the previous Government.</P>
