      <P>May I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, the first question today?  On what grounds did you exclude The Workers' Party from having consultations with the Friends of Ireland, a facility provided for all the other parties?  In your letter you refer to the Opposition parties. We are an Opposition party.  For the purpose of attending functions we were recognised as a party.</P>

      <P>I wish to refute the rumour that we boycotted the discussions. This morning I have had calls from people in different areas asking why we were excluded from discussions with the visiting group.  Naturally, those people in Fine Gael feel badly about their being on the Opposition benches but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I object to the Minister answering questions in this way.  Last week I had a question down regarding tonnage inwards to Dublin and Cork and I was also given this type of reply.  This does not give us an opportunity of submitting supplementary questions.  If the practice is to be repeated in the future the Government should extend us the courtesy of supplying us with the answers beforehand so that at least we can have the opportunity of reading the figures.</P>

      <P>Therefore, approximately 30 per cent of our unemployed have been on the unemployment list for more than 12 months.  This is a very serious social implication.  Taking these figures into consideration would the Government consider raising the lower levels of unemployment benefit?  The figures represent a large percentage of our population who are below the poverty line as a result of being in receipt of basic social welfare payments which do not allow for basic living standards.  Rather than giving a 25 or 30 per cent increase across the board will the Government consider raising the lower ends of the social welfare scales?  That is necessary if one takes the figures given by the Minister into consideration.</P>

      <P>The specific information requested by the Deputy is not available. However, in the 1979 Labour Force Survey a question of nationality was included.  On the basis of the information on nationality received in that sample inquiry, it is estimated that there were 50,000 United Kingdom nationals of all ages usually resident in the State in May 1979.</P>

      <P>Is it correct to say that the 1979 Census was compiled by computer? If that is the case surely the programme is sufficiently open to enable a sub-total for UK citizens to be extracted from it.

      <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should have this information and that the supplementary information contained in his brief should indicate whether those data are available or not.  From previous discussions when the Taoiseach was in power before, we know that this matter of voting rights for <Col N="555" /> UK citizens arose.  We cannot talk about voting rights for such people unless we know the number involved and that information is contained in the Census returns.  If the information has not been provided in the Minister's brief it is not his fault, although he is responsible for it, but I suggest to the Minister that the information is available and should be obtained without delay.</P>

      <P>The 1979 Labour Force Survey gives the figures on nationality and that is the question I was asked.  In the Census for 1971 and 1981 there was a question as to where people were born which is different from the question of nationality or citizenship.  The figure for that is 110,000.  That number of people said they were born in the UK.  The information the Deputy is seeking is not available.</P>

It involves the AG's office, the Taoiseach's office and the Department of the Environment who will merely be the people through whom the legislation is brought in here.  The Minister suggested that nothing was done regarding this matter during the seven months that we were in government.

      <P>Under the existing European provisions the polling day at Assembly elections is fixed by the individual member states within a particular period from Thursday to Sunday inclusive. As the Deputy is aware, proposals for a uniform electoral procedure, which may or may not involve a fixed polling day, are at present being considered.  In the circumstances and as the elections are not due for more than two years, it would seem premature to take a firm position in relation to the polling day.</P>

Without prejudice to whatever final arrangement is made, will he consider what the implications in this country will be for holding such elections on a Sunday rather than on a Thursday as is the norm?</P>

      <P>As a Deputy and as a Minister I see considerable merit in voting on a Sunday.  The European Parliament adopted a resolution on a draft uniform electoral procedure on 10 <Col N="563" /> March.  For the information of the House I will tell what is involved.  Representatives of each member state shall be elected by proportional representation on the basis of regional or national lists. Each member state shall decide how its territory is to be divided into constituencies. A member state may provide for a preferential voting system within a list. Member states shall grant a right to vote to their nationals irrespective of the place of residence.  They went on to say that the election day would be either a Sunday or a Monday.  The House will see that many complex questions are involved there.  It has now been referred by the Council of Ministers to COREPER.  A special committee has been set up on which we will have a representative from the franchise section of my Department. I assure the Deputy that I will take into account the points he has mentioned in his question.</P>

    <P>I understand that during the period of office of the previous Government there was correspondence between the corporation and the Department of the Environment in the course of which the corporation were reminded that, so far as Dublin city is concerned, the appointment and training of presiding officers and poll clerks was a matter for the City Sheriff.  It was indicated that it was considered that the proposed meeting between the Minister and members of the corporation would not serve a useful purpose because adequate instructions were contained in the booklet of instructions for presiding officers which is prepared by the Department and issued to all presiding officers.  The booklet is regularly up-dated and is generally supplemented <Col N="565" /> by additional instructions issued by returning officers.</P>

      <P>I had a meeting with Mr. David Mitchell, MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for the Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland at Stormont on 17 May.  An interesting and very useful discussion took place on a number of matters of common concern to the two Departments including the matters referred to below.</P>
      <P>1.  The future development of the Larne to Rosslare road as a European Route.  It was agreed in particular to seek to expedite consideration by the EEC of the request made on 19 March 1982 for support from the Regional Development Fund for a joint study of the improvement of the Dundalk to Newry section.</P>
      <P>2.  The question of follow-up to the cross-Border study which has been carried out of communications in the Donegal-Derry area (taking account of the Government's decision to support an airport development at the Big Isle, Letterkenny) and the study of the Erne Catchment Area.</P>
      <P>3.  The system in operation in Northern Ireland for fixing rents of controlled dwellings and the general question of financial approaches and incentives for housing, including my Department's special mortgage subsidy scheme.</P>
      <P>4.  Monitoring and prevention of pollution affecting the Erne and Foyle catchments. It was agreed to extend exchanges on monitoring systems and results as well as liaison and information on arrangements for dealing with oil pollution of coasts.</P>
      <P>5.  Arrangements for industrial waste disposal, including liaison in relation to cross-Border movements of such waste, on which it was agreed to have further discussions.</P>
      <P>The meeting was part of the work of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council.  The matters discussed will be followed up as appropriate at official level.</P>

Would the Minister accept every £1 spent either in sterling or in punts in the Border areas, North or South, would do most good for the advancement of these studies?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that grants are available to people living north of the Border which are not available to their relatives on this side of the Border?  The grants available in the North are far more generous than they are here and the assistance given towards the repair of existing houses and the building of new houses is such that it is quite embarrassing for Border Deputies to answer questions from constituents on this matter.  Were these matters discussed with the Minister's counterpart in the North and, if so, what explanation did the Minister give regarding the non-availability of grants here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear the Deputy talk about embarrassment. He will be aware that I recently extended the whole reconstruction grants scheme.

I do not accept the other points made by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that the money for increased grants should be raised by higher taxes or by borrowing?  Would the Deputy suggest how the money should be raised?

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that there is considerable delay from the time when an application for an appeal is lodged with An Bord Pleanála and the date on which a decision is issued; and if, in view of the considerable recession in the building industry, he will consider issuing a directive by way of guidance to the board to ensure that its members give overall priority to appeals which have a high employment content, with a view of speeding up the process of decision making and so enhance in some cases the prospects of construction jobs on sites with the minimum of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the importance of having planning appeals dealt with as expeditiously as possible, in view particularly of the possible impact on development and employment.  An Bord Pleanála have in fact been requested to devise means by which the output of decisions may be speeded up and the level of arrears reduced.  The board have also indicated their awareness of the importance of keeping the number of appeals on hands to a minimum and of the need to deal expeditiously with cases in which there could be significant employment potential. The situation is kept under continuing review.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated, of course, that factors outside the control of the board affect the time taken in dealing with some appeals.  These factors include delays in submitting grounds of appeal, requests that appeals be held in abeyance, awaiting documents from local authorities, circulation of documents, new issues arising and inadequate plans submitted with original applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is now taking between nine and 12 months for the board to decide on an appeals basis, a decision which was made within two months by a local authority? I am not inferring that he is not concerned about the matter because I believe he is <Col N="571" /> concerned.  Does he not consider that he has within the 1976 Act which set up An Bord Pleanála sufficient discretionary powers to change and improve the system of administration whereby the board can make their decisions without prejudice to either party far more quickly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the delay and the backlog.  I would give an indication of the size of the problem.  The number of appeals on hand at the beginning of this year was 2,177.  Between 1 January and 30 April 1,600 appeals were received. The board disposed of 1,409 and they had on hand at 30 April 2,376.  It is not correct to say that the vast bulk of appeals are now taking between nine and 12 months.  At 31 December 40 per cent of the appeals had been lodged for less than three months, while 34.1 per cent had been there between three to six months, 13 per cent had been there for between six and nine months and only 197 cases had been there for nine months or more. Many of the latter would be appeals which had been left in abeyance with which people did not wish to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister make available in the Library an indication of the kind of request he made to An Bord Pleanála regarding the criteria of priority they should apply in relation to large planning permissions where there is a large job content?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot direct the board on this question.  All I can do is ask for their understanding.  I met them on 3 May and had a long chat with the chairman and full membership of the board on this and other questions.  The Deputy can rest assured that I will continue to press them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is the Minister aware that often there is a delay of several months between the oral hearing and the decision?  The matters mentioned by the Minister could not be the cause of that delay.  Now that there is a chairman, and for this year at least a <Col N="572" /> deputy chairman, of the board, does the Minister consider their services should be availed of to eliminate the backlog?  The trouble seems to be inadequate staff to service the appeals and to present them to the decision-making persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  The problem is in the number of the inspectorate and this is something I am examining.  The problem does not arise at the administrative or decision-making level.  By the time the oral hearings are over the inspector concerned may be on another job.  He has to prepare his report and to submit it to the board for a decision and that is where the problem arises.  This emerged from the discussions I had with board members on 3 May.  I am attempting to do something with the Department of the Public Service to rectify the situation.</P>

In view of the fact that the Minister has confirmed what some of us have suspected, namely, that a sufficient number of planners-inspectors are not employed in his Department, also in view of the fact that planning students who are entering their final weeks in planning school in UCD are facing the prospect of unemployment, and having regard to his responsibility for the construction industry generally, will he bypass the DPS and take on in an emergency capacity a number of inspectors who could expedite the decisions which are holding up jobs on sites throughout the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that jobs are being held up.  I am very anxious to speed up decisions and I am anxious in particular that the board would concentrate on major job creation decisions.

Depending, again, on the circumstances, control provisions of the sanitary services, road traffic and fire services legislation may also be relevant.  It would be for the local authority concerned to see what use of these provisions would be necessary and feasible in a particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is satisfied with the fact that local authorities are not obliged to publish their building and development <Col N="575" /> proposals for the benefit of the public in the same way that a private developer or individual is obliged to seek planning permission so as to alert the adjoining neighbours of possible building development; if he is prepared to consider altering the regulations of the planning and development legislation with a view to requiring each local authority to signal directly to the residents and tenants adjoining properties which are scheduled for development by that local authority of their intention to develop on the adjoining properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposed developments by planning authorities in their functional area are set out in the development plan which each authority are required to make and keep up-to-date by reviewing it periodically.  Before a plan is adopted the draft must be put on public display for a period of at least three months and objections and representations made to the authority must be considered before the plan is adopted. Public notice must be given of the place and time that the draft is available for inspection.  Where land is being acquired compulsorily by a local authority for any purpose, for example, housing and roads, public notice must be given and where objections are made to me a public inquiry must be held.  Where development is being carried out by a local authority outside their functional area, public notice must be given and planning permission sought from the planning authority in whose area the proposed development is to take place.</P>
      <P>A planning authority may not carry out development which contravenes their own development plan.  I think, therefore, there are reasonable provisions under the law and procedures as they stand to enable people to become aware of local authority work proposals and I am not convinced that there is any real need for additional procedures, which would almost certainly add to the time involved in getting works going and in the related employment provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that he is making two categories of citizens, where the private individual is required to go through the process of planning permission which allows third parties to investigate what is happening and to be informed of the final outcome of a development but, on the other hand, where the local authority are exempted from informing third parties immediately adjacent to a development and where they are not allowed to have a direct input?  I am not asking the Minister to introduce new legislation.  He can do it by way of circular or regulation under the 1976 Act.  This would require local authorities, particularly when doing in-fill development, to comply with the normal courtesy of advising residents adjoining proposed housing or other development of the intentions of the local authority in sufficient time.  This would give them the same rights to respond as they would if it will a private development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the information must be made available to elected members of the local authority by the city or county manager. It is not correct to say that information is not made available.  As I have said, local authorities must stick to their development plans which are put on display for three months during which time objections may be made.  If a local authority develop outside their own area, for example, if Dublin Corporation want to develop a housing scheme in the county, they have to apply for planning permission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, if the principle of his reply is acceptable, a similar argument would apply to every proposed developer?  Every proposed developer, as the Minister would surely agree, has his land designated in the county development plan.  Yet, as that developer is required to advertise in the normal way, what possible basis can there be for drawing a distinction to that end in the case of our local authorities, seeing that the development plan applies in all cases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said already, the development plan is there. There is also the question of compulsory acquisition and public inquiries taking place in the case of a road or a housing development and the local authority members are notified if the local authority are developing outside their area where the members in the other area would not be aware of what was going on.  In cases like that the local authority must advertise.  However, what I am trying to do &mdash; and it was in response to the very points being made in Question No. 23 in relation to delays in the planning board &mdash; is to avoid putting further delays in the way of projects, which will provide employment at this time, getting under way.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has satisfied himself that sufficient legal protection exists for the consumer where the consumer has bought a house or a site for a house on an estate which is supposedly developed by a developer but which is not in fact developed within a reasonable time; and if adequate means exist for enforcing the rights of the consumer to have the commitment to the full development of the estate fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that planning authorities have adequate powers available to enable them under the Local Government (Planning and Development) <Col N="578" /> Acts to ensure that estates are completed to a satisfactory standard and in accordance with the terms of planning permissions.  The enforcement of any contractual agreement between the consumer and the developer is a matter for the parties involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree from his recent rather unsuccessful perambulations through Dublin West that this non-completion of estates is a major social problem in developing areas and that many builders either have not the means, or alternatively have lodged bonds which through inflation have become insufficient, to enable them to complete the estates?  Would he not further agree that action must be taken to change the law to stop this at the outset?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is available legislation in section 26 of the 1963 Act and in sections 31 and 35 of the 1963 Act and that was considerably strengthened in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act of 1976 which brought in, in section 27, that a planning authority or any other person may apply to the High Court where a development is being carried out without planning permission or in contravention of the terms of the permission for an order requiring the development to cease where it is being carried out without the required permission or to be carried out in conformity with the planning permission granted. That legislation also imposes controls with regard to bonds and in 1981 I introduced a scheme for cases where estates have not been completed and where the builder has gone &ldquo;bust&rdquo; or where, through the normal court procedures, the council still fails to have the estate completed, the State makes money available in the form of a grant of two-thirds of the cost to complete estates.  Since I introduced it last year £630,000 has been expended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the legislation, whatever it says on paper, is simply not working?  Would the Minister indicate to me the number <Col N="579" /> of estates that have been covered by the rather small sum of £630,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are coming to that in the next question.  I do not accept that the Act has not been working.  Some councils have been particularly successful in having work carried out on estates.  I accept that there are exceptions.  I saw some of them myself in my own constituency. However, there is a general review of the whole planning procedures and planning legislation being undertaken in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that private house builders are conning the public?  They sell from a set of drawings a house at a price in an estate, the legal advisers of the purchaser investigate the planning permission and find that the entire estate has to be completed and that the house forms and integral part of it; the house builder subsequently absconds or disappears or, to use the Minister's own parliamentary language, goes &ldquo;bust&rdquo; and the people in the estate are left with no redress whatsoever. Would the Minister not agree there are deficiencies in the legislation at the moment?  But there are political deficiencies in the Minister's party in that they are not prepared to tackle this problem courageously.  Would the Minister give some indication to the thousands of people who have to live with this nightmare of what he is going to do about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>It was because of the problem that the Deputy refers to, because of the number of these estates that have been left unfinished, that I introduced this scheme last year.

      <P>The Minister will agree that it may be a major step at the very <Col N="581" /> tail end after years of haggling between the local authorities and the builders.  But would the Minister agree that while the absconding builder is one problem another problem is the builder who stays in business and who has planning permission for about 300 houses, builds three-quarters of them and then moves on to another site not completing the previous site, not going bust?  There is nothing in the law to get at him to finish the estate up to the standard that the three-quarters of the residents are entitled to.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree, particularly in the context of County Dublin, that that local authority who are faced with the largest growing area of population in the whole of the country have insufficient funds available to them to enable their officials to fulfil the functions conferred on them under the planning Acts to bring proceedings against developers who do not finish estates?  Will the Minister consider making special financial provision available to Dublin County Council to enable them to fulfil their functions?  Secondly, in the context of the question and the Minister's reply, would he not accept that one of the major difficulties of the local authorities in this area is that if a bad developer who has not finished a number of estates within a local authority area applies a new for a planning permission to build a new housing estate the local authority can have no regard when deciding on the application to the fact that the developer has not finished other estates?  Would the Minister consider amending the legislation to enable local authorities to take into account the fact that some developers are not bona fide when they put in planning applications?</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well that this Government are engaged in a campaign, with the full co-operation of the Garda authorities, to combat the rising level of crime and lawlessness. I have no conception of what specific promises by my party he referred to, because I gave no such specific promises at any stage.  I also know that when Deputy Mitchell was Minister for Justice he made no effort in this area.  In fact, his personal activities in many cases were detrimental to law and order and to the activities of the Garda Síochána.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 40 and 41, to delete &ldquo;disused vehicles or other disused articles&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;vehicles or other articles (being disused articles)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 12 of the Bill gives powers to local authorities in the interests of amenity or of the environment of an area to take action with regard to any disused vehicles or disused articles kept on any land in their area for the purpose of being dismantled, reconditioned, repaired, stored, or sold.  This section is aimed principally at unsightly collections resulting from scrap dealings, dismantling of vehicles for spares, or accumulations of vehicles &mdash; a point made on Committee Stage &mdash; on the sides of roads or in laneways in connection with repair maintenance operations and work of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable emphasis was placed on Committee Stage on the need for fully effective powers being made available to deal with this problem.  There is a possibility that a reference to the word &ldquo;disused&rdquo; with regard to vehicles might be seen as providing some defence if action were taken by local authorities. The person could argue that the vehicles were not disused in the context of the definition in section 12 (10).  The local authority might not be able to take action in such a case.  It is proposed, therefore, to remove the reference to &ldquo;disused&rdquo; in relation to vehicles.  This will mean the local authorities will be in a position to <Col N="644" /> take action in relation to any vehicles, provided such action is justified in the interests of amenity or of the environment of an area and subject, of course, to the right of appeal to the District Court against a notice.</P>

      <P>This seems to be an acceptance of the spirit of the discussion on the last occasion.  Take an individual who is engaged in business in his own private house and who has two or three cars which are semi-dismantled and he says he is repairing one at the expense of the others.  Will the section now deal with that situation?  I know it can be dealt with by the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism and it can probably be dealt with under the planning laws.  That is a long drawn-out process.  It would be far better if the local authorities had power under this Bill to say people were littering the area by repairing or dismantling vehicles in their front gardens, or on the road outside their houses.  We could come at them more quickly and more efficiently in this manner.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry referred to the spirit of the Committee Stage debate and I think the spirit of that debate was to improve the visible amenity of areas.  I do not think it should be done however, at the cost of personal liberty and without regard to economic difficulties that some people have in relation to either trying to fix cars or perhaps operate a small business. Could the Minister say how he would see the section being used?  I support the principle and the spirit of it but if, for example, this is one person's form of business and he has no other, would it <Col N="645" /> be a defence for him to erect some kind of visual screen or how would such a person who is normally in this form of trade&mdash;and it is a trade that will continue, given the price of car parts&mdash;be affected? Would it be a defence, conceding that there is something unsightly, to erect a screen?  How would the Minister see the provision being operated.  I can imagine an individual making representations to a local councillor saying: &ldquo;This is my only trade.  How can I respond to the legislation?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> It would be up to the local authority to decide in such a case.  If the local authority agree that a screen would protect the visual amenity, so be it.  If the local authority decided that this was a litter offence within the meaning of this legislation, a prosecution would ensue.  There are very many cases, as the Deputy realises, in the constituency we both represent of abandoned cars left in laneways and residential roads and the intention of the Bill is to try to pinpoint the perpetrators of offences of that kind.  The local authority would be the arbitrator in such cases.</P>

While it might be a person's only livelihood&mdash;I am thinking particularly of corporation housing estates&mdash;to carry on a business like that which is noisy, frequently carried on at night into the early hours of the morning, destroying the visual and auditory&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;environment of one's neighbours, it is not good enough.  Such people should be in a separate registered business premises or, if operating in some side way from their own houses it should not be done so that the street or path is littered with bits and spare parts and there is banging and hammering and blow lamps going until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We were talking on section 3 about the depositing of litter by a driver or owner of a vehicle and the point was made in that Committee Stage discussion that in the case of a privately-owned vehicle the driver and owner of the vehicle were both liable whereas in the case of a publicly owned vehicle&mdash;the example given was CIE&mdash;the driver could be liable but more than likely the company itself or the general manager of CIE would not be liable.  The Minister promised to have a look at this before Report Stage.  I felt that there was a little contradiction here and that it was unfair to the people in the private sector.  I presume the Minister has looked at it and decided that for some reason it cannot be done.</P>

To take the case of CIE <i>vis á vis</i> a private bus &mdash; I think this is the point Deputy Quinn made &mdash; in both cases being public service vehicles they would be excluded from prosecution but the person committing the offence would be liable for prosecution in each case.  I think what Deputy Quinn was getting at was that the private bus company would be liable.  That is not the case.  There is no discrimination whatever.</P>

      <P>This is a very important amendment. Again there was considerable support at Committee Stage for endeavouring to have a higher maximum fine.  The amendment raises the level of maximum fine from £500 to £800, a very substantial increase.  I am informed that this is regarded as an acceptable limit in the case of an offence liable to prosecution in the District Court.  I should like to express my appreciation to the Members of the House who contributed on that point, because I feel it will have a much more positive impact if there is a fine of that kind.  We agree that if we could have it higher we would be happier but I have put a good deal of research into the matter and I am told that £800 is the maximum that can be accepted.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> That is a very good point.  It would depend on the decision of the court as to how they would fix the fine and how the case would be pleaded from there.  It is purely a matter for the courts to decide what action should be taken if a person cannot pay up.  It arises in many other aspects of legislation, where a person, for instance, cannot pay a parking fine or a speeding fine.</P>

Rather than thinking of the legislation being useless &mdash; I know the Deputy does not really mean to speak in that spirit at all &mdash; if maximum fines are meted out at the start &mdash; and there are many people who can afford to pay who are perpetrators of litter offences &mdash; if examples are made in the early stages, coupled with the on-the-spot fines which can be changed by regulation, we shall get off to a good beginning.  It will be up to all Deputies and councillors to encourage through the local authorities the right spirit for this legislation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I wish to thank all the Deputies for their co-operation in discussions on this Bill and for their very valuable contributions which I have endeavoured to include as amendments.  I consider this to be most important legislation which will have a major impact in leading to a cleaner and more healthy environment.  If we can manage to reduce the amount of litter, we will be going a long way towards improving the appearance of the country. The Bill provides for a good statutory framework for effective control by local authorities and the taking of remedial action.  I will be urging local authorities to make the widest possible use of the provisions of the Bill and to give them as much publicity as possible.  In the end, however, the problem will only be solved when public attitudes change.  Public opinion must be mobilised against the litter offender and I appeal to the general public for their support in ensuring the success of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I also hope, as I am sure the House does, that when prosecutions are brought under the provisions of the Bill, the courts will take into account the views of this House and the seriousness of the problem.  The House has given a clear expression of this view by providing for the maximum fines that can be levied in the District Court.  In due course I will be considering further promotional measures on a national and local level to see what help can be given to ensure that the legislation is effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see this legislation on the Statute Books but it needs a very positive push by the Minister and local authorities to see that it is made effective.  As I said on Committee Stage, the carrot could be as effective as the <Col N="650" /> stick in this matter and, while litter wardens are important, the guidance they could give might have a far more beneficial, long-term effect than instantly slapping an on-the-spot fine on litter offenders.  Litter wardens should be outside schools when children are coming out.  They should also educate some proprietors of take-away food premises as a large amount of litter emanates from these establishments.  Many proprietors make a point of keeping their premises clean but some do not.  Managers should tell their customers that they should not deposit papers or empty cans on the road outside their premises.</P>
      <P>Another area where litter can accumulate in huge quantities is at matches.  In the next three or four months many matches will be played all over the country and the organisers of these sporting events should be asked to co-operate with the local authorities by making frequent announcements over loudspeakers and by ensuring that there are enough bins to cater for the cans, bottles and bags.  They could also co-operate by not allowing full bins to stand outside stadiums overnight where they can be kicked around by vandals.</P>
      <P>Many of the wardens will feel that their duty is to collect revenue for the State but that is not what they are there for. This is a penalty for those who do not obey the law but the first job of the warden is to bring the law to the attention of the offender and only fine him the second or third time that the offence is committed. That may not appear to be very practical because the same people might not be passing the same warden every day but, if the wardens are outside schools, matches and take away premises, they will know their &ldquo;customers&rdquo; and they will keep an eye out for those who are not inclined to deposit their litter carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should also urge local authorities to empty bins more frequently in city streets.  Many are overflowing with cigarette butts and sweet papers.  If a person wants to deposit his litter and sees an overflowing bin he will shrug his shoulders and not bother.  If the local authorities take this legislation seriously and if <Col N="651" /> they try to implement the various sections of this Bill the end result will be a much better environment for all and that must benefit, not only those who live there, but also be of commercial benefit because our country will become a much more attractive place for tourists to visit.</P>
    <P>Last July I asked the Department to get in touch with country managers and ask them to see that grafitti in their areas was removed.  If that has not been done I ask the Minister to get on to them again because it is humiliating &mdash; I use that word advisedly &mdash; for any citizen to see offensive remarks about a neighbouring country painted on walls.  There has been an outbreak of grafitti in Dublin West recently regarding a prisoner in the Curragh. If anybody has a complaint in that regard the law is there to assist them.  It does not have to be brought to the attention of the public by painting it on walls, railway stations or bridges.  There is a method of making complaints without defacing the environment in which we all have to live.  I congratulate the Minister for bringing in this legislation and I hope it will be as successful as we would like it to be.</P>

      <P>I have a few positive comments to make, complementary to those made by Deputy Barry and the Minister, on the general intent of the Bill.  I share the Minister's concern, which dates back to 1974 when he was first elected to Dublin Corporation.  I am concerned about the central point in section 3 which might be open to some misinterpretation. I am unhappy about the distinction made and I urge the Minister, between now and when the Bill reaches the Seanad, to look at this question.  There is a distinction between the driver of a PSV, a bus, a refuse truck and so on, and the driver of a private haulage truck.  One category of truck owner will be exempt but another will not.  Is a public service truck to be defined as any vehicle on the road in the use of the public service?</P>

      <P>I do not want to be niggling, but I cannot see why this distinction is being provided for and I advise the Minister to look at it before the Bill reaches the Seanad.  Because of the way the courts have been making crazy decisions of late, some judge may deem this distinction to be unjust <i>vis-á-vis</i> one category of registered owner and another. I am simply saying, because of the constructive way in which the debate has taken place, that the Minister should look at this again so that we will not be seen to be giving some soldier hostage to fortune in relation to this.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy with it because I think it is bad law, although I concede that I may not be reading the section correctly.  I am more than happy with the overall effects of the Bill and I hope the Minister will put it through the Seanad as soon as possible and take the steps he has indicated. I hope he will inform the House precisely the steps he will be taking so that we can inform concerned bodies and associations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not available to take a greater part in this debate, because the Bill is close to my heart.  The by-election interfered.  Like other Deputies, I welcome the Bill; but, of course, the Bill will only be good if it is acted on. Unfortunately, the general perception of the public of how local authorities perform very often comes down to criticism that roadsides are littered: in other words, local authorities can be spending millions of pounds on sewerage and water schemes but if you ask somebody what he thinks of his local authority he will say they are awful because the roadsides are littered with rubbish because the local authorities are not doing their job.  It is a bad thing for the image of local authorities and I hope this Bill will go some way to give more power to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Bill will function properly only if the Minister and the Department are prepared to give the local authorities the necessary finance in order to implement the sections of the Bill &mdash; for instance, the sections which empower local authorities to impose penalties and <Col N="653" /> to provide places for abandoned vehicles and metal scraps.  The Bill cannot work if local authorities when preparing their estimates find they are short of money.  It is the implementation of this Bill that will get the knock.  If a safety measure has to be put into estimates this is the sort of thing that will have to go.  If the Minister wants the Bill to work he must be prepared to give a sympathetic ear to the local authorities in the matter of funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister must give to local authorities the finance to help them to employ extra litter wardens.  Dublin North at the moment is riddled with litter because of its proximity to the city and the number of rural roads in it.  There are only two litter wardens covering the whole area and it is impossible for them to keep a check on litter dumping.  The local authority will not be able to catch anybody on whom to impose these marvellous fines if they do not employ more men and women as litter wardens.  The Minister should emphasise to the Department that the Bill will work only if financial provision is made down the line. However, I welcome the Bill and I look forward to seeing the first fines being imposed very soon so that the Act will be seen to have teeth.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Bill arises out of the Government's commitment to establish a National Community Development <Col N="654" /> Agency on a statutory basis.  The agency will have wide-ranging powers to promote and support community development, self-help and community activity.</P>
    <P>In addition, as indicated by the Taoiseach in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 23 March last, the agency will carry out the work which was to have been performed by the &ldquo;agency to combat poverty&rdquo; proposed by the previous administration.  Our Government have already demonstrated their commitment to the success of the agency by making available a sum of £2 million to it in 1982.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important component in the Government's overall strategy for the development of a comprehensive social policy.  It represents the first attempt at the creation of a national policy on community development.  Community development, of course, is not new.  All Governments have an obvious commitment to community development in its broadest sense, and every action of government, directly or indirectly, is done in the common good and for the betterment of all.  What is new is that we are beginning to consider community development in a structured way, to refine our ideas and to develop an agreed and acceptable strategy for the future.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;community development&rdquo; is generally used as a convenient shorthand for the voluntary efforts of groups and individuals who are seeking to improve their local areas or are working to bring about improvements in the position of underprivileged and disadvantaged members of society.  The primary purpose of the new agency will be to support, assist and encourage voluntary effort in all its forms and to work towards the creation of a genuinely caring community.  I have not attempted in the Bill to define &ldquo;community&rdquo; or &ldquo;community development&rdquo; as this might only serve to restrict the work of the agency. Rather, my approach has been, and will be, to ensure that the agency will be afforded as much freedom and flexibility as possible to respond to our evolving social structures and the changing needs and aspirations of our people.</P>
    <P>The functions of the agency are set out in section 4 of the Bill.  As I have said, <Col N="655" /> the primary function of the agency will be to foster, assist and support local projects and activities, involving self-help and voluntary community effort.  Deputies are well aware of the tremendous level of community activity which exists throughout the country.  One only has to think of the achievements of community councils, residents' associations, social service councils, youth groups, social clubs and sports groups as well as the work of nationally organised organisations such as Muintir na Tíre and the Irish Countrywomen's Association to realise the enormity of our community movement.</P>
    <P>The agency will act as a resource, consultancy and activating agency to these groups and organisations and will be able to make available both material and financial support.  In most cases the initiative for projects and activities will lie with local communities themselves but the agency will also be empowered to stimulate activity in areas where this does not already exist.  Indeed it is my intention that the bulk of the funds at the disposal of the agency will be channelled into community development and activities at local level.  Within the limits of financial resources, the agency will provide support wherever need exists, whether it be within the decaying hearts of our inner cities, in newly developing suburban areas, in small towns or in scattered rural communities.</P>
    <P>Health boards, local authorities and other statutory bodies are already engaged to varying degrees in the development of community activity and in reducing poverty and social deprivation. The agency will be charged with the task of co-ordinating the efforts of the various statutory bodies and, where appropriate, voluntary agencies to achieve more effective action in relation to self-help, poverty and social deprivation.  This will involve the agency in appraising existing services and programmes and making recommendations for improvements as well as developing new strategies and techniques for promoting community identity and involvement and alleviating social distress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> The agency will develop close working relationships with relevant statutory bodies and voluntary agencies and will ensure that its efforts and those of the statutory and voluntary organisations are married together to provide a dynamic stimulus to community development and an integrated response to situations of need. The Bill contains two provisions to facilitate and, where necessary, ensure co-operation between statutory bodies and the agency.  Firstly, it empowers any public board or body established by or under statute to co-operate with the agency in the performance of its functions.  Secondly, the Bill provides that a statutory body shall co-operate with the agency where so directed by the appropriate Minister.  I would, of course, hope, and expect that the latter provision will be rarely used but it has been included in the Bill in order to obviate any possible obstacles to the effective discharge of its functions by the agency.</P>
    <P>Another important function of the agency will be to advise and make recommendations to the Minister for Health in relation to community development policies and programmes and in relation to the social aspects of national economic and social planning.  The agency will also advise on the development of the social services and community based services generally.  It is clear that the agency will have an important part to play in the formation of Government social policy and in helping to ensure that our social services are continually reviewed and adapted to meet the changing needs and expectations of our rapidly expanding population.</P>
    <P>Other functions of the agency will include promoting greater awareness, accessibility and co-ordination of social services and collecting and disseminating information on and promoting research into community development, self-help, poverty and social deprivation.  The agency will be required to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation and the measures required to alleviate them.  The Bill also provides for the agency to undertake such <Col N="657" /> tasks and to submit such reports as the Minister may direct from time to time.</P>
    <P>The functions which are to be assigned to the agency are difficult and complex and will tax the energy, initiative and imagination of its members and staff.  If it is to be successful, the agency will require a sound and secure base, the freedom to develop new ideas and approaches and the independence to provide critical analysis of the effectiveness of existing programmes and services and to recommend changes in the scope and direction of Government policies.  It is for these reasons that the Government have decided that the agency should be established on a permanent, statutory basis with all the powers and authority it requires to discharge its functions in a vigorous and impartial manner.</P>
    <P>A number of functions which it is proposed to assign to the agency are already being discharged by the National Social Service Board.  I established the National Social Service Board in June 1981 in place of the National Social Service Council, which had been in existence since 1971. The Board is an informal, unincorporated body.  It has the task of supporting, stimulating and encouraging the formation of new voluntary social service councils and the expansion and development of existing councils.  The board also co-ordinates the work of community information centres, arranges training for volunteer information officers and provides a central information and advisory service.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious to Deputies that these functions are inseparable from the whole process of promoting community development and strengthening of community identity which is to be undertaken by the new agency.  It is, therefore, proposed to dissolve the National Social Service Board and transfer its staff, functions and responsibilities to the agency and appropriate provision is made in the Bill.  I intend to have full consultations with the staff involved to ensure that there is no misunderstanding as to what is involved and to assure them that their existing rights and entitlements will be protected.  I am confident, however, that the staff will welcome this provision <Col N="658" /> which will provide them with the permanent status and security of employment which they have been seeking for a number of years.</P>
    <P>In addition to the staff of the National Social Service Board, the agency will have power to recruit other staff and to engage consultants and advisers.  I want to make it clear, however, that it is not my intention to create a &ldquo;superstructure&rdquo; based in Dublin divorced from the reality of community life.  The agency will be required to keep its permanent staffing to the absolute minimum necessary and as far as possible, to work with and through the many professionals and volunteers already engaged at local level in community development and social services.  I would expect that it will also be necessary for the agency to engage from time to time experts in particular fields, depending on requirements for specific projects.  Here again, as I envisage it, the consultants and advisers would operate in close contact with and in support of locally based workers, both professional and lay.</P>
    <P>The basic task of the agency is to promote and advise on community development. Community development is about self-help.  It is about the removal of deprivation and the provision of support. When we talk about community development we are talking about the development of people as individuals, about giving people a sense of self worth, a sense of identity, and a realisation of their collective strength.  People cannot be developed &mdash; they can only be supported and assisted in developing themselves. We mature and grow through the exercise of responsibility and by being allowed to determine the direction of our own lives.</P>
    <P>The way in which organisations and programmes are structured and the extent to which we are asked to participate can either add to our self esteem or increase our sense of dependence.  People can be treated as passive observers for whom provision must be made by others or as people with a real contribution to make to the planning of their community and environment.  A series of projects is a normal feature of a community development <Col N="659" /> approach.  These have a part to play in testing out on a small scale what is envisaged nationally.  But community development is more than a series of projects.  It is concerned with self determination as a basic right &mdash; the right of people who are to be affected by planning programmes to be actively involved in the shaping of them.</P>
    <P>The continuing incidence of poverty, the depersonalising effect of urbanisation and other social and economic problems have led to a pervading sense of powerlessness and alienation.  The growth of community based organisations around the country can be seen as an expression of the need for action by people themselves&mdash;the need for opportunities for people to participate in identifying and articulating their own needs and aspirations rather than having them interpreted and filtered through a superstructure of agencies and committees.</P>
    <P>This movement towards direct participation at local level has to be taken into account.  Forms of organisation have to adapt to meet new needs and new ways have to be found for letting the voice of the people themselves be heard.</P>
    <P>What community development does not mean is a return to the <i>laissez-faire</i> concept.  It does not mean that people are expected by themselves to solve the major social and economic problems with which they are faced.  These may demand major structural change to find long-term solutions.  Community development envisages the efforts of people themselves being linked to those of Government in a search for these solutions.  In other words, a new relationship between people and Government is involved and there is plenty of evidence to suggest that such a partnership can release a major source of energy and ability which has been largely untapped in the past.</P>
    <P>Basically, the role of the National Community Development Agency is to act as a resource and consultancy agency in promoting a new and comprehensive approach to the development of `communities'. Existing agencies which have a community development approach, such as Muintir na Tire, Macra na <Col N="660" /> Feirme, Foroige, local social service councils, local development associations, community associations and community councils will have much to offer in any national plan.  What has already been learned must not be ignored.  What is being proposed will not discard in any way what has already been achieved.  We will build on the lessons learned from experience.  We plan to develop through the National Community Development Agency a new and dynamic approach to tackling the serious social problems with which we are faced and developing our full potential in the community.</P>
    <P>It is in this spirit that I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard the Minister's speech I rise to make our party's comments on this Bill in a slightly different frame of mind from that on entering the House.  Having read the Bill I felt that, while one could criticise it on many levels&mdash;if interpreted correctly&mdash;it had the potential of meeting the needs for which it was intended originally.</P>
      <P>This Bill can be seen as a logical development of the steps undertaken already by our Party and the Labour Party, when in Government, and by previous Coalition Governments under the old programme to combat poverty, as part of a consistent and progressive campaign to deal with a very serious problem in our society, that of poverty and inequality.  I am disturbed by the lack of attention to this problem in the Minister's speech. The whole focus of attention has moved onto quite another plain, one which is not sufficiently specific and into a much more general sphere already relatively well catered for by local authorities and health boards, that of the average community engaged on various projects needing varying levels of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having heard the Minister's speech, I shall have to consider seriously the level of support we had hoped, by way of amendment, to give this Bill.  This Bill was introduced to meet a very great challenge in our society, a challenge I had hoped could be met with enthusiasm, energy, consistency, devotion, in the confidence that, with governmental commitment <Col N="661" /> at a wide-ranging level, it would be possible at last to come to terms seriously with the problems of poverty and lack of equal opportunity in our society.  It would be my concern that we would seek to amend this Bill in order to achieve that aim.</P>
    <P>I call on all those who will be responsible for the operation of this agency &mdash;assuming it receives the support of this House&mdash;to be aware of and appreciate fully the task entailed.  I am sorry the Minister did not make this call or draft this Bill in those terms.  The purpose of the Bill should not be once again to provide a source of aid to already well-developed communities but rather to focus precisely and with initiative on communities not yet developed, those which in themselves may find it difficult to develop leadership and are in need of support and encouragement.  It was for such communities that a Bill such as this was intended, not for the general, imprecise application as has been outlined by the Minister.  The need for such a precisely directed agency is very great because while references to the problems inherent in our society seem to have disappeared in recent months since the present Government came into office and phrases such as &ldquo;crisis&rdquo;, &ldquo;economic recession&rdquo; and &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; seem to have become unfashionable, the problems remain.  As those of us who live in communities facing deprivation know these communities have great needs which are not being met.  The problems remain and are those of communities created without proper planning, communities with inadequate support structures, inadequate education, communities which certainly do not have equality of opportunity with many others in our society.  There are the challenges of itinerant children glue-sniffing in O'Connell Street, of the old and alone, of the rural isolated, of the perhaps emotional poverty from which many people suffer.  There is the challenge of the rising level of vandalism and of drug-taking in our society.  If we as legislators do not avail of this opportunity of directing this agency to examine those tasks, then we are missing a very great opportunity.  Over coming weeks while <Col N="662" /> this Bill is being discussed we hope to ensure by way of amendment&mdash; with the support of the other parties and the Independents in the House&mdash;that the work of this agency will be directed more closely to undertaking those tasks than is the Bill as at present drafted, or the Minister's comments.  Therefore, I question seriously whether this Bill is adequate to meet the challenge I outlined already.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken up the recommendation of our Government and of the previous pilot programme to combat poverty to establish a statutory agency.  In replying to a motion moved in this House by Deputy E. Desmond in the last session the Minister indicated that the agency's function would be the continuance of the pilot programmes to combat poverty.  I am seriously concerned that that commitment does not appear to have been followed through in either the Minister's speech or the provisions of the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>However, an amended Bill could have the potential of achieving the aims I have outlined.  In that connection the make-up of the agency will be extremely important. I am concerned that the Minister has not referred to this in the course of his remarks.  Neither is the agency's make-up specified precisely in the Bill.  I would be most concerned that its make-up would be such as to represent both urban and rural areas.  Poverty is properly seen to be a largely urban problem.  But the level of rural poverty in our society is extremely high, the quality of life of many people living in isolated rural regions is a matter of serious concern and something we must ensure will be adequately examined by this agency.  Already voluntary organisations are expressing concern that the Bill, for various reasons, may become overly Dublin-based.  I have reason to believe that those suspicions may be justified.  It would be indeed serious if this were allowed to happen.  The Minister must be extremely careful in ensuring adequate rural representation amongst the personnel of this agency.  It will be extremely important also to ensure that, as far as possible, there be representatives of the poor themselves on that agency.  If we are talking about establishing contact between Government <Col N="663" /> and genuinely deprived local groups, if we are talking about affording them access to the decision-making processes and, thereby, directly to governmental circles, it is vital that such groups be represented on this agency.</P>
    <P>The title of the agency chosen by the Minister &mdash; given the context in which the proposal for its establishment developed &mdash; suffers from the imprecision and vagueness, a tendency which is continued throughout the Bill by the use of terms such as &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; which are not defined. Indeed, the term &ldquo;community development&rdquo; itself remains undefined and has moved a considerable distance away from the original intention of this agency, as envisaged by previous Governments and indeed as outlined by the Minister in his speeches to this House in the last session.</P>
    <P>We considered this.  I felt it was important to retain in the title of the agency some recognition of the group at whom it was intended to be directed and whom it was intended to serve.  I welcome the idea of community development and the positive nature of self-help, but as it stands almost any voluntary group or community could apply under this Bill for support.  We would simply then be continuing an existing level of inequalities and we would not be doing anything to even out the opportunities for communities which at present have not adequate access to the existing support structure. We intend to introduce an amendment to ensure that this will not simply be misused so that this agency becomes a further funding agency for the Government where they can have extra freedom to give out grants here, there and everywhere and respond in an <i>ad hoc</i> hit and miss fashion to a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about how the terms of reference remove the concentration on poverty to the last three functions of the agency.  In the Bill we had prepared it was the central objective.  Our amendment will seek to ensure that that central concern is returned to the Bill.  I would be very glad if the Minister would develop his ideas on fostering self-help. Self-help is a desirable quality.  The ability <Col N="664" /> to be able to control one's life and to direct one's affairs in the way one wants is a desirable talent and is less seen in underdeveloped communities than better off ones.  As the Bill is drafted it seems that it is the well organised communities who will be in a better position to take advantage of the Bill.  I object to the hit and miss nature of the Bill, the failure to approach in any fundamental way the problems of poverty and inequality in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the role of voluntary agencies in our society, which is excellent.  This agency should never be allowed become a further possible source of funding for voluntary agencies.  It was intended that this agency should tackle a fundamental problem in our society.  As the Minister has outlined, it does not seem as though the agency will do that. I hope that by amendment we can direct it a little more.</P>
    <P>The relationship to other statutory bodies as outlined is obviously necessary to any agency.  The experience of all other poverty projects and the pilot project indicates that where co-operation exists between existing statutory agencies and bodies the maximum benefit is reaped for the communities.  I would also see as a logical step in the progress of any community the point at which the community are able on their own initiative to have maximum and efficient access to the schemes and funding available from local authorities and health boards.  If the Minister is concerned about encouraging voluntary groups, I believe it should be done through increasing the funds available through local authority environmental schemes and through the health boards' funding of various voluntary agencies. They do not need the encouragement of this Bill.  The people who need it are those who are not at present in a position to be members of voluntary organisations or to be able to avail of the moneys which are there for communities and agencies organised and capable enough to take advantage of them.  This agency should not be allowed to duplicate that work.  It would be wasteful of national money if it simply became another funding body for voluntary agencies which are already <Col N="665" /> strong and self-sufficient.  This agency should have a major responsibility to initiate development in areas where it does not exist at present.  That initiative is not sufficiently ensured in the terms of reference of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the particular provisions of section 4 which state:</P>
    <P>A statutory body may, and, where the Minister having statutory responsibility for it so directs shall, co-operate with the Agency in the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>This gives a certain weight to the agency which can encourage the agency to insist on involvement from the local authorities and the health boards.  It was my experience during my brief time as Minister with responsibility in this area that not only the various statutory agencies but also the business communities were very willing to co-operate and be involved in this work if sufficiently directed, It is extremely important to keep that wide level of activity under way in the future development of this agency.</P>
    <P>The most important task of this agency should be to ensure that not only the local authorities, the health boards or the voluntary agencies will do their work, but that at Government level there will be serious consideration of the implications of certain practices in the creation of poverty groups, poverty areas and poverty traps.  I believe that any agency which is to study the causes and roots of poverty and to devise policies to remove them will find themselves radically affecting the operation of almost every Government Department.  It is at that level that expertise should be ensured to this agency.  It appears that the functions of the agency do not specifically include the responsibility to examine the causes and extent of poverty.</P>
    <P>This is mentioned at one point in section 4.  It is stated in subsection (1) (j):</P>
    <P>To promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation and the measures required to alleviate them.</P>
    <P>It may be an oversight, but the extraordinary <Col N="666" /> suggestion is there that the public have to be told about it and there is no follow-through of the responsibility of either the Government or the agency to undertake the policies which are necessary. I would like to see that become one of the central functions of the agency.  In section 4 (1) (f) the Bill refers to the importance of the development of community-based services.  It states:</P>
    <P>To advise the Minister on the development of community-based services, including in particular improved training and the supply of community development staff.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister has been involved in community activities and is probably aware of the great need that community workers who will be recruited at some future date through the work of this agency should be, particularly if we are talking about the areas I would like to see the agency concentrate on, where possible local people with natural leadership qualities.  I am very concerned that this agency does not simply become another grant-aiding body for existing structures and does not become another aid to the perpetuation of the existing situation rather than an agency which will ensure that the gap which exists at present is gradually narrowed.</P>
    <P>I expect that we will be working on this Bill for some time and I call on all concerned, and on the Minister in particular, to ensure that the opportunity being presented by the Bill is taken full advantage of.  We are establishing an agency which could have a fundamental effect on what are the greatest problems of society, problems that cause the most unrest and unease and which if not tackled present the greatest threat to society and to the country as a whole.  I hope that the Minister will be prepared to consider sympathetically amendments that we will be proposing.  We must all do everything possible to ensure that the new agency will be as effective as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support strongly this Bill.  It is legislation in which we have a vital interest.  The Bill <Col N="667" /> is presented to us as the alternative to the Bill that we had drafted while in Government for the establishment of an agency to combat poverty.  During our entire existence poverty has been a central issue with us.  The Labour Party prepared in 1973 what was the first policy document on poverty.  The whole issue was central to our various election manifestoes, including our 1981 document.  During our seven months in Government and having had before us the final report of the Combat Poverty Committee, as well as the report of the review group set up by the Department, we were very busy in this whole area of poverty.  We had got Government approval for the establishment of a committee to combat poverty. and the Bill was available in draft form.</P>
      <P>Whatever about other aspects of our policy which regretfully we had to leave unfulfilled on leaving office, the Bill in question was advanced to the stage where we hoped the new Government would take it over and have it processed.  However, within two weeks of our leaving office, the new Taoiseach, in reply to a Dáil question, made it clear that our Bill was to be dropped and was to be substituted by a Bill designed to set up a National Community Development Agency as agreed with Deputy Gregory in the talks prior to the formation of the Government.  That is the Bill that is before us now.  During the debate on the motion that we had before the House some weeks ago for the purpose of eliciting some information on the subject, the Minister told us that the Bill he proposed to introduce would broaden the scope of the agency.  The Minister has broadened the scope so much and has diffused the whole matter to such an extent that it has lost the point.  He has presented us with a rehash of the terms of the Bill we had prepared with the result that the agency now being set up will have a less definite role to play in the elimination of poverty than would have had the type of agency we proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were considering the question of a title for our Bill, at least two of those titles considered included the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;.  We considered that the inclusion <Col N="668" /> of that word strengthened the case. It is important that the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; is kept before the public mind.  Therefore, we considered the title to be of much significance.  Poverty is a reality. We know from statistics that up to 25 per cent of our people live in relative poverty in the sense that their standard of living cannot be compared with what is regarded as the norm for the remainder of the community.  The people who make up this 25 per cent are cut off from power, cut off from having control over their own lives, as a result of their dependence on other members of society.</P>
    <P>From reading the Minister's speech it is difficult to substantiate the claim he makes regarding the aim of the Bill being to combat poverty.  If that is the case why not call the agency an agency to combat poverty?  Community development in itself is a very good concept and one for which there is a place in society, but it is a different matter from the question of eliminating poverty.  Poverty has its roots in inequality, in the unjust structures of society.  All of the injustices and inequalities with which society is rife are very often reflected in individual communities. Therefore, to develop a community might mean in some cases to develop something that is already most developed.  It has been said that we might be applying the bulk of the resources to those communities that least need that sort of assistance.  Community development can be successful only to the extent that we realise that the causes of poverty come from the individual, from the family and from the community in general as distinct from coming from outside. In saying that I am not condemning community development, but for those of us who believe that the cause of poverty lies in the structure of the economy and of society, this Bill, and in particular section 4, appear to make much less effective the fight against poverty than would have been the case if the agency we proposed had gone ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister has juggled with the terms of reference as proposed in the Bill that we intended introducing.  Perhaps he can tell us what was wrong with, for instance, our terms of reference which <Col N="669" /> proposed providing that the functions of the agency should be to examine the causes and extent of poverty?  In what sense could that have been a worse start than proposing that the agency shall advise the Minister and make recommendations to him regarding community development, policies and programmes in relation to self help, poverty and services?  What was wrong with another of our proposals regarding the function of the agency &mdash; to undertake, in consultation with the Minister, action aimed at combating poverty and to evaluate such action?  What was wrong with one of the functions of the agency being to appraise critically existing policies and programmes in so far as they affect poverty and to recommend any necessary modifications or what was wrong with providing for the agency to establish and maintain contact with and between Government Departments?  Was there anything wrong with the provision that the agency suggest effective new policies and programmes against poverty and, in consultation with the Minister, test out new programmes on an experimental basis?  Why was the reference in our proposals to the implementation of recommendations of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty dropped?</P>
    <P>We felt that the agency should be charged with the task of advising on the implementation of the recommendations of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty.  That was four years ago and I should like to know why there is such a reluctance to recognise the work done during those years by such dedicated people in the areas of community action research, welfare rights projects, social services council projects, supplementary welfare allowances projects and the projects contracted out to the various bodies such as the education and training of itinerants in County Clare and the contract to Women's Aid with regard to family violence and the problem of battered wives.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that this was a fine report.  The recommendations which were worthy and well worked out were based on four years of dedicated and <Col N="670" /> difficult work.  The essence of the programme was that the information gained should be directed towards long-term policy.  The key note was that poverty had its basis in inequality.  There seems to be a tendency &mdash; certainly on the part of the Taoiseach and to some extent on the part of the Minister for Health if one is to judge by his reply to a recent Private Member's motion &mdash; to deny or to seek more concrete evidence that poverty has its base in inequality.  The final report of the Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty emphasised the powerlessness of the poor.  The committee made the point that deprived people have resources and skills which they cannot use effectively because of the powerless situation in which they find themselves in society.  They concluded that powerlessness was rooted in the way that income, wealth, education and educational opportunities are distributed among the individuals in society and that poor people did not have any status and very few rights.</P>
    <P>In his terms of reference the Minister mentioned the question of promoting a greater awareness among the public. That was also catered for in our terms of reference but with more punch.  Awareness among the public is necessary.  It is worth repeating that the recent EEC survey showed that 56 per cent of our people believed there were no poor here or if there were they had not met any.  That is the way our society is divided.  When asked if there were poor people why were they poor 30 per cent of those questioned believed it was through laziness and 20 per cent thought it was through personal misfortune.  Only 19 per cent of those questioned thought that poverty had anything to do with the injustices in our society.  My colleague, Deputy Higgins, when contributing to the Private Member's motion in the House some weeks ago said that we were high on compassion but very low on justice.  He was correct. We show a great deal of compassion but we do not think through things very easily. We do not see through the injustices in our society and, therefore, it is necessary to raise a great deal of public awareness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> The causes of inequality are based on initial disadvantage, compounded by subsequent disadvantages, poor housing, poor parents, poor neighbourhood, poor education, poor possibility of availing of whatever education there is, poor employment or no employment at all and a reinforcing cycle of causation.  There is no doubt that poverty in Irish society should be recognised as being largely as a result of inequality, the eventual elimination of which will involve long-term structural change.  There is inequality of income.  It is strange that once one makes that point there is a denial that it exists or that it is the cause of poverty.  There is little need to go into detail about that point but I should like to remark that before the recent budget one person paid £100,000 for wine in an effort to beat the budget increase.  We should compare that to what old or poor people have to spend when they go shopping.  We have all witnessed such people putting things back on the shelves because they cannot afford them.  Those people have to make a decision between buying a tin of soup, a packet of soup or a packet of biscuits. They deal in pence.  We live in a very inequitable society and inequity of income is the basis to it all.  Poverty which shows itself in that guise is something we cannot afford to allow to continue.</P>
    <P>We have a hopeless inequality in housing. In the book, <i>One Million Poor?</i>, written by Sister Stanislaus, which contains very effective contributions by many committed people, Liam Ryan, writing on housing stated:</P>
    <P>There may be many more profound differences between social classes, but segregation on the basis of type and ownership of house has become the supreme symbol for a class conscious populace.  The striking contrast between the semi-detached of the private sector and the inferior terraces of the public sector is remarkable in an age which adopts a public policy of inequality ...</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan went on to say:</P>
    <P>The world-wide North/South dualism <Col N="672" /> highlighted in the Brandt Report is parallelled in every city of the world by a sort of urban dualism wherein the deprivation of slums and the poverty of large municipal housing estates contrast with the relative affluence of middle-class suburbs.</P>
    <P>We have this poverty and deprivation and public representatives have to deal with it.  They come face to face with it weekly, at clinics where they hear of overcrowded houses and harassed parents who must meet high rents which they cannot afford.  We know that that strain has increased with the decision to decontrol rents and we are all aware of the problems caused due to children having to sleep in overcrowded rooms.  This is carried on into the education system.  It is often said that education has a great potential for equality and yet we have not used it very effectively up to now.  It has a reputation for being an equalising force in society but instead it tends to perpetuate and aggravate the income and class differentials we have.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about pre-school groups which are very important for deprived children, particularly where disadvantages exist.  In come cases there must be co-education of the parent and the child and that can only be done in small groups.  That is one area where pre-school has an advantage but yet we have not heard anything about it.  In 1979, 68 per cent of 16 year-olds went on for full-time education but the drop-out rate was such that when they reached 19 years of age only 16 per cent remained and yet there is an inverse distribution of money among the three levels.  In 1979 we spent £303 per pupil at national school and £542 per pupil at second level.  We have to spend money on education but there is a feeling that the more that is spent the better, that cuts are bad, and it does not matter how you spend it.  Obviously the most vocal lobby will avail most of or will get the most from education and they and their parents can reach furthest along the educational scale.  We spent £1.343 excluding the grants on third level education and the clamour was for spending more.  After all that there was no change <Col N="673" /> at all between 1964-65 and 1978-79 in the proportion of the various socio-economic groups attending university.  Therefore, despite the grants system at third level and free second level we made no impression. We had not reached the more deprived sections of our community.</P>
    <P>A. Dale Tussing makes a very valuable contribution in Sister Stanislaus's book <i>One Million Poor?.</i>  He says that to ignore infantile environment and pre-school learning, to beggar first level and then to offer equality of opportunity on the basis of free second level education and a high education grants scheme is ludicrous, all the more so when it is recalled that many pupils still cannot continue through senior cycle for economic reasons, that the higher education grants scheme is so structured as to fail even to permit all those with poorer backgrounds who somehow make it to third level to pursue higher education without help from their families.  He adds that more stringent requirement, four leaving certificate honours instead of two, for university entrance from the grant recipient seems a patent <i>prima facie</i> violation of equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>We have heavy subsidisation of education at third level, second level and primary level in descending order.  Our society is geared to give more to those who have most.  The subsistence grants and subsidies that we operate make a tremendous difference to an enormous number of people and achieve the greatest common good, nevertheless a residue of people who have no disposable income, who have barely enough to live on from one week to another, never have the balance to avail of those grants or in some cases to buy the things that are subsidised, and they are left at the bottom of the pile as far as equality is concerned.</P>
    <P>Quite recently many articles on poverty have been written and that is encouraging even if the same few people are writing them.  I was interested in a comment on the effects of bad housing on health from Dr. Geoffrey Deane the Chairman of the Medico-Social Research Board, published on 4 September 1981 in which he said that many studies have shown that socio-economic factors play <Col N="674" /> the principal role in health, that the better-off are healthier, suffer from fewer diseases and live longer than the poor. This is true of some of the major effects of ill-health in our society such as heart attacks, a number of important cancers, high blood pressure and so on.  Despite a remarkable improvement in the standard of living of the Irish people during the past 20 years the unequal distribution of wealth continues to have an effect on the nation's health.  Good housing is a prerequisite for healthy living and, although great strides have been made in the provision of local authority houses, more strides need to be made.  There is a link between bad housing and health and the chain of deprivation to which we have addressed ourselves to alleviating.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this Bill will do what it is supposed to do.  It is too diffuse, too wide and it applies itself to communities generally.  There is reference to deprivation and self-help and I ask the Minister to define what he means by &ldquo;self-help&rdquo;. He referred to it quite often during his speech and it is written into the Bill. Self-help is fine but the facilities to enable some people to help themselves are not there.  The burden of deprivation, poverty and want is so great that we need a more positive and direct approach.  We must confront inequality, and the question of confronting inequality and eliminating poverty must be set down in the terms of reference of the Bill.  While we did not mention inequality specifically in the terms of reference of the Bill, the House has had an opportunity to do so and it would be a good idea to mention it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We must confront wealth, power and privilege.  People might talk about poverty but there is a great reluctance to talk about wealth because then you are talking about taking from people who perhaps have more than their share.  Maybe you are talking about the privileged society, those who use the network of power and influence to get around the system. The system is there and it applies only to the deprived.  We as a country are notorious in so far as the poor are concerned and the system does not apply where it apparently is perceived to apply.  We <Col N="675" /> know that many big decisions and contacts are made in golf, yacht and rugby clubs and wherever you meet the people of your own standing in society if you are a person of power and clout.  This 25 per cent of the community have no clout or privilege.  They do not know where to go with their problems.  Perhaps it is their social service centre or using their TD when he or she sets up a clinic.  That must be the function of a TD because of the bureaucracy and the system that exist and because so many services are not accessible to the poor, but the ideal that we are trying to achieve would result in the TD becoming redundant as far as that kind of work is concerned.</P>
    <P>We must lay the foundation for an economic and social policy within a planning framework which will eradicate poverty from our society.  Right through the Minister's speech there are many nice-sounding phrases but they mean very little when you think about them.  We will be teasing out this Bill on Committee Stage and we will seek to amend it.  If this were a Bill to develop communities without reference to poverty we would probably support it but it purports to be a Bill to eliminate poverty and this is where we see the problem.  We do not think that it will eliminate poverty.  There is need for community development, to promote self-help, to apply resources and to make services accessible and so on.  The Bill cannot do that.  We will need a very good committee indeed to make it do the job it is setting out to do.  Does the Minister really say that he is setting out among other things to eliminate poverty?</P>
    <P>Before I conclude on this I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.  First, why was this Bill placed under his aegis in his capacity as Minister for Health? There is no explanation of that.  I cannot understand why it is put under the Department of Health and I would like the Minister to tell us.  Was there any reason why our terms of reference were changed?  The Minister in a recent speech spoke about broadening the terms of reference that we had.  We contend that such broadening would take all the punch out of the Bill which as a result will not do <Col N="676" /> effectively the task it is supposed to do. Why was there no mention in the terms of reference of the implementation of the recommendations of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty? The Minister spoke about the agency drawing on the experience of the past.  Perhaps he had in mind the experience of the pilot scheme.  Why not write it in as one of the terms of reference? Groundwork has been done, foundations have been laid.  Why not write that in?  The Minister mentioned funding, but that is no yardstick of the effectiveness of this committee.</P>
    <P>Their effectiveness will depend on their terms of reference, their concentration on the subject of poverty and their freedom to be an active, independent agency unafraid to abuse vested interests or to offend people in the pursuance of their tasks.  To do the job properly I have no doubt that they will have to offend vested interests and influential lobbies, representing those who reap the greatest rewards in society.  It is time that those at the bottom of the pile had an agency set up specially for them.  The agency must speak for them alone and not for every other community.  The Minister lists all the people who have made a contribution and we agree that many people have done worth-while jobs in different spheres. However, they have not served the purpose of eliminating poverty.</P>
    <P>Society works through a network of power and influence and people who are in the know use the system for their own advantage.  The system must be made effective for the poor.  The educational system, the housing system and the legal system have little direct relevance for the poor.  The system is geared towards property rather than people.  Although some form of free legal aid is now available for civil cases, the legal system in general does not meet the needs of the poor, nor are the people who operate that system geared to serve the poor.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the incorporation in the Bill of the National Social Services Board.  The Minister spoke about having consultations with the board and said he felt confident that they would accept their incorporation in the National Community <Col N="677" /> Development Agency.  He said he intended to have full consultation with the staff involved to ensure that there would be no misunderstanding as to what was involved and to assure them that their existing rights and entitlements would be protected.  He felt confident that the staff would welcome this provision which would provide them with the permanent status and security of employment which they have been seeking for a number of years.  I would ask the Minister why he did not consult the board before introducing this Bill.  I am quite sure the staff are interested in more than their permanent status and security of employment, although that is a very relevant matter.  I would have expected consultations before the Bill was printed.</P>
    <P>Section 4 should contain a specific reference to the continuation of the present work of the NSSB in the new agency. The present list of functions does not appear to guarantee the continuation of that work.  I do not know at what level the NSSB will be incorporated.  Will their members have a place on the agency and what will be the position of the director? No doubt these are matters which the Minister hopes to discuss with these people, but the consultations should already have taken place.</P>
    <P>Section 17 contains a restriction which may not be necessary and I do not know its purpose.  I refer to the clause dealing with official secrets and the Minister might refer to this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>Will the Council for the Aged continue to function under the umbrella of the new agency?  Will the NSSB constitute a separate wing of the agency with their own staff or will they be totally absorbed in the agency?  These are matters about which people in the NSSB would like to have known before now.</P>
    <P>We have waited anxiously for this Bill because it represents something which is very dear to us, the greater level of equality in our community.  We are not satisfied that this Bill will achieve what we set out to do when in Government.  During the four years between 1976 and 1980, while the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty were functioning, there was a fear of anything that <Col N="678" /> might make us feel uncomfortable or upset society as we know it.  We should not be afraid of that.  If we are to share more equitably the resources of this country, some people will have to give and the interests of some will have to be offended.</P>
    <P>It is so easy to meet deprivation by increasing social welfare benefits and such action will be welcomed by all &mdash; until perhaps, they have to pay PRSI contributions.  Such action is not positive because it does not change anything.  This Bill should be about changing things, but I do not think it will reach the really poor and deprived in our society, those who have been unjustly treated.  There should have been a much more concentrated effort to reach that section.  We will be putting down amendments to give the Bill teeth and direction and I hope that such amendments will be accepted.  The Minister has committed himself and stated that the objective is to eliminate poverty.  If he is serious I hope he will accept our amendments or at least discuss them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We accept the Bill because community development is good in itself.  Even if it had nothing to do with poverty, we would support a Bill of this nature.  We will try to shape the Bill in such a way that it will serve the purpose we intended, namely, the eradication of poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill and on allocating £2 million for the agency in the current year.  I believe the agency will be able to cope with the problem of poverty and improve the position of the underprivileged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the function of the agency and states that the agency will advise the Minister.  I would hope that the agency would not become a pressure group and that too many structures would not be imposed on the local voluntary organisations.  I was glad to hear the Minister say in his opening statement that there would not be any superstructure and that the bulk of the funds would be channelled into community development. It is important that communities should be able to develop their potential. <Col N="679" /> I hope the agency will promote this development and promote closer relations between the statutory and voluntary groups.  They should be equal partners in giving service to the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) (g) states that the functions of the agency shall be the following:</P>
    <P>To draw on and evaluate research on self-help, poverty and social deprivation by third level educational and other bodies, and to promote such research from time to time on specific projects;</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider giving grants to second level students to carry out surveys on the needs of the elderly and young people.  This would make them aware of needs in this area and it would interest them in finding a solution.</P>
    <P>It is important that we allow communities to develop at their own rate and it is important also that there should be voluntary involvement.  Excellent work is done by bodies such as the National Social Service Council in association with those working for the handicapped and people working with itinerants, and it is important that we give this work our support. This Bill should be welcomed because it will bring the various agencies under one umbrella and I compliment the Minister on introducing it.</P>

      <P>I should like to quote the Long Title of this Bill:</P>
      <P>AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BODY (TO BE KNOWN AS THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AGENCY) TO ADVISE THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH ON NATIONAL POLICY RELATING TO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, SELF-HELP, POVERTY AND SOCIAL DEPRIVATION, TO SUPPORT VOLUNTARY ACTION BY THE COMMUNITY IN RELATION TO THOSE MATTERS AND TO PROMOTE GREATER PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THEM.  TO DEFINE THE POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE AGENCY AND TO PROVIDE FOR OTHER CONNECTED MATTERS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would be forgiven for thinking the Minister was setting up a private company under modern arrangements who <Col N="680" /> were given the widest possible terms of reference and objectives so that they could do almost anything.  It is our view that this agency should not be empowered to do almost anything.  We believe the agency should be empowered to come to terms with the poverty that is pervading Irish society and which needs to be tackled.  The Minister might as well have given the agency the right to distribute toothbrushes so wide have been the general terms of reference.  The generalities so evident in the Minister's speech will not help, because no attempt has been made to come to terms with the very specific problems of the community.  The terms of reference are general, blasé and woolly and that is one of the regrets we have about the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not talking about combating poverty.  He is talking about setting up an agency that will have many different responsibilities, one that will somehow take over the role of the agency to combat poverty which he and his Government abolished.  He proposes also that the agency should take over the responsibilities of the National Social Service Council.  Instead of leaving those bodies, as proposed by the previous Government, with specific tasks, he has decided to merge all of them in one big club.  The result is that nobody knows which body is responsible for any specific matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has added insult to injury by attaching this new body to the Department of Health instead of to the Department of Education or indeed to a new Minister for youth and community affairs.  He has not put forward an imaginative proposal that would tackle the difficulties facing the community. Instead, we have been presented with a piece of nonsense that has come before us because of a deal between Deputy Haughey and Deputy Gregory.</P>
    <P>There has been no attempt to look at the problem objectively and to try to get a solution.  This measure is before us in the place of a well thought-out proposal to strengthen the board dealing with the problem of combating poverty which was abolished by the Minister.  The previous proposals were well researched and much <Col N="681" /> work was done on the matter by the former Minister, but they were replaced by proposals for a National Community Development Agency with woolly terms of reference simply on the nod of Deputy Gregory because his vote had to be bought.  I do not object to Deputy Gregory trying to do something constructive, but I do not think that Deputy Haughey and Deputy Gregory had the real interests of the poor at heart because they did not attempt to research the need for this new agency which the Minister is proposing to set up.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to those who were involved in the committee to combat poverty that the proposed National Community Development Agency does not compare with the previous agency. Indeed, the former chairman, Sister Stanislaus, and members of other voluntary agencies &mdash; I had a long association with the national council of one such organisation until I became a Member of this House &mdash; are not at all convinced that the Minister's attitude towards the problem of combating poverty has been amended.  They are not convinced that he is serious in his efforts to deal with problems facing the community.</P>
    <P>There is some potential in the proposals the Minister is putting forward in the Bill.  However, the Minister's speech introducing it was full of generalities.  The objective of combating poverty has been watered down and this is a cause for regret.  Vague terms such as, &ldquo;self-help&rdquo;, &ldquo;community development&rdquo; and all kinds of organisations and associations that have been mentioned are not specific enough.  It is much less specific than the proposals which the previous Government put forward to combat poverty.  I regret this and I honestly do not believe the present Minister believes that this is the most effective way to combat poverty. This Bill is before us for one reason, to tie up the vote in this House.  That is what I regret most.  If we were objective and asked ourselves how we were going to go about solving the problem that exists it would be a better Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing to subsume the National Social Services Board, having sacked the combat poverty board <Col N="682" /> against the wishes of its members, particularly its chairman.  Instead of leaving the two distinct bodies he is merging them and there will be difficulties from the beginning.  The Minister refers to self help groups in the community.  Presumably the community of Foxrock will get the same treatment as the community of St. Theresa's Gardens which I represent and where there is an obvious and immediate poverty problem that needs to be tackled not in a general way but in a very specific way.  I do not want to see areas of this city which do not have the same degree of poverty getting the same attention as areas which are obvious candidates for support and direct action.  The Minister would probably get over this problem if he were to designate certain areas as areas needing immediate help from this agency and tackled the problems in a specific way.</P>
    <P>There are so many such areas in the Dublin region in particular.  I do not wish to leave out the rest of the country because I know there are difficulties regionally as well.  But there are so many areas so obviously in need of help that under the general term of self-help groups in the community the Minister might be giving as much attention to the middle class and upper middle class areas as he is to areas of total deprivation which need urgent attention.  I would like to see in the Bill some mention of designated areas or some terms of reference given to the National Community Development Agency to tackle specific designated areas in the city, not just in the north inner city but in the south inner city and regions around the country most in need.</P>
    <P>One of the things that I am afraid of when setting up these agencies and giving them such wide terms of reference and not tying them down to specifics is that they become tied up in administration; they become just a further layer of bureaucracy.  When their objectives are so wide they become vague and the agency does not know how best to take on the task which is before it.  Previously in the Dublin area a pilot scheme was set up and it got, as far as I can recall, a budget of about £80,000, but at the end of the day £75,000 was spent on administration <Col N="683" /> and nothing was spent in the community to deal with the problems that were supposed to be dealt with.  I do not want to see this happen to this new body. The term &ldquo;National Community Development Agency&rdquo; is enormous.  It does not give any impression of an agency tackling poverty.  The Combat Poverty Agency clearly had in its name a specific task, a commitment.  To replace this with such a vague agency is very wrong.</P>
    <P>We will be proposing constructive amendments to the Minister's Bill.  Our reservations are serious, particularly about the vagueness of the Minister's introduction and the manner in which this Bill has been brought before this House.  We will continue to voice those reservations and will be putting amendments to the various sections of the Bill as they go through the House.  In particular Fine Gael will want to see an amendment written in whereby the causes and extent of poverty will be a term of reference of the development agency.  I fear that the Minister has not acted wisely in leaving that particular term out of the Bill.  It would be helpful to have it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred constantly to support groups in the community, to the ICA and various other bodies.  I note he does not mention the St. Vincent de Paul Society or other people who have particular expertise in the area of poverty. Where does the Minister say the agency's responsibilities lie?  It is very difficult to make out from the Bill.  Does he feel that the agency should support voluntary organisations or is it intended that they should get involved in paid professional services directly involved with the community? In answering this would the Minister make it clear what steps he intends to take to ensure that we are not just imposing a further layer of bureaucracy, because that is the essential danger in this Bill?</P>
    <P>The Minister says also that the agency will provide support wherever need exists &mdash; for example, in the decaying parts of inner cities or developing suburban areas.  There is relevant poverty in some of the suburban areas.  I think it was <Col N="684" /> Cardinal Conway who said that relative poverty is sometimes as bad if not worse than dire poverty.  If people are living in dire poverty the chances are that there are a lot of people around them living in similar circumstances.  Relative poverty can be a very disturbing experience and may seem like a social disease as well as the poverty of having to do without.  But on the question of commitment to areas, whether they are the heart of the inner city or the new suburbs or the regions or the west of the country or wherever the Minister happens to think the most poverty exists, we must all agree that there are areas which are obviously more poverty-stricken than others.  The term used by the Minister seems to indicate that he feels that this agency should get involved in all communities straight away.  Surely it should be directed towards tackling the problems in the areas most widely affected, particularly those difficult regions in Dublin and around the country.  I do not think there is this commitment.  Time and time again the Minister has come out with these woolly general terms instead of getting down to specifics.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing that the agency should relate to the Department of Health.  There may be very good reasons for that since the health boards and the local authorities relate to the Department. Perhaps the Minister has it in mind that the agency should work with them.</P>

The health board system is completely out of control and is badly in need of review.  It has lost sight of its objective. In the case of the Eastern Health Board, for example, the geographic area allocated to that board by the Department is too vast.  To add another layer to the Department of Health is not conducive to good results.</P>

      <P>To an area which is already showing signs of ineffective administration, the Minister is adding another layer which, as he said in his own speech, should be dynamic and effective. In my view, it will be neither because of its association with these bodies.  This agency needs to be associated with a new Minister, perhaps with the Minister for Education rather than Health, or a Minister with responsibility for youth and community affairs.  The association of this agency with an already overtaxed body will not in any way bring about the tackling of the really abject poverty existing in certain sections of our community. That poverty is expressed through unemployment, bad housing and the growth in drugs and crime problems.  Those realities and objectives have not been in the Minister's mind sufficiently strongly in <Col N="686" /> the preparation of this legislation.  It will not be as effective as previous legislation in coming to terms with poverty.</P>
      <P>There is mention in the Bill that members of the agency cannot be paid.  Presumably that includes the chairman and vice-chairman, who are mentioned separately. It does not say specifically whether they will be paid, or whether they will be full-time members.  The Minister might let the House know the situation there.</P>
      <P>The date of the initial meeting is referred to.  Has the Minister any specific date in mind, presuming that the House passes the Bill, however amended?  The section relating to audit and financial responsibility is very important.  There should be some financial analysis done on that audit to ensure that the funds to be voted by this House help those whom they are intended to help.  They must not be tied up in administration, or in areas of which this House would not approve.</P>
      <P>My next few points are important, although they are small in relation to the subject of poverty.  They relate to the drafting of this Bill and of Bills in general. I refer specifically to section 13 (1) which states:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Agency is nominated as a member of Seanad Eireann or as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or to the Assembly of the European Communities or is appointed to such Assembly, he shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in serious disagreement with that section.  At this stage in our political development any person offering himself or herself as a candidate for Dáil Eireann should not be required to resign from this agency, irrespective of whether that person wishes to stand as a Member of the Government party, or in opposition, or as an independent.  The Minister may be afraid that when they find out how ineffective this agency is going to be they may decide to run as candidates for Dáil Eireann on policies to combat national poverty and cause embarrassment to the Government, but that is their entitlement. <Col N="687" /> This restriction shows no imagination.</P>
    <P>Another equally important provision, in view of what has happened with regard to another agency set up by this House, is that under section 17 (1) which states:</P>
    <P>A person shall not, without the consent of the Agency, disclose any information obtained by him while performing duties as a member or employee of, or a consultant or adviser to, the Agency.</P>
    <P>I do not need to be specific, but recently a person acting in good faith supplied a member of the Government with information about an agency of which he was officer.  This eventually caused an investigation by the Fraud Squad.  That man was left completely in isolation and was suspended for providing such information to a Cabinet Minister.  This National Community Development Agency will be spending in the region of £2 million a year, which may not get to the real source of the problem and may not be spent where intended.  This provision would prevent an officer from divulging this necessary information.  Particularly in view of the bad experience in the west of Ireland.  I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to the deletion of this section.  This is a democracy.  If the agency being created is not doing what Dáil Eireann intended it to do, an officer should be at liberty to contact Members of the Dáil and, indeed, the Minister concerned, to impart that information.</P>
    <P>I have covered the matter of the numerous tasks which are being assigned to this agency.  I ask the Minister to consider an amendment regarding Members of the Dáil not having to resign from the agency and about the freedom to divulge necessary information.  Other amendments with regard to the objectives and terms of reference of the agency will be put to the House from this side of the House in an attempt to give the agency the real teeth which an agency to combat poverty should have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be somewhat brief in my contribution.  I congratulate the Minister <Col N="688" /> on introducing this Bill and giving the Members of the House an opportunity to contribute to the establishment of a very permanent structure for community services.  I have quite a lot of experience, not alone in my own constituency but throughout the country, of community services.  I wish to give the Minister an opinion on the formulation of other structures, which is why I am making this contribution.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the officials of his Department have much to gain from previous experience regarding the activities of the now defunct National Social Services Board and the Combat Poverty Agency.  The latter was a disaster, as I will explain later.  What is meant by community development?  It involves local people getting together to assess the needs of the community and organising in a structured fashion to provide for the needs of their community.  This is the philosophy of community development, the involvement of people on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>Community development is taking place throughout the country, perhaps not to the extent or efficiency we would desire.  There is a tremendous awareness of the needs of people, such as the care of the aged and the lonely.  This is not confined to the old.  Loneliness exists among young married couples and their families who move into new housing schemes.  There is also a great awareness of the needs of our young people.  One could talk at length about the needs of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we are not dealing with community services but a structure to advise on and develop community services.  My reservations on this Bill are that instead of setting up a National Community Development Agency, the Minister should consider a departure from the two previous structures, namely, the National Community Service Board and the Combat Poverty Commission to a local voluntary community agency coordinating the various services including health boards, local authorities and statutory bodies, and involve local people, sporting organisations, and so on, in community services for the old and the youth.  They should <Col N="689" /> all be under the one umbrella working for the common good of the people they serve.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer should be the programme manager for community care under the health boards.  A development officer should be appointed to the local agencies.  The local community associations are the best judges of the needs arising in their areas.  The immediate needs are to maintain and to expand the services.  Unfortunately, up to now the necessary finance was not available to local community associations.  The money to be spent on the administration costs of the National Community Development Agency should be channelled into the local community agencies.  I do not know the cost of the two administrations about which we have been talking. I had the pleasure and privilege of serving on the National Community Services Board.  I was impressed at the manner in which they fed out information to the various community organisations.  Their achievements were very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The local community associations have a wealth of information available to them thanks to the National Community Services Board and the Minister for his dedicated interest in this work.  A word of praise is also due to the officials of his Department.</P>
    <P>Originally I opposed the Combat Poverty Agency when they were introduced in this House some years ago.  I felt that their work would overlap the work already being done by the local community associations.  I was quite correct, because it was proved subsequently that this was happening.  There was an over-lapping of work and in some cases a certain amount of resentment existed.</P>
    <P>Practically all the sections in this Bill could be applied to the establishment of local structures rather than a national one.  This would ensure that the local people would have the authority and the initiative to organise, control and expand community services.  I want to give the Minister an opportunity to take advantage of the spirit in the local community organisations.  Why not have local structures rather than a national one?  I should <Col N="690" /> like the Minister to express his view on that point.</P>
    <P>In my own city of Cork there is a tremendous structure involving the health boards, the local authorities and some of the statutory bodies.  We may not have reached perfection but the structure is there.  With the involvement of the Minister and his officials in the appointment of development officers in each of the health board areas, I am convinced local people would rally and become involved in the work of serving their own communities.</P>

      <P>It is the intention of the Labour Party to seek to amend this Bill and particularly sections 4 and 18.  Section 4 deals with the terms of reference, and the main purport of our amendment will be to restore the concept of inequality to the terms of reference, and to seek to re-order those terms in a way which will enable the Bill which will emerge from our discussions to approach the problem of inequality and its derived consequence of poverty in its many forms.</P>
      <P>Section 18 to which our second substantial amendment will be proposed deals with the National Social Services Board.  It is the opinion of our party that a case has not been made for the transfer of the functions of this board to the new agency as outlined in the Minister's speech.  We will be tabling a number of other amendments to improve the Bill in terms of definition.  These will become apparent as the debate on the next Stage develops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that when we discussed poverty at the end of March we had a very sparse attendance in this House.  Obviously the problem was not attracting the interest of Deputies through the months of April and May and into the month of June.  In a way, it is interesting, symptomatic an illustrative <Col N="691" /> of our approach in the legislature to the question of poverty that, by and large, we are a privileged assembly of people. I am not suggesting for a second that one needs to be among the ranks of the most abject poor to have an interest in poverty. That in the experience of the Webbs, of Charles Booth and of Shaw himself would contradict such a suggestion. Nevertheless I think that our distance as legislators from the experience and facts of poverty informs the structure of the legislative response.</P>
    <P>I find it incredible that one could sit here and listen to a debate yet again on the subject of poverty and the entirety of the Minister's speech and not hear any reference to inequality.  I worry about this because if you trace the logic of the missing reference to inequality it leads you to poverty as some kind of pathology. In an intervention the Minister referred to the problem of drugs being under the Department of Health as would be this new agency.  It would be a separate statutory body but it was being introduced by the Department of Health.  I worry about the overall suggestion that poverty is in fact pathological.  This is a very short distance from suggesting that the poor are poor because of some inherent characteristics in themselves as opposed to an approach towards poverty that would see it as an aspect of structure, a structure that confers privilege on the one hand and poverty on the other within the same society, one as neat function of the other.</P>
    <P>There is a brilliant exposition of this published by a young anthropologist some years ago, Hugh Brody, in his book <i>Inishkillane</i>.  In that book he draws a distinction between, on the one hand, a man in rural poverty and loneliness who comes out with the remark, &ldquo;I will be like Sonny Liston; I will be dead for weeks before anybody finds me.&rdquo;  While in the same village with him is a character presented under the name Michael, another cameo, who ownes the local petrol pump, the undertaking business, his wife has a guesthouse and he is renting land.  The lonely man wishes to sell his land so that he will have neighbours and can provide <Col N="692" /> them with vegetables and so on.  But he is stopped by the greedy person in the community who insists on renting the land from him.  We can see that the abject loneliness and poverty of the one man are functions of the greed and avarice of the other.</P>
    <P>That kind of connection, powerfully demonstrated in all of the scholarship in every country where poverty has been studied is being abandoned in the preparation of a Bill like this.  The suggestion is that those who are privileged and well off, comfortable and happy and participating in the community, will be able to set up a structure, able to extend their own efforts to take account of the real interests of those who are the casualties of the very values that the people in the community hold.  This is not a very radical suggestion.  It is a simple, substantiated research finding in every place in every country where people have studied poverty.</P>
    <P>I find it curious that there is reference in the Bill to research.  It says under (g) in the Explanatory Memorandum that the agency will be able to draw on and evaluate research on self help, poverty and social deprivation by third level educational and other bodies and to promote such research from time to time on specific projects.  If that is the intention of this legislation why not take account of what studies are available at present? There is a consensus in poverty studies among any bodies who have done any research on the subject that what is needed is an approach towards the manifestations of poverty along the dimension of inequality.  If one does not do this, if one believes that you should leave structures intact you should take out poverty everywhere you speak of it and you should say this Bill is for the elimination of social distress.  That would be more honest.  You would be saying that the existing structure is fine; we are hoping that people will be voluntarily concerned about the consequences of the existing structure so as to take into account those poor infortunate people who are in distress. That would be honest but this instrument will not address itself to the problem of poverty, as studied and <Col N="693" /> researched and reported on as an aspect of structure.  It will not address itself to the question of distribution of power, the holding of power by those who are privileged and wealthy, the manner in which society reproduces itself and transfers resources unequally to those who unequally possess them at present.</P>
    <P>In a sad way we are repeating the history of poverty studies.  This exercise is the Irish version of what happened in the United States.  I was a post-graduate student there shortly after the initiation of Johnson's war on poverty.  It led to the giving of some federal money to poor areas where you had minorities, not poor by any accidental reason but because they were black.  They were deprived because they were both black and poor.  Some of the money led towards the stirring of demands, not for compassion or consideration but for civil rights.  More close to the bone the stirrings in the black ghettos meant that the mayors in the different cities, in Boston and Chicago for example, were threatened in their little local patronage games by the new rights-demanding black poor.  The programme came to an end.  Representations were made to federal government to pull back and suddenly there was an intellectual response which was interesting &mdash; we spent all the money on the blacks but they made love differently and talk to their children differently; the mother in the family had a different influence from the mother in the white family.  The next stage was to suggest that no matter what you spent on the black poor they had a culture of their own which would also make them poor.  The last stage of the Pontius Pilate exercise was to say, &ldquo;We must encourage them to participate more in the white man's US world.&rdquo;  Poverty was over.  <i>Fortune</i> magazine had announced in 1964, &ldquo;There are no poor Americans.&rdquo;  Early in 1965 the American administration discovered a couple of million of them and it initiated what has been called the rediscovery of the poor in the US.  They established a programme. The programme worked and attempted to do certain things; it ran head on into the power structure of American society and it was abandoned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> This exercise in history is being repeated in Ireland.  The basis of my assertion is the following: in 1970 Séamus Ó Cinnéide published his book, <i>A Law For The Poor</i> which detailed the experience of those dependent on social welfare.  It made an attempt for the first time ever to establish a poverty line in Ireland, so as to begin the estimate of the number of the poor in Ireland.  It was followed by the 1971 conference in Kilkenny, the poverty conference at which everybody spoke who had been working with the poor, organised by the late Bishop Birch.  This was in turn followed by an all-day conference of the Economic and Social Research Institute, <i>Poverty in Ireland: Research Priorities</i> broadsheet No. 7, October 1972.</P>
    <P>A second conference was held in Kilkenny in 1974 to review progress made since 1973.  Much later there had been a major policy document published by the Labour Party in 1974.  After that schemes were established which became known and ended as the pilot schemes on combating poverty in Ireland.  These were abandoned and here the force of my parallel becomes clear.  They were abandoned because they were opposed by certain vested interests in our society, the privileged and those who held power.</P>
    <P>Some of the activities of the committee, as I explained in my speech of 31 March, were criticised by bishops, politicians and by regular members of the State.  Out went poverty exactly the same as in the United States.  The poor had been found in 1971, they did not make it as far as 1980.  In 1981 we had a tenth anniversary conference in Kilkenny which was characterised by another interesting aspect of our society which revealed the complete intellectual collapse of Irish social science.  One part of the seminar would hear from an economist who told us that we were all in a desperate state, we had no money to distribute and so on, that we must all live more abstemiously.  Then a social worker would be brought on giving us a biography of a poor person or a case history of a poor family.  There might even be two of those because the emphasis was on compassion.  Then it would be time to <Col N="695" /> have an economist again to remind you that you really could do nothing.  We had this schizophrenic presentation of the social sciences in Kilkenny in 1981.</P>
    <P>All this is relevant because it reveals a lack of capacity to be sincere or thorough in our approach to the problems of poverty. I challenge denial on this matter.  I think we have done exactly as they did in the United States &mdash; forget the poor, rediscover the poor, initiate the programme, abandon the programme, make assertions about the poor and then go on to something else.  We are going on to something else in this Bill.  Will we be having a definition of what constitutes self help?  Is the suggestion that there are some principles which are governable by the individuals themselves, by their own choices, by decisions that they can take unaided which will release them into the possibility of full participation in society? If this is so, it is hard to see the distance between that and something that is mentioned in the Minister's speech when he said he was leaving aside any questions of <i>laissez faire</i>.  Of course the point is made &mdash; and I do not want to distort what the Minister said &mdash; that there will be some assistance available and that people will not be consigned entirely to helping themselves.  I see in the concept of self help a residual notion that derives from a case approach towards understanding and trying to do something about poverty.</P>
    <P>Another concept that occurs several times throughout the Bill is community development.  I must make a confession here that I am nearly 20 years teaching sociology and I have never understood quite what people meant when they spoke about feelings of community.  It is one of the most imprecise concepts in sociology, now abandoned by most serious sociological theorists as being so vague as not to have any great theoretical utility.  But when you add on to it that other shaky term &ldquo;development&rdquo; and you have this new concept of community development, which occurs again and again throughout this measure, I find it very difficult to understand how you can say that you can pursue the theme of <Col N="696" /> poverty, try to discover structures within communities, try to address the question of unequal inequality in all its aspects and take a concept like community development. The idea is that a proportion of the population has moved on to set up an institutional matrix in which people participate and that other people can be brought along to participate in that.  But the very structure of the institutions of the privileged are creating the poverty of the less privileged.  The very nature of poverty is derived from the excessive possessions of the wealthy, the failure of the attitudes towards poorer people.  It is they who define the distance of the rich and that cannot be handled within a model of community development.  Perhaps we are going to make history theoretically in this country, that we are going to do something which has never been accomplished in the recorded world.  I will give some evidence about communities. People who go on ship cruises refer to themselves as a community. People who oppose itinerants refer to themselves as a community.  The European economic partners refer to themselves as a community when they want to discuss economics.  That is what I meant by saying that the term &ldquo;community&rdquo; is vague and its vagueness will establish a distance between the reality of poverty and the measures that are necessary to eliminate its source &mdash; inequality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eileen Desmond, in introducing the attitude of response of our party towards this Bill, made a number of points which are important and to which I will return.  There are attitudes here &mdash; present even in the debates of this House &mdash; which more or less suggest that nobody is poor in Ireland any more.  I have heard this statement made.  Deputy Desmond referred to a survey carried out by the European Economic Community in March 1977.  Only 19 per cent of those interviewed in Ireland felt that poverty was due to injustice within society, whereas 30 per cent felt it was due to laziness.  A further 25 per cent believed it was due to misfortune.  Although these views were expressed by a small random sample of the population, they do represent the current views of Irish people. <Col N="697" /> They pose a very serious challenge to anyone attempting to find long-term solutions to the problem of poverty.  We are in possession of a set of attitudes towards poverty in Ireland which seems to betray a certain amount of compassion towards the extremities of social distress, that part of poverty which we can say is acute social distress.  A cynic would suggest that, if the very worst sections of the poor would stay away from the streets, there would be less attention paid to them and it would ease the consciences of some people.  I summarised these attitudes when I spoke on 31 March in this House. I said these attitudes revealed that we were pretty high on compassion but low on justice.  Will this Bill attack this set of attitudes?  Will it go beyond the point of compassion to suggest that justice demands that we make progress along the theme of equality or will it contribute to the smugness of those who are benefiting from inequality?  Will it simply encourage them to go beyond compassion in terms of donations and ask that, instead of giving an increment of money, to give an increment of time in dealing with the poor?  Will it leave the distance between the privileged and the poor intact?  I would love to be wrong in this matter.  However, I see nothing in the Bill which will challenge that set of attitudes.</P>
    <P>To take up the point behind these attitudes about poverty, at least those people who are offering this opinion as to why there is poverty in Ireland represent considerable progress on those who believe there are no poor at all.  That attitude is also prevalent.  It has been suggested again and again that the State cannot afford all these spongers that exist, these people who insist on presenting themselves for benefit.</P>
    <P>I pose another question.  Does our attitude express concern about matters such as food, shelter, access to education, health and is this to be defined in terms of what we can afford to spend or are we to say that the existence of these needs among an expanding population means that we have to question the structure of society, of the institutions, to see if we can provide for this population in an <Col N="698" /> adequate matter?  I am afraid we continue to evade these questions.  It would not be relevant in a discussion on this Bill to talk about the manner in which we have evaded the problem of unemployment and homelessness.  I am not making this point in a partisan way, but I do not think we have any conception of the scale of housing needs or unemployment.</P>
    <P>Equally, we are avoiding the reality of poverty.  At a political level I am not surprised that the poor are not represented in this House except marginally. One would not expect from the people who now hold power in Ireland a commitment to remove poverty in a structural way, changing the institutions, changing the Constitution if necessary.  It is interesting that nobody is rushing to change the Constitution on behalf of the poor. On behalf of whom are we rushing to change the Constitution, and do they represent a vulnerable minority or majority, whatever they are, within our community?</P>
    <P>Therefore, the powerless can look with very little hope to an institution such as this.  Indeed, it is interesting that rather than these institutions being the resource of the poor and the powerless, something to which they might look to change their position, the poor in fact have become the resource of the politicians.  They were the resource of politicians when the State began.  People took poor housing here and we had the poor, the potential emigrants, and we were going to do something for all of them.  They were the backs upon which conservative politicians in the early days climbed to power in the Irish Republic.</P>
    <P>Equally, today within the constituency system, for Deputies and Senators the poor are the clients of brokers within a client political system.  They are the people whose poverty can be kept separate, discreet and private, so that they are broken up and so that the homeless will never stand shoulder to shoulder, or the unemployed stand shoulder to shoulder, or those who are dissatisfied with the operations of the State stand shoulder to shoulder: they are all being given individual prescriptions from their political saints, and these political prescriptions, <Col N="699" /> if I might mix metaphors, manage to defuse the impact and effect of poverty in society.</P>
    <P>This is not accidental.  As I have said, the poor cannot look to the institutions that refuse to look with any confidence at structures and the relationship of economic institutions to jobs.  On the other hand, these problems generate the fodder for conservative politics.  In saying that, I wish to draw attention to something else.  Let us not argue about the precise nature of the figures.  Many people have spent a great deal of time and effort asking whether Séamus O' Cinnéide's figures were accurate &mdash; if he had drawn the line differently would he have got different numbers of people above or below the line?  The fact is that by taking simple social welfare criteria he was able to show that we would probably have one child in five, one household in four, below the poverty line in the seventies. Arguments about precise volume are irrelevant.</P>
    <P>It is 11 years after the 1971 Kilkenny Conference.  Have we changed the attitudes of the privileged and the powerful towards the poor and the powerless? Have we changed the realities of poverty? Have we changed the prospects for the children of the poor?  Have we changed objectives in relation to the proportion? Have we changed attitudes, institutions and structures?  We will be able to say historically that institutionally we responded by setting up programmes that were experimental, later to lead to a systematic attack on inequality in its various forms, but we abandoned the effort.  We looked back on those people, who have time and kind compassionate natures, to look after the poor.  We decided we would invite them to extend their concern.  The Bill proposed to achieve this transition uses phrases like `community development', `self-help' and `social deprivation'.  Not once does it use words such as `inequality', thereby avoiding structures, and therefore it leaves the privileged happy.</P>
    <P>I will refer to another myth which I did not have the opportunity to do when we were proposing here the establishment of <Col N="700" /> any effective agency which would have taken the place of this proposed one if my party had any influence on the position. The explanatory memorandum with the Bill refers less than public discussion to poverty.  It is sometimes assumed that we are dealing with a section of the population who are poor and about whom something can be done.  The evidence contradicts this: the poor are not one component section of the population. Poverty is something that happens in the course of a lifetime.  People are not poor only at a certain stage of their lives: they move into poverty when there is the greatest strain on an inadequate income, when there is inadequate housing, and they move out of poverty when their children have dispersed.  It is a stage of the life cycle.  Incidentally, we knew that in 1893 when the British studied poverty. This was brought to our attention in the late seventies by Professor Damian Hannan of the ESRI in a fine study on life cycle and poverty.</P>
    <P>There is the question of whether a voluntary agency can be assisted to help the poor.  I want to say positively why I worry about this and why I believe it cannot be done.  The experience of poverty in a typical household &mdash; hundreds of social workers can tell us this &mdash; may begin by the unemployment of the principal breadwinner.  It may become complicated immediately thereafter by the fact that the people are in rented accommodation and this leads to the creation of a housing problem.  In relation to food, nutrition, choices have to be made.  It affects the nutrition of children.  Children, badly fed and clothed, will participate less in the school system.  Over-crowding can lead to devalued relationships between children and parents and children will escape to the streets.  Suddenly, they are in trouble with the law.</P>
    <P>In every aspect of the State services &mdash; employment, housing, education, justice and health &mdash; there is proven evidence of the difference in experience between those who are poor and unemployed and those who do not share these characteristics.  Bear in mind the poverty related to unemployment.  Is it a great <Col N="701" /> mark of sophistication in our Republic to see the unemployed queueing at employment exchanges, waiting to be interviewed at hatches and have their number called or to see those without houses being told by the most junior members of the public service that there is nothing for them?  We have a unique feature in our public service &mdash;it is a kind one basically &mdash; where older people are promoted. They go upstairs and away from the public.  The poor find themselves being treated dismissively.</P>
    <P>As regards education, I teach in an institution where a tiny proportion of the children of working class families participate. Those of us who have participated in institutions which have benefited from public money must continually bear in mind that we were supported by the taxes of those who are now disenfranchised. Will this Bill give greater hope to those who are unemployed in their dealings with the State?  To give an example, when one is buying a house speculatively one sits down in an open plan office with the person who is selling the house.  One is treated with great courtesy even though one's needs may not be involved but merely one's idle curiosity.  Compare that with one who has his or her prospects completely shattered by unemployment. They will be treated in dreary, drab places.  Successive Governments have failed to do anything about this.  All it needs is a few coats of paint, demolish the hatches and break down the barriers between the people administering the dole and those receiving it.  Even if we never accept our full responsibility to explain to people why they cannot be housed or have shelter given to them, we should not ask them to queue with go-cars and keep their children waiting while their files are opened and different bits of bureaucracy are related to them sometimes courteously and sometimes not.</P>
    <P>Bills such as this one give the idea that the structure of society is a good one which will serve us and can be made by us to serve the poor.  I question that and categorically deny it.  This State was founded with the rhetoric of concern for the poor.  Many people who served in this House in the early days could speak <Col N="702" /> about a Dublin which had the worst tenements in Europe and child illnesses which were higher than any other city in Europe.  They were moved to do something about poverty.  Today we have taken a version of our society and have put it into our heads as the only known world that might ever be.  It finds itself in Bills like this.  It is comforting to the privileged society and those who have.  It is cold to the poor, the powerless, the homeless and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>In relation to other aspects of the experience of the poor in our society which will not be helped by a Bill like this, we have two health systems.  We have one which is suitable for poor people but can be avoided by those who do not need to depend on it.  The second version is the private health system which is private only in relation to the remuneration funded by the public and tax-payers and to the income it generates. The poor suffer a great deal of bewilderment in relation to their illnesses.  In relation to the areas where there is poverty I ask myself will there be more confidence and a breakdown of dependency? Instead of seeing physical illness as one part of a chain of deprivation, will they break out of it?  I am not so confident that they will.</P>
    <P>What we have to put up with in relation to the administration of justice is a scandal. If being poor means one is badly housed, participates unequally in education, is unemployed and has a diminished social environment one is socially deprived.  Does one find the system of justice operating to reduce the distance between the people coming before it and their children or does one see the opposite? Does one see those who are privileged to be sitting in judgment on the poor seeking to understand them and the distance between them and the people coming before them?  Does one hear them giving homilies and lectures as if poverty was something one had chosen? I do not believe the existing society is a perfect ensemble of attitudes, beliefs and models of the world and it is only a matter of its concern being extended like a shadow to take over those less fortunate. We create the less fortunate by refusing <Col N="703" /> to plan the economy, by refusing to deal with financial institutions and by refusing to structure housing to provide shelter; in education, by not getting rid of the daft notion that everyone must participate before the age of 20, by not committing ourselves to continuing education, by not heading off the troubles of the young among the poor before they get to the judgment part of the justice system and by not looking at our health system and saying that it exists to care for the ill and not to prop up privilege and incomes which should be a scandal in any civilised society.</P>
    <P>If we do not accept the responsibility of looking at our society critically in terms of structure we will refuse to face up to the problem of equality.  If one leaves that, one finds oneself speaking about community care, community development and extension of services to encompass the poor.  It is a poor alternative but it is better than lack of concern.  It would be welcomed by me and by others.  It does not address the question of poverty. It is easy to say that if the poor are not responding they have some pathological trait which diminishes their capacity to participate equally in society.  In our motion at the end of March, which would have led to legislation, we wanted to decrease dependency and give confidence to people to see themselves in the State not as people who have any defect but as participants in society as equal citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the fuel variation levy in electricity accounts be discontinued in view of (1) the glut in oil supplies and the consequent lowering of heavy fuel oil prices, and (2) the adequate supply of natural gas to the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of electricity in Ireland has <Col N="704" /> been described as being among the world's highest.  Indeed, in a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 20 June 1981 it was said that an American consultant had found that Ireland's electricity was the third most expensive amongst a range of countries surpassed only by Britain and Belgium. That does and has posed serious problems for domestic, commercial and, perhaps most of all, industrial consumers.</P>
    <P>In the past two years or so our electricity costs have been subjected to serious criticism by industrialists and the public in general.  It is a fact also that the hydrocarbon tax in force adds to the cost of each unit of electricity &mdash; I understand, approximately 4 per cent.  The rise in the price of electricity over the past two years have been very substantial.  I understand that the price increases allowed in 1980 were of the order of 40 per cent, some 20.5 per cent in February and 19.5 per cent in September of that year.  In the year 1981 an increase of 25 per cent was granted, coming into effect in September of that year and affecting the August/September accounting period. The 1981 price increase was sanctioned by the last Government of which I was Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy.  The rise sanctioned on that occasion had to be of that proportion because the Fianna Fáil Administration, from February 1981 to the time of the election, had refused to allow the Electricity Supply Board any price increase.  The then Minister, Deputy Colley, communicated with the board saying that there would be a Government subsidy to defray the loss of revenue.  It is clearly understood that the board of the ESB did not want subsidisation but rather to be financially sound without recourse to State subvention.  It is interesting to note that part of that 25 per cent increase &mdash; I think approximately 8 per cent thereof &mdash; was earmarked simply to recoup to the board approximately £30 million lost during the period February to end September that year.  Indeed, that 8 per cent was to obtain for a period of a year only, to be withdrawn thereafter.</P>
    <P>We are due for a reduction in the cost <Col N="705" /> of electricity.  In that context I was surprised to read recently &mdash; I think in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 23 May 1982 &mdash; that the ESB had applied to the National Prices Commission for a rise of approximately 6½ per cent in the basic price of electricity. At the time of sanctioning the 25 per cent increase my stern warning to the ESB was that there should be no further price increase for a period of one year.  I take it that the present Minister will take cognisance of that fact.  It was a stern warning to the board that I did not expect any further price increase for a period of one year.  Allied to that one must understand that Members on this side of the House would expect that that 8 per cent &mdash; sanctioned as a temporary price increase &mdash; be used to reduce the price of electricity to consumers.  I must put that fact on the record.  I am sure the Minister is aware of it but I would hope that he would insist that a reduction of 8 per cent be effected and indeed that the price of electricity be seen to decrease rather than increase. Electricity sales are directed more or less in the proportions of 50 per cent to domestic, 25 per cent to industrial and the remaining 25 per cent to commercial consumers.  Therefore, while the bulk goes to domestic consumers, any adverse change in the price of electricity is damaging right across the board.</P>
    <P>The amount of dependence on oil is interesting and has been decreasing substantially. Last year the board used approximately 54 per cent oil in the generation of electricity as opposed to other sources of primary energy.  It is intended that that percentage should fall to approximately 40 per cent by the end of the eighties.  Of course that policy is in line with the EEC one of diversification away from dependence on oil, which is to be welcomed.  The fact now is that the price of oil has been reducing substantially over the past few months, a reduction which came about quite suddenly. Here I should like to quote some statistics I received from PIW of 12 April 1982 from a table entitled &ldquo;The Ups and Downs of OPEC Prices, 1960 to 1982&rdquo;. I am taking the spot price for Mid-East light crude &mdash; 34 dollars &mdash; as being indicative of the type of oil used by the Electricity <Col N="706" /> Supply Board.  The average price per barrel of that crude in 1981 turned around at 34,1725 dollars.  In January of 1982 the price was 34 dollars per barrel, in February it had dropped to 30.40 dollars per barrel and, by March, had dipped again to 28.20 dollars per barrel, constituting a substantial fall in the price of crude oil.  Based primarily on that fact I feel that by now electricity consumers should be benefiting from the collapse in oil prices.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that the board are taking a quantity of heavy fuel oil from the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, but I do not think the volume of that offtake will seriously affect the price of oil at this point in time.  I feel we should now be benefiting from the collapse in the price of oil.  It is evident that the price of oil from the North Sea has fallen and this should aid the oil supply position as far as the ESB are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am surprised to see in the monthly report of the National Prices Commission, No. 113 of January 1982, in paragraph (5) that in their projections for 1982-83 they state the board are anticipating an increase in their total fuel cost bill.  In the case of fuel oil they state that the board have forecast an average price for 1982-83 slightly above the average 1981-82 price.  I take it that when the fuel variation charge is reviewed this month by the National Prices Commission cognisance will be taken by the commission of the substantial fall in oil prices since the beginning of this year and since the publication of the January 1982 report.</P>
    <P>The other prong of the motion refers to the availability of gas.  I am aware that at the moment the gas supply to the ESB is at the Cork Plant at Aghada.  It is interesting to note in the appendix relating to the particulars and performance of generating plants of the Electricity Supply Board's Fifty-Fourth Annual Report for year ending 31 March 1982, that the fuel cost per unit for electricity sent out from Aghada was 1.452p per unit and that the works cost per unit sent out was 1.689p per unit.  This was a very cheap source of electricity.  During my period in office the ESB were allowed a larger off-take to help them to be competitive.  In <Col N="707" /> comparison, in Great Island, County Wexford, we find that the fuel cost per unit sent out was 2.710p per unit and the works cost per unit was 3.165p per unit, which is substantially in excess of the gas-fired stations.</P>
    <P>I am seriously worried about the Ringsend generating station where the fuel cost per unit sent out was 3.630p and the works cost per unit was 5.912p.  That is an oil-fired station and in the context of the cost of generating electricity an explanation is owed to the House for that cost per unit at Ringsend, which seems to be very high.</P>
    <P>When we take account of the fact that there has been a solid reduction from 34p to 28p in spot prices and the fact that the ESB have a greater offtake agreement for natural gas from Bord Gáis Eireann, those lower prices for the cost of generating electricity and the cost of electricity generated from oil should be publicly manifested in the price of electricity to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the ESB are currently converting the Poolbeg Station at a cost of £3 million to take natural gas when it comes on-stream at the end of this year.  I see that as a priority.  I am pleased to note, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19 January, 1982, that Professor Dillon, speaking to the Rotary Club in Dublin, predicted that next year natural gas will replace imported oil in supplying the major portion of the ESB's total fuel requirements for electricity generation. While I accept it is in the future it must be a source of confidence that the benefits of natural gas will become apparent in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I also note from an <i>Irish Times</i> report of 13 May 1982 that Mr. Seán Tinney, the director of advance projects at the ESB, said that the board were only too conscious of the level of price increases in electricity.  He said that the board realised that industry needed to be assured not only about supplies but also about price stability.  He said that the whole of the ESB is at present focused on a corporate priority to achieve far more price stability in the eighties than was possible in the past decade.  He said <Col N="708" /> that the target is to achieve an annual price inflation considerably lower than the national level as measured by the consumer price index.  It seems that we are going into a period of price stability. It is essential for Irish industry and agriculture as well as for domestic consumers that the price of electricity should be more competitive than it is at the moment and that maximum advantage is taken of the lowering of oil prices and the availability of natural gas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the price of natural gas, I fully appreciate that a pricing policy should be set down.  I am not sure if it has been finalised in the Department.  I realise that natural gas cannot be given away, that a pricing policy must be one that is to the best benefit of the people. It is within the power of the Minister and the Government to control the price of natural gas and to ensure that its price to the ESB is such that it will remain cheaper in the energy sense than the cost of higher energy sources such as oil and perhaps such as coal.</P>
    <P>I am comforted in this matter by the fact that reserves at Kinsale are higher than what were forecast originally. Proven reserves began at one trillion cubic feet and the figure was later upgraded to 1.35 trillion.  That is encouraging. When I was Minister of State I directed that a further examination be made of the reserves and I am optimistic that on foot of those tests the reserves at Kinsale will prove to be higher than the present estimate.  Though I may be somewhat on the optimistic side, I am hoping that the consultants' report will show that the reserves are nearer to the two trillion cubic feet figure.  When we discussed this matter here last week the Minister told us that the question of the reserves must be treated as confidential.  I cannot see any validity for that argument.  These reserves of gas are the property of the people and if they turn out to be higher than previously estimated surely we should be pleased to give the public that information.</P>
    <P>Now that a deal has been finalised regarding the supply of natural gas to Northern Ireland it is important that the reserves be stated.  The implication of <Col N="709" /> supplying gas to the North is interesting. We are talking about a finite reserve.  I am aware of the intended off-take to the various sectors of the community and I appreciate fully that in the case of a finite reserve a choice must be made as between users.  Therefore, it is important to find out exactly what the reserves are. It is only by having that information that we can finally establish a policy of off-take and of prices.</P>
    <P>Regarding the ESB situation, I am pleased that the board's generating capacity will be based on natural gas as the primary source of supply.  I understand that about 55 per cent of the board's generating capacity will be by way of natural gas.  When we consider the availability of this resource it is important to ensure that ultimately the consumer will be the one to benefit from the availability of the gas and that its price is not kept artificially high.  A balance must be struck and it must be struck in favour of the consumer, the consumer being the Irish nation.  To date, though, there has not been evidence of price benefit to the consumer. I do not know whether this is because the amount of natural gas available is not of sufficient significance to justify a reduction in electricity costs; but it is clear from the annual report of the ESB that the availability of the gas is having an impact and that impact, allied to the impact which has resulted from the lowering of crude oil prices, is seen in pricing policy.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly also to the structure of the fuel variation charge. This charge was introduced in January 1974, was discontinued in July 1978 but reintroduced in January 1980.  The current domestic rate for electricity is 4.36p per unit and the fuel variation charge is 2.017p per unit.  In other words, the fuel variation charge represents 46.26 per cent of domestic electricity costs.  I do not think it was ever envisaged that this charge should be at such a level <i>vis-á-vis</i> the fixed charge.  As I understand it, the fuel variation charge was introduced in order to allow some flexibility to the ESB whereby they could vary the charge without having recourse to the NPC on every occasion on which the price of oil <Col N="710" /> changed.  In the history of this charge it has never before been at such a high level.  There is no justification for this situation.  We should have a pricing policy for electricity whereby the price increase would be on an annual review basis.  The fuel variation charge should be used only as a mechanism in times of rapid changes in the price of oil.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we view the likely trend in oil prices, it is important that we do not over use the fuel variation charge.  In this context I would refer to the likely situation in the future in respect of oil prices.  In an article in <i>The Financial Times</i> of 26 March, the chief economist of the International Energy Agency is quoted as forecasting that there will be a continuous decline in the real price of crude oil in the next three years.  That analysis is interesting.  The economies of western Europe seem to be in a stagnant mood with a growth rate this year of about ½ per cent.  If we consider this trend in oil prices continuing to fall or even of stabilising, we cannot find any justification for the continuation of the fuel variation charge.  That is why I say that this charge should be dropped now.  We are not in a situation in which the price of oil is changing rapidly or in which the board must increase prices immediately so as to avoid the loss of huge amounts of revenue.</P>
    <P>There is little justification, based on the forecasts of the price of oil, for continuing the fuel variation charge.  The Minister may say that we should keep it on for a while longer, but I do not think there is any justification for retaining it. We are entering a period of price stability for electricity.  That stability is soundly based on the fall in the price of oil, the availability of natural gas, and the fact that there does not appear to be any surge in the economies of Europe or the US now or in the immediate future.  In making that statement I am relying on the opinions of experts.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the workings of the board.  The ESB are responsible for supplying power to our homes, our factories and farms.  Earlier this year a comprehensive agreement was reached between management and employees.  It <Col N="711" /> was a fairly expensive agreement and one hopes that as a result of it we will not have any further lapses in the supply of electricity to the nation.  For the staff the agreement was financially attractive, but I must question the need for it.  While the electricity generating industry is important &mdash; it is a monopoly and has a vital role to play in keeping our economy going &mdash; I doubt if employees in any semi-State body, no matter how delicate an area they serve in, should be treated any better than those in any other area. For instance, the Garda and the Army have an income level that is not excessive, but the staff of the ESB got a special comprehensive agreement about which I had reservations when it happened.  It had been concluded when I came to office.  The man sweeping the street is doing just as essential a service as the man who turns the switch in a generating station.  I can see now why there cannot be any grounds for industrial disputes within the ESB.  They have a comprehensive agreement and their incomes are generous compared to other workers.  It would be a sad day for the State, and for the ESB, if we were to have a spate of industrial disputes such as occurred in the past.</P>
    <P>The board have a responsibility to be efficient and that is important in a period when electricity usage has fallen &mdash; it fell, according to the annual report for 1981-82, by about 8 per cent and the board envisages a further reduction in consumption this year.  I am aware that the board have major capital commitments such as the Moneypoint and Poolbeg projects and the new crow-coal station in County Leitrim.  But the board have a responsibility at a time when electricity consumption is stabilising or, as in this instance, is falling, to ensure that they are not overmanned.  While I understand that the lead time into any major capital programme is flexible, the board must ensure that responsible decisions are taken about further capital expenditure. Obviously, they cannot be caught.  If there is an upsurge in the economy it is important to have the necessary reserves, but when we have natural gas that can be <Col N="712" /> done by switching in and out from that source.</P>
    <P>The board have a responsibility to ensure that their workers are carrying out their tasks efficiently and that the price of electricity is at its most competitive level as a source of energy.</P>
    <P>In July 1978 the fuel variation charge was dropped and the time has come to do away with that charge again.  It is far too high in proportion to the total cost of electricity.  The price of oil has fallen sufficiently to make an impact on the cost of generating electricity and the increased availability of natural gas should combine to ensure that a price reduction can be made.  Allied to that is the fact that in the 25 per cent increase granted in July last year was a figure of approximately 8 per cent which was given for one year only.  That was designed to help the ESB recoup revenue losses incurred from February to September 1981.  That should be withdrawn before the next billing period, August to September. That would mean a reduction of approximately 8 per cent in the cost of electricity.  I am perturbed that the board have applied for a further price increase. I do not think they can justify it and I have outlined the reasons why.  There is no reason why there should not be a reduction in the cost of electricity and now is the time to remove the fuel variation charge.</P>

      <P>I should like to clear up a few points in case there is any confusion before I go on to deal in detail with the subject raised in the motion, something which concerns us all.  I can understand Deputy Collins' approach to this subject. Understandably, he made a few nice arguments which he hoped would hold water.  I should like to deal with his reference to the 25 per cent increase granted last year.  The Deputy said it was a condition of the granting of the increase to the ESB that there would not be any further increase for 12 months.  The Deputy has nodded, so I take it I have interpreted him correctly.  To put the record straight, if that was the case I am surprised that the Government did not <Col N="713" /> make it a condition of granting the 25 per cent increase, which they did not do.</P>
      <P>Secondly the question of subsidies was raised.  This is a new phenomenon to some extent.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government I was a member of the Cabinet and I remember that we said at that time that because of the movement in oil prices and the trends that were apparently there at the start of the year we were prepared to wait until the end of the year to see if oil prices had stabilised, look at the situation with the ESB and come to grips with it.  Our views on the matter were borne out very shortly afterwards when the ESB returned a profit of up to £6 million.  If the Government intended to make this the excuse for saying that the ESB should not have a price increase, this is the first anyone has heard of it except Deputy Collins.  The record shows that there is no decision whatever conditional that the ESB would not be applying for any price increase within the 12 months.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins quoted spot prices on the market which we know are volatile. The whole oil market is volatile to some extent, but Deputy Collins quotes spot prices and spot prices only.  The ESB buy heavy fuel oil at spot-related prices, but Deputy Collins, making the argument correctly from his side of the House, would say that he did not take into consideration the currency fluctuations. Bearing in mind that the price we pay for oil is in dollars and taking the currency fluctuation into consideration, then you see the real position and the fluctuation that he talks about is much less than he tries to make out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty whatsoever in accepting the principle of the motion which reflects my own thinking and foreshadows the outcome of measures which I have already initiated.  Within weeks of assuming my responsibilities as Minister for Industry and Energy I made it one of my priorities to look at the usefulness or otherwise of the surcharge to see whether it might be timely to remove it from the ESB accounts.  Among the factors which have prompted me to look at it has been the fact that in recent times the market for fuel oil has tended to stabilise.  In <Col N="714" /> addition the ESB have for some years embarked on a policy of diversification of sources for the generation of electricity. I heard other comparisons made here in relation to the unit cost, taking various stations.  I am sure that the House would like to be fully aware that gas used by the ESB was used in Cork only and when you talk about drawing a unit price from various other stations you have to do it accurately and professionally and not take a figure out of the air and make it a common price.  Deputy Collins knows quite well that electricity generated from gas is reflected even at this time in 1p cheaper per unit than would be the case if gas was not used &mdash; I did not hear him make that point either &mdash; therefore, the fuel variation surcharge which has been in existence for over ten years by now was a vital mechanism when increases in the price of fuels were sharp and frequent, particularly with heavy fuel oil which at that time was the main fuel used by the ESB in the generation of electricity.  This had very serious financial implications for the ESB.  The surcharge, therefore, was a necessary mechanism to enable the board to recover the cost as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>At present heavy fuel oil accounts for about 40 per cent of the electricity generated by the board.  As recently as 1978 fuel oil accounted for two-thirds of electricity generated.  The reduction came about through a policy decision by both the Government and the ESB to diversify away from fuel oil and towards increased uses of indigenous resources.  Obviously peat and hydro have played an important part in this, but the most significant contribution has come from the use of natural gas which now represents over one-third of electricity generated.  In this situation, with the lessening of the ESB's reliance on heavy fuel, a reliance which will continue to decrease probably to less than 30 per cent by the end of the decade, clearly it is opportune to consider the removal of the fuel variation mechanism. I have had very many consultations with the ESB on this subject and I hope to be in a position to make a formal announcement on the matter within the next day or two.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> A further significant development is in the board's annual price contract review. In recent years the price increases which have been implemented have been very high, for instance 25 per cent last year and similar figures in the previous years. One of my major policy objectives is to see that any necessary increases in ESB charges will be kept to single percentage figures.  From my consultations with the board and senior executives of the ESB I am pleased to say that I have their full support in this approach.  Therefore, while I cannot say too much at this stage, I am confident that the figure which will emerge from this year's contract review will be far more modest than anything we have experienced in recent years.  I am equally confident that this single figure achievement will be repeated in future years.  This will bring the benefit to the industrial consumer and the consumer in general of stability in electricity prices together with any absorption of the FVC into basic tariffs.  This will mean that consumers will have to contend with only a single price adjustment a year and that adjustment in single percentage figures. I see the Deputy nodding his approval.  It is the right road to go.  He knows it, I know it and the House knows it and I am sure he must be asking himself why he did not do something about it.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in industry in general arising from the high cost of electricity are of primary concern to me.  I have received numerous representations from individual firms and organisations on the matter.  This is one of the topics that I have been discussing with the ESB in the consultations I have already mentioned. I am anxious that some relief would be given to industry, at least in so far as the electricity surcharge is concerned, and the ESB are carrying out a review on this and will be reporting back to me in the very near future.</P>
    <P>This motion also refers to a glut in oil supplies and a consequent lowering of heavy fuel oil prices.  Recent references to falling oil prices concerned principally crude oil and some of the more expensive oil products.  In particular the references have been to the dollar price of these <Col N="716" /> fuels.  Of course the ESB are faced with paying for their fuel oil in IR£ and must, therefore, take account of exchange rate movements.  When these are taken into account a different picture emerges.  The price of the residual fuel oil in IR£ has remained almost constant since the end of 1980.  Clearly it is not realistic to expect any reduction in electricity prices from this source.  Indeed, there are indications that with the easing of the world recession oil demands may begin to pick up again over the next year with a corresponding hardening in oil prices.  I have heard references to reductions in oil prices and I am sure that the Deputy and the House have been aware only in the last day or so of an announcement from the British National Oil Corporation of an increase of $2.5 a barrel.  A close watch on the spot market over the last while reveals that it also has tended to harden.  When we look at the picture let us look at every side of it realistically and then come out with a decision that is right.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a marked swing towards state to state oil deals.  This is reflected in the purchasing pattern of world oil production.  In 1978 the major oil companies accounted for some 60 per cent of total oil purchases. In 1980 this figure had dropped to 49 per cent.  Simultaneously direct Government purchases rose from approximately 15 per cent in 1978 to 25 per cent in 1980. Purchases by the smaller oil companies and spot market deals make up the balance.</P>
    <P>It was in recognition of this increasing trend on the part of oil-producing states to deal directly with oil-consuming countries having their own national oil companies that the Irish National Petroleum Corporation were established in July 1979 pursuant to Government decision. The INPC have contributed to Ireland's security of supplies by entering into supply contracts for crude oil.  In October 1979 a contract was signed with the Iraq National Oil Corporation for the supply of 500,000 tonnes of crude oil in the year commencing March 1980.  However, the instability of the world oil supply situation soon manifested itself and the outbreak of hostilities between Iran and Iraq <Col N="717" /> resulted in supplies from Iraq being subject to <i>force majeure</i>.  At present the INPC have one supply contract with the Saudi Arabian State Oil Company which was entered into in April 1980 and which provides for a crude oil supply equivalent to 500,000 tonnes per annum.  This contract ran until December 1980 but incorporated a roll-over provision.  The INPC are currently exploring the possibility of acquiring additional sources of crude oil supply to enhance further our security of supply and to provide the crude oil necessary for operation of the Whitegate oil refinery which the Government recently purchased and which the INPC as State agents will operate.</P>
    <P>The Whitegate oil refinery, in State ownership, will when operational in July-August of this year represent a very important element in our efforts to reduce our country's vulnerability to oil supply disruptions and to the economic and social effects of such disruptions. With Whitegate in operation the INPC will supply some 35 per cent of our total national oil requirements.  I need not overstate the significance of such a development. With the enhancement and development of the INPC's role and stature in the Irish oil market, it is my intention to bring before the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity the legislation necessary to put the INPC on a statutory footing and to assign to them the powers, responsibility and capital structures necessary to carry out their work.</P>
    <P>The motion also includes reference to natural gas.  The ESB have played an important part in the development of the Kinsale gas field.  They were one of the few organisations which could take gas in sufficient quantities at the outset to make early development of this field possible. The benefits of allocation of natural gas to the ESB are obvious.  It provided revenue to Bord Gáis Éireann of about £45 million in 1981 and an expected £70 million in 1982, according to ESB estimates. Savings in fuel costs to the ESB have been about £45 million in 1981 and are expected to be about £55 million in 1982. The overall effect is that ESB prices to the consumer are currently about 10 per cent lower than they would otherwise be. <Col N="718" /> Deputy Collins referred to the revaluation of the gas field which last year showed that the reserves stood at 1.35 trillion cubic feet and that they were 35 per cent higher than previously estimated. Studies have shown that it is now economically viable to embark on a policy of development of the total national gas grid to exploit the premium market in high density population areas.  This will give the consumer the benefit of direct use of gas at keen prices.  It will maximise revenue to Bord Gáis Éireann from sales of gas and will also maximise savings on imports as natural gas will ultimately replace significant imports of fuel oil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also referred to the revaluation of the reserves at Kinsale which is at present taking place.  While I would like to think that his optimism in this would be justified, nevertheless I feel I must sound some note of warning that the information available to me from the preliminary work does not point in that direction.  However, we will wait for the final valuation.</P>
    <P>Already agreement has been reached to sell gas to the Dublin Gas Company and also to the North of Ireland.  The House will be aware that last Friday at a meeting in Stormont Castle between Mr. Adam Butler and myself we reached agreement on all the headings concerned in this very complicated gas supply contract for the North of Ireland.  While Deputy Collins has expressed some reservations about the quantities of gas which may be sold to the North of Ireland, I am quite satisfied that the present reserves off Kinsale Head give no major cause of concern in this area.  In total the 20-year contract would represent something in the region of 12 per cent of the known reserves.  This will also give us access to the development of premium markets on which we are embarked.  Development of the premium market in other areas of the country such as Limerick and Waterford is under consideration but it will take some time to develop such markets to their full potential.  During this intervening period surplus gas supplies from the contracted amount available from the Kinsale field will be allocated for electricity generation and heavy industrial <Col N="719" /> use where an economic price can be paid. This will maximise the economic and financial return from investments in gas pipelines.  Thus gas will be available to the ESB for some years ahead in quantities sufficient to have a significant beneficial effect on savings to the ESB and on electricity prices to the consumer.  The coming on stream in 1986 of coal-fired electricity generating plant should produce a continued stabilising effect on electricity prices.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the Cork-Dublin gas pipeline project is well under way and work is expected to be completed by December.  Construction of the pipeline from the Dublin city gate into Dublin Gas and the ESB is expected to commence later this month and to be completed by next December also.  Consumers in Dublin can expect to be using Irish natural gas from the end of January next and they will have the opportunity of benefiting from the very considerable savings I announced within the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>Many of the arguments pursued are understandable coming from Opposition benches.  This is an area about which we are all concerned.  The fuel variation charge has been a bone of contention for many years and I have no difficulty in accepting the principle of the motion because it is in line not only with my thinking but with the thinking of the Government.  I have already said that I will be making a formal announcement about the situation within the next two weeks.  The matter becomes very complicated when one pulls out figures and looks at indexes and at questions of how various prices should be fixed.  It is also difficult to forecast the volatility of the oil market.  Nevertheless, I have made it abundantly clear that on taking office my first objective was to come to grips with this problem and I did that.  A considerable amount of work has been done and it is now coming to fruition.  The right decision will be made at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get into an argument here in relation to the various statistics that have been produced but from the <Col N="720" /> information I have and the index I have seen in relation to spot oil prices as converted into punts it is obvious that the huge fluctuations referred to have not occurred.  I am not producing that as an argument but merely wish to correct the record.</P>
    <P>When people make comparisons regarding gas produced by the ESB from heavy fuel oil, they must remember it is only used in Cork at the moment.  I am sure the Deputy opposite is aware that there is inefficiency and the Government are anxious to ensure that there is an improvement in efficiency where the ESB are using natural gas.  There is a severe limitation in the present situation in that the gas can be used only in the Cork area. The sooner we get the pipeline to bring the gas here the better.  Plans are on target and Cork is going ahead at the rate of approximately one mile per day.  The quicker we can deliver the gas to the Dublin area the quicker we will get more efficiency in the system.  This will be of benefit to the consumers.</P>
    <P>People talk about fluctuations in price but it is well to remember what fluctuations have occurred and what fluctuations have not occurred in the price of heavy fuel oil.  I do not want to bore the House by reading out the statistics for each quarter.  There is stability in the price of heavy fuel oil but the same cannot be said in respect of gas.  My officials put in considerable work on studying the prices of gas and petrol when I took over as Minister for Energy.  The House will recall that when taxation increases were imposed in the budget they were neutralised by a reduction in petrol prices. When Whitegate oil refinery closed last summer everyone realised a premium had to be paid on fuel prices in that refinery.  In fact, that was the situation from the begining when the refinery came into operation in 1959.  It was reasonable to expect a reduction in oil prices after the closure of Whitegate but we did not see any such reduction.</P>
    <P>When Whitegate comes on-stream towards the end of July or the beginning of August it will be well to remember that a premium will have to be paid for <Col N="721" /> security of supply.  If I want to take out a security on my own life I must pay an insurance premium.  If we want to secure in the national interest oil supplies at a rate of 35 per cent of our national requirements, it is reasonable to expect that a premium will have to be paid there. When Whitegate was established the premium was one penny in the old currency. If someone would like to do a sum on what that money meant in those days and bring it forward in today's money terms I am sure Deputies would appreciate it. The INPC will run the State-owned oil refinery at Whitegate.  They will be able to go to the market and purchase the proper mix of crude oil.  They will not be restricted as they were in the past, depending too largely on one supplier from one source.  They will be able to become a State oil trading company and get the benefit of any deals while, at the same time, ensuring security of supply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins spoke about disputes that may arise in the ESB and the comprehensive agreement that was reached. This agreement is to be welcomed.  I hope we will not see any going back to the days when we had so many interruptions of supply which undermined the confidence of investors and made them less competitive. I hope the comprehensive agreement that has been reached will ensure that we do not return to that kind of situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins made an interesting comment but one I did not understand in relation to the fuel variation charge.  He said that the bulk of the price increase should be made on the basis of an annual review, that it should not be referred to the NPC but should operate independently. That may not be what he meant and perhaps I misunderstood him.  The fuel variation charge is operated by the NPC and if it is to be altered it must be done by them.  I did not quite grasp the point the Deputy was making.</P>
    <P>I do not think we differ fundamentally on the policy or the thinking behind the motion.  I have indicated I have no difficulty in accepting a motion that falls in line with my thinking since I became Minister and which foreshadows what I intend to do.  We are all agreed on what <Col N="722" /> should be done.  I have given a clear outline of my approach since I took up office.  I have stated my objectives and how I hope to achieve them.  The matter of the fuel variation charge has been a major bone of contention in my mind as it has been in the minds of many Deputies. I know all Deputies will welcome action to resolve the situation.  I have outlined clearly my position and that of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's statement that he accepts the purport of the motion I am not quite sure if he is going to discontinue the imposition of the fuel variation charge.  If that is what he is saying, it is to be welcomed.  However, from one's knowledge of promises from that side of the House I think we had better wait and see what will be the exact nature of the announcement.  We must also see whether what has been given with one hand will be taken away by the other hand, perhaps behind the back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated he did not want to get involved in an argument about statistics and I agree with him in that respect.  But what we have to look at is the reality of the fuel variation charge and the effect it has had over the years on ordinary working people, particularly people on the low end of the incomes scale.  It is no exaggeration to say that its effect has been little short of traumatic. It has made the ESB bill an item of terror. There are many families who, when they see that ESB bill dropped through their letterbox, are put in real fear as to what the outcome will be; and the outcome is that their supply of electricity is cut off. That is the reality.  There are many estates I know of where ESB inspectors and operatives came in without warning and, on a large scale, cut off perhaps 50 or 70 houses in one day without warning, and in many of these cases the amount of the bill owed was relatively low.  One can imagine the degree of misery that would be caused by the cut-off of electricity in a house with children.  One has to see this in the context of the ESB, in the early years, adopting an aggressive sales campaign, advertising and pressing for the sale of their wares and their product, so <Col N="723" /> much so that many builders built houses taking up their proposals and their offers and providing all electric houses, houses with electricity as their only means of cooking and heating, so that people were locked into the monopoly situation of the use of that commodity.  They then had to face the horror of the fuel variation charge and the increases that took place in that generally over the years.  Over the past seven years the increase in the fuel variation charge has amounted to upwards of 600 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have to make some adverse comment generally on the lack of sympathy that is all too often evident on the part of ESB officials in dealing with many of their subscribers, particularly those who find themselves cut off from supplies and thereby deprived of heating and cooking facilities, often in the middle of winter. Many of the officials insisted on obtaining payment in full of all outstanding arrears on accounts and all too often they would refuse to enter into a reasonable arrangement to reconnect and allow the subscribers to pay off an outstanding bill.  I do not think that that was a universal situation. It depended very largely on the particular public relations officers, and this would vary from area to area.  Some certainly were more sympathetic than others.  With this monopoly situation, where the ESB are the only supplier of electricity in the State, there is clearly a great need for sympathy and understanding on the part of the ESB officials in these situations, particularly in dealing with low income families, in being prepared to enter into an arrangement with the subscribers for the reconnection of electricity.  It is an undeniable fact that as the years have progressed during the last decade the cost of the ESB bill in the average worker's household has absorbed an ever-increasing percentage of the wage coming into that house.  This has caused immense hardship particularly in the case of people on long-term social welfare and people on low incomes especially where there are children in the house.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some concept running through this country in the matter of <Col N="724" /> the supply of essential services that these services must break even, that there must be no loss situation.  One finds this area of thought not only in the field of electricity supplies but in the field of transport and in various other fields of that nature. These are areas where social necessity requires that these items be provided to members of the public as a social service and that a subsidy from State funds generally would be appropriate, if not across the board then certainly in cases where the financial need of the family involved so warrants.  So far as electricity is concerned attention should be given to extending free electricity or subsidised electricity to people who are on long-term social welfare benefits, to the long-term unemployed, to people on low incomes and to people with large families.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the relevance of the cost of electricity for industry.  This is a very important issue, but it has been insufficiently analysed.  It is a fact that the use of electricity is an essential factor in manufacturing industry.  It is a key factor in the costs of manufacturing industry.  It is also a fact that the cost of electricity here is, if not the highest, certainly among the highest in Europe.  That fact alone places an intolerable burden on Irish industry and has contributed to the difficulties and collapse of very many of our industries.  That is a tragic situation that we need not have.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the cost of oil and said one of the factors that affects the cost of oil in the ESB has been the decline in value of Irish currency.  That is quite right.  As the Minister points out, when the Irish currency depreciates, that alone increases the cost of oil to us, because oil is priced in dollars.  So, the Irish currency goes down and, as a result, oil costs go up.  The next stage in the chain is that the ESB charges go up.  ESB charges to the factories, big and small, make the marginal industries that bit less viable, that bit less competitive.  As a result of that many of them go to the wall.  A key example of that was the Clondalkin Paper Mills, a subject to which I trust in these closing days of the Minister's deadline he is applying himself very <Col N="725" /> carefully, because tomorrow week is the deadline for the resuscitation of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  In that industry it was pointed out how vital a factor the cost of energy was.  Therefore, as a result of the ESB charges going up, many of these marginal industries go to the wall, causing redundancies, increasing the already unacceptably high level of unemployment, placing an additional burden on the State in the provision of redundancy payments and social welfare payments. What is the result of all those factors &mdash; increased unemployment and a drop in the national product of the State, a further drop in Irish currency, thereby completing the vicious circle and triggering off the whole procedure once again leading to increases in the cost of oil and so on.</P>
    <P>Why can we not get away from this concept that a service industry like the ESB must break even?  In my view, it would make sound economic sense if the cost of electricity to industry was subsidised and reduced.  There is an apparent loss and an apparent cost there, but it is only apparent, because in the long run that will be recouped and brought back fourfold and fivefold.  It will make viable industries that would otherwise close down, it will preserve and maintain employment that would otherwise be lost, it will save enormous revenues to the State in social welfare and redundancy payments and in many cases it will mean goods produced in the industries which closed down will have to be imported &mdash; witness the paper industry, and there are many others.  Industries are closing down week in and week out. When one adds up all these savings they will more than offset the initial apparent cost incurred in subsidising electricity charges for industries.</P>
    <P>As far as industry is concerned, we should take a small risk &mdash; and I would regard it as a very small risk.  Let us take a radical step for once.  It is not that this is not done elsewhere.  Electricity charges are subsidised for certain industries in industrialised European nations.  They recognise the importance of the cost of a key vital factor in the production of industrial goods.  Electricity charges are <Col N="726" /> subsidised for specified weak industries in Germany, Norway and many other European countries.  Why do we not do that when it has everything to recommend it?  These industrialised European countries know the merit of that course of action.</P>
    <P>So far as domestic use of electricity is concerned, the Minister said the increases during the current year would be down to single figures.  I am afraid that will come as no consolation to the very many people who are unable to meet their existing electricity charges, who are terrified at the advent of the electricity bill.  What they require is not an increase in single figures, but a reduction in the cost of electricity, a very basic and essential commodity of the family today which is as necessary as food, transport and so on.  To plunge families, particularly with young children, into darkness and coldness is wrong.  In my constituency it is standard practice for the ESB to cut off electricity supply because of the financial inability of people to meet the electricity charges.  That is an intolerable situation. It should not be accepted and I urge the Minister to ensure that what he indicated in his speech will be translated into reality, that it will be within the financial means of people to meet these electricity charges and that no person should be cut off from electricity supplies because of being unable to meet the electricity bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement this evening that he will discontinue the fuel variation levy. Deputy Mervyn Taylor said he would welcome it when it was announced, but the Minister said very clearly here tonight that it will be officially announced within the next few weeks.  As the Minister said when giving a history of our oil situation and the recent oil crises, we welcome the situation where our dependence on oil is diminishing because for the last few years we have been developing our natural resources &mdash; hydro, peat and natural gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 25 per cent increase inflicted on us last July hit all sectors of society, consumers, industry and the farming community particularly.  Dairy farmers found their electricity bills very severe.  When <Col N="727" /> the levy disappears it will help agriculture as well as industry and the consumer.  I was glad to hear that increases in the coming year would be in single figures. People who were not in a position to pay were very frightened when they got their electricity bills; in many cases they got letters saying their electricity supply would be cut off.  This is causing great concern.</P>
    <P>Our dependence on oil has been reduced from 40 per cent to 28 per cent. This move has been welcomed by all.  In my constituency we have an amount of bog which has kept us poor for many years, but one of the most heartening signs we have seen is milled peat being processed and shipped to places like Shannonbridge.  Last week the Minister said he was giving the go-ahead to a briquette factory in the Ballyforan area. That type of development has ensured that we will not be as dependent on oil as a source of energy as we were heretofore. I am glad that type of development is going on and that Bord na Móna are acquiring more bog in that area.  The bogland which has made us poor will certainly now make us rich in energy, as well as providing the jobs so needed in a rural area such as Ballyforan.</P>

Whether it means a heifer in-calf, a calved heifer or a heifer which has been calved, or whatever it means, Deputy Dukes will have 20 minutes during which he will enlighten the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for giving me the opportunity of raising <Col N="728" /> this matter this evening.  The Chair may well ask what kind of scheme it is, since there appears to be a great deal of confusion as to whether or not that scheme actually exists.  In spite of my best efforts, it has been very difficult to find out from the Minister what the situation is in that regard.</P>
      <P>I first raised this matter during the Adjournment Debate on EEC farm prices on 6 May last.  That evening I was concerned to find out from the Minister what exactly was happening in relation to the fixing of those prices and the various measures which go together with the farm prices, of which this calf heifer scheme was proposed at that stage to be one.  I pointed out then that this was one of the schemes which I had proposed to the Community authority for inclusion in the farm prices package this year.  We had already got agreement to our scheme of subsidies for calved heifers in 1982 on a national basis and I had proposed to the Community authorities that this scheme be continued for a further three years and that some Community funding be made available.  The cost of the present scheme for one year is being borne entirely by the national Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In his reply on that occasion the Minister made the point, in column 654 of the Official Report of 6 May:</P>
      <P>&mdash;we have now got approval by the Council of Ministers for an in-calf heifer grant for every additional breeding heifer over and above this year's level.</P>
      <P>He went on to give some more details about the scheme and then said:</P>
      <P>That represents a three-year cycle guarantee to the breeding farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was what I took to be a fairly positive statement from the Minister as to what was in the package.  The Minister made the point that they had got agreement at that stage.  On 6 May, of course, we had not yet got that agreement on the EEC price package.  However, I took that as an earnest of the Minister's intention to continue the negotiations on the basis that we would get agreement.  Indeed, at the time we all wished him well because <Col N="729" /> we were becoming rather impatient that neither the farm prices nor the measures which go with it had then yet been fixed for this year.  We are all agreed on the importance of having a multi-annual scheme to build up our livestock and provide us with the basis for increasing the level of activity on farms and, indeed, in our meat factories.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons into which we have gone, there was agreement on all sides of the House that we should have a scheme of this kind and that it was important that it be included in the farm price package.  I raised the matter again on 19 May when we discussed the agreement which had just been reached on EEC farm prices for the 1982-83 year.  Here again I refer to the Official Report of that date.  I hope to be allowed to refer rather extensively to that debate, because it is important to establish what we understood the situation to be at that time.  I quote from column 1771 and said as follows:</P>
    <P>It is stated in the document the Government circulated that under the calf heifer scheme grant aid amounting to £70 will be paid by the Irish Exchequer this year and for the two following years.  What is the real situation here?</P>
    <P>That was a specific question to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I had reports this morning that the calf heifer scheme was not agreed as part of the package, that it is a scheme which could be agreed only with unanimity in the Council, not because of the United Kingdom budget problem but because it is a scheme which needs sanction under Article 93 of the Treaty and therefore must be agreed unanimously. I heard that the matter was not raised in the Council until after the British Minister and his Minister of State left the meeting and therefore it was not possible to get unanimous agreement.</P>
    <P>  I said further:</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us exactly what the position is in this respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> I expressed the very real concern of everybody in this Houe and of the farming community about just what the next few years have in store for us in terms of livestock expansion and whether or not there will be a fixed plan extending over several years that would encourage the expansion of livestock production here. As I say, we had a statement from the Minister on 6 May to the effect that agreement had been reached on the scheme.  According to Government information circulated to us on 19 May, agreement had been reached on a scheme which would cover the present year under the national scheme and a further two years under a slight variation of the scheme which the Minister explained.</P>
    <P>It would be useful to refer specifically to the Treaty of Rome which deals with national aids.  I do this for a very specific reason.  It is important that it be explained fully to the House just what has been going on here.  The second section of Article 93 of the Treaty, in its third paragraph states:</P>
    <P>On application by a Member State, the Council, may, acting unanimously, decide that aid which that State is granting or intends to grant shall be considered to be compatible with the common market, in derogation from the provisions of Article 92 or from the regulations provided for in Article 94, if such a decision is justified by exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The case which I made originally for the measure which is now agreed for this year and that which I made for continuing that measure for a number of subsequent years &mdash; and which I understand the Minister has continued &mdash; were based on the fact that we in this country find ourselves in exceptional circumstances, circumstances which are reflected in the appaling reduction in farm income over the past three years, circumstances which are also reflected in our breeding herds for, indeed, a longer period than that.  This seems to us &mdash; and there was general agreement on this &mdash; to justify special measures intended to increase our livestock production.</P>
    <P>In reply to me that evening, the Minister <Col N="731" /> spent the best part of ten minutes in a rambling discourse on the operation of the veto and various blocking mechanisms. He explained in detail what had happened, what initiatives had been taken to secure a situation in which farm prices would be agreed by a majority vote in the Council.  A great deal of this could have been said much more briefly and, indeed, much more pithily.  We listened to this discourse, I must say, with mounting dissatisfaction on this side of the House, to the point where Deputy D'Arcy and I &mdash; who, I think the Chair will agree, are normally two reasonably well conducted Members of the House &mdash; felt obliged to interrupt the Minister to ask if he would answer some of the specific questions which we had raised.  I am bound to say that we got precious little satisfaction from him in response. At the end of the Minister's contribution, I felt obliged to congratulate him on having spoken for ten minutes without once having referred to the effect on our farmers of anything about which he was talking. However, my ill-humour about that has very little to do with the discussion we are having here this evening.</P>
    <P>During the course of his reply I interrupted the Minister to ask him for some more details about the scheme which he said had been agreed.  As reported at column 1778, volume 334, of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>On top of that we have a national aid of £70 per in-calf heifer.  Deputy Dukes started off this scheme on a subsidy-interest basis.  It has now been translated into a grant basis over the next three years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence, Deputy Power, opinioned that was a great deal of money, as it would be if, in fact, we had any of it this year.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>We are committed to do that over a three-year period.</P>
    <P>I asked him specifically at that point:</P>
    <P>Is that agreed to?</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> It is agreed to.</P>
    <P>A categorical statement.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>This in-calf heifer grant is not included in the package but is a separate matter which has been agreed to.</P>
    <P>We had to take that on its face value. The Minister said the matter had been agreed to.  He said it several times and he said it quite clearly.</P>
    <P>There have been persistent rumours ever since that the matter has not been agreed to entirely.  I have been trying to find out what exactly the situation is.  I have recalled to the House that I asked the Minister if it was true that the matter had not been fully agreed to at the Council of Ministers.  I asked him if it was not true that it required unanimous agreement and could not be agreed to in the absence of any one of the Ministers. The Minister's reply was that it had been agreed to.</P>
    <P>Over the weekend we had a number of newspaper reports, one in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Saturday and one in <i>The Irish Press</i> last Saturday.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> last Saturday had an article on page 3 headed: &ldquo;Britain blocks £70 heifer scheme&rdquo;.  It said:</P>
    <P>Farm Ministers did not pass the national aid measure &mdash; estimated to cost £37 million &mdash; because of an objection lodged by UK Farm Minister Peter Walker, at the controversial Farm Council which saw Britain's veto out-voted by the other member states.</P>
    <P>It was also reported that the Minister for Agriculture was hopeful that agreement would be reached on this measure at the next meeting of the Farm Ministers of the Community.  I know the Minister is a very hopeful man.  He was hopeful last week and his hopes turned out not to be particularly well-founded.  I am hopeful that the same kind of situation does not apply in this case.</P>
    <P>There was another report to the effect that approval was blocked by Britain &mdash; this was in a different newspaper &mdash; at the meeting of the EEC Ministers early this month, that agreement had to be <Col N="733" /> unanimous and that officials in Brussels were confident that the matter would be agreed when the Ministers next met.</P>
    <P>I take a very serious view of this situation. If it is the case that the matter requires unanimous agreement, as is provided for in the Treaty, and if it is the case that is was not unanimously agreed at the meeting of the Farm Ministers which decided on 1982-83 prices, then it is up to the Minister to come here and tell us that, and to make it clear to this House and to the farmers just what the situation is.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has made an error, or if he did not notice that the matter was not included in the package, it is up to him now to rectify that.  If, on the other hand, he is quoted as being hopeful that the matter can be resolved at the next meeting, I want to ask him how he squares that hope with his statement in this House on 19 May to the effect that the matter had, in fact, been agreed to. If the Minister is not aware that this doubt exists, I ask him to make it his business to be aware of what the situation is and to give us some kind of guarantee that he will take up the matter properly the next time around, and that he will not let agreement on a matter like this slip through his fingers because the UK Minister and his Minister of State have left the meeting before the Minister has got around to raising the problem.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister tonight, in contrast to the approach he adopted in this House the last time we discussed these matters, to give a specific answer.  Has the scheme been agreed to unanimously by the Council or has it not?  If it has been agreed to, what are the terms?  If it has not been agreed to, would the Minister please say so and tell us what he intends to do in order to make sure that this scheme, which he himself has put forward as being of some considerable importance, is agreed to?  Would he further explain to us, if the scheme has not been agreed to, why he made so many categorical statements in this House to the effect that it had been?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to restrict himself to the issues and say exactly what is going on, exactly what the position is, and forget <Col N="734" /> other side issues.  I ask him to forget about niceties of negotiations and tell us whether or not agreement has been reached on this matter.  If the Minister has to tell us that agreement has not been reached, I want it to go very clearly on the record that the Minister had no foundation for what he said to us on the 19 May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1 July this year &mdash; and Irish farmers will be hearing about it <Col N="735" /> in the coming weeks &mdash; we will have for the following 12 months a £70 interest grant scheme initiated and in operation. That is the scheme which Deputy Dukes initiated, an interest subsidy scheme, to which we objected in Opposition and rightly objected to on the basis that it was very much a limited subsidy to particular categories of farmers.  However, we are proceeding with the implementation of that scheme from 1 July 1982 to 1 July 1983.</P>
      <P>Starting on 1 July 1983 and 1 July 1984, and continuing until 1 July 1985, there will be in operation a straightforward in-calf heifer grant scheme.  We will convert Deputy Dukes' and the Coalition's scheme &mdash; and I have made this clear before now &mdash; from an interest subsidy scheme to a straight grant scheme for every in-calf heifer over and above the level of the preceding year, so that starting from 1 July next year and 1 July 1984 every additional in-calf heifer will benefit from this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over three years, starting off with Deputy Dukes' inadequate scheme, if I may say so, limited to an interest subsidy which we will implement this year, we will convert that into a far broader scheme involving a grant across the board to every additional in-calf heifer in the following two years.  I will not make any point about the inadequacies of the first year.  That is the responsibility of the previous Government, but we will implement their scheme.  In year 1, starting 1 July this year, we will have an interest subsidy scheme which we will try to implement as flexibly as possible and as far as possible we will try to mesh it into the grant scheme which we can bring in specifically in the following year on 1 July 1983 and 1 July 1984.  I hope that is clear. In that context, as Deputy Dukes is well aware, because the grant scheme which we will bring in next year and the following year is national aid we have to get the permission of the Council of Ministers to implement it.  We are implementing it at the same rate as his interest subsidy scheme, £70 per animal.  We got approval of that national aid outside the package &mdash; this is where Deputy Dukes is making <Col N="736" /> a mistake.  We got it by unanimous approval of the Council under Article 93 (2) at a meeting of the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg April 28 to 30.  The Agricultural Council indicated support in principle and there was no dissent by any Minister and all ten Ministers were present, together with officials.  That was prior &mdash; perhaps this explains the confusion in Deputy Dukes' mind &mdash; to the finalising of the actual prices package which happened at a subsequent date in Brussels.  The Luxembourg decision at the meeting of 28 to 30 April is duly written into the minutes, approved by the President and his officials, the legal advisers to the Presidency and the Commission. That is a separate matter altogether, although going in parallel with the package proper.  This is a question of approval by the Council of Ministers of national aid giving us the right to bring in this national aid which will cost the Exchequer money &mdash; it is not a European transfer of money.</P>
    <P>I was away during the weekend in North Africa doing very practical business on behalf of Irish beef producers and exporters which I am glad to say proved successful.  Leaving that aside, I saw the newspaper reports only after my return.  I saw them this morning.  These newspaper reports show confusion and Deputy Dukes has added to it.  The calf premium which is the £22 for each dropped calf is a grant to be paid to every producer in the country with a dropped calf from the beginning of the marketing year to the end of the marketing year next year.  For each dropped calf, on full rearing to six months, £22 will be paid.  It is a rearing grant really and will be paid at the end of the rearing period of six months.  That scheme is already in operation and is directly financed by the Community. It is a direct Community transfer to Ireland.  The £37 million odd involved in the financing of that scheme has already gone into operation and is part of the package.</P>
    <P>There are articles in both the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Press</i> to both of which Deputy Dukes referred, particularly the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the writer confused the two issues of the in-calf <Col N="737" /> heifer scheme which is a replacement of Deputy Dukes' scheme already in the budget prepared by the former Minister for Finance.  There was an amount of, I think, £5.5 million, written in by Deputy Bruton which we also wrote into our budget.  That will finance from the National Exchequer the interest subsidy scheme.  That will be continued by us as a grant scheme next year and the following year.  That is entirely separate from the actual package itself even though the negotiations went on in parallel.  In the package itself we are concerned with Community finance only and that relates to the calf premium scheme of £22 per calf after six months rearing.  That involved transfer from the Community of £37 million to our Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I hope I have explained the matter fully.  I do not understand how this storm has arisen; it is possibly a storm in a <Col N="738" /> teacup.  Perhaps I contributed to it myself by not being explicit enough, as Deputy Dukes suggested, on the previous occasion. I hope I have been explicit now.  I shall not enter into any other extraneous issues as he has suggested.  These are the basic, unalterable facts of this matter.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>1.  The 1981 figures are provisional.</P>
    <P>2.  &ldquo;No. detected&rdquo; refers to offences in respect of which charges are preferred and in addition offences in respect of which the perpetrators are known but where charges are not preferred because, for example, those concerned are dealt with under the juvenile liaison scheme or are mentally incapacitated or have died.</P>
    <P>3.  &ldquo;No. of convictions&rdquo; do not include cases where the indictable offence was dealt with summarily and where the charge was proved and an order made without conviction.  Statistics of such cases for the areas in question are not available but the number of such cases is quite small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 415, 416, 417, 423, 424, and 425 together.</P>
      <P>The Government of the Soviet Union are well aware of the Irish Government's deep concern about human rights violations in the Soviet Union.  We have in the past availed of all appropriate opportunities for expressing this concern and will continue to do so in the future.  In general we feel that our views are most effectively conveyed through multilateral channels particularly the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.  At the Madrid CSCE meeting the Irish delegation in numerous statements has called attention to the violations of the humanitarian provisions of the Helsinki Final Act by the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the two families known as the &ldquo;Siberian Seven&rdquo; mentioned by Deputies Quinn and Birmingham, the Government share the widespread sympathy for their plight.  My Department are following their situation particularly closely at present.  The Deputies will be aware that Lida Vashchenko applied once again for an exit visa on her return to Chernogorsk.  Since by her return to <Col N="589" /> Chernogorsk Ms. Vashchenko has fulfilled the condition insisted upon by the Soviet authorities of application from her home region, we now look to the Soviet authorities to respond favourably to her request for an exit visa.  Such a favourable response would represent a break-through which we hope would be followed by further positive developments in relation to other members of the group.</P>
    <P>It seems clear that the real difficulty for these families is not in which Western country to live but how to obtain permission to leave the Soviet Union.  I therefore do not consider that an offer of temporary asylum in Ireland would be very useful or relevant to their present problems. If indeed the families were to indicate a wish to come to Ireland, we would certainly consider such a request sympathetically.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn has asked a number of questions relating to the harassment by the Soviet authorities of Soviet Jewish citizens and I should like to assure him that I am aware of and concerned by this problem.  The reduction in exit visas granted to Soviet Jews, the concerted moves against the cultural seminars organised in Jewish circles, the restrictive attitude to the teaching of Hebrew, all are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Helsinki Final Act.  We have noted the difficulties and hardships encountered by Pavel Abramovich and others like him in their campaign to have the private tuition of modern Hebrew recognised as a legitimate profession.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to ensure that, when the Madrid meeting resumes in November, the Irish delegation will continue to underline our concern at these developments. We are also ready to convey our views bilaterally in circumstances where this would seem appropriate and effective; it is my general view, however, that bilateral channels are best used sparingly if they are to be effective.</P>

His means were last revised in May 1981 when he ceased to rent land. However, the question of increasing the rate of unemployment assistance in accordance with the new means assessment was overlooked and in consequence he was underpaid.  The matter was recently corrected and all arrears of unemployment assistance due were paid to him last week.  He is presently in receipt of weekly payment of £38.65, being the maximum rate of £48.55 less means £9.90 derived from the national value of his holding.</P>

      <P>Although the person concerned had for some years been receiving a non-contributory old age pension at the maximum rate a re-assessment of his means has resulted in a reduction in the rate of payment.  His means, derived from a small holding and a British retirement pension, entitle him to payment at the reduced rate of £32.45 a week, plus a living alone allowance of £2.70 a week.</P>
      <P>The person also has an entitlement to a <i>pro rata</i> contributory old age pension under EEC regulations.  However, simultaneous payment of this pension and the non-contributory pension is not permitted. Hitherto the non-contributory pension has been paid to the person as the rate was higher.  The position has now changed because of the reduction in his non-contributory pension.  His <i>pro rata</i> contributory pension entitlement is now more favourable, being currently £33.55 a week, plus living alone allowance of £2.70 a week.

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an incapacity which he attributed to an accident at work on 9 April 1982.</P>
      <P>Normally in such cases, payment of disability benefit is allowed pending inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity.  As, however, the claimant had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the 1980-81 contribution year he was not qualified for payment on this basis.</P>
      <P>On completion of the inquiries regarding the occupational accident, payment of injury benefit was authorised from 10 April 1982.  All arrears of injury benefit due to 29 May 1982, date of the latest medical certificate received, less an amount refunded to the Mid-Western Health Board in respect of supplementary welfare allowance advanced, was issued to the claimant on 31 May 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 18 February 1982 and was paid from that date at the maximum appropriate rate.  All disability benefit due to 6 March 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work, was issued at that time.</P>
      <P>The social welfare regulations provide that where the combined weekly amount of disability benefit and pay-related benefit exceeds a claimant's reckonable earnings in the tax year relevant to his claim, pay-related benefit is not payable.  His earnings in 1980-81 were £52.16 per week and, as the amount of disability benefit, £71.75 per week, exceeded this amount, pay-related benefit was not initially authorised.  Following an inquiry from the claimant it was established that he has an unemployment benefit claim within the 13-week period immediately prior to his disability benefit claim and that his claim was, therefore, linked for pay-related benefit purposes to the 1979-80 tax year.  As his reckonable earnings in that year amounted to £6,590 he was entitled to payment of pay-related benefit for the period 4 March 1982, 13th day of incapacity, to 6 March 1982.  A cheque for the sum of £22.38 issued on 20 May 1982.</P>

In pursuance of this requirement, all housing authorities are expected to consider the circumstances of individual housing applicants, including the level of their incomes, in deciding whether they should be approved for rehousing or whether they could reasonably be expected to provide accommodation from their own resources assisted by the generous aids provided for this purpose from public funds.</P>

This is not to say that they are deprived of the right of appeal.  The right of appeal remains and its exercise can be safeguarded by an objector who is prepared to keep in touch with the processing of an application, by using the information in the planning register and by making inquiries.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that there is a large problem in this area or that special steps are called for.  It is of course very undesirable that planning decisions should go by default.
