      <P>Deputies should keep quiet.  I may be doing them a favour.  On the Order of Business, could I ask the Taoiseach if and when he intends to appoint additional Ministers of State?  If he does intend to appoint them, can he explain the inordinate delay in doing so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach if and when he intends to appoint additional Ministers of State and if he can explain the inordinate delay in doing so. Can we assume that the reason the Taoiseach has not done so is that he attaches no value to these positions?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Chair if it is his contention that the precise questions I asked the Taoiseach appeared on the Order Paper and that is why he is ruling them out of order.  I am asking him if he will give me the dates on which they appeared on the Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I accept fully, sir, that you may not be responsible for the Taoiseach's replies. You are responsible for your own rulings. You gave your ruling that the questions I addressed to the Taoiseach appeared <Col N="984" /> on the Order Paper and therefore you are not allowing my supplementary.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I did.  Then I told you that the Taoiseach answered you that he replied to Parliamentary Questions on the subject.  I told you that and I said I understood that was it.  I am not responsible for continuing the argument about it.  I certainly could not allow that.  You asked the question.  You are given the reply and that is the matter ended.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

To have an amenity closed down without having funds made available is something which I am sure the Taoiseach and his Ministers would not like to see happening particularly in view of the crime rate that is now apparent in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost the same.  There are a few minor changes.  The Deputy thanked me for co-operation on the last day when I had issued the speech but time prevented me from delivering it in its entirity. <Col N="990" /> There are a few changes possibly in relation to industrial relations and the EEC Council meeting.  There are some additions that I am sure the Deputy will pick up.  Certainly I do not intend to hog the time because of the agreement between the Whips.  I want to be as brief as I can on the continuation of this speech on the Estimate.  I now propose to deal with the Department's role in relation to new legislation.  Considerable progress has been made in the last decade towards conferring statutory rights on workers.  I am proud to have been associated with this development during my previous term of office at the Department of Labour.  Our legislation amounts to a charter which safeguards the employment rights of workers.  I hope shortly to put at least two completely new pieces of legislation on the Statute Book, one about hours of work and overtime and the other in relation to safety on off-shore installations such as oil rigs.</P>
      <P>Current statutory limits on working hours were set during the thirties and are now completely out of date.  Apart from that studies have shown that there exists potential for the creation of jobs through the control of excessive overtime.  I intend to introduce a Bill in the very near future which will reduce statutory working hours and limit excessive overtime working.  To be effective the Bill will have to be very wide in its application and will have to cover both the private and public sectors.  Overtime over and above the limits set in the Bill will have to be sanctioned by the Minister for Labour and I would anticipate that we would operate the legislation on a fairly flexible basis initially until firms adapt to the new limits which will be specified.</P>
      <P>As regards safety of workers involved in the exploration or exploitation of hydrocarbons off our coast, it is my intention to introduce a Bill in the very near future to provide for standards on off-shore installations comparable to those which exist in our legislation for safety in industry generally on-shore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I had a meeting with the directors of State boards.  I know my predecessor also had a meeting with them in his term of office, just as I had in my <Col N="991" /> previous term.  As he was impressed with his meeting, I was similarly extremely impressed with my meeting with them yesterday afternoon.  I found them to be a very positive committed group of people with very deep commitment to their industries and the boards in which they participate.</P>
    <P>One of the major pieces of worker protection legislation is the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  This Act has worked well since its enactment and a great number of workers have benefited from its terms.  However, it has become clear that the legislation can be improved in certain respects and with this in view I am giving priority to the preparation of a Bill to amend the Act.  I would hope to have this Bill ready for circulation by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The employment equality legislation has now been in operation for a number of years.  I am having a comprehensive review of the operation and effectiveness of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 carried out.  In the course of the review, discussions will be held with both sides of industry as well as with the Employment Equality Agency and the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>As regards dangerous substances, since the Dangerous Substances Act came into operation in September 1979, five sets of regulations have been made relating to petroleum.  In addition, 25 other substances have been declared to be dangerous for the purposes of the Act and regulations to control the conveyance by road of these substances are in operation.  I believe, however, that this list of 25 substances should be extended to cover further substances.  I have, therefore, asked for an urgent review of the Declaration Order and this is currently being carried out by the Industrial Inspectorate of my Department.  I also believe we need a further set of regulations to control the loading and unloading and storage of these substances.  The drafting of regulations on this matter is at an advanced stage and I would hope that I would be able to make the regulations in the very near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> My Department, through the industrial inspectorate, continue to enforce the provisions of the Safety in Industry Acts, the Mines and Quarries Act and certain provisions of the Office Premises Act. The Department are also involved at EEC level where occupational safety and health matters are being considered.  An increase in the staff of the inspectorate has recently been authorised and recruitment of additional personnel is proceeding.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, a commission of inquiry are at present examining the entire question of how safety at the workplace can best be secured and their report is expected by the end of this year. I have no doubt that their findings will be important in directing public attention at this vital but often neglected area and will point the way ahead for my Department and for other bodies who have a part to play in promoting safe and healthy working conditions.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency who are financed by grant from the Labour Vote have the general function of monitoring the operation of the equality legislation.  This year's grant shows an increase of over 60 per cent on 1981.  The agency play an important role in informing women of their rights under the legislation and ensuring that those rights are obtained.  The agency recommended the repeal of the ban on the employment of women on nightwork in industry which they considered to be discriminatory. When the denunciation by this country of the ILO Convention relating to women on night work takes effect at the end of February 1983, women may be permitted to work at night by regulations made under the Conditions of Employment Act 1936, after consultations with the employer and the workers' representative organisations.</P>
    <P>My Department are responsible for liaison with the Council for the Status of Women who represent over thirty women's organisations throughout the country.  Support for the efforts of the council on behalf of women in this country are reflected in the provision of an extra £30,000 over and above the original amount of £65,000.  The additional provision <Col N="993" /> is being made in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>A working party to look into the question of child care services and facilities for working parents are meeting under the aegis of my Department.  The working party have been considering the setting of standards and the introduction of a system on registration and inspection of child care facilities and also the training of child care personnel.  The preparation of the working party's report is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>My Department have responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the legislation covering conditions of employment.  They maintain an information service about entitlements and obligations under a substantial body of worker protection legislation, covering holidays entitlements, hours of work, shift work licences, the rights to minimum notice and written terms of employment, right to maternity leave, redress for unfair dismissal and protection of young persons.  The question of enforcement is pursued wherever necessary.</P>
    <P>There are still sectors of employment, particularly where workers are unorganised, where special regulation of working conditions is necessary.  These sectors are covered by employment regulation orders, setting minimum pay and conditions under the Industrial Relations Acts. The main sectors are catering and hotels, law clerks, agriculture, the clothing industry and hairdressing.  Inspectors of my Department visit all premises covered by these employment regulation orders to ensure compliance.</P>
    <P>My Department has a substantial involvement in the social policy side of the EEC and also in the ILO and OECD. One of our main interests in the EEC is the European Social Fund from which Ireland is a very substantial beneficiary.</P>
    <P>Ireland's income from the social fund has increased every year since 1973 and now constitutes a very important part of our expenditure on training, job creation and mobility of workers.  As a reflection of increased Government expenditure in these areas, our requests for social fund assistance have increased considerably in recent years.  The amount of fund assistance <Col N="994" /> approved for 1981 operations was £70.9 million.  For operations commencing in 1982, some of which will extend in 1983, assistance of £102 million has been applied for, of which £80.9 million has already been approved by the EEC Commission.</P>
    <P>The main beneficiaries will be AnCO, the organisations dealing with the training of the handicapped, the Department of Education, the Industrial Development Authority, the National Manpower Service, CERT and the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>The social fund is about to undergo a major review and Deputies may have seen articles in the press suggesting that Ireland's present status in the fund, as a region of absolute priority, could be put in jeopardy in the review.  The Commission have not yet made formal proposals for the review of the fund but I have been keeping in close touch with the Commission and am aware of the general lines of their thinking.  I had a recent meeting with the EEC Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs, Mr. Richard.  I impressed upon him that Ireland could not agree to any proposals which could result in a reduction in the amount of aid it received.  I received certain assurances from the Commissioner that Ireland would not suffer any reduction in the amount of its social fund aid, as a result of the Commission's proposals.  I shall be keeping a very close watch on this matter to ensure that our interests are protected.</P>
    <P>One of the main problems facing the fund has been a scarcity of resources to enable it to meet all the demands being made of it.  I shall be pressing for a substantial increase in the Social Fund budget for the coming years.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting on 27 May of the Council of Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs at which a number of important decisions were taken.  The Council agreed a directive relating to the levels of exposure of workers to lead; that directive will take effect in 1986.  A resolution relating to a new programme of Community action in favour of women was adopted.  As a follow-up to that resolution, the European Commission will be putting forward specific proposals for <Col N="995" /> consideration by the council in a number of different areas.  The Council also approved a recommendation relating to flexible retirement age of workers. Finally, and most important of all, the Council adopted a resolution concerning Community action to combat unemployment. This resolution deals with such matters as the need to take account of employment considerations in investment decisions, industrial restructuring, the roles of small and medium-sized undertakings and of local initiatives and co-operatives, the desirability of giving priority Community attention to vocational training of young people and adaptation of working time.  The resolution provides a framework for the development of Community proposals in specific areas and the Commission have been asked to bring forward the appropriate measures.  The OECD have recently embarked on a series of reviews of youth employment policies in member countries. Ireland was included in one of these reviews which started last year.  A review team led by Mrs. Shirley Williams, formerly Secretary of State for Education and Science in the United Kingdom, visited Ireland last summer and will be reporting shortly, I expect the results of the review to be of substantial help in developing our youth employment policies and programmes.</P>
    <P>Finally, I propose to deal with industrial relations and, as worker participation is a clearly allied subject, I will first outline progress in that area.</P>
    <P>I believe that better worker participation can contribute to better industrial relations.  I had a discussion paper on worker participation published in March 1980 with the aim of focusing debate on the key issues as well as outlining possible policy options for the development of participation.</P>
    <P>Submissions have been received from many interested parties, ranging from individuals to large companies, students and specialists in the industrial relations field and from universities and professional bodies.  I have now requested an assessment report and I intend, as soon as I have completed my consideration of <Col N="996" /> the report, to have consultations with the representatives of employers and trade unions as well as other interests concerned in the hope of getting a consensus on future developments.</P>
    <P>In line with an earlier commitment in the second national understanding, I will shortly be seeking Government approval to introduce legislation to extend the principle of employee participation at board level to additional State enterprises. Also my Department have prepared a draft code of practice on disclosure of company information which will be sent to congress and employer organisations shortly as a basis for consultations. The code will be designed to improve trade union and employee knowledge of company affairs and to facilitate collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>Our industrial relations scene has continued to be one of intense activity as is reflected in the level of services provided by the Labour Court and Rights Commissioners. The court held 831 hearings and issued 766 recommendations during 1981.  This compares with 866 hearings and 802 recommendations in 1980 and 622 hearings and 575 recommendations in 1979.  Also in 1981 the rights commissioner service issued 639 recommendations under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, as compared with 660 in 1980 and 506 in 1979.</P>
    <P>I have always been committed to the need for support of training and education in the trade union movement during my time as Minister for Labour.  That continues to be my policy.  This year's allocation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions towards the cost of their education, training and advisory services is £540,000.</P>
    <P>The college of industrial relations are doing excellent work in promoting trade union studies and industrial relations education and training.  Provision is made for an increase in the grant-in-aid to the college by £5,000 to £35,000 in 1982.</P>
    <P>Progress on trade union amalgamations has been disappointing.  The response to the Trade Union Act, 1975, the purpose of which was to simplify amalgamation procedures and thereby <Col N="997" /> encourage trade union rationalisation, has not been as good as envisaged.  There is an allocation of £10,000 for this subhead this year and my hope is that the full allocation will be taken up.</P>
    <P>It will be my intention during my term of office to give urgent attention to the improvement of our industrial relations system.  Consultations with my Cabinet colleagues on the extension of legal immunities under the Trade Disputes Act, 1906 to licensed trade unions in the public sector of the economy have now been completed and I propose to introduce the necessary legislation in the present Dáil session.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been pressing for this amendment of the 1906 Act for many years.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have already given me an assurance that they will enter into discussions as soon as action is taken on the amendment of the Trade Disputes Act to identify ways and means of remedying, as soon as possible, deficiencies in present industrial relations practices and procedures, including problems identified by the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations.  I expect a similar approach from employer bodies.</P>
    <P>I will undertake shortly comprehensive discussions on the improvement of our industrial relations practices and procedures. I will work hard and diligently with trade unions and employers to make positive progress towards the improvements which are regarded as being both necessary and urgent.</P>
    <P>The Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations which I established in 1978 presented their report last year.  Their report contains a detailed analysis of our system of industrial relations together with wide-ranging prescriptions for its reform.  It can be expected to form a useful focal point in regard to a number of the subjects which I will be discussing with employers and unions.  I see no reason why immediate progress cannot be made on those aspects of the commission's report on which a consensus already exists or might readily be obtained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> It would be difficult to overstate the importance I attach to seeking improvements in our system of industrial relations. The goal of national economic recovery would be assisted greatly if disruptions of production or services resulting from industrial action could be reduced to a minimum.  An improved industrial relations climate would also encourage more foreign investment to locate in this country.</P>
    <P>Little will be achieved by this process unless there is a willingness in all parties to recognise not only their own responsibilities and the need to improve their own performance but also the need for change.  It is vitally necessary, therefore, for all parties to work together to achieve improvements which will lead to a better and a more stable industrial relations climate.</P>
    <P>Employers have ultimate responsibility for the running of their enterprises. They must recognise that industrial relations require the application of the necessary time, effort and expertise.</P>
    <P>Unions exist to represent the interests of their members.  To do this adequately, they must be well-resourced and efficiently organised.  This is manifestly not the case in many instances at present. The defects in Irish trade union structure are too well known to require further elaboration.  The trade union movement alone can tackle the defects and must surely recognise the need for urgent remedies.</P>
    <P>In the forthcoming duscussions, I intend to stress forcefully to both sides my conviction that the remedies for many of our problems lie mainly in their hands.  This surely is what free collective bargaining must mean.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on that note because I believe that there is a great deal of consensus on the need to improve our industrial relations performance and on the recognition that such an improvement is a vital part of the action required towards national recovery for the economy and particularly for employment.  There is, however, much less consensus on how precisely improved industrial relations can be achieved.  I intend to devote a great deal of my time over the next few <Col N="999" /> years to working hard for a broadening of this area of consensus and to implementing measures which result from that wider consensus.</P>
    <P>In the time available &mdash; I want to give Deputies an opportunity to speak &mdash; I have had to deal necessarily briefly with various aspects of my Department's work.  If Deputies require further information I will, of course, try to provide it when replying.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Estimate and Supplementary Estimate for the approval of the House.  I assure Deputies on all sides they will have my co-operation at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I welcome Deputy Fitzgerald back to the Department of Labour.  I enjoyed very much shadowing him during the years in which he had responsibility for that Department up to 1981.  I wish him every success in his difficult task.  I hope he will be as successful as his predecessor, Deputy Kavanagh, who made a great impact and impression.  I was privileged to have been a colleague of his in the last Government. I am sure his contribution to this debate later will be listened to carefully.</P>
      <P>The main problem facing the country not just today or last year but in the past ten years was, and probably for the remainder of the century will be, unemployment which is the central economic problem here.  We have seen the graph going up and it has now reached 150,000 and heading for 160,000, and the forecast is that by the end of the year the figure could reach 200,000 people unemployed. I hope that figure is too pessimistic, that we will not have that dramatically high figure this year, but taking the most optimistic view, if we continue on the road the Government have been taking and their unwillingness to face up to hard economic decisions, I am afraid we will reach a position which will make it difficult for our democratic State to survive. I am not exaggerating, because if the present trend continues we could have 300,000 or 350,000 people unemployed by the end of this decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it behoves all of us in the House and in the country to do everything <Col N="1000" /> possible not only to create jobs but to maintain present employment.  We must be prepared to make the sacrifices necessary so that employment can be created and so that there will be a future here for the present and coming generations.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have implemented policies which have been conducive not to the creation of employment but unemployment.  First of all, there is a lack of an incomes policy.  We have not got such a policy though there is an urgent need for it.  The first rule of such a policy should be that he who goes out to work should be paid significantly more than he who does not.  I represent a very large working class area in Dublin and those who are unemployed come to me to tell me they are better off not working.  Some of them even tell me they cannot afford to work.  On the other hand, many who are employed come to me to say they are hoping for redundancy, that they want to leave their employment because they would be better off without it.</P>
    <P>I am saying this because it is part of the <i>malaise</i> attached to unemployment. There are many other problems as well to which I will refer later.  Among the things that inhibit employment creation here, and the maintenance of employment, is the high level of absenteeism. This is caused indirectly and unintentionally by a combination of policies of successive Governments &mdash; for instance the policy of high personal taxation and high PRSI.  Towards the end of the tax year it becomes more profitable not to work. The absenteeism bulge comes in the last few months of the tax year.  It is clear that these policies, together with the one of paying high pay-related payments and not taxing them, contribute to absenteeism. If a person was thinking of locating an industry in Ireland, he would say there are certain incentives; but then he would look at the disincentives, particularly the high rate of absenteeism.</P>
    <P>I know that what I am saying runs counter to the instincts of all socialists. However, if they think about it they will know I am correct.  I am all for better social welfare benefits but when I thought about it, I saw what we were doing.  We <Col N="1001" /> were removing the incentive to work and creating unemployment.  People on the streets of Dublin will tell you that.  We must leave our prejudices aside and think about what we are doing.  It is too serious a situation to be allowed to drift.</P>
    <P>In our budget in January we proposed to introduce an element of taxation on pay-related payments if they exceeded a person's tax free allowance.  We were attacked by the Workers Party and other socialists because we tried to tackle the problem which is that if it is more profitable not to work, human nature being what it is, people will not do so.  It is not very pleasant to get up early in the morning and travel to work in traffic jams and bad weather.  If we are concerned about creating a future for the people and creating employment, we must think seriously about it.</P>
    <P>Absenteeism is caused on a large scale by a combination of our social welfare policies.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Mr. Corish and his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cluskey, in 1974 introduced pay-related payments.  This was a very progressive step.  Before 1974 the level of absenteesim was somewhere in the region of 4 per cent to 6 per cent.  Six or seven years later it had doubled or trebled. I was alarmed to hear that in some factories in Dublin there is an absenteeism of 30 per cent plus.  There is the Monday morning syndrome, the Friday afternoon syndrome and the January, February, March syndrome.  Absenteeism stifles the creation of new jobs.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations here are also a disincentive to creating employment.  There is no doubt that they are in an awful mess. That need not be.  I do not pretend that there are easy solutions but there are solutions.  There is a broad consensus between the social partners and the political parties on how most of the problems can be solved.  Most of us have commonsense.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a serious mistake when he was Minister for Labour previously about the commission on industrial relations.  Once the Irish Congress of Trade Unions withdrew from that commission it was inevitable that the report would be rejected and would not be <Col N="1002" /> acceptable as a basis for any progress on industrial relations.  That is how it turned out.  There is a basis for wider consensus both inside and outside the House to bring about the necessary changes and reforms so as to improve our industrial relations.  What reasons have I for saying that?  In trying to explain the difference between relations here and those in Sweden, Holland and Germany people say that we are not amenable to discipline.  I reject that.  We are a very disciplined race and there are many examples to prove it. For example, although last year may prove the exception, we have had more political stability than any other western European country.  That shows a discipline in voting and support.  There is discipline, but we do not have the leadership to harness it.</P>
    <P>The frequency and number of strikes, especially unofficial ones, contribute to the loss of thousands of jobs.  If an investor was looking for a location in which to site a new plant and looked at the scene in Ireland, Denmark or Holland, everything being equal, he would not choose Ireland because of our bad industrial relations.  Although this is important in its own right, I refer to it in the context of its impact on employment.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement have a duty to address themselves to these problems and put aside old prejudices and old principles in order to allow policies to be adopted which will increase the likelihood of job creation.  To give an example, the principle behind the Unfair Dismissals Act, which was passed in period between 1973 and 1977, is an excellent and correct one.  Again, the principle is excellent and correct.  I know the Minister has said that he intends introducing amending legislation later this year but has not said what type of legislation that will be.  Even though the principle is excellent and the motivation absolutely right the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act unintentionally are proving to be some of the greatest disincentives to employment because, once an employer engages somebody it is now almost impossible to get rid of that employee no matter how bad he or she may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> I shall be looking forward to hearing the Minister's proposals for amending that Act.  I do not know how one can overcome the real problems the operation of that Act is creating without violating the excellent principle which motivates that Act.  I know many employers who would rather not make extra profit, would rather not expand their operations rather than employ additional people because they feel the responsibility of so doing under the Unfair Dismissals Act is too great.  Such employers have had their fingers burned already by reckless, careless and irresponsible employees they cannot get rid of.  While raising the subject of this Unfair Dismissals Act I must emphasise that the principle motivating it is absolutely correct, that people must be protected in their employment.  But we must seek ways of reconciling that principle with the real problems emerging on the ground.</P>
    <P>The creation and maintenance of employment far outweigh the central economic challenge now facing us and indeed will continue to do so in the next 20 years.  Many things have been tried in the last five to ten years.  All sorts of policies have been adopted.  We have had work experience programmes which I must say I did not feel at the time of their initiation had much merit but which I must concede in practice have proved to be of considerable merit.  There is the employment incentive scheme, the youth employment premium scheme and then the Youth Employment Agency established by Deputy Kavanagh as Minister for Labour.  To some extent all these things have the appearance of creating work, in other words, of thinking up jobs rather than creating real jobs.  That would be all right if they were accompanied by other programmes creating real jobs but it is not all right if these are supposed to constitute a full answer to the problem. The only attempt to create employment is by way of these make-work jobs.  We can sustain these programmes only if at the same time we create sufficient other real jobs generating wealth which, in turn, will maintain the others.  I am afraid we have been very weak in the creation <Col N="1004" /> of real jobs.  That is why is so necessary and urgent that we examine in a comprehensive way the full range of Government policies to ascertain their impact on job creation and its maintenance, which is equally important.  Having assessed those policies having an adverse impact on employment we must then, as a Legislature, proceed to their amendment as best and as urgently as we can.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of employment and unemployment there are two further matters to which I want to refer. Firstly, there is the whole area of what might be described as the payroll taxes. Secondly, I might refer to the area of under-employment also constituting a massive threat.  To deal with the question of the payroll taxes it is worth repeating that it does not make sense, at our stage of economic development or in the context of our present and foreseeable economic problems, for us to pursue a policy of taxing employment which is effectively what we have been doing.  I know that to some extent this runs counter to the policies of the Government of which I had the honour of being a member.  But every additional expenditure we incur in the creation of a job renders its very creation less likely.  It must be said also that the burden of social contributions of all sorts has become so great that it is acting as a very real disincentive to job creation for many employers.  On the other hand, it has proved to be an incentive to some employers to go outside the white economy into the black and employ people who draw unemployment and social welfare assistance while at the same time working, which means that such employers do not have to stamp their cards and so on.  From what I see happening all round me it would appear that that practice is growing and is another adverse consequence of these payroll taxes.  It does not make sense for us to be taxing employment.  Admittedly, it is easy to say that but it is not so easy to suggest alternative sources of revenue. In the context of our present and foreseeable economic situation, in the context of our present and foreseeable employment position, we must think in dramatically new terms about the whole <Col N="1005" /> subject of employment.  That is one area that must be examined.</P>
    <P>Talking about the very depressing unemployment figures and their even more depressing portends, I must admit that there is one area which makes me very gloomy indeed, that if that of underemployment. I do not know what is the present position or that of last year but I do know from NESC reports that five years ago our economy, in the manufacturing industries sector, was producing less than half per work person that of the Danes, Belgians, Dutch and Luxemburgers, what are called the Benelux countries. In effect that means that had we the same levels of productivity as the Danes, Belgians, Dutch and Luxemburgers half of those in our manufacturing industry would be redundant.  Of course it must be remembered that, because of the competitive nature of that industry, that in turn means that potentially half our work force in that area are redundant.</P>
    <P>As competition gets tougher and tougher it is likely that more and more of those jobs will be lost.  There is only one other way by which those jobs can be saved and that is through low wages.  We can only get away with employing twice as many people as the Danes, the Belgians, the Dutch and the people from Luxembourg employ to produce one unit of production if we pay our workers half what they pay theirs.  That is the only other way we will maintain competitiveness. That is not a very happy thought.  If we went in that direction it would really be opting for continued work sharing, which was the great in-thing about four years ago.  Work sharing has been the way of the past because our productivity levels have always been such that we were employing more people to produce things than other countries found it necessary to employ.  Work sharing can only be continued if the gross pay bill for our employers is not greater than the gross pay bill of the Danes and the Dutch. Unfortunately that is not the case.  We may have to make the choice soon of opting for low wages relative to the Danes and the Dutch or opt for more unemployment.  That is a very harsh <Col N="1006" /> choice but I am afraid it will have to be made.</P>
    <P>I remember saying in the House, when discussions were going on about Ireland joining the European Monetary System, when all the pundits and commentators as well as most of the politicians were talking in terms of a revaluation of the punt within the EMS snake, that there would be no revaluation but devaluation unless our entry into the EMS was accompanied by a proper wages and incomes policy.  We did not have an incomes policy and we have floated downwards within the EMS.  This will continue to happen.</P>
    <P>Devaluation has an impact on employment and the standard of living.  I am worried about the effects of devaluation but I am also worried about the absence of an incomes policy.  I do not mean an incomes policy for this year, I mean an underlying principle of how incomes should go over the next few years and an overriding consensus on why such a policy is necessary.  The overriding principle will be the principle of maintaining and creating jobs because if we do not tackle the problem, if we do not think in dramatically new terms about employment I doubt if the democratic system can survive the type of unemployment figures which are now being envisaged for the end of this decade.</P>
    <P>I will not speak for much longer although I have much to say, because I realise there are many Estimates to be taken today.  I ask the Minister for Labour, who is also Minister for the Public Service, not to be afraid to think in dramatically new terms about industrial relations and employment.  He should not be afraid to approach the Opposition to seek a consensus for job creation and a job maintenance policy because it is in all our interests that we turn the corner, the downward spiral is halted and we start climbing back up again to fuller employment.  If the Government fail we all fail, if they succeed we all succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and Deputy Jim Mitchell for their kind remarks about me while I was in the Department of Labour.  I cannot join <Col N="1007" /> with the same enthusiasm the Deputy's welcome of the Minister back to the Department of Labour.  I was quite prepared to stay on there a little longer.  My period in the Department of Labour was a high point in my political career, which I enjoyed.  I had the greatest co-operation from the staff in that Department from the top to the bottom.  I can only pay the greatest tribute to the personnel in the Department for the unstinting way they helped me through the difficult periods I faced in that Department and the great ability and knowledge which the staff of that Department have about the various areas of their responsibility, particularly industrial relations.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the former Secretary of the Department of Labour, Mr. Tadhg Ó Cearbhaill, who retired during my term in the Department.  I want to say, on behalf of everybody who served with him, how grateful we are to him.  In fact, one could say we served under him because he was a very dominant figure in that Department.  He created the Department along with the first Minister for Labour, who is now our President.  He saw it through the early years when the formation period was so important to the future of the Department. It is now a major Department and great credit must go to Mr. Tadhg Ó Cearbhaill for the work he put into the Department.  I wish his successor, Mr. Finlay, well in his new job.  He served for many years as second in command and his knowledge and ability is unquestioned.</P>
      <P>I have to be a little more critical in my remarks from now on.  The financial allocations for the different services of the Department of Labour and their agencies as outlined in the Minister's statement are, with one exception, as decided by me when I was Minister for Labour.  The exception is the Employment Incentive Scheme for which the Minister for Finance provided an additional £4 million in the Budget and on which I will be commenting later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech is disappointing because of its superficial treatment of nationally important issues and because <Col N="1008" /> of his failure to give any indication of policy priorities or of his likely approach to particular areas of departmental responsibilities.  There are vocations where the practice of silence is both uplifting and appropriate.  Membership of Government and the effective discharge of ministerial responsibilities require, however, a certain basic level of communication so that the public can be aware of what is being done or proposed on their behalf.  In its absence they may suspect inactivity and become restive. The silence from Mespil Road since early March is a curiosity to many. Last week the executive of the FUE could take it no longer and in a strident statement sought information on the Minister for Labour's industrial relations policy. I am not aware that they have had any satisfaction to date and the contents of the Minister's Estimate speech certainly will not provide it on that or any other major issue relevant to the work of the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>As indicated the bulk of the estimates sought will be devoted to industrial training and employment-oriented schemes and programmes.  The overall thrust of these is to improve the quality of the labour supply in the expectation that by doing so we will also enhance the chances of participants gaining worthwhile employment.  That thesis more easily translates to reality in times of economic expansion but, nonetheless, education, work experience or industrial training cannot but be an asset to those seeking jobs.  Facile attempts to explain away the seriousness of the present unemployment situation are no help at all.  In his speech the Minister contends that IDA job creation and £50 million for the building industry will stabilise the current level of unemployment and then start to reduce it.  He does not say when this development will come about no more than he explains how.  Factory closures and increasing numbers of redundancies do not intrude to distort the cost picture he paints.  The people are showing with increasing regularity an impatience with those who underestimate their intelligence and sophistication.  The present <Col N="1009" /> Minister for Labour would do well to remember that.</P>
    <P>We have a very serious unemployment problem and recent authoritative and objective commentaries on emerging trends forecast continuing high numbers of people, and particularly young people, without jobs in the period immediately ahead.  Despite this greater progress can now be made than before to cater for the vocational needs of our youth.  In my period as Minister for Labour I established the Youth Employment Agency with the mandate, the structure and the resources to make an urgent comprehensive contribution towards alleviating and overcoming the problem of involuntary unemployment among those under 25 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be said that the Deputy just beat the deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>But the fact is that it was done in a very short period of time. In doing this the co-ordination of existing schemes of training and work experience and the initiation of new and imaginative departures to meet the job needs of unemployed youth are major tasks.  The time is opportune for all local communities to consider their potential for making a contribution to the employment futures of their young people.  I am convinced that local enterprise has much untapped employment potential not only in small-scale industrial ventures but also in agricultural and horticultural enterprises. The agency can assist in the establishment of co-operative ventures by young people and I am hopeful that this dimension will be developed in the period ahead.  I fully support the Minister in exhorting all to co-operate fully with the Youth Employment Agency and so assist them in effectively discharging the centrally important tasks for which they were established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated the only heading where there is any variation in the level of financial allocation proposed, as against the estimates settled by me in advance of leaving office, relates to the employment incentive scheme.  Here the original estimate has been increased from <Col N="1010" /> £2 million to £6 million as announced in the Minister for Finance's budget speech.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the improvements made to this scheme and in particular the increased level of premia payable to persons over 25 years and over 26 weeks without a job, I have some reservations which I hope the Minister will allay when replying.  First, I would ask where the additional £4 million is coming from.  Secondly, expenditure on this scheme in 1981 amounted to only about £1.21 million. Even allowing for the improved rates of premia and the longer duration in which payments will be made, I find it very difficult to see anything approaching £6 million being spent in 1982.  I should like to know the Minister's views on this. Thirdly, perhaps the Minister would tell me the date from which the revisions to the scheme will be applicable.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister innocuously mentions that &ldquo;the scheme has been simplified from the point of view of the employers who wish to claim.&rdquo;  I am very anxious indeed to have clarification as to what those words are intended to convey and with good reason because we recall that in 1977 this scheme was extended to insurance and banking sectors and almost £500,000 was paid almost entirely to the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks to encourage employment in these sectors. I recall that about 1,300 jobs were created by way of that expenditure.  We need hardly tell the House that there is absolutely no need to encourage these sectors to use public funds to extend their numbers when we are aware of the profit being made in this sector of the economy. I am anxious that none of the £6 million would go in that direction this time.  I am, nevertheless, interested to know if the scheme will be extended to the building industry which could use this level of incentive to encourage the employment of thousands of people presently unemployed in the industry.</P>
    <P>The enactment of progressive labour legislation to protect the interests of working people is the most durable testimony to the commitment of a Minister for Labour.  Nowhere has the positive effects of the Labour Party's participation in Government in the lot of ordinary <Col N="1011" /> men and women been more effectively demonstrated than in the legislative programme which Deputy O'Leary when Minister for Labour put on the Statute Book.  During that period, nine major labour laws were enacted relating to issues such as holiday entitlements, employment protection, unfair dismissal, equality in pay and working conditions, worker participation and trade union amalgamations.  These have provided a statutory base for proper standards for workers where none previously existed or updated legislative provisions where it was no longer objectively effective. Every day since those laws were enacted workers and employers have availed of the structures established to ensure equitable treatment for all in the work place. This body of legislation has been practically applied with few problems in the intervening period.  When in Government I had announced the commencement of a comprehensive review of the operation of the Anti-Discrimination Pay Act, 1974, the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, with a view to seeing if they could be improved in any way on the experience gained in their operation to date.  I am pleased that the Minister proposes to proceed with that review.</P>
    <P>On what the Minister describes in his speech as two completely new pieces of legislation which he himself proposes to have enacted &mdash; dealing with hours of work and protection for workers on off-shore installations &mdash; there are a few points I want to make.  The first point is that there is nothing new about either proposal.  Hours of work legislation, to update the 1930s law which as a matter of fact has never been enforced, was promised in the national understanding of 1980.  There it specifically stated that the appropriate Bill would be introduced in the first Dáil session in 1981.  That commitment, like many others in the 1980 national understanding, was not delivered on as promised.  It re-emerges here without any reference to its previous <Col N="1012" /> history and is offered by the Minister as a completely new legislative initiative.</P>
    <P>The other novel legislative departure which the Minister proposes concerns the introduction of legislation to provide for the safety and health of workers on off-shore installations.  This has been a standard offer in speeches by the Minister over some years now when previously in the Department of Labour.  The real crux here has to do with the extent of the right to legislate for off-shore territory.  This is tied up with the deliberations of the Law of the Sea Conference which has been proceeding in Geneva for many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to remind the Minister of the irritants that were in the Department when I arrived, an office which he occupied some months before my arrival.  Finality will most likely take many more years to arrive at.  The Minister gave the impression today that he <Col N="1013" /> can somehow shortcut the deliberations of the Law of the Sea Conference.  I hope he can.  I would not like to see the country dragged before an international court.  I will be surprised if the Minister can make progress with this legislation in the near future but if he can he will certainly have my support.  We must wait to see what emerges.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Agency which was established under the Employment Equality Act of 1977 has been a major force for beneficial change in practice and attitudes on the employment, education and training of women since its inception.  Through its work many of the barriers which had prevented access of women to employment and job training have been removed.  Women and men now work in jobs from which they had previously been debarred.  We see female post delivery personnel and bus conductors, there are male air stewards where previously there were none.  These are but some of the more obvious examples of the result of work undertaken by the Employment Equality Agency.  The less public aspects of changing attitudes and breaking down discriminatory practices also progresses behind the scenes.  A real test of commitment to its objectives is demonstrated by the level of financial provision which it is allocated.  During the period 1977-81 its initial derisory budgetary level was increased only in line with inflationary trends.  No effort was made to give it the resources, financial and otherwise, to allow it do its job with maximum effectiveness.  In these circumstances, the agency has performed remarkably well.  I had increased the level of this year's grant to the agency by 60 per cent, the first real increase on a nominal initial allocation which it has received to date.  I am pleased that the Minister has not changed that level of grant allocation. I hope that, whatever the period of tenure of this administration, it will show a more positive approach to eliminating discrimination against women in our society that it has done in the past.  I am sure the Minister will maintain that level of expansion of resources to that agency which has done tremendous work in the area of equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> The promotion of worker participation, given its first formal structuring in the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, of 1977 has patently not been a priority of Fianna Fáil Ministers, since the extension of the Act to other State enterprises has been talked about for years by Gene Fitzgerald but no positive advances have been made.  I was glad to see that he had met the worker directors and I hope that as a result he will be spurred on to do more.  Only in March 1980 did the discussion document on worker participation appear after a very long era of promises.  It is most depressing to hear today from the Minister that, now that submissions on the discussion document are all in, yet another report to assess these is to be prepared.  This only further long-fingers the time for taking decisions which might lead to progress in the application of worker participation to employments.  Now that we know what other interest groups think of worker participation, surely it is well time that the Minister let people know his own personal and political views on the issue.  To appear to be always striving for consensus can often be an effective disguise for seeking only to do nothing.</P>
    <P>I have noted the Minister's remarks on the review of the European Social Fund and his determination to ensure that any changes proposed should not result in any reduction in financial aid to this country. That was the policy line which I had communicated to the European Commission and will obviously continue to support. Income from the social fund is very substantial indeed and has increased each year since we joined the EEC.  The extent of our industrial training and employment scheme has been directly influenced by the level of income from the fund and failure to protect our interests fully in renegotiation of the ground rules for benefit would be disastrous.  I am confident that our interests will be protected in the course of this exercise.  While on the subject of aid from the social fund, I had expected the Minister to indicate the progress of negotiations with the European Commission to retrieve in excess of £700,000 which Ireland was disallowed because of the Minister's failure to submit <Col N="1015" /> the claim form by the date specified. This was to have been considered by the European Court of Justice and I would appreciate if in his reply the Minister would outline any developments that have occurred in the intervening period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, I want to make some comments on the subject of industrial relations.  The establishment by the Minister of a Commission on Industrial Relations in 1978 could have been a highly significant development.  As events have turned out it was not.</P>
      <P>The Minister adamantly refused to amend the 1906 Trade Disputes Act at the request of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and so precipitated their decision at the 1979 annual delegate conference to suspend participation in the deliberations of the commission until that act was amended.  The ICTU representatives were not to participate again in its activities but as things turned out they should never have had to leave.  The 1980 national understanding, concluded when the Commission on Industrial Relations was about to report, committed the Government to amend the 1906 Trade Disputes Act as the congress had requested two years previously.  No explanation has ever been given as to why it could be conceded in 1980 but not in 1978.  There was obviously no fundamental point of principle involved.  In the context of getting a national understanding in 1980 expediency and intimidation were the vogue terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile, the hard work of many committed people in the CIR was devalued because of the absence of any <Col N="1016" /> philosophy to introduce industrial relations on the part of the present Minister. What could have been a fundamental and significant report drawn up with the active co-operation of the trade union movement and pointing towards improvements in our industrial relations practices and procedures is now gently disowned by the Minister in his speech. His previously expressed expectations for the report have been hugely scaled down and he now sees it only as providing &ldquo;a useful focal point&rdquo; around which to commence discussion once again.  This sorry saga of wasted time and resources could have been avoided at no cost whatsoever. The fact that it was not has put a major question mark over the capacity of the Minister to achieve any improvements in the area of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>On coming to the Department of Labour last July 1 was fully aware that the practice of direct ministerial intervention in industrial disputes was gravely undermining the functions of the statutory dispute-setting agencies such as the Labour Court and its conciliation service.  The situation had become so farcical that on occasion not one but two Government ministers, as well as the Taoiseach himself, were meeting with parties to industrial disputes to discuss the issues involved.  The present Minister came back from his secondment to the Department of Finance to partner his ministerial successor in discussions with the petrol tanker drivers who were on strike in the early part of last year.  Such actions had the effect of prolonging strikes rather than solving them.  My policy was to leave the job of solving industrial conflict to those paid by the taxpayers of the country to do it.  I did not see that the Minister for Labour had any role in intervening directly in the issues in dispute.  It is not any part of his brief to tell employers or workers how much should be paid for any particular job. Those are matters for negotiation or appropriate and expert third party intervention. I think I succeeded in establishing that.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister's approach will be this time around &mdash; making the fairly broad <Col N="1017" /> assumption that he is afforded the freedom to determine that policy for himself.</P>
    <P>The Minister who is taking office has had a period of unique industrial peace such as we have not seen for many years which has resulted from the approach of the previous Government to pay bargaining and to the public service agreement on pay and also, as I have said, to the policy approach of the Department of Labour to industrial disputes.  I hope that the Minister will not waste this time of industrial peace which contrasts so vividly with the period when I came into office when bus workers were on strike and in various Department of Government the public servants also were on strike.  We had a long and difficult strike in Tara mines.  I could go on and on.  The Minister has had a period of industrial peace in which to formulate policy for wage agreements over his period of office.  Before the last election and during that election he promised to renegotiate the national wage agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Your author is wrong again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  Also in his speech after the budget failed the now Minister for Education &mdash; and he should read it &mdash; promised that this would be done.  The Minister must admit that he has now succeeded to a situation of industrial peace on a very large scale such as has not been known for years.  I have said some hard words to him, but now I give him advice which he should take.  He should use the time to ensure that this industrial peace continues.  Groups representing employers, such as the CII, have indicated that there is an upturn for manufacturing industries and exports. This has occurred because of the policy of the previous Government on industrial peace and wage settlements.  If that upsurge continues we will see a reduction in the inflation rate which had begun to fall when we left office.  We will see also a fall in the unemployment figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I tell the Minister to remain vigilant in this area and then this country can overcome its many difficulties.  I intend to return to the wider economic <Col N="1018" /> situation in the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach which usually concludes this Dáil term, but today I want to be specific about the job of the Department of Labour.  I would have liked to see the Estimate for the Department of the Public Service taken at the same time, but that was not done and so I cannot ask the Minister about such items as the Ombudsman and policy in that area. When I asked questions of the Minister on the Department of Labour and the Department of the Public Service I can only say that because of the volume of questions on the Order Paper I have had to take written replies and therefore could not quiz the Minister in the House. Those replies were totally unsatisfactory. I hope that we will have an opportunity for a much broader discussion on the whole area of industrial employment, taking in the public sector also.</P>
    <P>I have had strong criticism to make of the Minister's work in the Department in the past.  He now has a second opportunity to approach it with an example that was set recently.  I hope he will take that opportunity to progress in a way more positive than we have seen on previous occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the other speakers I extend a hearty welcome to the Minister on his resumption in the Department of Labour of his State responsibilities. I accept that at this time he is facing the most formidable task ever confronted by him or any of his predecessors in assembling the mechanism necessary to give training and work experience and bring about a reduction in the colossal volume of youth unemployment here.  I will be brief because of the time limit on us, but I want to make a few points.  I subscribe tremendously to the contribution AnCO are making to the training of our youth, but from my experience of the multiplicity of courses they run some of them are quite short with no real end product in view.  The repetition of these course sometimes leads to frustration among the students and people involved. Really there is no goal and such courses do not result in the employment to which <Col N="1019" /> they aspire.  Longer and more fundamental training courses which lead eventually to positive employment bring about the best results.</P>
      <P>A widening of the work experience programme in relation to the Manpower Service is necessary.  Not only must these courses be run in the larger centres of population but they should also be taken out among the community with a view to tapping very valuable resources and preventing school leavers from turning to the labour exchange rather than to an employment incentive scheme which could fit them for subsequent employment.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give particular attention to the problem of apprenticeships because these are vital to the individuals concerned and to the whole community.  Over wide areas in the west there are no sponsors for apprenticeships and in my constituency there is not a single sponsor in the electrical trade.  This is a trade to which many young people aspire but despite their aptitudes and qualifications they are unable to obtain sponsors.  A similar situation exists in the engineering, joinery and carpentry trades.  There are many school leavers of high calibre with aspirations to these trades and I suggest that the Minister's Department in consultation with other bodies should set aside a number of apprenticeships for which AnCO, the National Manpower Service or the Department of Labour would arrange the necessary sponsorships.  This would be doing a service not only to the students but also to the communities they would serve on completion of their training. Such people would assist in the development of small industries.  The absence of sponsors for apprenticeships delays the provision of skills in the areas where they are most required.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Youth Employment Agency, local project teams of young unemployed should be set up and their views should be ascertained as to how best they could be formed into units so that the different agencies operating under the Department could guide, direct and help them financially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> I disagree with the suggestion that the present levels of social welfare payments are a disincentive to work.  Let us accept that there is poverty in only one sector of the community and that is the sector which depends on social welfare benefits. Anyone who has experienced the frustration of workers who are faced with the possible closure of a factory will accept that there is no ready willingness on their part to become unemployed.  Much is being made of the suggestion that the levels of social welfare payments contribute to the high level of unemployment because people do not want to work. Every public representative and factory manager knows of the strong representations which are being made with a view to obtaining employment.  The fact is that our people have not the opportunity to work and they have no option but to rely on social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take particular note of my plea in relation to apprenticeships. The area from which I come is seriously handicapped by the lack of sponsorships in various trades.  Many of our young people who aspire to achieving qualifications are denied the necessary opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the suggestion by the Minister to limit excessive overtime.  This has become a regular feature in industry and overtime payments are accepted as a normal part of a person's income.  When overtime is not available it is very hard for such a person to accept a lower standard.  I contend that overtime should be restricted because there is a tendency on the part of employers to allow some people to work any amount of overtime while others are unemployed.</P>
      <P>We now have quite an amount of legislation which is of direct importance to workers.  It deals with such matters as safety in industry, unfair dismissals and employment equality.  It is unfortunate that so many workers have to refer their case to the rights commissioner or the appeals tribunal set up under the unfair dismissals legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One speaker asked what protection management have.  We must look at manabl <Col N="1021" /> agement and recognise that many problems in industry can be attributed in no uncertain manner to the appointment of incompetent people.  The standard of management is very low.  Workers on the factory floor must see that their factory is being run by a competent person who has close liaison with the workforce. There should be no question of making appointments simply for the sake of making appointments because when workers see that happening they begin to ask why they should bother.  Management must be competent to run industry and must enjoy good relations with the workers. Many problems would thus be eliminated.</P>
    <P>So many agencies have now been established that it is difficult to see what exactly is being done to create youth employment.  The National Manpower Service are not really playing their part, possibly because their terms of reference are not correct.  There is no point in an unemployed person going to the NMS, having his name put on the register and hoping that some day he will get a call saying that a job is available.  There is nothing to reassure such people that they will get an opportunity to compete for jobs.  The attitude of some employers to the National Manpower Service is not what it should be and in some cases the use of the service is merely a cosmetic exercise.  There should be a more thorough follow-up in this area.  We must not forget that employers receive grants and we must ensure that there is fair play towards people who are unemployed.  It is the sons and daughters of well-off people who are getting employment, the children of people who may be earning incomes of £20,000 or £25,000 a year. Yet, at the same time, the children of unemployed people are walking the streets.</P>
    <P>Worker participation has been mentioned. Worker participation is worthwhile, but it would be more beneficial if we had built into the legislation provision for a system providing for participation below board level.  At the moment workers are elected by their fellow-workers to the board of a company but there is no provision to refer back to the <Col N="1022" /> workforce.  It is a haphazard arrangement with no substance.  I ask the Minister to consider providing for worker participation below board level.</P>
    <P>Statements have been made that unemployed people are getting more than people who are at work.  That may be the case, but I think it is somewhat overplayed.  There has been talk of taxing social welfare benefits as though that were the answer, but it is ludicrous to suggest such a course.  I will give the House a few statistics to illustrate my point.  Recent figures on payments made under pay-related benefit schemes highlight the backwardness of the approach of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The Coalition Government proposed to tax short-term welfare benefits.  The average pay-related element in unemployment benefit amounted only to £19.32 per week in 1981.  The pay-related element runs out totally after 15 months and a person aspiring to get the average male industrial wage while being unemployed would need to have at least 14 children. So much for the theory that thousands are earning more on unemployment benefit than they would if they were lucky enough to have job.</P>
    <P>It is wrong and unjust to have a system where a young boy or girl of 19 or 20 years, who has no income and who is registered for unemployment assistance, is assessed not only on the income of their parents but also on the income of their brothers and sisters in the house.  That system is quite wrong.  I see great frustration in people who have been assessed in that way.  Young people want to work and do not want to stay on unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation to protect workers.  It is unfortunate that it has to be so strong but that can be attributed to the fact that in most cases management are not up to standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate, and particularly Deputy Mitchell for his kind words and good wishes.  With regard to Deputy Kavanagh, I cannot be blamed if the electorate decided that his <Col N="1023" /> term of office should be so brief.  I was disappointed at the general tenor of his contribution: he showed a little bitterness that is not typical of that Deputy.  I am sorry he is not present, although I understand fully the reason, because I would have liked him to hear my comments on what he said.  I thank the Deputies for the points mentioned and the issues raised and I want to assure them that what they have said will be considered and taken into account in any decisions being made.  However, I shall reply specifically to some of the points mentioned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell started by departing somewhat from the area of labour into that of social welfare.  The matter of incentive or disincentive to work is a broader issue and, strictly speaking, it is a matter for discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare. One could argue on many lines about the incentive or disincentive to work.  However, we must not forget the many under-privileged people in our society, those who are unemployed, the sick and other vulnerable groups.  At times it seems to me that such people are being made a target for criticism and are held responsible for certain problems in society.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke about absenteeism. This is a matter of grave concern. Deputy Sherlock was right in saying that he appeared to confine it to just one issue, the disincentive or incentive of the social welfare benefits.  The reasons for absenteeism are interesting and varied. Although there are no firm statistics available in any of the European countries, the trend of labour surveys seems to indicate that growth in absenteeism is common to European member countries. It is a modern phenomenon and is a rather serious matter.  It is costing industry a considerable amount of money and is putting an additional burden on fellow-workers.  At the moment there is an inter-departmental committee working on the matter which involves a number of Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell that this is a serious issue, but I do not agree that the sole reason is the disincentive to work.  It has become a European problem <Col N="1024" /> and needs to be examined closely.  I will certainly be interested in the departmental committee's findings when they come in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also referred to the taxation of employment.  We are mainly talking about youth employment and incentive schemes.  Deputy Mitchell's figures are based on the continuation of existing trends.  Our budget will help to get people back to work.  There was criticism of the provision of extra money for the building industry.  Deputy Kavanagh said it was not sufficient.  It was £50 million more than the previous Government thought fit to provide for that industry. To provide employment in industry we acted quickly and provided job opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of the Youth Employment Agency will be helpful and I have already complimented my predecessor on setting up the agency and have continued to support it myself. If Deputy Kavanagh were honest he would admit that I walked into a dispute situation, that he had created an industrial relations problem in the Youth Employment Agency on a very day he left office, as the public press acknowledged. I supported the Deputy because I thought he had taken the right decision and I complimented him in the House for having taken that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I want to go on to some of the points raised by Deputy Kavanagh.  He referred to the attitude of Ministers to the problem of industrial relations, an indication of his short time in that Department.  Ministerial intervention has been debated in this House and outside it over the years.  If a Minister intervenes he may be blamed for settling at too high a price or for not settling at all.  If he does not intervene he may be criticised because the public are deprived of some service.  I supported the non-intervention policy and have always done so.  But there are times when the public generally require that every possible step be taken by the Minister.  If Deputy Kavanagh were honest he would also admit that the <Col N="1025" /> quiet behind-the-scenes interventions that no Minister can claim credit for are the ones that make the greater contribution to periods of industrial peace such as we have at the moment.  I do not like to say that because one never knows what will happen tomorrow.  But there is fluctuation. Let not Deputy Kavanagh think that in his long wet day in the Department he succeeded in achieving anything like that.  He did not.  These things happen intermittently.</P>
    <P>Let me be more specific in regard to the Deputy's reference to the 1906 Act. In the document prepared in the Gaiety, Deputy Kavanagh's Government agreed to amend the 1906 Act.  Yet by 9 March in had not been amended.  Perhaps there were difficulties that prevented him from amending it by 9 March.  I accept his personal commitment to it but I suspect the commitment of some of his colleagues was not as great.  However, I would like to correct him on one point, because obviously he did not spend a lot of time in the Department of Labour or do as much homework as I thought he might have done.  If he had read all the national understandings through he would have realised that I too regretted the withdrawal of Congress from the Committee on Industrial Relations.  In the relevant national understanding there was a strong commitment by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to participate fully in the work of the Committee on Industrial Relations.  But subsequently the decision to withdraw was taken at their delegate conference.  I regret the decision but I am convinced that we can make progress using certain aspects of that report as an agenda for discussion.  Despite the Deputy's criticism on consensus, I will always strive for consensus in delicate issues between employer and trade union bodies here.  I welcome Deputy Mitchell's offer of discussion with the Opposition on matters of that nature.  I would certainly like to discuss such matters with the Opposition's spokesman in his term of office.  As I said, consensus between employer and trade union bodies is important, and if we in this House can achieve something by discussion I am all <Col N="1026" /> for it and I am quite prepared to discuss these items with the Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell asked about the Unfair Dismissals Act.  I am loth to accept his argument that the Act operates as a major discouragement to employment. It is mentioned often and it is an exaggeration.  It has not had a major impact.  I never object to paying tribute when it is warranted and I admit that it was introduced during Deputy O'Leary's time in office.  But it happened to coincide with emerging reforms of that nature through our EEC entry.  But nevertheless I complimented my predecessor many times for it.  I would always hope to be more generous than my predecessor.</P>

I want it to be specifically useful to workers and employers.  I would hope that the interference of law would not become too severe a penalty.  My predecessor would probably agree with that in regard to the Act.  It was introduced to make it as easy as possible for employees in certain circumstances to have access to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  After four or five years in operation it should be looked at to see if improvements could be made.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan for his contribution because only he and Deputy Sherlock referred to AnCO.  That organisation should be complimented for taking the responsibility of training many young people.  I sympathise with the point raised by Deputy Moynihan about sponsorship in some trades in certain parts of the country.  This situation is worse in the west and south-west where there is very little employment in skilled areas where apprentices could be sponsored.  AnCO try as far as possible to get young people apprenticed in their own areas.  I do not see any solution to the problem of sending apprentices outside their own area except to say that AnCO try to place apprentices in their own areas as far as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards apprenticeships the difference between this recession and the last is that it appears industry are more concerned to continue apprenticeships now. I welcome that move and we should all encourage it because industry will ultimately benefit.  The more skilled people that are available at times of boom and growth the better for industry.  I urge people who are not committed to this idea to support AnCO's training policy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock introduced an element which causes concern.  He mentioned the different agencies and the people who operate the schemes.  We have AnCO, the National Manpower Service, the Department of Education and the Youth Employment Agency. There is a certain amount of confusion in the public mind about who is doing what. There were recent discussions on this subject but it is very important that there be co-operation amongst all the agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock was critical of the National Manpower Service, I think unjustly, but I will be looking at this service to see if some changes need to be made.  It is unfair to be so critical of that service in times of high unemployment because they have great difficulty at such a time in placing people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Deputy who wishes to talk to me about any aspect of the Department of Labour is welcome to come to me because it is very important that every <Col N="1028" /> Government Department is as efficient as possible.  If there is room for improvement we should decide what to do to provide a better service for the public. The vital function of the Department of the Public Service is the overall training and raising the quality of the civil service and we should all help towards that end. I have not mentioned the incentive schemes but I have all the answers and the Deputy need have no reservations.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas I should and could cover but before I conclude I want to support what Deputy Kavanagh said about the officials in the Department of Labour.  One is inclined to say more about a person when he retires than when he is serving but at a time like this it is nice that we commend people who are so often unfairly criticised by the media. The majority of civil servants work very diligently.  I support the comments about the recently retired secretary of the Department of Labour who was in the Department for a very long time.  I join with Deputy Kavanagh in paying a tribute to him now that he is no longer in the civil service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> That a sum not exceeding £845,574,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1982, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chlaraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and a grant-in-aid. </P>
    <P>I had hoped to give a more comprehensive speech but because of the time limit, I have substantially cut my speech.</P>
    <P>The gross non-capital provision in the Estimate amounts to £865.874 million. Allowing for appropriations-in-aid at £69.5 million the net non-capital grant provision is £796.374 million.  The net non-capital grant provision represents an increase of about £67 million on the out-turn for 1981.</P>
    <P>The capital provision included in the Estimate amounts to £49.2 million.</P>
    <P>Vote 51 &mdash; increases in remuneration and pensions &mdash; contains £53.657 million in respect of the 1982 Exchequer liability arising from pay adjustments for health services personnel based on the proposals for an agreement on pay in the public service.  The 1982 budget provisions for the health services will be covered in a Supplementary Estimate which will be introduced later in the year.</P>
    <P>The Estimate which I have moved was prepared by my predecessor who approved of non-capital allocations for health agencies which were related to the level of grant provision in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>When I assumed office I found that the reaction from health agencies to the levels of allocations approved had been distinctly unfavourable.  There was general agreement among health boards that unless the allocations were increased serious consequences for the health services could not be avoided.  It emerged that the overall allocation was about £48 million short of what was needed to maintain services at 1981 levels.  The seriousness of the position was made clear at a <Col N="1030" /> meeting which I had with the chairman and chief executive officers of health boards on 2 April last.  Among the more drastic measures which were considered to be necessary to contain expenditure within approved levels were the closure of hospital wards for protracted periods, significant reductions in numbers covered by medical cards, severe curtailment of vital community services such as home help services and meals on wheels and cutbacks in services for disadvantaged groups such as the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped.  Unprecedented reductions in numbers employed would also have been required to secure the necessary savings.</P>
    <P>Despite the financial constraints imposed by the difficult economic situation, the Government considered that it was necessary to provide extra funds to ensure that community based health services could at least be maintained at a reasonable level and that the measures which would undoubtedly be required to control expenditure on hospital services would not be such as to deprive people of essential hospital care.  The Government, therefore, decided to provide an additional £28 million in the budget to ease the severe financial constraints in the health services.  The effect of these extra funds has been to reduce the overall deficiency in the allocation for health services to about £20 million.</P>
    <P>Despite the extra funds provided for health boards, voluntary hospitals and homes for mentally handicapped persons, there is still undoubtedly a gap between the increased allocation levels approved and estimated requirements.  I know that difficulties are arising in bridging this gap.  I must, however, emphasise that the Government have gone as far as they can go in providing extra funds for health services in the current year.  It is now the responsibility of the health agencies to achieve the necessary economies. This will require the full support of all personnel, both in hospitals and in the community.  But I must emphasise that the situation is now in my opinion manageable, if undoubtedly difficult.  It represents a challenge, not an impossibility.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on health services has <Col N="1031" /> risen rapidly in recent years.  In 1977 the net non-capital cost amounted to £328 million.  In the current year, taking account of increases in pay costs and the budget provisions for the health services, the cost will reach £978 million.  In 1977 health services absorbed 6 per cent of GNP.  This year the percentage will be about 8 per cent.  Some of this can be accounted for by the increasing welfare dimensions in the form of better community-based health and personal social services.  This is a development which we have promoted.</P>
    <P>Other factors which have given rise to the increase in health costs over this period include extensions in entitlement to services, specific developments in the services, improvements in medical technology and the increasing demand for services, partly accounted for by a rising population.</P>
    <P>The main reasons for the rising costs are, however, increases in pay and increases in the price of goods and services.  Pay costs have increased from £197 million in 1977 to about £652 million in the current year.  This is due to increases in the numbers of personnel employed in the health services, the application of national pay awards to health services staffs and, in particular, to costly special pay awards for many grades of health personnel settled under the established negotiating machinery. Pay costs now represent 64 per cent of overall expenditure on health services and about 70 per cent of expenditure in the acute hospital sector.  It is clear, therefore, that measures to contain expenditure on health services must centre largely on the area of pay and personnel.</P>
    <P>Unless the pay element in the cost of health services can be stabilised there is a real danger that the funds that can be provided by the Exchequer for our health services will not be sufficient to support the present work force, and that largescale disemployment and disruption of services will inevitably take place.</P>
    <P>During the course of the past 12 months because of the present difficult economic situation the Government have <Col N="1032" /> found it necessary to restrain the creation of additional employment in the health services.  These constraints apply not only to the health services but are of general application throughout the public service.  In the present circumstances, therefore, it is of increasing importance to make the most effective use of our existing staff so as to enable essential improvements and developments to take place.  It is important that there should be maximum flexibility in the deployment of personnel and posts in order to ensure that they are allocated to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that over the next few years, funds required to effect essential improvements in the health services must largely come from savings on existing services.  It is, therefore, imperative to research, as quickly as possible, how savings can be achieved and to take the necessary steps as soon as possible to realise these savings.  I have, therefore, set up a special unit in my Department to explore ways and means of identifying areas where savings in cost can be achieved without detriment to the effectiveness of the services concerned.</P>
    <P>One such area for close examination is the general hospital service.  Institutional services account for 75 per cent of the expenditure on health services and about two-thirds of the institutional services costs relate to general hospitals.  This year the average cost per patient in a general teaching hospital will amount to about £665 a week.  It is noteworthy that in the period 1960 to 1980 the numbers admitted to acute general hospitals increased from 250,000 to 540,000 per annum.  We must now try to concentrate the minds of all concerned on the steps required to stem the tide of hospital admissions, to ensure that only those who really need to be admitted are referred for in-patient care and to provide treatment to the maximum degree possible either at general practitioner level or on an out-patient or day care basis.</P>
    <P>It is also essential to eliminate any unnecessary expenditure on hospital services for those who are admitted.  The aim should be to provide services with the maximum degree of efficiency.  Evaluation <Col N="1033" /> of efficiency depends largely on the development of better information systems regarding comparative costs in order that each hospital can assess its own performance by reference to the performance of other comparable hospitals.</P>
    <P>A number of preliminary studies have already been undertaken by my Department and these have shown wide variations in certain areas of expenditure between hospitals in broadly similar categories, variations which cannot be readily explained.  For example, the cost of drugs in one major hospital was 30 per cent greater than in another comparable hospital.  These comparative costings will be of considerable value to the new research unit in probing further into this complex, but I hope rewarding, examination.</P>
    <P>I have circulated to Deputies the most up-to-date volume of statistical information relevant to the health services.  This information is set out by reference to the main health programmes.  It will help Deputies to understand what is happening in each programme.  I would like to refer here to some features of the vital and health statistics which are of particular relevance.</P>
    <P>The percentage of the population in the dependant age groups &mdash; that is under 15 years of age or over 65 years of age &mdash; is important because it is from these age groups that the major demands are made on the health services.  41.3 per cent of the Irish population was in this category at the time of the 1979 population census.  This, by international standards, is high.  It is higher than the corresponding percentage for any other member state of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Irish birth rate continues to be, by far, the highest of the EEC member state. In 1980 the rate was 21.9 live births per 1,000 population, a total of 74,388 births. This is the highest annual number of births recorded in this century.  Less than 1 per cent of these births now take place at home.  It is very encouraging to report that infant mortality, which is accepted as one of the important indicators of the general state of health of a community, is continuing to decline in Ireland.  As recently as 1960, the rate was <Col N="1034" /> 29.3 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. By 1970 this rate had fallen to 19.5.  In 1980 it was down to 11.2.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the continuing increase in the number of persons being admitted to the acute hospitals.  In 1980 the number of admissions was about 540,000 or 158 admissions per 1,000 of the population.  This is one of the areas which will be studied by the new research unit to see what scope there may be to control admissions to our very efficient but very costly hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the psychiatric hospitals the number of patients in residence continues to decline.  It has fallen from about 20,000 in 1963 to about 13,000 in 1981.  On the other hand, the number of admissions to mental hospitals has increased from about 20,000 in 1969 to 27,000 in 1979. In recent years alcoholism has emerged as the major single cause of admission.  In 1979 this condition accounted for 26.2 per cent of all admissions.  These figures reflect greater activity in the treatment of the mentally ill and the strengthening of services in the community for their care and rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words on the question of substance abuse.  I am very conscious of the increasing incidence of alcohol and drug abuse among young people and I am taking immediate steps to alert and educate parents and young people to the dangers inherent for them in the whole area of substance abuse.  I recently allocated an additional £¼ million to the Health Education Bureau to undertake an urgent national programme on substance abuse.</P>
    <P>The bureau's programme will involve the training of teachers, doctors, pharmacists, career guidance counsellors, health board personnel, gardaí and clergy as drug educators.  These will be available to act extensively throughout the community, and particularly in schools.  This aspect of the programme is aimed primarily at parents, to inform them as to the nature and extent of the problem, to equip them to guide their children away from becoming involved with drugs and train them to react appropriately in organising treatment and support if their child has a drug problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> Young people themselves must also be alerted, advised and educated outside the home as to the dangers of drug abuse. The school is the obvious place through which to impart information.  To this end the Health Education Bureau, with the full support and co-operation of the Department of Education, are arranging for the preparation of educational materials on all forms of substance abuse for second level school children.  This is being piloted in selected schools at present and will be extended to all schools from September 1982.</P>
    <P>Education in relation to abuse of alcohol will be a component of this comprehensive programme for schools.  There is also a special alcohol education programme for second level schools in the process of being designed at present by the bureau.  The aim of the programme is to develop a responsible attitude in young people to the use of alcohol.  It is expected to be in operation early next year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the problem of glue sniffing, while glue is not a drug or a poison, it is a substance subject to abuse, which can become a health hazard.  As such, it rates for inclusion among the substances subject to abuse for which preventive measures are being formulated by the Health Education Bureau.  Although glue-sniffing is seen in the context of the drug problem generally, glue in itself is not a dangerous substance and would not, therefore, come within the scope of controls relating to such substance administered by other Departments, for example, explosives, toxic chemicals, and so on.</P>
    <P>Glue is not a drug or a poison and therefore cannot be considered in the context of the Poisons Act or Misuse of Drugs Act.  Similarly, it is not possible under those Acts to control other commonly available items which are occasionally reported as being the subject of abuse.  The 1908 Children's Act prohibits the sale of cigarettes and intoxicating liquor to persons under 18 years.  It is proposed to extend this provision in the new Children's Bill to apply to &ldquo;such <Col N="1036" /> other substances or products as may be prescribed by the Minister from time to time&rdquo;.  This will give a new facility and new enabling legislation to the Minister to control such materials as are considered necessary.</P>
    <P>This year marks the tenth anniversary of the introduction of the choice-of-doctor scheme for medical card holders.  The service provided for patients has, in general, been satisfactory.  The abolition of the dispensary system after so many years will, I feel sure, be regarded as one of the most significant developments when the history of our health services comes to be written.  There have been problems associated with the new service.  Chief among those has been the question of cost associated with the visiting and prescribing rates, each of which has been substantially greater than the rates which were anticipated when the scheme was being negotiated.  There is, therefore, need for constant monitoring of the scheme in the interests of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The supply of drugs in the general medical service has been the subject of a report by Trident Management Consultants. I am currently engaged in a detailed examination of their recommendations, in preparation for consultation and discussion with the relevant interests.</P>
    <P>Responding to the request of the medical profession I am establishing a working party to examine the position of general practitioners who are engaged in the general medical service.  They have been pressing for a change in the terms of their contracts to include provision for superannuation and related benefits for contracting doctors.  Such a radical change in their terms of service should not, in my view, be considered in isolation from their conditions generally and from the experience of the operation of the service over the past ten years.  I expect that the working party will report with all possible speed and that their recommendations will provide a basis on which to secure the development not only of the general medical service but of general practice as a whole for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something very briefly about the health capital programme. I am engaged in the preparation <Col N="1037" /> of a medium-term programme which will allow of the orderly achievement of developments which I am endeavouring to promote within a period of five or six years.  The commitment of resources in this way will remove from the scene much of the aggravation hitherto associated with the stop-go approach which has bedevilled planning development in the past.  My time in this debate is quite limited so I had an opportunity to cover only a number of the items currently in progress in the Department.</P>
    <P>Eligibility for the health services has been raised from £8,500 to £9,500 from I June.  I could say a good deal about the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and their relevance to workers and people in general.  I should also like to have said something about infectious diseases.  I am particularly concerned about the reappearance of polio due mainly to complacency about vaccination, and also the increased incidence of whooping cough. Work is also going on in the area of hygiene.  One of the most outstanding features of this area is, that despite the very valuable work involving the hygiene awards being done by the Health Education Bureau, in 1981 there was a 60 per cent increase in notifications of infectious hepatitis over the previous year.  This is due principally to poor food hygiene and poor personal hygiene.  We are pursuing these matters vigorously at present. Because of the hygiene awards and the efforts of the health boards and the Health Education Bureau, there has been a tremendous improvement in standards, but we are quite concerned about this aspect at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should like also to have referred at some length to the work of the Health Education Bureau which is becoming much more penetrating than perhaps it was in the past.  The bureau concern themselves in particular with young people, children in school, and the different age groups.  I am sure the work being done will be very effective.  A great deal is happening in the community care services, in the area of home help and meals on wheels.  I am particularly attached to these services and I am very anxious to see them being developed.  In <Col N="1038" /> the extra £28 million being provided, we are ensuring that the home help service can continue at its present level.  I am having an examination carried out into the further development of this service.</P>
    <P>We have a whole series of health centres being developed throughout the country, some of which are at an advanced stage, and others are at various stages of planning.  Ultimately, they will provide a very important basis within communities for the delivery of community-related and community-based health services.</P>
    <P>I should like to have dwelt on the dental and ophthalmic services.  The National Community Development Agency Bill is being debated in the House at present.  It is covered in this debate having been transferred from the Social Welfare Estimate to the Health Estimate.  The National Council for the Aged are working quite well.  They have five committees, one dealing with income maintenance, one dealing with housing and institutional care, one dealing with community services, one dealing with the role of the elderly in society, and one dealing with the progress on the implementation of the recommendations in the Report of the Care of the Aged, published in 1968.  We have already had a report from the National Council for the Aged which I set up last year, relating to day hospitals and their function within the services generally.  I expect very worthwhile contributions from those committees on the areas they are studying.</P>
    <P>I know the House has a considerable interest in the question of the care of children.  I hope to make a statement very shortly on the outcome of the report on the O'Brien and Sutton cases.  I hope also to announce shortly the setting up of the National Council for Children.</P>
    <P>We could say a good deal about our psychiatric services.  We have a very strong commitment to continually improving our psychiatric services, with particular reference to the development of community-based services.  There is a great deal of activity in the area of mental handicap.  I am particularly concerned about the services for the adult mentally <Col N="1039" /> handicapped.  They will be given priority in the work of my Department.  One of the difficulties is that the children's units are being filled, if you like, by adult mentally handicapped people who stay on there because of a lack of other facilities. This must be tackled as a major priority. By providing adult facilities, more facilities will be available for children.</P>
    <P>We have a fairly substantial legislative programme to come before the House shortly.  We have the National Community Development Agency Bill.  We will have a Dentists' Bill in the autumn.  We have a Nurses' Bill and a Children's Bill which I hope to have circulated relatively soon.  We have poisons regulations which are very detailed and complex.  We have the Health (Mental Services) Regulations. We have a Bill to provide for statutory registration for certain paramedical professions.  The Green Paper on the handicapped will be published in the autumn.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me I have gone briefly over some of the main activities of my Department.  I look forward to hearing comments by Deputies and I recommend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's speech has been significantly abbreviated from the original.  I regret that both in his selection of matters to consider in detail and what he has actually omitted the Minister created the impression of a Department which will essentially be static over the next twelve months.  His speech contained very little other than an initial indication of figures and some information on numbers going in and out of various hospitals or institutions. In an addition &mdash; not circulated &mdash; to his speech he listed the areas in regard to which he gave a one-line indication that there were various reviews and developments.  Consistently over the past month I have been struck by the sense that the Department of Health is alive with reports circulating, studies being done and so on which I must accept is a valid way of making decisions on progress, but very litle of substance is emerging.  The overall picture is one of a <Col N="1040" /> static Department showing little development.</P>
      <P>The Minister made much of the fact that on arriving in government he discovered that there was need for more money to be made available to the eight health boards.  This is a normal feature of operating in the Department where a number of Supplementary Estimates is quite common. His predecessor had indicated a willingness to meet the health boards to discuss with them difficulties they might be having arising from the originally published Estimate.  The Minister admitted that despite the level of increase the amounts finally allocated still left a short-fall over estimated expenditure and that this must be seen as a continuing situation in the health services where over the past three or four years the services have been suffering from these effective cuts.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that one of the greatest difficulties in the context of constraint was the problem of the level of pay increases.  He indicated there would have to be concentration on continuing the constraints on additional employment. I fully accept that in general there must be in the public service as much rationalisation as possible in relation to employment but I make a special appeal that this should not be a blanket situation and that the Minister and his officials should use all their ingenuity to rationalise in certain areas but to allow development in others.  No other service I think has accepted that kind of blanket limitation.  In Education there has been acceptance of the need for creating new teaching posts; in Justice, there has been acceptance of the need for new gardaí. Clearly, in the Department of Health there is a crying need of allocation of staff in new growth areas, particularly in the areas dental service, child care service, the mentally handicapped and community workers.  The Minister should not stand over any blanket restriction on staff increases in his Department.  To do so would leave intolerable gaps and would indicate that an already inadequate service will not see any development in the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the general <Col N="1041" /> principle which would be strongly supported by this side of the House of trying to move patients away from hospital treatment and to provide as much health care in the community as possible whether for people with long-term or short-term ailments.  The Minister gave some statistics in which there was something of a contradiction on the level of births taking place at home which now amounts to 1 per cent and the resulting improvement in the infant mortality rate which is highly to be welcomed.  The Minister should consider the trend in other countries where perhaps the best of both worlds is being achieved and where the length of stay of a mother having a child in hospital is reduced significantly and there is a corresponding improvement in the community-based services.  In some cases the mother's stay in hospital may only be for the period of labour or, perhaps in a difficult birth, for 24 hours or so.  The remainder of the care is provided in the home.  That is of benefit emotionally to the mother and the family.  People should at least have a choice.  It would involve some spending in the developing of community services but there would be comparative overall savings by reducing the length of stay in hospital which is the most expensive form of health care at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to developments in regard to drugs and that is obviously to be recommended and supported.  We are all concerned about this growing problem which cannot be tackled by any one Department alone.  The commitment of the Minister to do all in his power in this regard and to educate is welcome.  I ask the Minister to be very much aware that education can only be one element of the solution.  In the communities where this problem exists I have found it is very much associated with the general effect of recession and depression and unemployment, lack of opportunity or hope among young people and among older people a tradition of abuse of drugs in our society passed on by parents.  The Department have some responsibility in this in examining in many cases the habit of prescribing sedatives for adults and developing a dependency which is often passed on to children.  This seems to be <Col N="1042" /> a cycle common to many classes but more evident in fairly deprived areas.</P>
    <P>In areas in which I am familiar where the drug problem is becoming very serious &mdash; I know it is extending into all types of communities and all social and economic groupings &mdash; the solution they have found is not alone to make people aware that this is a dangerous problem but also that there is a necessity to create a more positive life value for children and families in this situation, along with education as to the dangers.  I would ask the Minister to see that all his officials, the Health Education Bureau and all the resources available to him should be used to co-operate with other agencies in creating an environment and in producing youth development officers who will act to create a more positive life image, an alternative life style for families caught up in a cycle of drug abuse and lack of other resources and satisfactions of life. One immediately realises that this is associated with tackling wider problems in our society, the problem he has discussed in regard to the National Community Development Agency.  Drug taking is associated with economic problems and the fact that economic problems seem to bite particularly at those groups who are already deprived and under-privileged. It is part of the two problems even in dealing with an Estimate for a specific Department, the need to get to grips with our basic economic ills and to look at how we create groups and sections of our society who are at a disadvantage from the moment of birth.  Both of those problems must be tackled seriously if we are to come to terms with the surface expression of those deeper problems such as drug addiction.</P>
    <P>The last five minutes of the Minister's speech consisted of a list of the items which are to be of greatest interest but they deserved greater attention in the presentation of his Estimate.  The Minister referred to the Health capital programme and said he was deciding on orderly development over five years to end the stop-go situation.  That seems to be an attempt to cover up the fact that there is no indication that there will be any significant commissioning of units <Col N="1043" /> this year.  This is a matter of very serious concern, to which I will return later.  The Minister referred to increased eligibility from £8,500 to £9,500 which will result in increased benefits to a large group of people who are within that income group. I wish to commend the fact that the income limit for eligibility to medical cards was also raised earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to the dental service, that he was concerned about it.  I hope the Minister will expand on this because this is an area where there are great inadequacies.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the National Council for the Aged and the progress being made there.  We welcome all progress on this specific problem.  It was a question which needed to be raised in the general discussion of the National Community Development Agency and perhaps the Minister would expand as to how the National Council for the Aged and the proposed National Council for Children will fit in with the task of the National Community Development Agency.  The servicing by the National Social Service Board of these councils was something which in many cases led to much criticism, where people felt these agencies needed a separate secretariat. With the expanded function of the National Social Service Board being subsumed into an expanded agency, whose primary function the Minister assured us yesterday was to combat poverty, the problems of the aged and of children parallel but in different ways the problem of poverty.  Certainly the problems of the old who are poor and children who are poor are more serious than children in the same age group who are not poor.</P>
    <P>The problem of the old goes beyond social and economic groups and is different. I do not see how it comfortably fits in at present with the National Community Development Agency.  Perhaps the Minister would give some thought to possible future developments of small, individual and separate secretariats for each of these councils to enable them to perform their functions independently and in a clearer environment.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will be making a <Col N="1044" /> statement shortly on the matters he mentioned, child battering cases and on the establishment of the National Council for Children.  I agree that the areas of mental handicap and psychiatric services needed a good deal more.  I further welcome his commitment that the Green Paper for the handicapped will be published in the autumn.</P>
    <P>However, having responded in that way to the Minister's speech, I must say there are some outstanding omissions. The Minister referred to his proposed Children's Bill, but he has made no allocation for the implementation of any recommendations or desired developments arising from the task force report, part of which will be taking shape in the Children's Bill.  This is in marked contrast to the decision of the previous Government and to the allocation made by them. The area of child care prevention must at all times be seen as the most important activity, rather than dealing with crises or trying to pick up the pieces when crises have occurred.  In that area the allocation of moneys for children who are not yet in a crisis situation, allocation for either pre-schools, creche or day-care facilities, should be seen as a priority and as a release for parents and families who may be under stress.</P>
    <P>The previous Government had committed £1 million on top of £400,000 already set aside for developments in the pre-school play group area.  This money has disappeared.  The Minister will remember in the recent by-election, when we both attended a public meeting, that a group of members from the Irish Pre-School Play Group Association greeted him with a song wondering where their million pounds had gone &mdash; the tune was of a song they sang in their play groups.  This money would have been a massive boost to the activities which are providing so much relief and training for the mothers, especially in the Dublin area with which I am most familiar.  It is a small amount of money in comparison with the Health Estimate, but it could have gone a very long way because play groups are inexpensive for the yield they produce.  They are run essentially on a voluntary basis, the amount of support <Col N="1045" /> they need is quite small, but the benefits are tremendous.  All this money need not have been allocated through the Department of Health but certain amounts had been considered to have been spent by this Department.  It would have been a massive incentive to the whole play group movement and could have caused a further flourishing of these community and individual play groups.  I regret this money is not available.</P>
    <P>Added to that is the disappearance of the money set aside by the former Government in the Department of Health Estimate which they had prepared for the implementation of the task force report, which would have been over and above that general governmental commitment to providing that £1 million. Effectively, the child care services have been deprived of a massive source of funding by the Government which purports to put forward developments in this area.  Nowhere in the Estimate is there an allocation to implement some of its fundings, particularly in the prevention area which is essential if the Children's Bill is to be effective.  Therefore, I accuse the Minister and ask him to explain how he can possibly have starved this area of child care in this double fashion.</P>
    <P>During the time of the previous Government there was a commitment that £200,000 would be made available to the battered wives' hostel in Dublin for the acquisition of new premises.  I would like to be assured by the Minister that that money is in the Estimate and is available for that purpose.  I hope too that the Minister will continue the intention of the previous Minister, which was to see an extension of developments in this area throughout the country.  The situation is so bad it cannot wait for better times. Unless we provide centres which are reasonable and which provide an adequate service, we are forcing mothers and children to remain at the risk of violence and of permanent damage being done to their own lives and to their children's lives. That cannot be tolerated.  We cannot allow continuation of substandard accommodation provided on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by voluntary organisations whom we do not support adequately.  We are <Col N="1046" /> condemning sections of our people to an atmosphere of violence, being threatened by psychological and physical injury.  I should like the assurance of the Minister that money has been or will be made available for Dublin hostels and similar units throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in passing, referred to the need for planning in the matter of services for the handicapped.  I hope this year will not pass by without the publication of the Green Paper on the services for the disabled.  Last year, as we all know, was the Year of the Disabled and during the year there was an improvement in public understanding, in integration, and as a result physical changes were made to buildings and a great deal of voluntary money was put into the improvement of general conditions for the disabled.  It is essential that the progress made last year be maintained.  Now that the matter has gone from the public eye, I hope the Department will maintain the commitment given during that year so that progress will be continued.</P>
    <P>The needs in this area affect nearly every Department, and therefore if progress is to be made there must be close liaison between the various Departments so that the existing services will be developed and that the handicapped will be more and more fully integrated so that their abilities and talents can be utilised. People working in this field voluntarily and professionally are concerned about provision for the disabled of their basic human rights to work and proper homes so that they will be able to live full lives.</P>
    <P>Many people say that the efforts made during the Year of the Disabled were not adequate and that they are not being continued.  The Department of Health are responsible for the welfare of those people.  Therefore, I submit that the job quota for the handicapped in the public service should be improved to ensure that.  I would suggest that the quota should be extended if the number of applicants warrant it.  I have come across strange situations of people entering for examinations for the disabled in the civil service being turned down in the medical examination.  I agree that the disabled must have the physical capacity to do the <Col N="1047" /> jobs for which they apply, but I would ask the Minister to ensure that the greatest possible flexibility will be allowed not only to ensure that the job quota is reached but over-reached, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment made some advances to make public buildings accessible, but we need our planning laws designed to ensure that this becomes a necessary feature of our public buildings.  The Department of Social Welfare must be taken to task because, though the level of grants was improved this year, there is need to improve the mobility allowance.  For instance, disabled persons are frightened off from attending courses because of the fear that they will lose some benefits they have. This matter should be examined to ensure that handicapped people will not be discouraged from moving out to look for new jobs, apart from new sources of training.  The imminent Green Paper should give a lead in all these matters and indicate the extent of Government commitment in the next number of years.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the mentally handicapped because they are of great public concern and dissatisfaction.  Even in the Year of the Disabled, the mentally handcapped were Cinderellas and it was only late in that year that adequate attention was given to their special problems.  The notion favouring community-based services is being given lip service but this does not mean anything.  All we are doing is giving people a choice of living in overcrowded, unsuitable hospital accommodation where still in some cases mentally handicapped people have to live with those suffering from severe psychiatric disorders or staying at home with families who are not supported by a sufficient staff of community-based nurses. Day care facilities are inadequate.  It is not a choice at all, or it is one between the devil and the deep blue sea.  We need urgently to ensure that only those who are acutely mentally handicapped should be put permanently into residential care. To make that exercise effective we must ensure that there will be proper levels of community support for their families and <Col N="1048" /> themselves.  These matters should not be put in abeyance until economic conditions improve.  Proper services in this area would mean savings now and later for the health services.  More and more people should be moved out of long-term care.</P>
    <P>We cannot tolerate another year without departmental action on the dental services.  In our Programme for Government, 81/85, we were committed to the extension of optical and dental benefit to wives of insured workers.  These have not been included this year and I hope the Minister will tell us the Government are committed to extending these benefits as soon as possible and that he will be meeting the dentists to work out the costings of such an extension so that it will become a reality soon.</P>
    <P>Immediate action must be taken also in regard to the orthodontic services. Children, particularly those growing into adulthood, have no services available to them.  The situation is in crisis.  Day by day in the House Deputies, including myself, are being given replies that indicate there are no facilities at all available for children in the matter of orthodontic services.  The excuse given is usually lack of staffing.  This is something which cannot be excused.  It is one area which must be served.  Orthodontic treatment is only available to those who can afford it.  It is an indictment of society if we have to say to those who cannot afford the treatment that they must go into adulthood with deformed mouths.  The child care, mental health and dental services are areas where we cannot tolerate delay even in a recession.  The Minister must ensure that there are developments in these areas in the immediate future.  I should like him to give more details of his commitment in each of these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Flaherty, I am hesitant as to how to address the Chair on this occasion.  I do not think the Chair ever looked so well.  By passing this estimate, which accounts for 8 per cent of our GNP, we are accepting that all is well in the health service at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the health boards who will disperse the money we pass here today, are we satisfied that we are getting value <Col N="1049" /> for money?  We had to wait until the end of the Minister's speech to hear that he was reviewing certain aspects of the whole health area.  Recently Deputy Deasy put a question to the Minister regarding the operation of the health boards.  I echo the reservations he expressed about the role of the local public representative on the boards.  I have always advocated industrial democracy. However, in the health boards we have a situation where those employed by them control the destiny of the nation in health terms.  They are in receipt of substantial sums of money from the board and decide the policy each health board should follow.  In his review of the health service the Minister should give consideration to a greater input from local representatives. This is vital if there is to be proper supervision.  I do not question the integrity of the officers on the boards. Indeed we have been very fortunate in that respect.  We have men and women of integrity who carry out the wishes of the board.  However, some decisions made leave a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>I question the practice and terms of contract which give private medical practitioners and consultants so many beddays per year in public hospitals.  Much expensive equipment is provided by the State and many consultants have the use of it without making any contribution towards its upkeep and where necessary, replacement.  That is a serious situation. I do not think anyone should have a right to use an appliance provided by taxpayers' money for their own ends and profit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty mentioned her concern about the dental and ophthalmic services.  I support what she said.  The cause of greatest concern is in the psychiatric area.  We have very few institutions which are custom built for this purpose. We have outdated buildings which do nothing to speed the recovery of the mentally ill.  This area has always been the cinderella of the service.  It is an out-rage that as elected representatives we should allow this to continue.  In the southern health board area there is a great incidence of tuberculosis in these institutions.  This is currently being examined and I am anxiously awaiting the <Col N="1050" /> outcome of the inquiries.  I hope it will not be found that it was due to negligence on the part of the health board or the Department of Health.  It is an area which no public representative should ignore. The fact that a disease which we had thought we had come to grips with has now come to the fore in health board institutions is a cause of grave concern.</P>
    <P>There was little reference in the Minister's speech to voluntary hospitals which provide an invaluable service to the community.  Boards are set up to liaise between statutory bodies and voluntary hospitals but as yet a means of providing adequate funds for these institutions has not been arrived at.  The South Infirmary in Cork has been trying for many years to replace its outdated X-ray equipment but to date have not received sufficient funds for that purpose. There are rigid visiting hours in the hospitals. The Taoiseach, when Minister for Health, said he would introduce flexibility into visiting hours.  The present Minister should give thought to this because it can create difficulties for people who have to travel long distances to visit someone.</P>
    <P>The health boards operate a system of catchment areas.  In the area of mental health I do not think it should be the case that because a person is from a certain area he should go to a certain hospital.  I know it probably enables the health board to run more efficiently but there should be more flexibility.  The system is alien to community care and the needs of the people.  We should get rid of it. People come first and the health boards should be able to organise themselves in the interest of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty mentioned the physically and mentally handicapped.  This is an area which is left almost entirely to voluntary organisations.  It is rather pathetic that parents of mentally handicapped children must come to public representatives asking them to help in some way to lighten their burden.  Goodness knows, fate has laid its heavy hand on them and we should do everything possible to alleviate their burden.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to social problems arising from juvenile delinquency, <Col N="1051" /> drugs, glue-sniffing and other such activities springing up in our communities. There is greater need for co-operation between the prison service, the local authorities and, in particular, their housing departments from which a lot of these problems emanate.  There is a need for the health and community welfare officers of this board to be involved in the planning stages of housing developments in conjunction with the local authorities. If this request were to be acceded to and the Minister were to take steps in that direction it would go a good way towards prevention of some of the problems encountered later due to bad planning.</P>
    <P>We must ask also: have we made adequate provision for the young chronically ill?  I do not think we have; I think they have been overlooked.  This is something warranting urgent investigation in each health board area.  There may be a mother, sister or brother with a young person chronically ill in the household.  I do not think the ordinary individual is capable of coping with this problem which has imposed a very heavy burden on some families.</P>
    <P>I asked during the term of the previous Government, and do so again, that some steps be taken in regard to the prescribed relative allowance because its terms of reference do not permit members of a family, if they so desire, to cater for the needs of their kith and kin.  What is offered them is not acceptable.  Insufficient funds are provided in this area.  I would be less than honest if I did not say that I put this point to the Minister's predecessor.  I would urge that the terms of reference for the prescribed relative allowance be redrawn to allow greater flexibility, to give people encouragement to remain at home and cater for those in need.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the Minister's remarks he referred to the question of cost associated with the visiting and prescribing rates, each of which he said has proved substantially greater than the rates anticipated when the scheme was being negotiated.  I might refer to the number of visits, terms of contract with <Col N="1052" /> general practitioners and their entry into the General Medical Service.  At present a young doctor, on qualification, must wait approximately seven years to qualify for entry into the General Medical Service unless he is taken into partnership. We have suffered from this rather cumbersome system.  Lots of our very good, highly qualified doctors are forced to emigrate as a result of this system.  As things stand, it is more or less a closed shop.  This system is in need of urgent examination.  We should provide an incentive to such young doctors because, at present, their families must maintain them while they endeavour to build up a private practice.  Consequently, we lose quite a number of good young doctors who would be prepared to serve the community had they the means of supporting themselves in the period immediately following their qualification.</P>
    <P>The cost of doctors' visits is in need of examination also.  There should be devised a means by which an individual could be reimbursed such costs through tax allowances.  A person with a moderate income who does not qualify for a medical card is caught for very considerable costs in respect of doctors' visits. This system has worked to the detriment of the community at large because lots of people simply cannot afford to call a doctor. If some system could be devised permitting such people to be reimbursed by way of tax allowance this would be helpful and indeed would constitute a form of preventive medicine in itself.</P>
    <P>There is need also for additional geriatric beds throughout the country.  The present system under which people are assessed and are allocated beds is far from satisfactory.  In certain health board areas there are not sufficient geriatric beds, a chronic problem with which public representatives must deal daily.  I am aware that the Minister is constrained in this respect by the amount of money available to him.  I would ask him to give this matter serious consideration and priority, which again would constitute further movement towards the achievement of a better health service generally.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Estimate with which we are dealing provides a sum of £845,574,000 for payment during the year ending 31 December next for the health services.  That is a staggering sum.  It is frightening to think that this House is being asked to dispose of that Estimate, together with four others, in a few hours today.  The amount of money involved, between £750 million and £1,000 million, is a staggering sum being provided for a very worthwhile service.  But it is not good enough that this House is being asked to scrutinise that Estimate, give it the all-clear and approve it today between the hours of 12.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.  We have no alternative to so doing because if we do not, we shall be told that the services cannot be provided.  Also we are dealing with the matter before going on holiday between the beginning of July and the month of October next.  It is high time that the suggestion of Deputy John Bruton of this party was accepted and that the whole system of Estimates, of their presentation to this House and the manner in which we deal with them, be changed radically.  Deputy John Bruton suggested that instead of leaving the Estimate to 31 December 1982 until now when the year is already half passed, that Estimate should have been presented to the House last September or thereabouts, dealt with then, when its consideration would have been meaningful and would have afforded Deputies an opportunity of scrutinising the services being provided for the ensuing year, as any ordinary, sensible businessman would do.  Were I to continue on these lines I would be taking up the limited time available for dealing with this Estimate and making suggestions in regard thereto.  I want to repeat that it is absurd, in the extreme, that the business of this country &mdash; and this is nothing new, it is a practice that has gone on year after year for the last 30 years &mdash; should be conducted on the basis that this House is asked to deal with an Estimate of this magnitude in a couple of hours on a Thursday afternoon. I hope the absurdity of this will sink into the heads of the Government and that Deputy John Bruton's excellent proposals <Col N="1054" /> will be given serious consideration and put into effect.</P>
      <P>I want to deal briefly with three things, the problem of drugs, the problem of mentally and physically handicapped young people and a general hospital for Cavan town.  The Minister today dealt, to some extent, with the problem of drugs.  The world is afficted with a drug problem and we are not immune to it.  In fact, it has become a real problem here and has to be dealt with.  We must try to prevent people taking drugs.  We must try to get after those who import drugs and distribute them for material gain.  They are evil people and should be dealt with. We must try to educate people, particularly the young, about the terrible ill effects that the use and abuse of drugs can have on their health.  We must try within our resources to provide health recreational facilities for young people to try to ensure they will not drift into the use and abuse of drugs.</P>
      <P>I want to talk today about the curing of people who are already hooked on drugs.  There is a sizeable number of those people in the country.  This problem must be dealt with immediately.  If we do not help those people to cure themselves, if we do not provide medical and therapeutic services for them they will simply go from bad to worse with fatal results.  During the Dublin-West by-election campaign, which is referred to lightly now, with pleasure by some of us and with displeasure by others, I had a very interesting experience.  Most people are inclined to refer to great experiences they had during the election campaign and lessons they learned.  I was entrusted with the campaign in the Clonsilla area. During that period I visited the Coolmine Therapeutic Centre.  My visit to this centre was an education.  I found approximately 50 lovely young people from all walks of life with one common purpose, to get themselves off drugs and back into normal life.  One boy about 18 years of age told me that as soon as he got out of there he would go back to school and equip himself for a better job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Coolmine Centre was founded by a man from my constituency, Lord Rossmore.  I got the impression <Col N="1055" /> that a good job was being done there.  All the young people came into a room, listened to a few of us and put some very awkward questions to us.  We had approximately three-quarters of an hour of very useful discussion.  As far as I know, the centre is run with voluntary help and some financial help from the Eastern Health Board.  I believe that centre is great value for money.  The boy who told me he was going back to school when he got out of Coolmine told me he was only six stone when he went in there. I want to compliment the founder, the staff and management of the Coolmine centre and, above all, I want to compliment the young people who have so much common sense and are so lucky to have taken the decision to go in there and avail of the facilities in the centre.</P>
    <P>I understand that Coolmine is the only centre of this kind in the country.  Why are there not more such centres?  Why is there not one in Cork, Galway and the north-eastern area?  I do not believe it would take much money to run those centres.  I strongly recommend to the Minister that he explore the possibility of establishing similar centres throughout the country.  There is not an elaborate building at Coolmine, there is no evidence of large expensive vehicles around the place but there is certainly evidence of common sense.  There is evidence of value for money and, as far as I could ascertain, excellent results.  The Minister should let it be known that the State would be prepared to grant-aid other centres like Coolmine throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The next matter I want to deal with is the facilities for mentally and physically handicapped children.  There is a real problem here.  Deputies learn more by going and seeing what is being done or hearing what people are trying to do.  A couple of nights ago I got an invitation to attend a meeting of a committee set up to deal with Down's syndrome, a mental and physical handicap which, I understand, is quite common throughout the country.  I understand that one-third of the population who have an I.Q. of less than 50 per cent are afficted by the handicap <Col N="1056" /> known as Down's syndrome.  Therefore, we are talking about a sizeable problem.  I am told also on reliable authority that one child in every 400 born here is likely to be afficted with Down's syndrome to some extent.  It is not known for definite what causes the problem though it results from a child being born with 47 chromosones instead of 46.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to compliment the committee whose meeting I attended in Cavan town.  It would take too long to go through all the suggestions that were put forward but suffice it to say that this committee are doing a very good job.  It is their ambition to try to educate these children as well as possible so that they will be better equipped to live as normal a life as possible.  From my experience as a solicitor over a number of years I know the great concern and love that parents have for these handicapped children. When these parents are growing old they give a lot of thought to what will happen after their deaths to their handicapped children and in making wills such parents make as much provision as possible for these children.  In the past these matters of handicap were kept within the family circle but now the whole problem is brought out into the open.  I could spend half-an-hour talking about this topic and about the various forms of mental and physical handicap but I do not wish to hog the time of the House.  The principle concern of those committees dealing with the mentally handicapped is to get more help from the Departments of Health and Education.  In my constituency there is only one suitable school so far as the mentally and physically handicapped are concerned but I expect that comparatively speaking we are well off compared with other counties in which there is no such school.  The suggestion has been made here today that when a school is being built an extra room or two should be added to allow for educational services for perhaps 20 handicapped children. This would provide adequate buildings and facilities for these young people. Even in County Cavan which has a special school there are children who must travel 35 miles to and from Cootehill to <Col N="1057" /> attend the school.  That is not a satisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister for Health to get full reports from committees such as the committee in my constituency of parents for children suffering from Down's syndrome.  I appeal to the Minister to battle at the Cabinet table for liberal grants for these bodies.  I am told, for example, that there is no specialist nurse available in my county for children aged between one and three; also that neither is there any physiotherapist, psychologist or occupational therapist available for children between the ages of three and five.  I have suggested that there should be pre-schooling, a psychologist, an occupational therapist and a speech therapist for these children.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am talking about the system.  I have suggested that Deputy John Bruton's proposal that the whole system be changed and rationalised is highly desirable.  It is not my intention to cast any reflection on the Chair.</P>
      <P>There are many voluntary organisations and many caring parents who have brought these afflictions of handicap out into the open and who are prepared to avail of whatever specialist facilities are available.  Any money spent in providing such services would be well spent.</P>
      <P>I should now like to refer to the 321-bed general hospital which has been sanctioned for Cavan town.  For 45 years we have been pressing to have that hospital built.  I understand that at present the fourth stage, the preparation of the contractor's working drawings, has been completed and they are now with the Department.  I accept that they were delivered to the Department only in the last month or so but I should like to ask the Minister to approve of those drawings with the minimum of delay so that we may proceed to the fifth stage, the preparation of the bill of quantities.  It is important that that stage is dealt with with the minimum of delay.  Following that the health board will be in a position to advertise for tenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that we have a new Government I should like to ask the Minister to renew the commitment that Cavan hospital will retain its priority and that a by-election or any other type of election will not alter its position on the list.  I hope the Minister is in a position to tell the House that he will approve the fourth and fifth stages without delay.  It is important that he authorises as soon as possible the advertising <Col N="1059" /> of the job so that the health board will be in a position to compile a short list of suitable contractors.  I regret that I took a little longer than expected in my contribution but the intervention of Deputy Sherlock highlighted the fault that exists in the system we operate in this House.  It ventilated the absurdity of trying to deal with an Estimate of this size in such a short space of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a number of points on this Estimate which amounts to more than £845 million.  It is hard to understand, when one considers the size of that Estimate, how the money to purchase necessary equipment for the hospital in Mallow has to be raised by voluntary subscription.  Obviously, there is something radically wrong.  It would be interesting if the Minister was in a position to tell the House the amount of money which the Southern Health Board pay annually for office accommodation. The figure I heard mentioned recently is colossal.  It amounts to bad planning. Why is it that the health board do not build their own offices and avoid having to pay out this huge sum of money annually, particularly when health services are being cut in an effort to save money?  It is not right that general hospitals are under-staffed at a time when qualified nurses are searching for jobs.  I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister to grant full eligibility to pensioners, contributory and non-contributory. I should like to know if the dependants of such people will be entitled to full eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that health services cost us 8 per cent of GNP while in England, where they have a full free comprehensive health service, it is a lot less.  At one time I felt that if we got our workers to pay an extra 1 per cent full eligibility could be extended to another 40 per cent <Col N="1060" /> of our people.  That would be worthwhile. There is no doubt that the fee per item system of payment to doctors and pharmacists is being abused.  It should be changed to some form of capital grant or other payment to doctors and pharmacists. It must be recognised by now that there is widespread abuse of that system. That view was expressed by an official of the Southern Health Board recently following an investigation of some general practitioners in that area.  A major job must be done in this respect.  We must find out where the abuses are occurring and change the system.  We must also encourage health boards to build their own offices rather than have them paying out huge sums of money annually in rent.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when the old dispensary system was done away with some people felt it was the greatest thing that ever happened here but in my view it was the worst decision ever made.  Under the old dispensary system a person could go to the local doctor and even if he did not have a medical card he could be given some medicines.  At present many people who get prescriptions do not go to the chemist to get the medicine because they cannot afford it.  That is not an exaggeration. A family with an income of £80 or £90 per week who are marginally over the qualifying income limit cannot afford to pay for medicines.  The fact that they cannot get the medicines results in them having to go to hospital.  I hope the Minister will look at the issues I have raised and deal with them in the course of his reply.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few points in relation to the provision of health services.  When one bears in mind the sum of money that is provided it is hard to understand why many areas are not catered for in the coming year.  I shall confine my remarks to the provision of health services in the area with which I <Col N="1061" /> am most familiar, County Kerry.  The delays which people in that area have to endure while waiting for medical attention, particularly where operations are necessary, are appalling.  People must wait in terrible distress, in pain and suffering to themselves and their families, for a long time before they are called to hospital.  Constituents of mine have had to wait up to three years to undergo major surgery.  There is great inequality in the provision of medical services in that those who can pay for their treatment can get it on demand.  I fail to understand how the Department can continue to allow that distinction because we should be treating all our citizens equally. Steps must be taken whereby people in need of medical attention will be provided with it on the basis of priority and not of their financial ability to pay.  From the point of view of the availability of consultants prior to people undergoing even a stage of an operation, I know that in one area a man visits the town of Tralee one day a week and for a period of six or seven hours works under tremendous pressure.</P>

Because of the demands on the available resources for the priority local authority programmes, including housing and sanitary services, it has not been possible for my Department to make a capital allocation for this project.  The position is being kept under review with a view to enabling the project to proceed as soon as the circumstances allow.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The overall aim of the Government's environment policy is to protect and improve the physical environment side by side with economic and social progress so that there will be a better quality of life for everybody, now and in the future.  The central theme of the policy is the concept of integrating environmental concern with development; the prevention of pollution and the protection and improvement of amenities and our heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These objectives are in line with the <Col N="1065" /> recommendations of the report <i>A Policy for the Environment</i> which was produced by the Environment Council set up in 1978 and was published at the beginning of this year.  The term of office of the council expired in June 1981 and the council was not renewed.  I am currently reviewing that position including the question of appointing a new council and the settling of its functions.  In the meantime the detailed recommendations of the previous council's report have been referred to the various Departments concerned and progress is being monitored by the inter-departmental environment committee who operate under my Department.</P>
    <P>The quality of environmental resources will continue to depend largely on the effective operation of the planning and pollution control systems.  It is my intention that these systems will be extended and improved as necessary.  A general review of the operation of the Planning and Development Acts will be undertaken as soon as the more immediate items of planning legislation have been dealt with.  In the meantime comprehensive guidelines on the administration of local planning are being prepared for the assistance of planning authorities. Local authorities are being urged to give full effect to the provisions of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, and of the new regulations which have been introduced for the control of waste disposal operations. Arrangements are also proceeding for implementation of other aspects of the general <i>Strategy for Waste Disposal</i> which was published in May 1981.</P>
    <P>Trends in air pollution are being closely monitored with a view to any additional control measures that may be necessary and feasible being introduced and the controls relating to other environmental problems, including noise and nuisance, are also being reviewed.</P>
    <P>It is important in all of this, and in the further development of environmental policy, that there should be as accurate a picture as possible of the actual environmental conditions and of the trends. This calls for development of a system of state-of-the-environment reporting.  I have asked An Foras Forbartha to assist <Col N="1066" /> in the preparation of a first report of this kind, and that work is now in progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The EEC Council Directive of 29 June 1978 on the lead content of petrol stipulates a maximum content of 0.40 grammes per litre in the EEC generally, but gives a derogation in the case of this country to allow for the setting of a maximum of 0.64 grammes per litre during the five years commencing on 1 January 1981.  The regulations made pursuant to the directive provided accordingly.  The derogation was allowed because of the technical and economic problems which the immediate implementation of the lower limit would have created for the Whitegate oil refinery.</P>
      <P>Following the suspension of refining operations at Whitegate, all the petrol now being used in the State is imported from EEC countries so that the actual lead level in petrol being sold in this country at present conforms to the general EEC standard of 0.40 grammes per litre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, when refining operations are resumed at Whitegate, it is envisaged that the petrol produced there will conform to the general EEC standard. I hope, therefore, to be in a position <Col N="1068" /> shortly to amend the regulations so as to prescribe the lower maximum level of 0.40 grammes per litre.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any moves afoot towards providing lead-free petrol in this country.  However, there is no statutory prohibition against the placing of such petrol on sale here.</P>
    <P>I am aware of studies carried out in other countries the results of which suggest a possible correlation between lead intake and impaired intellectual development of children in particular.  The findings of all such studies will be taken into account when determining if and what further action needs to be taken or is feasible to reduce environmental lead levels.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health, has already made regulations which control the lead content of some 60 foods and beaverages.  His Department advise that exposure to lead poisoning from sources other than lead in petrol may vary according to diet, area lived in, the existence of old leaded paint or pipes in a house or premises and other similar factors</P>
    <P>At present monitoring of lead-in-air is carried out at four stations in Dublin city. The operation of the system including the possibility of extending it to other areas is kept under review.  The results obtained from the Dublin monitoring have in general proven satisfactory when compared against the standards envisaged in a proposed Directive on Lead-in-Air which is at present under discussion in the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

The answer to the question was exceptionally long but the substance was varied.  We are not meeting the requirements of the EEC.  When Whitegate is opened again we will be selling our own petrol.  Will that refinery have the capacity to produce the kind of petrol to which Deputy Briscoe's question relates?

I have no hesitation in saying that I should like to see lead-free petrol available as a choice, as is the case in many other countries. I regard it as a very serious matter and I am pleased that we will be coming into line with EEC stipulations.

      <P>I thank the Minister for <Col N="1070" /> his later remarks and I agree entirely with them.  In the light of recent research in this area, would the Minister not agree that it is desirable, rather than seeking to comply with the minimum code under EEC regulations, that we take steps to ensure within a short time a legal requirement that all petrol be zero lead-rated? Would the Minister not also agree that recent research has indicated that minimum EEC standards may not provide sufficient protection for children and that there is a very real need for zerorating? In relation to Whitegate, I would ask the Minister to take the necessary steps, with the Minister for Education, to ensure that the refinery will provide lead-free oil and not oil which simply complies with an EEC standard which is now proving not to provide the necessary protection.</P>

      <P>So far the Minister has concentrated on lead pollution arising from petrol.  In Question No. 7 I asked generally what steps were being taken to reduce the level of lead pollution.  The Minister said that paint can give rise to problems of lead pollution.  Recent research carried out in certain schools in Dublin has indicated that the lead content in paint in the schools constituted a danger to the children.  Will the Department consider laying down minimum standards in this area and undertake to carry out an investigation of schools throughout the country, and particularly in city areas where there is the greatest danger?  Will they investigate if the painting at present being carried out in schools is posing a danger to children by way of lead pollution?</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> Consequent on the degrouping of Counties Laois and Offaly for management purposes <Col N="1075" /> I appointed a person to the office of manager, temporarily, in Offaly County Council pending the making of a permanent appointment thereto by the local authority on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners. The degrouping of the two counties became effective on 1 April 1982 and I understand that Offaly County Council have forwarded the formal statutory request to the Local Appointments Commissioners requesting them to recommend a person for appointment on a permanent basis to the office of county manager.  An advertisement announcing the competition for the filling of the vacnacy on a permanent basis appeared in the national press on Wednesday, 5 May 1982.  The arrangements for the selection of a suitable candidate for recommendation to the county council for appointment are matters for the commissioners.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The superannuation of local authority employees is governed by the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, and where applicable, the Superannuation Revision Scheme, 1977.</P>
      <P>Under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 an officer in the position outlined in the question would receive a lump sum of £6,933.33 and a pension of £50 per week.  In similar circumstances a servant would be entitled to a pension amounting to £66.67 per week and no lump sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corresponding figures under the Superannuation Revision Scheme, 1977, provided an option for the scheme was exercised, are £7,800 lump sum and £5 per week pension for officers and also for servants who are not fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  The pensions of <Col N="1076" /> servants fully insured under the latter Acts are co-ordinated with social welfare pensions in respect of service given on or after 27 May 1977.  Under this arrangement a servant with 40 years service will qualify for combined local authority and social welfare pensions of not less than half-pay, in addition to the lump sum, the local authority element being £45.05.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 18, 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Cork County Council, at my request and in consultation with other bodies concerned, have prepared an emergency flood alert plan for the Blackwater Valley. The purpose of the plan is to give early warning of possible flooding and thus enable local authorities, other bodies, community groups and individuals to take suitable measures to protect life and property.  I understand that the county council is installing equipment required for implementation of the plan and is having discussions on the plan with the Blackwater Flood Association.</P>
      <P>Arterial drainage for prevention or alleviation of flooding in the Blackwater catchment is a matter for the Minister for Finance and I would refer the Deputies to the reply given by him to Question No. 584 on 11 May 1982.

An emergency plan to help people to get out of their homes when they are flooded is not what is being asked for here.  What is being asked for here is, in view of the fact that the Office of Public Works have said that they do not intend to change the priority list for the Blackwater drainage, that in the interim some help be provided to the people who are constantly under this threat of flooding, particularly in the Mallow area.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East)</i>: On assuming office I found that, while my predecessor had sanctioned an increase of 15 per cent over 1981 in the level of local authority rates for 1982, he had not <Col N="1084" /> made adequate provision in the Department's Estimates to allow for full recoupment to local authorities of the value of rates relieved.  I also found that local authorities were being required to meet such statutory demands as were served on them in respect of supplementary social welfare allowances and the maintenance of drainage schemes.  Further, local authorities had been instructed they could not in 1982 apply the 40 per cent proceeds from the sales of local authority houses towards their current expenditures as had been allowed the previous year.</P>
      <P>I have been able to reverse this last decision completely as a result of which about £7 million is being restored to the revenue accounts of all local authorities. I have had the statutory demands limited to an 18 per cent increase, thus relieving local authorities of a liability for a further £2.9 million.  The benefit to Dún Laoghaire Corporation of these two decisions by me is £310,000.  I have also given the corporation grants totalling £123,000 for roads and environment works.  The present Government's budget also provided extra allocations totalling almost £14 million for other local authority services.  Dún Laoghaire Corporation's requirements will of course be considered in the allocation of these moneys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> On 2 June 1982 I allocated an extra £800,000 to Donegal County Council towards the financing of further new work which the council propose to commence this year on their local authority housing programme.</P>
      <P>I sanctioned loans of £45,000 and £40,500 on 13 and 18 May for repairs and improvement works to the harbour at Portevlin pier and for the purchase of four fire appliances.  I propose to notify Donegal County Council shortly of their allocation under the special border areas programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly before my meeting with the deputation, I had notified Donegal County Council of a supplementary capital allocation of £430,000 for road <Col N="1088" /> improvement works.  I also notified them of an allocation of £272,000 in respect of environmental works, youth employment.</P>
    <P>I might add that since taking office, the Government have reversed the previous Government's requirements that the entire proceeds of sales of local authority houses should be diverted to capital purposes. This gives Donegal County Council an extra £187,000 for revenue account purposes.  Donegal County Council will also benefit by almost £74,000 from my decision to limit the demand made on local authorities in respect of supplementary welfare allowances and drainage works.</P>

They have had to let these people go.  The streets of many of the towns are without street cleaners because they have not money to pay for the cleaning.  The public baths are being closed because they cannot afford to keep them open.  The roads are in such a bad state of repair that they are recognised to be the worst roads of the Republic &mdash; I can say that with a lot of authority because I do a great deal of motoring throughout the Republic.

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £845,574,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1982, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chlaraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and a grant-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to Question Time I <Col N="1114" /> was speaking about the pressure under which consultants are operating attending to huge queues of patients they find waiting for medical attention.  I want to emphasise the unacceptability of delays in the availability of medical attention for people in the general medical services. As long as these delays occur, we as politicians and parliamentarians and those working under the auspices of the Department of Health are failing in our responsibility to those people.  As a matter of urgency the Minister should look at these delays.</P>
      <P>Where extra consultants can be employed they should be employed, and where outstanding vacancies exist they should be filled at once.  The personnel are available if the money is provided. We must make some inroads into these inordinate delays.  Resulting from those delays the quality of life of these people is diminished.  Their standard of living is low enough without having to wait for years before getting medical attention.  It is a basic human right that they should have medical attention available practically on demand.  They should not have to wait as long as they now have to wait.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provision of medical services as administered in my own county of Kerry, I should like the Minister to examine the structure on which the health services are provided.  I am not in a position to comment on the quality of the service prior to 1973, and prior to the establishment of the health boards. The present structure seems to have got itself wrapped up in bureaucracy.  It is top heavy with bureaucrats and executives. We are not getting a satisfactory health service for the money being spent.  If possible, the Minister should restore us to the situation prior to the establishment of the health boards.  I realise legislation would be necessary to do this.  The question of providing health services through local committees should be examined. That could only be an improvement on the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is dissatisfaction in my locality due to the fact that our health services are administered from a city with a far larger population than we have in Kerry. We are not getting our fair share of the <Col N="1115" /> necessary finances or resources.  As a matter of urgency the Minister should look at the question of equipping the new Regional Hospital in Kerry.  This is an example of gross mismanagement and a complete lack of planning, considering how long this project was in the pipeline. I am not blaming the Minister because the position should have been remedied long before he took office.  We are now in the ludicrous situation that we have a hospital which was completed in November 1981 and we have been reliably informed by the Minister that it will not be operational until early 1984.  Somebody in the Department of Health must have made gross miscalculations about the building of the hospital or the provision of the correct finances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Every reasonable person in this House accepts the fact that resources are scarce and that there are financial restraints on the Government. I find it totally objectionable when resources are scarce that something in the region of £30 million can be found all of a sudden for the purpose of winning a by-election.  The people in Kerry would accept that there was a shortage of finance if things were the same in every county.  It is objectionable that money can be found over-night and schools can be sanctioned under the cover of darkness without consultation with the Minister for Education.  Finances are allocated, but whether those allocations are <Col N="1116" /> ever made is another matter.  It is not healthy for this institution or for democracy that that type of practice should continue.  The electorate are not satisfied with that type of procedure.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister try to provide the finances for us because we are working out of a totally inadequate institution, a former workhouse in Tralee?  It is totally inadequate to facilitate the number of people requiring services.  Most politicians who have visited Kerry are aware that the facilities are not available.  I am asking the Minister to consider this matter urgently.  If any further allocation could be provided to equip the hospital, it would be appreciated by the people of Tralee and the county in general.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister in the course of the year to look at the position of staffing of existing hospital facilities in Kerry.  It has come to my notice that many of the nursing staff in our institutions have been taken on on a continuing temporary basis which is totally unsatisfactory. Would the Minister consider this matter with a view to giving these people some security and so take them out of the uncertain working conditions that exist in some cases being employed on a temporary basis for three or four years?</P>
      <P>If possible, could the Minister provide physiotherapy services to deal with patients away from the institutions and from hospitals?  Considering the cost of hospitalisation which the Minister correctly pointed out in his speech, anything we can do to attend to people's needs for medical attention away from hospital should be encouraged.  The Physiotherapy Society of Ireland are in a position where they are prepared to offer services if the Minister would see fit to co-operate with them.</P>

      <P>I shall try to avoid, because of the timescale we have, speaking on matters already raised by colleagues in my own party and the Labour Party.  I accept the agreement made between the Whips, but in dealing with the Minister's speech today I personally feel that this is a totally inappropriate method of dealing with an Estimate as important as this.  The sums of money <Col N="1117" /> involved in the area of health care require considerable consideration.  The Minister's speech on the Estimate, which to some extent is a policy programme which I presume the Minister intends to implement in the coming year, is a matter that I believe should get serious and in-depth examination.  Agreement that Estimates of this nature should be processed and pushed through the House &mdash; all political parties are to blame for that; it is no more the Minister's fault that it is mine or anybody else's &mdash; is not satisfactory.  The manner in which the Estimates are being pushed through the House means that there is no real discussion, no real control over the manner in which public finances are being dealt with and no real or serious consideration of policy matters that are important in the health services in the next 12 months.  All these Estimates debates tend to descend into either a series of party political points, in which one side or the other tries to prove that they have a greater commitment in one area than the other side, or an occasion which Deputies engage in special pleading on behalf of their own constituencies. That has a place in the system, and Deputies must be in a position to do that, but we never appear to be in a position to have a debate where we can discuss overall policy considerations in the general area of health or any other Department other than an Estimate debate.  The only other circumstances in which policy considerations may be discussed are when particular items of legislation are before the House which of necessity require that discussion concentrate on the one item with which the House is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that we shall very soon proceed to reform the procedures in the House so that these forms of debate can have greater meaning and make a real and genuine input into Ministerial programmes. As a Deputy who has only been here for nine months I understand the difficulties experienced by Deputies outside Dublin and the need for them to work within their own constituencies, but I find it difficult to understand why the House sits only from 2.30 on Tuesday afternoon until 5 p.m. on Thursday.  I <Col N="1118" /> cannot understand why we cannot at least sit through until Friday and carry the Estimate debates on different Departments from Thursday to Friday of each week to afford a proper and realistic consideration of the various matters that come before the House in this way.</P>
    <P>I intend briefly to deal with some of the matters mentioned by the Minister and in doing so I hope I shall not reiterate things that have already been said.  I am not seeking in any of my comments to score any party political points, but what I am trying to do is to raise issues that I believe are matters of genuine concern and which I genuinely believe have not yet been properly dealt with and the importance of which is not fully and properly appreciated in the House.  That, I think, can be said of the approach under different administrations in this House on different occasions.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned not so much about what is in the Minister's speech as about what is missing.  Unfortunately, I was not present when the Minister spoke but the printed version is a curious document.  Obviously items which the Minister originally intended to include have been cut out as indicated by half pages here and there.  A very reasonable explanation of that could be typing errors or something of that kind; I am not insinuating anything beyond that.  I understand that the Minister also briefly referred to one or two areas that are not covered in the original statement.  I find it somewhat curious that five comments were made but not referred to in any detail.  In particular I am referring to the general responsibility the Minister has in the area of children and children's services.  It is extremely disappointing that there is no comprehensive reference in the speech to the report of the task force on child care or to the promised legislation that we are told is coming. This is a matter that has been raised by Dáil question.  I had hoped that in the Minister's speech today he would flesh out some of the proposals that he intends to bring to the House by way of legislation and indicate when he believes such legislation will be implemented.  I am disappointed that there is no reference to <Col N="1119" /> the task force in the written speech which was distributed.  There is no reference generally to children's services or to the problems that have given rise to tremendous concern over the last six months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>For the information of the Deputy and the House I would like to make the position clear.  In view of the time constraint I was forced to circulate just part of the speech and synopsise the rest which was given at the beginning of my speech today.  Obviously it will be in the Official Report.  These matters were covered, including forthcoming legislation and the task force and the Children's Bill and various other matters like that. I am sorry.  If I could have entered the whole speech on the official record I would have been happy to do so, but I was not permitted to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That goes to show &mdash; I think the Minister will agree &mdash; how ineffectual this type of debate is and how we need to review the procedures we use. Having said that, I regard these items as of tremendous importance.  I do not suggest that some of the items referred to in the speech are not important but personally I feel that in the case of items that are so important, irrespective of the time constraint they are matters that the Minister should have expanded on.  I am sorry he did not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of areas where at this stage we are not clear as to what is the approach of the Government and the Minister.  In the general area of children's services and children's law a vast number of proposals have been put forward in the report produced by the task force.  A number of alternative proposals are contained in dissenting reports produced by a variety of different elements of the task force.  There is no clear public statement yet as to what recommendation the Government will adopt in the context of the Children's Bill.  This is something that should be discussed and dealt with in the House.  The Minister is still in the position where his responsibility for children and children's services is shared with two other Departments.  I should certainly <Col N="1120" /> like to have the Minister's confirmation as to what the position is.  In particular I should like his confirmation that the recommendation of the task force that the Department of Health have sole responsibility for children and children's services will be adopted and acted upon. From my own knowledge in recent years there has been a variety of different administrative arrangements between Departments whereby it appears on occasion that the Department of Health would assume sole responsibility, but then the difficult responsibility that exists between Health, Education and Justice has on other occasions emerged out of the woodwork.  I would like some indication of what present thinking is in that area, as it is very important to ensure co-ordination in dealing with services for our children.  In the area of children's law, the vast majority of reforms are proposed in the task force on child care in the context of care proceedings.  I expect and hope that most, if not all, of these will be adopted.</P>
    <P>The area that is at this stage uncertain and upon which I hope the Minister will act and encompass within the context of the Children's Bill is the area of adoption. It is uncertain because the task force were unable to reach agreement as to what should be done in that area.  The majority of the members decided they were not going to deal with the topic at all and I accept that that was not the Minister's fault.  Equally, a minority of the members recommended a large number of changes in the area of adoption, many of which are worthwhile although some are not and could give rise to greater problems than exist at present.  We do not know whether the new legislation will deal with adoption.  I understand a junior Minister in the Department publicly indicated that another committee might be set up to look at adoption.  I hope that is not the case because, in the context of the general area of children's services, we have had too many committees.  We want a political commitment and a political decision to reform areas that are not controversial, where the problems are known to people working in these areas and which do not require a whole pletroversial <Col N="1121" /> thora of committees sitting and considering previous reports and making recommendations on top of other recommendations. Many of the matters that need to be dealt with in relation to adoption are clear.  Many of the defects in the procedures and in the law as it exists at present are also clear.  What they require is the political will to tackle them.</P>
    <P>I will illustrate a small number of these as I do not feel it is fair to colleagues who want to contribute to the debate to go into them in depth.  There is a recommendation that the area of adoption should be transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Health.  From the few public comments that have been made, I understand that the Minister has accepted that recommendation. If so I welcome that decision because it is a step forward.</P>
    <P>There is a need now to provide for adoption legislation to enable legitimate children to be adopted.  The Government's policy on this is unclear, I cannot put it any further than that.  There was a commitment from the previous Government to bring in legislation to provide for the adoption of legitimate children.  Prior to June 1981 the Government refused to countenance such legislation although it was recommended by the task force on child care.  It was also recommended by the Medico-Social Research Board in a report published by them in 1979 and reiterated in a report published in 1980. Such legislation is demanded by the number of legitimate children we now have in residential institutions who have no possibility of leading a normal family life and who will either be in permanent residential care for the rest of their childhood or in foster care, with all the uncertainties, difficulties and problems that can arise, especially in the event of a parent seeking to regain custody some years hence.</P>
    <P>On 4 May 1982 I asked the Minister in this House how many legitimate children were at present in care and had been in care for over five years.  The Minister replied that we have just over 900 legitimate children in care who are not living with their parents and who have been in care for over five years.  Those children have no possibility of being adopted and <Col N="1122" /> probably have little possibility of an ordinary family life with the security attached to it that an adoption order could give them.  There is no rhyme or reason why the facility of adoption should not be extended to these children.  We have approximately a further 700 legitimate children who have been in care for under five years and, presumably, a number of these will shortly go into the over five years in care category.  There is no reason why the facility of adoption should not be extended to them.  I am not saying that whenever a legitimate child is placed in care he or she should be made available for adoption.  Of course that is not the case.  There are many good families who suffer terrible disasters because of health or other social problems who may need to place a child in short-term fosterage or in residential care for brief periods while the family sort out their problems.  But, on the statistics available, we have in excess of 1,000 children at present who are prevented from having a normal family life because they cannot be adopted.  I would ask the Minister to bring in the necessary legislation to allow these children to be adopted.  There is no difficulty in providing that legislation.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Collins was Minister for Justice he suggested there was a constitutional impediment to prevent such children being adopted.  That is not the case.  There has been a clear indication from the courts that there is no constitutional difficulty in the context of children who have been permanently neglected or abandoned and who are legitimate children. I am sure the Minister's officials can advise him that it has been made clear that there is not a constitutional objection to such children being placed for adoption. Even if there was, this Government would have a duty to hold a constitutional referendum.  I believe there is general agreement throughout the country among social workers, health boards and adoption agencies that such children should be available for adoption.  I respectfully suggest that such legislation would have no constitutional difficulties but, if the Minister is committed to providing for the adoption of legitimate children, that should be included in whatever <Col N="1123" /> constitutional referendum is to be held towards the end of this year or early next year.</P>
    <P>Other problems in the area of adoption are too numerous to mention.  I ask the Minister, in addition to dealing with the problem of legitimate children, to look at the need to deal with other problems now arising in the adoption process.  There is the problem of a child who is placed for adoption but whose natural mother, prior to an adoption order being made, withdraws her consent or refuses to consent to the order being made.  This is creating difficulties for adoptive parents who, from the time a child is placed with them, do not know whether an adoption order will be made in their favour even if they are assessed as being proper people to adopt and even if the child thrives with them.  Adoptive parents are finding themselves in a situation where they may have to get involved in expensive High Court cases in order to adopt a child previously placed with them by an adoption society. There is a need to re-examine the whole system of consent to adoption and agreements to place.  There is a need in doing this not merely to provide protection for adoptive parents and proper protection and advice for natural mothers, but also to ensure that the best interests of all the children who are affected in this area and who are placed for adoption are fully and properly protected.</P>
    <P>Adoption is about ensuring the welfare of children, about protecting children, about finding families for children who need them. The difficulties that are arising in some cases of the adoption process are giving rise to fears and worries among many people who adopt or who have children placed with them for adoption. The vast majority of adoption applications are processed without doctors experiencing any great difficulties.  However, there is a large majority in which difficulties arise which give cause for concern and create real worries.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a need to provide a new form of placing of children for adoption whereby the natural mother would place a child for adoption, a brief <Col N="1124" /> period would be allowed to pass during which she could reconsider and change her mind, but after that period she should not be allowed to do so.  The child would then be placed for adoption and the charges with whom the child would be placed would know that the mother could not come in and withdraw consent.</P>
    <P>These matters should be examined very seriously.  We should look at the law in Australia which provides protection in this area.  Through my contacts with natural mothers I know that many of them would welcome a change of this nature. Many natural mothers, when they place their children for adoption, suffer great emotional stress and difficulty, a great deal of certainty attaches to it, and this is a period of serious stress for them.  When they have gone through a proper counselling service and understand their situation and have finally made the difficult decision, they want their children to be adopted, they place them with adoption agencies and then sign agreements.  Many of them, having signed those agreements want to go off to reorganise their lives and start anew, and not have to look back on events which had been distressing. The present procedure which requires a natural mother to go in months later, again to sign a consent on something she has already signed, reopens the wounds and prevents that woman's life from being reorganised.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is in the interests of everybody, of the natural mother, the adoptive parents and particularly the child placed for adoption, that this problem should be dealt with.  There are many other problems, and I understand that in the childcare legislation which the Minister is about to introduce, there will be greater legal protection and more extensive provisions in the area of foster care and foster services.</P>
    <P>In that new legislation, if the Minister does not deal with adoption he will be covering only half the problem because adoption and fostering services should be integrated as part and parcel of the child care system&mdash;it is not something separate &mdash; and if a Bill dealing with children's law does not contain provisions to amend existing adoption law, if it does <Col N="1125" /> not contain provision in certain cases for the adoption of legitimate children, it will be defective.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have had sad cases of battered children coming before our courts.  I do not think the matter is being treated with sufficient seriousness.  Last year we had three children dying as a result of non-accidental injuries, or what is more emotively referred to as child battering.  Three different sets of parents were sent to prison.  In two out of those three cases there was clear evidence before the courts that the health authority &mdash; in both cases it was the Eastern Health Board &mdash; were aware that the children who died had been at risk.  In each case the family had come to the notice of the health board.  One parent in each case had previously been before the courts.  In one case, the father had been sentenced to nine months imprisonment for viciously assaulting his three-year-old daughter.  The second was a case in which the father had been convicted in a criminal court and the foster mother, only two months before the child's death, had been before the District Court and convicted of child neglect.  In both cases there was no excuse for not having had the children taken into care.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of grave concern that necessary action was not taken.  Independent inquiries into the deaths should have taken place.  I ask the Minister to hold such inquiries.  I understand the Department have been conducting their own investigations but there has not been any public indication of the results of these investigations: there have been promises that a public statement will be made as to the results of the investigations. That is not a satisfactory procedure. In dealing with non-accidental injuries, the health boards are following guidelines introduced by the Department in 1980 and it is not fair to ask any Department to investigate themselves.  It could very well be that the guidelines are defective: perhaps the health boards did everything possible but that they had the wrong guidance from the Department's guidelines. I am not saying that was so, but it could be.  It could also be that health board personnel made wrong judgments. <Col N="1126" /> It could be simply an accident, but these problems were not followed up properly. Whatever the nature of the problem, the deaths of two children in a year, whose families were on notice to the health authorities as families with whom children were at risk, merit a proper formal investigation of an independent nature. I do not believe that the type of investigation that has been conducted by the Department will provide the necessary information or will do what is necessary, that is, satisfy the public that our children's services are adequate to provide proper protection.</P>
    <P>The public need to be reassured that whatever defects and problems arose in these caes will not recur.  The reason for such an inquiry is not to find scapegoats and say they were responsible, it is not to pick out some director of community care, or social worker, or doctor, and say they are responsible for a child's death. The reason for such an inquiry is to find out the problems: were they administrative, were errors of judgment made?  If errors of judgment were made, the inquiry should clarify them and so ensure that in future such errors of judgment will not be made.  In that way defects could be discovered and the public would be reassured that any such loopholes would be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Existing children's law, however bad, no matter how many reforms are required, has been more than adequate &mdash;I speak from knowledge of the cases I have spoken about &mdash; to have afforded each of the children no longer alive the proper protection they were entitled to. Reforms of the law would not have affected in any way the legal situation of those children.  They could have been taken into care: their parents had been before the courts and this placed a duty on the health boards to take the children into care, if necessary by taking the necessary proceedings.</P>
    <P>If, for instance, proceedings had been under the Children's Act, 1908, and if for some technical reason the proceedings had failed, the health board should have applied to have the children made wards of court and there by afforded them the protection to which they were entitled. <Col N="1127" /> Therefore, it is disingenuous to say these problems will be solved when we introduce a Children's Bill.  I regard the problems that arose in these cases as administrative, procedural.  They are problems that can be tackled now and they will have to be dealt with in new legislation. I hope the Minister will seriously consider holding the type of inquiry I regard as necessary in this area.  As regards non-accidental injury to children, there is a duty on health boards to have training in this area for their personnel who come into contact with the problems and deal with them.  On 4 May in a parliamentary question I asked the Minister if he was aware of any health board which provided any specialist training of any nature for any personnel and the answer was that the Minister did not know or that he would look into the matter.  This is part of the problem.  We are asking committed personnel in health boards to undertake tasks for which the boards fail to provide training.</P>
    <P>In the light of recent events there is a duty on the Minister to ensure that each health board provides specialist training for the staff involved in non-accidental injury monitoring and for those attached to community care teams.  As regards the legal aspect, it is not sufficient to rely on the fact that if a lawyer is acting for a health board he or she is automatically fully conversant in all areas of the law.  If specialist training is provided, it should be provided for lawyers attached to health boards or who act for them in children's cases to ensure that the full protection that exists under the law is made available to young people.</P>
    <P>I regret that there has been no detailed comment by the Minister on any of these areas of children's services.  It is of vital importance.  In the context of the Department of Health, children's services are very much the cinderella area.  Part of the reason for this is due to the multi-ministerial responsibility, where the buck has been passed over the years between the Ministers for Health, Justice and Education and back again.  There is a need for a coherent and committed approach which reflects political will.  The time has <Col N="1128" /> passed when a Minister should resort to asking for more committees to produce more reports in any area of law dealing with children.  I regret that the Minister did not refer to these areas.  I look forward to the Bill concerning children.  I hope it will deal with some of the areas I have referred to.</P>
    <P>The problem of Women's Aid has been mentioned.  This is a voluntary organisation which has provided a service over the years which the State has never been prepared to provide.  They have great financial difficulties.  A commitment was made by the previous Government to provide £200,000 for them.  What is the Government's position on that?  Will the necessary funds be forthcoming to them? What assistance will be afforded to them in Dublin?  Will any similar assistance be afforded to them outside the Dublin area to deal with the grave problems of battered wives and emergency-type accommodation which Women's Aid was set up to provide?</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concern expressed by the Minister about drug abuse and young people and alcohol abuse.  I welcome the fact that he intends to take some action in this area.  Still being new in the House, I am cynical when politicians say they will take action on the drug problem.  The subject of drugs makes for fine sounding speeches and grab tremendous newspaper headlines: &ldquo;Minister so and so to act on drug problem&rdquo;.  When the verbalisation stops the State fails to tackle the problem.  We are a great society.  We con ourselves into believing that if we talk about a problem we are doing something about it.  I hope the Minister will do something which will involve a real commitment in this area.  For far too long we have had this problem.  It is a problem &mdash; I do not say this in relation to the Minister &mdash; which some politicians have milked for the purpose of cheap newspaper headlines without doing anything to tackle it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment in this area and the idea of preparing educational material to circulate in schools.  I also welcome the fact that there is a pilot scheme commencing in this area which will be extended to all schools from <Col N="1129" /> September 1982.  I ask the Minister to include something else in that project. The Minister referred to extending the provisions which exist in the 1908 Act to the new Childrens' Bill.  There is a provision in the Act which prohibits the sale of cigarettes to children under 18 years of age.  It is proposed to extend this provision in the new Bill to other products which may be precribed by the Minister. The provision in the 1908 Act is something which is honoured in the breach rather than the observance.  Most people are unaware of the provision which prevents the sale of cigarettes to children under 18 years of age.  Nobody takes any notice of it and it was never enforced. Whatever about the dangers of drugs, there are more people dying from cancer resulting from smoking than there are from drug abuse.  It is time that we took this area far more seriously.</P>
    <P>It is time the no-smoking campaign became a serious one rather than a sentence appended to a packet of fags or a large advertisement indicating that smoking damages health.  It is a campaign which has not been dealt with in the serious fashion it should be.  The State has an interest in both drink and cigarettes. On the one hand, we try to discourage people from abusing drink and smoking cigarettes, but we also earn revenue from their use.  Cigarette smoking starts in school and has been with us for many years.  There are children of eight years and nine years who are addicted to cigarettes.  No serious campaign has been run in the schools to counter the problem. I hope the Minister will include it in whatever campaign he starts in this area.  We fall far behind our colleagues in Europe in our approach to cigarette smoking.  We cannot force adults to stop smoking and no Government would survive if they tried to do so.  However, we can educate the youth in such a manner as to ensure that they do not grow up addicted to nicotine in a way which for many of them will result in their lives ending by way of cancer, which nicotine is a direct catalyst for.  I hope the Minister will start a campaign to stop children smoking and educate them on the dangers of smoking. The existing campaign is a joke and is not <Col N="1130" /> taken seriously.  The reason the cigarette industry co-operates with it is because they know it is a joke and has little real impact on the sale of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I should like to take up in the context of the Minister's remarks, indeed in the context of drug abuse.  I cannot recollect whether this arose directly in the Minister's speech or out of a report circulated and on which I compliment the Minister &mdash; indeed I wish I had had greater opportunity to examine it before today &mdash; but the report referred to the different approaches of different hospitals to the amounts of drugs being used or prescribed.  This varied approach about the prescription of drugs for adults and young people, particularly adults, is reflected in the medical profession, where some doctors will prescribe drugs in certain circumstances and others will not &mdash; drugs, some of which can have a tranquilising effect or the reverse and on which many people in our society are now dependent.  I would hope we could highlight the problem thereby created.  I come into contact with far too many people who are on tranquilisers, who have no major health problems but who because of their difficult family or social circumstances &mdash; so that they can come to terms with their situation &mdash; are being tranquilised into acceptance.</P>
    <P>There is a need in the medical profession to seek a greater degree of understanding in the area of drugs.  Here I would lighlight the problems with which I have been dealing professionally over the years in the area of marital breakdown. Far too often one comes across the battered wife who has been assaulted for years in her family home, who has lived in that situation, in a sort of twilight zone, tranquilised into a form of acceptance that they are the realities of life in the latter half of the 20th century.  Very often all such a person requires is the help and support of a social worker or legal assistance. In some areas of the medical profession there is the need to ask that they be somewhat more alert than they have been in the past, in particular in prescribing tranquilisers.  Lest anything I say be taken as a slight on the medical profession, I should say I do not wish it <Col N="1131" /> to be so taken.  I pay tribute to the great number of general practitioners who provide a service way beyond the call of their duties, not merely dealing with medical problems but social ones as well.  In some instances there has been a lack of perception of the reason people are looking for tranquiliser-type prescriptions.  Often there is too great a readiness to provide them instead of other remedies and assistance which would be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his commitment to the psychiatric services and those for the mentally handicapped.  In this context, indeed within the context of our general hospitals, it is my understanding that we now luxuriate in the knowledge that we have something in the region of 120 units of accommodation available throughout the country but which are not being used through lack of adequate funds.  This can be listed from county to county, particularly in the context of psychiatric units and units for the mentally handicapped.  For example, there is a psychiatric unit in Carlow which has been available since 1981 but which, as far as I am aware, is not functioning.  Then there are psychiatric units and units for the mentally handicapped in Cork.  The same applies in Donegal.  In Dublin there is a whole series of units available for use but in respect of which funds have not been made available for the necessary staff to enable them function.  In St. Michael's House in Ballymun there are available 50 residential units for the severely-mentally handicapped which I understand are not being used.  I understand also that there are six specially built bungalows that have been in existence there for something like two and a half years, that have not been fully used or taken up and where one or two only are at present operational.  St. Michael's House in Kilmacud in my constituency at present can provide additional places for children in multi-handicapped units but they are not in a position to utilise these. Again, St. Michael's House in Rathfarnham Castle is in a similar situation.</P>
    <P>I have talked about the children's services being the cinderella of our health <Col N="1132" /> services.  The whole area of our psychiatric and mental handicap services would not even qualify as the cinderella of our health services because they have long been ignored, not fully or properly provided for, lacking a proper and coherent policy approach in the sense that, while we have policies, we do not fully and properly implement them but rather engage in a form of ad hoc-ry in dealing with them.  I hope the Minister will tell us what will be the situation in the next 12 months in these various psychiatric and mental handicap units, those that are built, available, providing potential places but which cannot at present be utilised due to the absence of the necessary funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief, bearing in mind the pressure of time on the House this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the point raised earlier by Deputy Sherlock about the problems experienced specifically by mothers of young children in health centres.  This is a problem brought repeatedly to my attention and on which I have been asked to make representation. Anybody who visits a health centre on the day the doctor is in attendance will realise what a very important and useful service it is.  But it is unrealistic and unfair that the mothers who bring their children to the doctor to be examined or for a check-up cannot get drugs at that centre. I wonder would the Minister consider having available there a limited range of drugs.  I understand the problems being experienced at present by chemists and pharmacists who have very good and expensive security with regard to drugs. Certainly I do not suggest that the risk of drug abuse should be expanded.  However, I would ask that the type of drugs likely to be needed for this aspect of health care in health centres be stocked. It need not necessarily be free.  For people with medical cards, yes; but there are many mothers who would be prepared and willing to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's remarks he referred to the fact that this year the average cost per patient in a general teaching hospital will amount to approximately <Col N="1133" /> £665 per week.  The Minister went on to say that we must now endeavour to concentrate the minds of all concerned on the steps required to stem the tide of hospital admissions to ensure that only those who need to be admitted are referred for in-patient care.  This suggestion begs the question: if there are to be cut-backs on some services in order to create or expand on others, how will this reallocation be effected?</P>
    <P>I would appeal passionately that an allocation be made to expand and in some cases develop ancillary services within the community.  For far too long we have paid lip service to the allocation of funds and having realistic community ancillary services.  Here I am talking particularly about people who are discharged from hospital, people who think they could or should be in hospital, or whose relatives feel they could or should be in hospital. I have advocated the provision of such ancillary services for many years.  I have observed the lack of these services and feel very sad about it.  We have in this country approximately 1,000 public health nurses, some of whom serve a catchment group of up to 9,000 people.  That would be the case in a county like Donegal.  The ideal &mdash; it is not perfect &mdash; but the ideal situation within which our public health nurses have said they can operate would be 2,500 people per nurse, that is if there are ancillary services to back them up.</P>
    <P>I recently had in my clinic a mother of ten children who came home from hospital after the third Caesarean.  The youngest child at home was one year and three months and she was living in a three-bedroom house under very distressing conditions.  I asked her what service, what nurse, what community help she had and the answer was &ldquo;None&rdquo;. This mother was obviously a case at risk in relation to the mother's health and the baby's health.  There was no link between the hospital, where I presume the medical social worker would know this woman's history and background, and the home.</P>
    <P>I know the work of public health nurses.  People of my generation know they are a group of very committed nurses who perform a unique service. <Col N="1134" /> They are accepted in homes throughout the country.  They can come into a home and very often detect problems before they are obvious to the family doctor. They made representations to the Minister for an expansion of this service but I feel it is disgraceful that a country, which has the highest birth rate in the EEC, has the worst community service when it comes to the ancilliary services available for people who come home from hospital or people who are ill at home.</P>
    <P>I know that in the economic crisis we have at the moment it is necessary to have cut-backs.  If we are to have cut-backs in the hospital area I suggest we cannot leave people without any services at all.  I would like to think that the figure of 1,000 public health nurses will be increased dramatically in the next year.</P>
    <P>At the end of the Minister's speech he spoke about glue-sniffing and he defined it.  He said:</P>
    <P>Although glue-sniffing is seen in the context of the drug problem generally, glue in itself is not a dangerous substance and would not, therefore, come within the scope of controls relating to such substance administered by other Departments. </P>
    <P>I suggest that the damage caused to children's health by glue-sniffing is such that it should come under whatever legislation is introduced in relation to up-dating the 1908 Children's Act.  The Minister said he proposes to extend this provision in the new Children's Bill to apply to other products as may be prescribed by him from time to time.  He also said the 1908 Children's Act at the moment prohibits the sale of cigarettes and intoxicating liquor to people under 18 years.  I appeal to the Minister to devise some way to prohibit the sale of the glue that is used by those children.  They can be seen quite near to Leinster House staggering around in an almost unconscious state.  Those are the symptoms which are obvious to us. We do not know what the long-term symptoms are or what the damage to their health is.  I appeal to the Minister to find some way of restricting or prohibiting the sale of this glue to children.  This <Col N="1135" /> problem will become much worse if something is not done about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal to cover and I will have to try to cover the points as briefly as I can.  Perhaps I will start by taking up some of the points made by Deputy Fennell. I must be sure to cover Deputy Fitzpatrick's point in relation to Cavan Hospital, whatever else I do.  With regard to the glue-sniffing my intention is that the power given will be broad enough to include a variety of substances.  The intention is to give the power to deal with the glue or other substances.  As the Deputy knows, it changes from one substance to another at different times.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned public health nurses.  The number at the moment is 1,300.  Before I left office we were quite proud that we reached the level set by a working party earlier as the norm we should achieve.  I accept what the Deputy says, circumstances have changed, the population is different from what it was at the time and, in line with the general development of our community-based services, we should now be setting ourselves a different norm.  The target was to get 1,300 nurses.  We have reached that target now and we have to look at where we are going.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says about the value of public health nurses in the community.  In relation to admissions, Deputy Fennell took up exactly the point I was trying to make, that the ancillary services must be developed in the community and the resources must be better spread between the major hospitals and the community facilities.  The Deputy referred to drugs, health centres and making certain drugs available.  I know the Deputy appreciates the difficulties in regard to this but I will examine the matter. There is a variety of difficulties in that area not at least of which is the relationship with the chemists who are supplying the service at this stage.  We will certainly look at that and do whatever we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had fairly wide-ranging contributions. I intended to make more comprehensive <Col N="1136" /> replies to some of those matters because if we had the time, I had in my original speech a much more comprehensive contribution on the psychiatric services, the services for the mentally handicapped and other matters but these are matters we now have to leave for another day.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters in Deputy Flaherty's contribution I would like to refer to.  I would like to refer particularly to the point she made about only 1 per cent of children being born at home now, that of the 74,000 children born in 1980, only 1 per cent were born at home.  The Deputy asked about reducing the stay in hospital to 24 hours possibly and having community support.  She might find there would be some objection to that short term but it is down to three days at the moment.  There are objections to it being only three days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned it purely as an option.  I did not want this to be compulsory. I feel it should be available as an option which people could choose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The option of going home is probably there at the moment but the advisability might not always be there.  I agree with the Deputy that the services in the community would need to be increased <i>pro rata.</i>  As I said, the stay is down to three days which is a considerable development.  We could talk a lot about this because there has been a dramatic change in recent years with women going into the major hospitals, which has put a great strain on the services although it has meant a much higher standard.  This area will have to be looked into in relation to the community back-up facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were various questions raised about capital development and about staff and specialists being required here and there throughout the country.  Deputies on the other side must know that there is an embargo on the appointment of staff and when you appoint a consultant you are talking about the back-up staff that go with that consultant.  We hope to have those matters resolved in some of the priority areas shortly.  One Deputy asked about orthodontists.  This <Col N="1137" /> is one of our top priorities and I hope to have movement in that area fairly soon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty raised the question of how the National Council for the Aged and The National Council for Children are to be serviced.  I would agree with her suggestion that with the setting up of the new board these councils should be regarded directly as advisory bodies and serviced separately.  The new board will be a statutory board.</P>
    <P>The question of dental services involves a substantial debate.  Deputies will know that I am committed to this field.  We have had discussions with the chairman of the Dental Association and we hope to make progress in that respect. There are a number of complex issues involved, including the question of the supply of dentists, and that brings us into the area of education.  That area and the area of opthalmic services generally are areas to which I will be giving attention.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the Women's Aid hostel.  I wish to confirm that the hostel is going ahead. We have had some discussions about the design that was there but which does not seem to be adequate and we are considering some improvements in the earlier design.</P>
    <P>Concerning the Green Paper on the handicapped, it is my intention to have this document published by the autumn. Had I remained in office last year it would have been my intention to have had it published by last autumn.  However, I am confident that it will be ready by the coming autumn.</P>
    <P>There was reference also to the question of mobile allowances.  These allowances were increased in the budget this year.  Finances to increase them had not been provided earlier.  However, the allowances will be increased further in the future.</P>
    <P>There were some direct questions from Deputy Fitzpatrick about Cavan hospital and a number of other questions were raised about matters such as the role of the voluntary hospitals.  We are fortunate in having the mix of hospitals and services that we have.  I have been at a number of conferences recently where I heard people with an international background <Col N="1138" /> as well as some of our people expressing acceptance of this situation.  We should be very careful lest we might denigrate the service.  The mix we have is one of the strengths of the service.  Perhaps we must find more efficient ways of handling this mix, but essentially it is a good mix and one that is being copied increasingly in Great Britain, despite all that is said about the services there.  Deputies may know that the chief of our Voluntary Health Board was enticed to Britain recently to develop that area there.</P>
    <P>I wish to give Deputy Fitzpatrick my assurance that I was committed to the Cavan hospital question before I left office last year.  He probably discovered that after I left office, but he seemed to have been somewhat suspicious of me during my tenure of office.  I assure him that I remain committed to this matter and that the hospital will go ahead without let or hindrance, without delay in any way.  We will go ahead with the completion of the planning stages and on to the work of construction.  The specific approval of the fifth stage is a matter that I will follow up.</P>

      <P>Deputy Spring raised the question of Tralee hospital.  What happened in that case was that because the clearance for the equipment in 1981 was set back, there was a delay.  The delay was because quite an amount of the equipment is subject to a delay period from the time of ordering. That ordering process is going ahead.  In any event the building is now completed and the builder will shortly move off the site, although there may be one or two things still to be done.  I should like to assure the Deputy that equipping is going ahead and we have provided the money in this Estimate for that.  The Deputy need not have any concern about that matter at this stage.  Early in 1984 we will open the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy raised a question about the health centre and I must agree with him that the buildings there are in a <Col N="1142" /> deplorable condition.

    <P>Deputy Shatter raised a number of questions and I regret that he was not here to hear my contribution when introducing the Estimate.  I also regret that he is not present for my reply, because his absence makes it very difficult to communicate. I should like to tell the Deputy that I resent his suggestion that the Department do not have the integrity or the objectivity to undertake an investigation of the two cases of child-battering that he referred to.  It is demeaning the public service, which is at a high standard in the Department of Health.  I should like to assure the Deputy that the investigation being undertaken is a thorough one and will cover the issues he has raised.  The Deputy also raised a question about psychiatric services.  I was asked how much was being spent on Coolmine. Through the health board Coolmine will be getting £90,000 this year.  I agree that it is one form of therapy.

      <P>The Deputy raised a point in relation to the occurrences of it and he mentioned that it was high in Ireland. There are two basic reasons for this.  One is that we do not condone abortion.  We are not prepared to abort children and that is a national matter.  As a result of that we have an extra responsibility in relation to the Down's syndrome children, and I accept that.  Secondly, the marriage rate has tended to be higher.  In births to women over the age of 35&mdash;this is a scientific fact&mdash;the instance of Down's syndrome is higher.  They are the two contributory factors to our position.  I have noted the Deputy's point about the Cavan group.  Of course, we have Drumcar which is not so far away and in which we have invested considerable resources. We will pursue the points made by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Permission has been given to Deputy Gay Mitchell to raise on the Adjournment the question of the designation of certain inner city areas in respect of financial provision for educational matters.  I know I can appeal to Deputy Mitchell to conclude by 5.20, in about 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I have asked to raise this matter on the Adjournment is that a Private Notice Question of mine to the Minister for Education was disallowed.  That question was to ask the Minister for Education if he would make a statement on reports that officials from his Department have informed Dublin inner city school principals that Dublin inner city has been defined by his Department for special treatment purposes as being in general the north inner city east of O'Connell Street.  Secondly, given the redefinition of that special designated inner city area, has £200,000 additional funding been provided for these specific schools to be used before Christmas, 1982?  In view of the general question of discrimination which arises will the Minister make an urgent statement on the matter, particularly in view of the horror and concern expressed by a widely representative group of Dublin inner city school principals?  Unfortunately, that question was ruled out of order and I felt it necessary to move that this be raised on the Adjournment here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background is that meetings of principals from inner city schools north and south of the Liffey have taken place. These principals are gravely concerned about the lack of finance and the difficulties facing the schools, which have, in fairness, been building up over a long period.  Their meetings have included meetings with Dáil Deputies from all sides of the House.  I understand that they met the Minister for Education and that they had a meeting with officials from the Minister's Department last Friday when they were told to their astonishment that this special treatment was to be given to a specially designated area on the north <Col N="1150" /> side of Dublin, east of O'Connell Street largely, although I understand that there were a few minor exceptions.</P>
    <P>I am raising this matter because, as a Deputy who represents the south side of Dublin, both inner and outer, I am concerned about these discriminatory steps that have been indicated to this group of principals. Many schools and principals in the area I represent are as badly in need and their needs have not been given the same critical examination as those in the north inner city, especially part of the north inner city approximating to a section of Deputy Gregory's Dáil constituency.  I feel concerned that education, of all things, should become the political football that the present Government seem to want to indicate it can become for the purpose of trying to buy a few more months of survival in this House as Government, because we all know that is about as long as you have left.  You have no more by-elections, no more tricks to pull&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;no more counter-strokes. I will address my remarks to the Chair.  In future I hope that the Government will not be pulling the strokes they have been pulling and instead will get on with proper, legitimate governing of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many deprived areas on the south side of the city, leaving aside the outer city which in many cases has problems of its own.  If the Minister were to take a tour around, say, St. Teresa's Gardens, Fatima Mansions, Bridgefoot Street flats, Oliver Bond flats, Thomas Court or certain sections on the south side which I represent he would find there communities who are very deprived educationally as well as economically.  I am sure that my two colleagues for the constituency, Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Fitzpatrick, who are members of the Fianna Fáil Party, would argue &mdash; if they got the opportunity &mdash; that they would not accept the Minister's handling of this situation in allowing this to happen where a section of this city can be given <Col N="1151" /> special educational priority on no basis other than the fact that the Government need to buy a vote for a few more months' survival.  It is an absolute disgrace and nobody knows better than the Minister for Education that it is a disgrace.  Many regional areas need special attention. There are many areas where the Government are depending on the support of Deputies.  If people in those regions knew about the special treatment being given to Deputy Gregory's constituency, because the Government need to buy his support for a few more months, they too would be trying to get on to this new educational gravy train.  It is an absolute disgrace.  Education cannot be provided on the basis of political favouritism.  This would not have happened in the worst days of British occupation or under any sort of colonial administration but it is now happening under a native administration. It is difficult to believe and it is a disgusting practice.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 10 March 1982, which gives details of the document agreed by Deputies Haughey and Gregory. A number of areas of agreement are outlined in this witnessed document and there are specific promises in relation to education which discriminate in favour of north inner city areas and against other equally deprived areas.</P>
    <P>My objection is not to the north inner city getting special treatment.  Indeed, there is probably a good case for this, but there is an equally good case for parts of the south city or for other parts of the north city or other regions.  There was no critical examination of these proposals, nor was there an examination of other educational needs.  It was purely a political stroke.  We have seen other political strokes, particularly when Deputy Haughey has held office as Taoiseach, but this must be the lowest stroke of all time.  If special treatment is to be given, let it be given to all those in need and not only to those in certain sections of this city.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Primary Education&rdquo;<i>The Irish Times</i> states:</P>
    <P>From this decision to declare the <Col N="1152" /> north inner city an educational priority area Fianna Fáil will provide the primary schools in the north inner city with:</P>
    <P>&mdash; An improved pupil-teacher ratio, of the order of 1 teacher to every 25 pupils.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Increased number of remedial teachers on the basis of one per national school or per 200 pupils, whichever is the lesser, and improved remedial facilities. </P>
    <P>Only the north inner city area is mentioned. These decisions were not reached as a result of an examination by the Minister's staff or research carried out by his Department.  This was a private agreement between two Deputies to buy a vote and the consequence is that this is being forced through the Department of Education without any proper examination.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>It is our intention to declare the Dublin north inner city an educational priority area.  This will enable positive discrimination to be exercised in favour of a socially deprived area, and special measures taken by suspending normal Department of Education rules. </P>
    <P>The normal rules of the Department of Education have been suspended to facilitate the vote of one Deputy and what the document calls `positive discrimination' is actually discrimination against many people who are equally in need.  I have no objection to people in the north inner city receiving special treatment but I want equality of treatment of all our citizens, particularly those who are blatantly in need on the south side of the city.</P>
    <P>The document names schools in Eccles Street, North Great George's Street, Dominick Street and the Sisters' of Charity School in Gardiner Street.  It states that these schools, if they obtained the necessary extra facilities, could concentrate on serving the northern inner city population rather than a wider catchment area.  Here again priority is being given <Col N="1153" /> to this area without any proper examination having been carried out.</P>
    <P>The document also states:</P>
    <P>We accept that Seville Place represents an exceptional situation and that a special effort will be made both at pre-school and primary level. Resources will be provided for a pilot pre-school and the primary school will be reorganised along the lines of the Rutland Street Scheme with special provision made for slow learners. </P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts that Seville Place is an exceptional case, will he not also accept that there are many schools on the south side, in Donore Avenue and elsewhere, which also represent special cases?  Why is equal treatment not being given to these people?  Why are people in the north inner city being more favourably treated than people elsewhere?</P>
    <P>There is mention also of a community school for Lower Gardiner Street at a cost of £3 million.  I could go on quoting from this document but I have already used up much of my time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend taking my 20 minutes.  I do not think there is any reply, despite the Chair's intervention.  I do not care who tries to protect the Government or the Minister for Education; the indictment is there.  The rules of the Department have been suspended because of political, not educational, need.</P>
      <P>On 11 March 1982, the day after the publication of this document, I stated that I would take legal advice on the constitutionality of the agreement between the two Deputies and its consequences. I am informed that the document is unconstitutional, particularly in relation to the educational promises contained in it.  I understand that it is not constitutional for the proper rules to be suspended and for discrimination to be made in favour of any section of the community, whether in Dublin or outside it.  The Minister is obliged to follow normal procedures and practice and constitutionally cannot discriminate in favour of some of our children and against others. This is what has happened.  I am advised that there is a very good chance that the section of this agreement which attempts to discriminate in favour of one area of the inner city is most likely unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The Minister is probably getting into a situation about which he knows nothing. The Minister for Agriculture in the course of the recent by-election campaign made announcements about all sorts of schools which the Minister for Education did not know about. It is quite likely that the Taoiseach has directed the staff in his absence and, knowing the Minister for Education, I doubt if he has done anything but acquiesce.  The matter has been taken out of his hands completely.  Nevertheless, he is the Minister responsible and we may have to go after him in a very special way if these plans are carried forward in the discriminatory manner proposed, according to information supplied to principals of inner city schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my horror at these proposals. This is outrageous and probably one of the great scandals of political life in recent times.  Certainly it would not have happened in the time of Donogh O'Malley because he would have been <Col N="1155" /> too strong for the Taoiseach and would have told him where to go.  I am wondering why the Minister for Education has not the gumption to tell the Taoiseach the same thing &mdash; treat all our children with the same respect and give them all the same opportunities.  If they have needs let us treat their needs on merit, not according to political gimmickry.</P>
    <P>This is an outrageous, unchristian act and it will get strong opposition from this side of the House.  I appeal to the Minister to stand up to the Taoiseach because sooner or later he will no longer be in office.  The rest of his so-called friends will desert him, leaving only those who, like the Members of the Third Reich under Hitler, will ask afterwards, &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo;  I appeal to the Minister to stand up to the Taoiseach, to tell him he will not preside over what is happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that this is outrageous discrimination.  He should give an undertaking that other deprived areas will get the same status and be given the same funds as were spent before Christmas. I understand £500 per school can be spent without having to refer to the Department, where the school merely sends in an invoice and the Department pay the balance.  Even at this hour I ask the Minister to declare that he will scrap the ruling and that he will give all people in deprived areas the same opportunities. We do not want to make a strong issue about this.  We do not want to have to pursue the Minister for Education.  However, if the Minister will not do what we ask him in this case, we have no option but to seek his resignation.  It may be that we will have to put the matter to a vote in this House.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister to do the reasonable thing and to give the same opportunities to people in deprived areas.  I ask him to cut out the nonsense and the gimmickry that has gone on in all spheres of government.  I ask him to stand up to the Taoiseach and to accept the responsibilities of his office.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity <Col N="1156" /> to clarify some of the matters raised by the Deputy.  Obviously I will be able to give only very short replies because of the limited time at my disposal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell placed a certain emphasis on the constitutionality of the matter and he suggested he had had some legal advice.  The Deputy would need to have that clarified.  In particular, he would need to clarify some of his own thinking on the matter.  On a number of occasions he said he wanted equality of treatment for all citizens but on other occasions he appeared to accept the notion of what is usually referred to as positive discrimination in favour of specified disadvantaged groups.  He said he would accept comparable treatment to that suggested for one area if it were accorded to some other areas in the Dublin area.  The Deputy mentioned also the possibility of other urban centres requiring the same type of treatment.</P>
      <P>On the constitutionality aspect, there is a considerable amount of discrimination for or against particular groups depending on how one views the matter. Obviously discrimination for one group can be implied as discrimination against another group.  That exists whether on religious, geographic or income grounds. There are a number of heads under which positive discrimination is deliberately exercised as a matter of policy in our educational system, not to provide equality of treatment in the sense of doing the same for each child irrespective of circumstances but rather trying to correct some imbalances in the opportunities open to children from different backgrounds. If the Deputy wishes to raise the issue of the constitutionality of discriminatory actions, it is a matter on which I would like some clarification.  Perhaps it might be more appropriate if there were some informal discussions rather than plunging straight into an issue that, if it were to come forward in the form suggested by the Deputy, would have serious implications for the whole conduct of our general educational system, not just for the inner city areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the inner city and the question of discrimination for a particular area, I would point out to the Deputy&mdash;<Col N="1157" /> he referred at one stage to the fact that I knew little or nothing about the area&mdash; that I was involved in considerable work in the educational area starting 20 years ago.  In 1968 I had the privilege of being associated with what was the first scheme for positive discrimination at the primary education level.</P>

      <P>A particular area was chosen for what became known as the Rutland Street Project&mdash;incidentally, it happens to be in the area to which the Deputy referred.  If I applied the Deputy's language to it I would say that the normal rules of the Department of Education were suspended for the purposes of the operation.  To the best of my knowledge it went on for 14 years, with the support and blessing of many people not only in education but also in other spheres of community life.</P>
      <P>The concept introduced at that time is the one that is now sought to be applied to a number of other areas where it is felt that a combination of social, economic and other factors give rise to significant disadvantage in the education of young people.  That is the context in which the question of spending additional funds on education in these areas has arisen.  With previous ministerial responsibility I was the Minister who established what became known as the inner City Committee. The report of that committee is the document on which much of this discussion is based.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Among other things, that report sought to give some definition to the inner city area which was broadly defined as being the area between the canals.  Then it became a question of seeking to define within that geographical area the particular characteristics relevant for exercising positive discrimination whether under the heading of education, employment, housing and so on.  The subject matter of the <Col N="1158" /> question and the Deputy's remarks are bound up with matters that did not originate on 9 March 1982.  The Deputy read out quotations from <i>The Irish Times</i> but they are in no way inconsistent with the more general policy of positive discrimination in favour of disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked if I would make a statement on reports that officials from my Department informed inner city schools of a redefinition.  That has not been done.  As the Deputy pointed out, I met all the principals and had a long discussion with them.  I should have thought if there was to be any question of delivering a definition that it would be more appropriate for the Minister to do so.  I did not hear the Deputy suggest I had given any such definition.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any official pronouncement of any kind from my Department which carries any such definition.  My understanding is that the meeting to which the Deputy referred, and which is the basis for the rather strong language and the wild accusations that have been thrown around, is that it was a meeting to which some officials from my Department had been invited, not for the purpose of defining or redefining the inner city area but simply of exploring some of the priorities and problems faced by schools in the inner city district.</P>

Of the 90, two did not participate in training by AnCO, one having taken up alternative employment and one because of prolonged sick absence.  At present, the provisions of the agreement are being applied to 88 men; (c) The average weekly payment to the 88 men amounts to £8,880; (d) I have no information to hand as to the cost and extent of the training provided by AnCO; (e) So far, the Industrial Development Authority has not succeeded in securing the establishment of a suitable alternative project (or projects) that would provide alternative employment for the men but these efforts are being maintained.  In addition, other employment possibilities, including in the public sector, are being followed up; (f) Since it is not possible to forecast the outcomes of the efforts referred to at (e), it would be premature to speculate at this stage as to the cost, if any, of implementation of the agreement in 1983; (g) There is no formal date of expiry specified in the agreement.</P>

      <P>Bord na gCapall spent a total of £19,352 on the purchase of four stallions <Col N="1098" /> (three Irish draught and one thoroughbred) in 1981 for leasing under their Leased Stallion Scheme.</P>
      <P>The board, like any private purchaser, are unlikely ever to be fully satisfied with the performance of all stallions purchased over the years.  Nevertheless, the board are satisfied that, based on foaling returns, their present pool of stallions are performing in a highly successful manner.</P>
      <P>Stallions purchased by the board are disposed of if, after an appropriate time at stud, they are not considered successful. One of the stallions purchased in 1981 developed a pathological condition and was disposed of in accordance with the board's policy.</P>
      <P>The location of the board's current pool of stallions is detailed in the following statement:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The action needed to improve the quality of service between these areas is the provision of additional circuits on the Waterford-Cork route, which serves them both.  The provision of these circuits must, regrettably, await the completion of major works planned and in progress in the Cork and Waterford areas as part of the programme for upgrading the telephone service generally.  These works include a new digital exchange at Waterford and a major exchange complex at Cork.  Part of these works will be completed this year but the desired improvement on the route cannot be effected until the bringing into service of the new Waterford exchanges next year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, a new Lismore-Cork trunk route provided recently will have the effect of reducing the traffic being carried through Dungarvan exchange and the possibility of giving further interim relief on this and other routes serving the Dungarvan and Youghal area is being examined.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an incapacity which he attributed to an accident at work on 5 December 1981. On completion of inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity it was accepted that the incapacity was due to an accident at work and the claim was allowed.  Payment of injury benefit for the period from 5 December 1981 to 29 April 1982, was made on 29 April 1982, on the basis of information furnished by the employers as to the period of absence from work.  Payment after that date was not made because medical evidence of incapacity was not received.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the Deputy's inquiry the employers were again contacted and it was confirmed that the claimant is still absent from work by reason of the accident injury and that he has furnished medical certificates to my Department. As, however, he has been quoting an incorrect RSI number the certificates were not associated with his claim.  The matter has now been rectified and payment of all benefit due to 4 June 1982 has been made.  The claimant has been advised of the correct RSI number and has been requested to quote this number on all medical certificates and other correspondence in connection with his claim.</P>
