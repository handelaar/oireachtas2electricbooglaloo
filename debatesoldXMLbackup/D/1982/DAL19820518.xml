      <P>The amount of money spent by my Department on this type of advertising was as follows: 1979, £35,395.48; 1980, £2,758.78; 1981, £892.10.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not that information. However, I can give the Deputy an outline of what was involved.  The major sum in 1979 of £35,000-odd was in <Col N="1294" /> connection with the constitutional amendment and the expenditure in 1980 was almost entirely concerned with the advertising for the post of Manager of the National Concert Hall.  The 1981 amount was advertising telephone numbers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if his Department will make provision to assist Kildare County Council to construct houses for retiring members of the Defence Forces in order to avoid the serious problems encountered by &ldquo;overholders&rdquo; in County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>Arrangements will be made, as resources permit, for the replacement as soon as possible of all unsuitable married quarters, including those at the Curragh Camp.  It is proposed to use the provision for new married quarters in the Defence Estimate for 1982 to meet, among other things, the cost of the planning and initial development of 37 new quarters at the camp.  These will be additional to the 130 modern quarters already provided there.</P>
      <P>I am aware that, for a very long time, the situation at the camp in regard to overholders has been unsatisfactory despite the action taken by the local authority to rehouse a number of them. It is my intention to use my best efforts to find a solution to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the overholders, is it the case that Kildare County Council some time ago indicated to the Department of Defence that they were willing to share the cost of providing extra accommodation?  If this is the case, would the Minister take the matter up and see if progress can be made on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of this case. During my time on Kildare County Council, I made a similar suggestion.  I am hoping that some type of special scheme as the Deputy has mentioned will be evolved which will be of benefit to the overholders concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the reason the women officers who were appointed in May 1981 and who had to have a university degree or equivalent have not been promoted to full lieutenant rank while their male counterparts have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the officers to whom the question relates are the eight female officers of the Permanent Defence Force who were appointed to be officers on 27 April 1981.</P>
      <P>The conditions of service of the female officers in question, in common with those of their male counterparts, provide for promotion to the rank of lieutenant after two years' service in the rank of second-lieutenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the ladies in question were obliged to have a university degree in order to apply for entry into the cadet school, while their male counterparts are not so obliged?  Is it not also the case that while the regulations state that promotion to lieutenant follows in two years, in the majority of cases, for male entrants to the commissioned ranks, promotion to lieutenant takes place sooner than that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a prerequisite.  The scheme as advertised stipulated that one of the qualifications was a university degree.  All the applicants entered for the examination in this knowledge.  Defence Force regulations outlined that promotion from second-lieutenant to lieutenant would be in two years and from lieutenant to captain would be in eight years and these conditions will be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that in the majority of instances male members commissioned <Col N="1298" /> into the forces who have a university degree are promoted in advance of the normal schedule, some within six months at the most?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware, but I can assure the Deputy that the conditions were laid down when these cadets were being recruited and these conditions are being adhered to strictly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister assure the House that there is no difference in the promotion opportunities between females with a university degree enlisted in the cadet corps and males?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is no discrimination between them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate why, in the case of female entrants, it was judged necessary to make it a condition that they were university graduates when this is not the case in relation to male entrants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>These were the first female officers recruited and I suppose it would have helped to short-list them.  In the normal course of events, after completing two years in a military college, a male cadet would attend university.  In the case of females, it was possible to put them straight into their units when their two years were completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of female entrants, there is a feeling that they are being put into purely administrative <Col N="1299" /> duties which are far below their qualifications. For that reason, the requirement of a university degree would seem to be out of line with the duties to which they are assigned or to take it the other way around, the fact that they are university graduates would not suit them for a more active participation in the life of the Defence Forces, which now seems to be planned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he has considered the outline development plan for the Naval Service on Spike Island and the consultants' report on the linking of Spike Island to Haulbowline; if he will give full details of the report; if he agrees with it and if he intends to proceed with it; and, if so, if he will give an undertaking to proceed with costings and a timetable for implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the consultants proposed a bridge which would have 14 spans and would maintain a minimum clearance of seven metres over the deepest part of the channel between Haulbowline and Spike Island.  Certain site investigations are now being carried out, on land and under the sea-bed by a specialist firm to determine the type of foundations which would be required for such a bridge.  When the investigations have been completed the matter will be considered further.  In the meantime, works to meet the immediate needs of the Naval Service on Spike Island are being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give details of the report?  Does he agree with the report and could he give some indication as to when work will begin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the report. There was no room for expansion in Haulbowline and the situation was <Col N="1300" /> regarded as critical.  We have six ships in operation and one more under construction. The authorities considered the use of Spike Island and came to the conclusion that a bridge should be built to link Spike Island with Haulbowline and that this would be the best solution to the problem.  The matter was examined, borings are now going on to determine conditions and the construction of the bridge would take about 33 months.  In September last, authorisation was given to a firm to carry out site investigations.  That is being done, they are expected to be completed shortly and, the next phase of the development can then be carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>What funds are provided in this year's Estimates for carrying out the work mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware there are no funds in the Estimates for 1982 for building the bridge.  There is a possibility that, because of the infrastructural facilities that are also being used for fishery protection purposes, some of the expenditure may be recouped from the EEC and that angle is being pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that no funds have been provided in the 1982 Estimates and that it will take 33 months to build the bridge? Will the 33 months begin from the introduction of the 1983 Estimates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that many families <Col N="1301" /> are living in dwellings at McKee Park, Dublin which are in very bad condition; whether he has arranged to meet the people concerned to discuss the matter; and if he will give details of the housing situation for soldiers in McKee and Collins Barracks, Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The married quarters in McKee Park, which were built in 1954, provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation. At this stage however, they require some repairs which my Department are having effected.  These repairs are the subject of discussions between the occupants of the quarters and the appropriate military authorities.</P>
      <P>Four of the married quarters at Collins Barracks, Arbour Hill, have recently been built and are in excellent condition. The remainder of the quarters are very old and, as they become vacant, are not being re-allocated.  It is proposed to demolish them and, in due course, to have them replaced by modern dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the system of providing accommodation for the Defence Forces?  The responsibility is divided between the Minister's Department and the local authorities and there is a feeling that members of the Defence Forces leave in order to qualify for houses.  Would the Minister consider the position of providing houses for members of the Defence Forces because, at present, they are falling between two stools, the local authority and the Department of Defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is a conflict of interests here.  It is the duty of the Department of Defence to provide married quarters for members who wish to avail of them and that is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it is the duty of his Department to provide married quarters but is the Minister aware that local authorities also provide housing accommodation for married personnel within the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  I am pleased to say that, in this instance, <Col N="1302" /> Dublin Corporation have been very co-operative in rehousing occupants of old married quarters in Arbour Hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that members of the Defence Forces have been prohibited from contacting Deputies by directive of the Chief of Staff, would the Minister not agree that he should meet the people concerned to discuss the matter in view of the fact that he has been a very bad landlord and has put the responsibility for this matter on the shoulders of Dublin Corporation which has had the effect of transferring the Estimates for the Department of Defence to Dublin Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be in a position soon to issue a statement which will clarify the position.  It is only in regard to service matters that members of the Defence Forces are prohibited from contacting their Deputies.  I see no difficulty, particularly in regard to local authority housing, why a member of the Defence Forces should not have ample opportunity to discuss the problem with his local representative.</P>

    <P>14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will encourage members of the Defence Forces to set up housing co-operatives to provide houses for Defence Force personnel in view of the non-availability of housing in many locations where Defence Force units are based and of the lack of housing available to his Department for military personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if, in view of the widespread disquiet at present regarding Defence Forces' accommodation as evidenced by an RTE television programme and the health report presented to Dublin Corporation, he will make public the report of the board of officers set up by the Quartermaster-General in September 1980 which was referred to in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 26 on 8 April 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1303" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married soldiers have an equal claim on such housing with other members of the community in the same category.  The policy of my Department is to supplement the efforts of local authorities where soldiers' housing needs are greatest. Since 1954, 334 new married quarters have been provided at various locations throughout the country, including 92 in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>It is the intention that all unsuitable married quarters will be replaced by modern housing.  Work is now nearing completion on the first phase of the programme for the replacement of the married quarters at Cathal Brugha Barracks. This phase comprises 12 dwellings.  The planning of further new quarters at the barracks and at the Curragh Camp and Collins Barracks, Cork, is being undertaken. The report referred to by the Deputy will be taken into account when plans for the building of further new married quarters are being considered.  It is not intended to publish it.</P>
      <P>It will continue to be the policy to encourage members of the Permanent Defence Force to set up co-operative schemes for the building of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the reply given by the Minister to a previous question, does he stand over his suggestion that the wives of members of the Defence Forces may contact Deputies?  In view of the fact that the health report of Dublin Corporation has resulted in some of the accommodation being declared unfit for human habitation, will he now take his responsibility seriously?  The fact is that some of the accommodation is not fit for the lowliest animals to live in, but the Minister expects members of the Defence Forces to live in them.  I have asked Dublin Corporation for details on the Minister's behalf and I am asking the Minister now if he will set up or arrange to have set up a housing co-operative, <Col N="1304" /> and if he will see to it that the persons involved will be met by him or some senior officer in his Department to discuss their grievances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a grey area in regard to the legality of members of the Defence Forces approaching their elected representatives, and to get over that difficulty many of them got their wives to make representations.  That grey area will now be clarified, I hope, as a result of a definitive statement to be issued.  I agree that the standard of married quarters in some cases is very bad. The quarters in Griffith Square have been vacated, they are now closed, and we have had a certain amount of co-operation from Dublin Corporation with regard to rehousing.  Co-operatives have been particularly successful in Westmeath and Longford and it is something which the Quartermaster-General will help to expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the equality of access to local authority housing for members of the Defence Forces by comparison with the general population is more theoretical than real? Is he aware that a number of local authorities, in an endeavour to resolve the problem, set aside a number of houses for the Defence Forces from each group of new houses completed, and does the Minister agree that that is a very generous approach on the part of the local authorities? Will the Minister agree that it has become necessary to review the distribution of responsibility between his Department and the local authorities so that once and for all we can get it established with whom the responsibility lies in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>All of this will be included in the special provisions we hope to make in regard to the Department and the local authorities and this will solve the immediate problem of overholders.  The Deputy will probably be aware that this is something we will always have with us&mdash;there will always be overholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not <Col N="1305" /> agree that clarification of responsibility in this area would help us to deal with the overholders in the future?  I agree with the Minister that a special provision to be made between the Departments of Defence and the Environment could solve the problem on a year-to-year basis, but will he not agree that a proper clarification now of the distribution of responsibility might help to prevent the overholding problem from continuing in the future, which it will if we make provision on a year-to-year basis only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that such clarification would be helpful and I will do everything in my power to encourage it.  Any co-operation we get from any other source will be very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's intention to promote co-operative effort but would he elaborate on what type of co-operative housing he has in mind? Will he accept that overholding in Army houses is getting progressively worse year by year and that unless something is done immediately the situation will be beyond redemption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it merits immediate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>What type of co-operative system is the Minister talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about county councils providing the necessary loans for members of the Defence Forces, or overholders who are former members of the Defence Forces, to enable them to rehouse themselves.  We have decided that the Quartermaster General should encourage the formation of such schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Loans have been available all the time.  That is not progress towards the solution of the housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that members of the Defence Forces in Mullingar and Longford found it helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously <Col N="1306" /> talking about a proper housing co-operative system?  Will he take this up with local authorities who have Army barracks in their jurisdiction?  Would he make some contribution to the local authorities to help them to provide fully serviced sites to facilitate a proper co-operative housing scheme for Army personnel? We have heard of the medical officer's report in regard to Dublin which condemned all the accommodation as substandard.  We had a television programme outlining in detail the difficulties and the problems of the Defence Forces' accommodation.  I am asking the Minister seriously to take up with local authorities, with a contribution from his Department, the provision of serviced sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I have travelled all these roads for many years in deputations to successive Governments and Ministers for Defence with regard to the provision of serviced sites on the Curragh and elsewhere. I have gone into depth in regard to special allocations the Department of Defence might make to local authorities so that a certain number of houses in each local authority housing scheme adjacent to Army barracks could be designated for Army personnel.  I have not been very successful.  Will the Deputy accept my assurance that anything I can do to resolve this will be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Would the Minister examine my suggestion that he discuss with local authorities who have Army barracks in their area the possibility of providing fully serviced sites, with the help of an allocation from the Department? That is the first step towards providing proper Army housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

      <P>I will examine it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The peace-time function of <Col N="1308" /> our Naval Service is to assist in patrolling the territorial seas.  In regard to naval patrols, that would be the three-mile limit.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The current and prospective financial position of the National Film Studios of Ireland Limited was such that there was no reasonable prospect of the company becoming viable.  This view was shared by the board of the company. The first priority, as I saw it, was to prevent further losses by closure and liquidation as a matter of urgency, and in the interest of protecting employment in the area, to make every effort to establish there a self-sustaining industry.  I might add that if I had not taken this action, enforced closure by the company's creditors was inevitable within a matter of weeks.  In these circumstances it appeared clear to me that prior consultation with the trade unions would not achieve a viable alternative to the conclusions which I had reached.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge what the Minister says.

In effect, the Board said that whatever money is to be expended should be expended by the National Film Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some information. Ardmore Film Studios were purchased by the Government in 1973 at a cost of £.5 million in the belief that this was an essential prerequisite to the development of the film industry in Ireland. The total employment in the company was 46.  Total Exchequer grants of £1.5 million were paid since the company were set up.  The company incurred losses of the order of £.5 million per annum before grants, due to their inability to attract sufficient business and the lack of a proper capital structure which resulted in heavy interest payments.  The losses projected for this year alone were approximately £780,000.  Indebtedness to the banks had reached almost £2 million. That puts the loss situation into perspective.</P>

I would point out to the Deputy that one of the ongoing complaints from the furniture industry for some time past has been the disadvantage at which they find themselves on the Irish market <i>vis-a-vis</i> value-added tax on imports not being paid at the point of entry.  That situation was corrected in the recent budget and puts the Irish furniture industry on a level footing in a competitive sense with their foreign counterparts. That was one of the running sores of the furniture industry.  Information is not available to me on the file in relation to the upsurge of imports, but I shall be glad to communicate it to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider providing that furniture which is manufactured and sold, or even put on sale in this country, should bear a label or an indication to the effect that it complies with at least our one single mandatory standard?

    <Title>Falklands Crisis: Statement by Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make a statement informing the House of the latest position on the Falklands crisis particularly in the light of last night's meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg.  In my statement to the House on Tuesday last, 11 May, I explained comprehensively the principles that have guided the Government's policy in relation to the crisis in the South Atlantic and the development of our attitudes and actions in the light of those principles and the evolution of what has been a constantly changing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those principles are that we are committed to the rule of law in international relations, and that we support action taken in furtherance of Security Council Resolution 502.  That resolution calls for a cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of the Argentine forces from the Falkland <Col N="1425" /> Islands, and the achievement of a peaceful settlement by diplomatic means.  I would emphasise that Ireland's position of support for these three demands has not altered.</P>
    <P>When we agreed to Resolution 502 there was hope that a peaceful settlement was attainable.  Indeed, it was in that hope that we supported the resolution of our partners in the European Community instituting a system of economic sanctions. With the increase in hostilities in recent weeks, that hope faded and we found ourselves moving into a situation which would seriously endanger our traditional policy of neutrality.  We were being seen and obviously could fairly be interpreted as being associated with a serious escalation of military activity.</P>
    <P>At the outset, the Government went along with sanctions with reluctance.  We had reservations about the apparent tendency towards a proliferation of economic sanctions, the effectiveness of which is very doubtful, especially when they cannot be universally applied.  However, a persuasive case was made that in this instance the primary effect would be to give a clear political signal that forceful seizure of territory was intolerable and could not be perpetrated with impunity. On this basis and in a spirit of Community solidarity, we agreed with our partners, on the clear understanding, certainly so far as we were concerned but I believe generally, that the measures were intended to reinforce political and diplomatic efforts to secure a peaceful negotiated settlement.</P>
    <P>By 4 May, in the circumstances I have already recalled, the situation had completely changed.  Hostilities had intensified and it appeared that on both sides negotiations might be put aside.  We were faced with the prospect that sanctions would operate and be seen to operate in a situation of open war.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances and in view of our neutrality, the Government had to review our support for sanctions.  We indicated that in our view their continuation in a situation such as appeared to be then emerging, would no longer be appropriate.  We were conscious that the relevant Community Regulation contained <Col N="1426" /> provision for a review before the expiry date of 17 May of whether the measures should be extended, amended or repealed.  This required a proposal from the Commission.</P>
    <P>While our view was put to his colleagues by the Minister for Foreign Affairs some time ago, no such proposal was tabled.  While there was a consensus that the measures were intended to advance a diplomatic settlement, not a military solution, it was felt that it would not be right to lift the sanctions in advance of the expiry of the Community regulation.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it was agreed that a decision on any extension of the measures after 17 May should be left over until closer to that date.  Clearly, member states wished to be in a position to monitor the situation and to decide their attitude by reference to the continuation and progress of meaningful negotiations, on the one hand, and the possible escalation or de-escalation of hostilities, on the other.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, at the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg yesterday, Ireland and Italy made declarations to the effect that they would no longer apply sanctions and this was accepted.  To avoid any distortion of trade within the Community, Ireland and Italy will not allow their countries to be used so as to permit goods imported from Argentina to enter the territory of our other partners.  The other members agreed that the measures being applied against Argentina for the last month would remain in force in their countries for one further week until 23 May.</P>
    <P>The objective of Ireland and of the other members of the Ten remains a peaceful negotiated settlement between Argentina and Britain in accordance with Resolution 502 of the UN Security Council.  I wish to underline our own strong support for the continuing efforts of the Secretary General, with the support of the other members of the Security Council to bring about a peaceful and honourable settlement.</P>
    <P>I know that the consistent and constructive approach we have adopted in relation to this problem has received very <Col N="1427" /> wide support among our people.  I am also satisfied, on the basis of reports from our diplomatic missions, that our policy, which has been clear and consistent throughout, in a situation of great danger and complexity, has earned us considerable respect in many countries around the world.  I think it is due to this country and its people that this should be more clearly understood and more openly acknowledged than has, I am afraid, always been the case in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I would only add, for the information of Deputies, that the farm price package has been agreed by the Council of Ministers this afternoon.  While the news has just come to hand about the agreement of the farm price package I will be glad to make available later in the day to Deputies some details of the farm price package.  I could give them now but perhaps Deputies would prefer to wait until they have a written document in front of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Taoiseach's statement concerning the position taken up by the Irish Government with respect to EEC sanctions against Argentina.  The basis of the Irish Government's decision, namely, that the maintenance of sanctions after hostilities have taken place would be a violation of Irish neutrality, a matter again referred to by the Taoiseach in his speech, is inconsistent with both the traditional Irish position in such matters and with previous actions by a Government led by the present Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it should be pointed out that on October 9 1935, the Assembly of the League of Nations adopted economic sanctions against Italy precisely because hostilities existed, following the Italian invasion of Abyssinia.  There were only two dissentients to this decision, other than Italy, namely, Austria and Hungary. Ireland, under the leadership of the then head of Government and Minister for External Affairs, Mr. de Valera, supported this decision without qualification. Irish policy was then, and has since remained, as I shall exemplify in a more recent case that economic sanctions are <Col N="1428" /> an appropriate action for our country to take as part of measures designed to deal with acts of aggression and to continue during subsequent hostilities.</P>
    <P>Much more recently, as reported in the 16th Report of the European Community submitted to this House, Ireland joined with the other EEC States in taking steps against Iran, culminating in economic sanctions imposed on 17 and 18 May 1980, following the taking of Americans as hostages by Iran.  These sanctions remained in force until the hostages were released.  That decision by the Government then led by Mr. Haughey was not seen by him, or by anyone else at that time, as inappropriate for a neutral country.</P>
    <P>Following the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union at the end of 1979 &mdash; the Taoiseach was in office then, too &mdash; the EEC Council decided unanimously, with the full support of the Irish Government that the Community countries would not substitute grain sales to the Soviet Union for those embargoed by the United States.  So far as I am aware that decision remains in force, and it arose directly from the very existence of hostilities in Afghanistan following the Soviet aggression there.</P>
    <P>More recently still further economic sanctions against the Soviet Union were introduced by the EEC, with full Irish concurrence, arising from what was regarded as Soviet intervention in the affairs of Poland.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from these examples that the application of economic sanctions has not up to now been seen by the Government under the Taoiseach or by any former Government under the late Mr. de Valera as infringing our neutrality, nor is it so regarded in international law, and that the question of whether hostilities are taking place has no bearing on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is clear therefore that the Government's stated grounds for their decision lack foundation, and one must look elsewhere for the rationale of this decision.</P>
    <P>Such a rationale could be found in a decision by the Government that the lifting of sanctions would be likely to have a beneficial effect, through limiting hostilities <Col N="1429" /> or discouraging acts of warfare.  If this is the Government's belief, and if this were the basis for their decision, then this should have been said from the outset, instead of producing the phony excuse about neutrality, the character of which I have just exposed.  No such statement was made.  Neither has the Taoiseach put forward any such claim today.  The Government's ham fisted handling of this affair has left the impression in many capitals, including London, that the Government were motivated in this matter, not by considerations of neutrality, which every other country knows is irrelevant to this issue in international law, nor by considerations of the course of action most likely to lead to peace, but instead by a desire to achieve temporary popularity at home, at the expense of our international credibility.</P>
    <P>I regret that these actions and in particular the manner in which they have been taken, and the unconvincing character of the excuse put forward, have weakened our ability to influence the present situation towards peace, at a time when the maximum effort needs to be made in this direction in view of evidence of intransigence and some unwillingness to seek a solution by peaceful means.  It would have been much more useful from the point of view of securing peace if our Government had sought the support of others in pressing on both the contending parties, but especially on Britain as a fellow member of the EEC, the vital importance of a negotiated solution based on Resolution 502, which called for a cease fire &mdash; a point that has not been given full attention in many statements of the British position &mdash; and for Argentine withdrawal from the Falklands.</P>
    <P>The basis for such a solution would on the face of it appear to exist in the light of statements made by both parties to the dispute, in particular taking into account an apparent willingness by Argentina to allow the decision on sovereignty to be left for a subsequent negotiation.</P>
    <P>It was important that we should have been able, with our EEC partners, to press on the British Government the importance of pursuing this apparent <Col N="1430" /> Argentine position to a conclusion, requiring that it be clarified one way or the other without delay by the United Nations Secretary-General, before any further military action is taken.  Unfortunately, by the manner in which our Government have acted, and as a result of the obvious invalidity of the grounds they have given for their actions, we have lost the power to work effectively towards a solution of this problem in conjunction with our partners.  We have thrown away our traditional role as peace-maker, damaging, moreover, perhaps irretrievably, so far as this Government are concerned, our relationship with Britain on which the Taoiseach in 1980 and 1981 placed such importance as providing a way forward &mdash; he suggested at that time the only way forward &mdash; to a resolution of the Northern Ireland problem.</P>
    <P>I should add that I recognise that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has done his best to limit the damage done by the Taoiseach's approach to this matter, adopting a low-key approach in Brussels throughout most of yesterday, leaving it to Italy to make most of the running.  His firmness on television in his first interview on this subject several weeks ago also showed up in marked contrast to the Taoiseach's wavering and ambivalent attitude.  But in the present situation there is little or nothing the Minister can now do to repair the damage done to our reputation &mdash; damage done not through the decision itself on sanctions, which could have been justified on rational and defensible grounds, but through the manner in which this affair has been handled without regard to the importance of working effectively for peace, without regard to our interests, or to those of our citizens in Britain, and above all without regard to the interests of achieving a resolution of the Northern Ireland problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Falklands crisis shows every sign of entering a new and more dangerous phase.  It appears that the British Government are shifting the emphasis from diplomatic to military action.  Last Friday night's landing by the British forces on the tip of the West Falklands <Col N="1431" /> lends credence to this interpretation of events.</P>
      <P>There is, too, the return to London of the British Ambassadors to the UN and the US, an event which effectively has frozen peace discussions and suggests that there is an acceptance now by the British Government that efforts on the diplomatic front are close to termination. Therefore, a major landing by British forces on the Falklands appears imminent. It is against this background that last night's meeting of the Community's Foreign Ministers must be viewed.  Britain is not without support for her position so far as EEC Governments are concerned. President Mitterand said yesterday in London that no new element in the present dispute would change France's stance and that given the failure to resolve the crisis by diplomatic means, he accepted that only military options were available now to Britain.  Chancellor Schmidt has not abated his public support of the British position, regardless of what reservations he may have expressed privately at any meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Foreign Minister's meeting, the Irish Government took a moderated stance apparently in comparison with the Italian position.  The Italians vetoed a full renewal of sanctions by the Community. It appears from reports that we did not attempt to induce our fellow members to adopt a common position.  The Taoiseach's statement does not make quite clear the distinction between the position adopted by us and that adopted by the Italians.  The Taoiseach's statement seems to put both positions into a common denominator, a position that I would not consider to be correct on the basis of the report of the Community meeting. The Italian Government apparently took the course of looking for an all-Community sanctions common policy.  It is not clear whether the Irish Government approved the continuation of sanctions in principle while reserving our position on the matter in deference to our declared neutrality.  On the evidence of last night's meeting, the EEC no longer have a common position on the Falklands crisis.  The renewal of sanctions by eight of the ten <Col N="1432" /> members, with Ireland and Italy withdrawing, reduces the political impact of trade sanctions by the Community.  From the outside trade sanctions were primarily a source of political rather than economic pressure.  The decision of Ireland not to be used as a back door for Argentine imports to other member states would appear to indicate that our decision to opt out of sanctions is based on maintaining our neutrality and does not give indirect support to the Argentine position.</P>
    <P>We stated our position in defence of our neutrality but as I made clear in the House last week, a price may well have to be paid for this declaration though not an unnecessary price.  Our neutrality is central to our foreign policy and is independent of any political division on this island or of any resolution of such division. I await a satisfactory clarification by the Taoiseach of the present basis of our neutrality, which has my support, and his formulation of Ireland's position on neutrality in the defence policy debate of 11 March last.  I ask him again to clarify whether he has changed his view from the position adopted by him in that debate and if he is now of the opinion that Ireland's neutrality cannot be compromised irrespective of political developments regarding the future of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The implications for world peace of military action in the Falklands between a leading member of NATO and the largest military power in Latin America are extremely serious.  The United States has already committed in advance to keeping the task force supplied and the interests of the Soviet Union are involved if grain shipments from the Argentine are disrupted by the outbreak of full-scale war. Indeed, those who see this as purely a British-Argentine dispute without the involvement of the super powers are not reading the position accurately because there is already great concern in the Soviet Union, due to the failure of their wheat harvest, about their supplies from the Argentine.  The United States has also taken a position of support for the British.</P>
    <P>Now that the EEC have finished with <Col N="1433" /> the matter of trade sanctions and that we are back to national states' reaction once more, it would appear that the pendulum of diplomatic activity swings back to the United Nations where we hope that the peace initiative of the Secretary General will not fail.  If it does fail we must, through whatever influence we can wield in the UN, strive to work further to avoid a further deepening of this problem which cannot be confined to a purely British-Argentine quarrel but has global implications when one considers that the super powers are already indirectly involved.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Falkland Islands events the Irish Government have stated that the position adopted by us is a consequence of our neutrality policy and yet there is still ambiguity about the constituent elements of the neutrality approach adopted by the Government.  There was the position adopted by the Taoiseach in the March defence debate.  Then the Taoiseach appeared to contemplate our willingness to review the most appropriate defence arrangements for the island as a whole in the event of a satisfactory solution to the situation in Northern Ireland.  Effectively that view of the Taoiseach of our neutrality relegates our neutrality to being a mere by-product of the continued political division of the island. I view our neutrality as a core element of our foreign policy.  I see it as independent of any settlement of the Northern question. Our neutrality derives from our independence and sovereignty as a State. In my view it reflects a realistic assessment of the requirements of our national interest.  Our independence in foreign affairs is sustained by our neutrality.  Our neutrality confers a leverage on the side of peace in the world which our membership of any military alliance would negate.  Our neutrality is not a side consequence of the division of Northern Ireland which comes up for bartering in the event of any political settlement on whatever date our Government consider a settlement had arrived.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Taoiseach for clarification of his view on neutrality and I mentioned that matter today again because throughout this dispute our neutrality <Col N="1434" /> has been referred to as the main element which has determined our policy. I hope the Taoiseach will not delay any further in giving that necessary clarification of his views on neutrality, either in this exchange or at an early date.  The most appropriate thing would be for the House, since the matter is of supreme national importance, at an early date to have an opportunity of reviewing the constituent elements of neutrality as perceived by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that my party did not receive any prior notice that the Taoiseach was to make a statement today and, consequently, we have not had an opportunity of preparing a statement to read to the House.  However, I should like to make a number of points.  We were dismayed initially when the Government decided to row in with other EEC countries in applying sanctions against Argentina because we felt that that was mitigating or watering down to some degree our neutrality.  We felt that it was cutting across the efforts being made by the United Nations to bring some kind of solution to the problems in relation to the Falklands.  In our view the efforts Ireland makes in terms of foreign affairs and on the international scene should be made through the United Nations and not through the process of the EEC.  We welcome the recent move by the Government to step back from applying sanctions against Argentina and we look forward to a strengthening of our neutral position on the international scene.</P>

But I would have been anxious to ask the Taoiseach, for example, whether he is under the mistaken impression that this State has never operated sanctions in conditions where hostilities are going on.  Would it be in order for me, arising from specific sentences included in the Taoiseach's statement, to put down a question to him in the ordinary way?  I hope I will not find it ruled out of order in the grounds that <Col N="1435" /> the material has been adequately covered this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-East)</i>: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 18, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, save where the context otherwise requires&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was introduced early last year and Second Stage was taken in May 1981 but the Bill lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil.  It was subsequently reintroduced on Committee Stage by the Coalition Government but was not taken before the Dáil was dissolved.  The Bill <Col N="1439" /> now before the House is unchanged since the original introduction but I will be proposing a number of new provisions, mainly to strengthen local authority powers for dealing with abandoned vehicles, fly-posting, graffiti, subversive slogans and the like.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of technical and consequential amendments, of which amendment No. 1 is the first.  This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 20 which will facilitate the removal and scrapping of abandoned vehicles by local authorities in certain circumstances.  There is a problem about the removal of abandoned vehicles from a public road or car park under existing road traffic legislation, as a road authority have to store the vehicle for at least six weeks after the removal and must serve or publish a notice stating their intention to dispose of the vehicle.  Local authorities, with some justification, are reluctant to incur costs in removing and storing useless hulks of vehicles.  It is in order to remedy this problem and prevent it arising in relation to vehicles removed under the present Bill that I am introducing amendment No. 20.  This will help a road authority to dispose of vehicles forthwith after removal if the authority are satisfied that the vehicles cannot be restored at reasonable expense.  This will avoid unnecessary expense by the authorities in storing vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of the Bill as set out by the Minister is quite correct and we welcomed it when it was debated 12 months ago.  The Government then changed before Committee Stage had been reached and I, as Minister for the Environment, asked my Government if we could strengthen the Bill by the inclusion of the two amendments mentioned by the Minister, one to deal with graffiti and fly-posting and the other to deal with abandoned vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who has been canvassing in the present by-election campaign will be very much aware of the necessity for these amendments.  The number of abandoned vehicles in that constituency is quite extraordinary.  In one small private <Col N="1440" /> square near Inchicore there are no less than seven abandoned vehicles in various stages of disrepair.  Something must be done about this problem and we welcome the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>I once suggested in the Department, half in jest, that the way to deal with this problem was to offer the itinerants £50 for each abandoned vehicle delivered to a central corporation dump.  The danger is that temporarily abandoned vehicles might be taken away and a person having a drink or shopping might find that his car had disappeared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The vehicles in the dump might be removed at night and redumped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment with which I as Minister was mostly concerned was that dealing with fly-posting and graffiti. Standards in this regard have deteriorated so much in recent years that the place is a visible disgrace to everybody who lives here.  Every tree, every closed-up shop or boarded-up window and every smooth wall has some kind of motto or graffiti painted on it or has a fly-poster stuck on it.  Most of these are harmless enough in that they advertise local dances or state that so-and-so's rule is OK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many respects political parties are as guilty as anybody else.  The provision in the Bill that political parties must remove their posters within seven days of the date of poll is a recognition of the fact that even though we are guilty we intend to do something about it.  It appears to be the case that the victors in any election remove their posters more quickly than the vanquished and I hope the Bill will remind political parties of their obligations in this regard.  It is normal practice for political parties to boost the names of their candidates prior to an election but we have an obligation after the election to remove those posters.  However the populace may regard posters at election time, they are offensive environmentally months and years afterwards.  However worthy the objective of getting our candidates elected we should not offend the <Col N="1441" /> people whose votes we solicit by leaving property visually defaced.</P>
    <P>The problem of graffiti has reached enormous proportions.  We must make up our minds whether or not we want a tourist industry in which our nearest neighbours in the United Kingdom will be major customers.  All during last year we had graffiti of a most offensive kind to both politicians and ordinary citizens of the UK at all points of entry to this country.  The very mildest of these was &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; which proliferated throughout the country all last year and for a very long time before that.  If, as I believe, 99 per cent of the people of this country do not agree with the aims of those who are daubing our walls with these signs, it is up to that 99 per cent to tell the 1 per cent that they will not tolerate it any longer. The Litter Bill strengthened to deal with graffiti gives legal authority to the owners of the walls or premises in question and the local authorities, whose end responsibility it is, to see that these graffiti are removed, and a necessary part of our function in this House is to give that muscle to the local authorities.  Side by side with that, we, individually, as political parties and as a country, must get off the fence in this regard.  We cannot have the contradictory situation where, as he was last week, the Minister for Industry and Energy is over there trying to persuade British industrialists to invest in this country and Bord Fáilte over there are trying to persuade tourists from the UK to come here and spend their holidays in this country &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have a number of things to say on the question of abandoned cars. I extend my congratulations to the Minister <Col N="1443" /> of State here in the House on his appointment.  I know of his concern about the litter problem.  I have in mind an area with which he is particularly familiar as it is in his own constituency, the area of Poddle Park where a person operates selling off parts of vehicles and the vehicles are on the pavement.  There is a veritable mountain of them and this has been an unauthorised development for years.  The corporation have been trying to get this man away.  He has about 500 vehicles there and many of them are on the side of the road and on the footpath. I want to know if this Bill will empower the authorities to take action against this man?  Will the this person be subjected to fines of £500?  Also, if he is fined once, can he be fined again as often as he is brought to court if he does not comply?  This whole question of abandoned cars is very serious.  Too many of these operators are practising in Dublin at the moment and they are using private housing estates to operate these &mdash; I cannot call them car sales &mdash; wreck sales.  The people who buy them are worse, but they come along looking for spare parts for their cars and they do not care what they do to the area concerned.  The area around Poddle Park is completely polluted. Bangor Drive in my constituency is another place where this sort of thing is going on.  Wrecks are towed in and are left on the roadway.  This fellow does not even have them in the field &mdash; they are left on the roadway while being dismantled and when he has finished with them the corporation at considerable cost have them taken away by Hammond Lane Metal Company Limited.  I am glad to say that the corporation have recently come to an agreement for a piece of land to put them on in Deputy Quinn's constituency in Ringsend where they will be out of sight.  What is the position regarding this?  Can we with this Bill finally nail some of these people who have been escaping the law on pure technicalities?</P>

      <P>I would like to speak about abandoned cars.  I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister of State on his appointment.  One difficulty I see <Col N="1444" /> in the removal of abandoned cars is the delay occasioned.  I have seen abandoned cars lying for months before being taken away.  I do not know whether this Bill gives authority to take them away, and I would like to be satisfied that it does.  The problem is in establishing that a car is in fact abandoned.  Where the registration number appears on a car it is necessary to try to trace ownership and this could cause undue delay in removing the car. It would be advantageous if the section of this Bill referring to abandoned cars could be extended to include abandoned cars on public roads.  I hope that the Minister of State when replying will deal with this.  As Deputy Briscoe has said, some places are littered with abandoned cars, some of them there for months, but no provision seems to be made in any legislation for the more speedy taking away of those cars.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> Deputy Briscoe's point about accumalated vehicles is covered in section 10 of the Bill.  As far as Deputy Brennan's point is concerned, certainly the Bill will give local authorities all the powers they need to tackle this problem.  Quite an amount can be said about the definition of the word &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo;.  If the Deputies would like me to elaborate further I will do so, but I think it is clear what an abandoned vehicle is.  It is one that has been left to be taken care of or taken into account by someone else.  The word was not defined in the Road Traffic Acts.  It would be impossible to be absolutely definite about when a vehicle could be termed abandoned.  In practice it is usually clear but in view of the fact that the maximum fine for abandoning a vehicle is £500 this could prove contentious in the absence of a definition as given.  The definition allows for taking into account the place in which the vehicle is left, the condition of the vehicle &mdash; for example, wheels removed, windows smashed, engine dismantled altogether &mdash; and the length of time the vehicle has been left in place as indications of whether it might be abandoned.  I am convinced that the provisions of the Bill will give the local <Col N="1445" /> authorities the power to tackle the problem with full vigour.</P>

      <P>I support what Deputy Briscoe said in relation to skips in terms of the definition of a vehicle or part of a vehicle.  I do not know if this could be done on Report Stage.  There appears to be general agreement here with regard to this matter.  Skips are metal bins that form an integral part of specially designed vehicles and it is a question for the parliamentary draftsman to consider if they can be defined as portion of a vehicle.  This is an increasing problem in the Dublin area and members of the committee in Dublin Corporation have experience of it.  The problem will not go away: if anything, it will get worse.  This is probably the last time we will be dealing with this problem for the next ten years at least and we should get it right this time.  If it can be incorporated within the definitions section of this Bill to such an extent that a prosecuting lawyer on behalf of the local authority can construe reasonably that an abandoned skip falls within the definition of an abandoned vehicle or portion of an abandoned vehicle, then I think the rest of the measure would hold.  Will the Minister consider this matter for Report Stage?</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 1 to 3, to delete subsection (1) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  A person shall not&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  deposit anywhere, whether in a receptacle or not, any substance, material or thing for collection by or on behalf of a local authority, or</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to make a more positive statement about the problem of litter arising from refuse being left out for collection by local authorities.  The use of inadequate refuse containers, no lids on bins, open boxes and untied sacks, by both commercial and domestic users has been a continuous source of litter.  The provision in subsection (1) will make it an offence to leave out refuse in this way.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> Yes, section 3 (5) covers that situation.  It is essential that people become involved <Col N="1448" /> rapidly in dealing with the problem of litter and I appeal to the public for their co-operation.  Legislation is one thing but it is essential that we get the co-operation of the public.  I have been a member of a local authority for the past eight years and I know that the problem needs to be tackled.  In reply to the query of the Deputy, both the driver of the vehicle and the perpetrator of the offence will be liable but it will take public co-operation to identify the perpetrators.  The on-the-spot-fine will be £5.  If the vehicle is driven away the litter warden can get the number and under this legislation will have power to bring the transgressor to justice.</P>

We would need a warden for every person if we were to try to get at them through the law.  Much more attention will have to be paid to what can be done in schools and in the education of the parents.  If parents do not educate their children to be litter conscious, we will only be chasing the problem when those children become adults.  We need the goodwill and co-operation of parents if this Bill is to be effective.  It is only a minority who cause the problem and I hope this Bill will be able to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to a point in this Bill which, if I am reading it correctly, creates an unacceptable division in our legislation &mdash; and this is not the only instance where it occurs.  My reading of section 3 (5) is that a haulier could find he was liable for an offence because the driver of one of his trucks committed an offence.  The section reads that the owner of the vehicle &ldquo;shall be guilty of an offence in addition to any person guilty of the first-mentioned offence.&rdquo;&mdash; for example, that referred to by Deputy Briscoe &mdash; but if the person who commits the offence is the driver of a local authority van, a Posts and Telegraphs van or a CIE truck the statutory authority would not be treated the same way.  I do not see the reason for <Col N="1449" /> this distinction in law.  It takes the pressure off management and the owners of the company, whether private or public, to ensure the same kind of discipline.  In the eyes of the public this sets up a further division between &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; and puts the public sector in an unique position. This is unnecessary because it appears that one administrative system is protecting another.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask two questions.  First, am I correct in my reading of this section? Second, if I am, why is that provision there, because it does not seem to be necessary?  If it is not necessary, can we not take it out on Report Stage?</P>

    <P>It is reasonable for management, particularly in the public sector, to be able to point to the fact that not only will the driver of the vehicle in question be liable to a fine but that the company, too, will be directly liable.

This can be done by education and legislation, but both methods, particularly education, can be slow and tedious.  Education is the long-term solution.  To eradicate this litter problem we must use all the media at our disposal &mdash; newspapers, radio, television and so on.  Until littering is recognised as a social crime, the problem will be with us.</P>

      <P>I am not.  I have not had a reply to my question but that may be because of my inability to clearly identify what I see as a contradiction.  For example, the general manager of a private bus company in whose name the vehicle is registered would in addition to the bus driver be liable for an offence of, for example, tipping the ash tray out.  The general manager would be equally responsible and liable in law if that were a private bus company but the general manager of CIE would not be so liable. That is an unnecessary distinction, an exclusion of the public sector, to begin with, because it is not equality in the eyes of the law.  Secondly, given our experience of public service management practices the removal of such an additional sanction would weaken the position of management in relation to being able to enforce the good practices we all wish to see achieved.  I do not see the logic of having this exclusion in the legislation unless the Government want to avoid the embarrassment of having the general manager of CIE also in court along with the bus driver. jointly charged for littering.</P>

I want Deputies to be absolutely sure that every aspect of the legislation covers even what could be interpreted as a minor littering offence.  I appreciate the contributions made by Deputies Quinn and Barry in this respect and by Deputies Briscoe and Brennan.  The liability of vehicle ownership is really what we will elaborate on.  Littering and roadside dumping is often caused by persons from vehicles and identification can be difficult. The person may be an employee acting on instructions.  Under subsection (5) the owner of the vehicle will be held liable apart from the liability of anyone else.  If the vehicle is the subject of a hire-drive agreement as defined in section 1, the hirer will be liable.  If the vehicle is being used by someone else that person will be liable but the owner or hirer may be excused if in effect he can show that the vehicle was being used on the occasion in question by another person and that such use was not authorised, or in addition, in the case of the owner, that the vehicle was the subject of a hire-drive agreement &mdash; that is in subsections (6) and (7).

The Minister could bring in an amendment on Report Stage saying that no matter who owns the vehicle, whether it is public or private, the liability for littering ultimately rests with the owner of the vehicle.</P>

Now local authorities will be empowered to fine on the spot.  It must clearly be understood that the emphasis will be on the local authorities for an on-the-spot fining system for litter offences.  As the Bill proceeds through Committee Stage, we will have more time to elaborate further on that.  The local authorities will engage litter wardens who will be empowered to issue fines on the spot.  If the perpetrator of an offence is not prepared to co-operate and pay the fine, he or she runs the risk of being brought before the courts and given a maximum fine of £500 for refusing to pay the on-the-spot fine.</P>

      <P>On the appointment of litter wardens, giving them teeth to do their job is an esential part of this Bill. Equally important, given the nature of the Irish character, is the quality and attitude of the wardens appointed.  I imagine the money collected would be very little.  The best possible solution would be that the litter wardens would do themselves out of a job, because they would be so effective that there would eventually be no fines to be collected because no litter would be dropped.  That would be a mark of their success.  Women might here be more appropriate than men because rather than fining children, they could point out to them the damage being done to their own quality of life by littering streets by dropping sweet papers and other litter.  Even though it will be a long haul, the educational aspect of wardens must be seen as important and complementary to the role of the teachers and parents.  The Bill gives greater powers to local authorities, bringing the legislation more in line with modern conditions, but a careful selection of the wardens would, in the long term be more beneficial, given the character of the Irish people, than slapping a fine on somebody who dumps a cigarette packet on the street.  In Austria a few years ago, I saw an old lady coming out of a restuarant prodding a small boy for throwing a sweet paper on the road and she told him to pick it up. She was her country's litter warden, although she was just a citizen of the city. She was very concerned that her city should be a place in which she would like to live and was going to see that it was not litter-strewn.  She was going to see that other people did not make it unacceptable to her.</P>

      <P>At the moment there are litter wardens in Dublin, but probably the reason why they have not been observed is that the uniform is very similar to that of the Garda.  Very often, when people are approached by these wardens they do not realise that it is a litter warden and not a garda who is addressing them.  They are probably shown a great deal more respect because <Col N="1459" /> they are thought of as gardaí.</P>

I am not making any defence of the kind of mess we see about us and the litter wardens should be given more powers and recognition. It is important that there have been no complaints about these litter wardens.  It may be a good idea to appoint some women litter wardens as well, but what will make the warden's job more effective will be the on-the-spot fines. That is much easier than bringing people to court.</P>

Unfortunately, we have an ingrained attitude to acceptance of litter, while the lady mentioned by Deputy Barry would not accept that, even in the winter of her years.  To amplify the Deputy's comments, what is important is <Col N="1460" /> that it will be an educational process.  It is my intention that the litter wardens will be properly trained and have the correct approach, not so much in apprehending and pouncing on people but that it will be an educational process, as well as the last resort of fining.  I will be appealing, if cases go to court, for the justices to mete the heavy penalties, certainly in the early stages of this legislation to give it the necessary teeth and impact to which Deputy Quinn referred earlier.  Examples are made early on, to ensure that the legislation is thought about.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), line 47, after &ldquo;section 3&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or 7* (other than an offence under the said section 7* to which subsection (2) of that section relates)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is consequential on the introduction of amendments Nos. 8 and 9 and enables a litter warden to <Col N="1461" /> request the name and address of a person whom he catches in the act of fly-posting or writing graffiti.  This is a major part of the legislation and it covers the area that Deputy Brennan referred to a few moments ago.  The existing provisions in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, have not proved adequate to deal with the problems of fly-posting, graffiti, slogan writing and so on.  These provisions are directed only against the person who puts up posters or writes graffiti slogans.  This can be done at night of course and offenders are difficult to apprehend or identify.  In addition, no penalty is incurred by those responsible for the advertisements or those who benefit from them.  The local authorities should also be able to take action directly to remove the offending material or to have it removed.  The new sections 7 and 8, which I am proposing for inclusion in the Bill, meet these needs.</P>
    <P>Section 7 relates to fly-posting, graffiti and slogans on buildings and other structures in or fronting any public places to which the owner, occupier or person in charge has not consented.  The section provides for the creation and the prosecution of the offence and the taking of remedial action by the local authority if the occupier is agreeable.  The principal effect is that the offence is extended so that the person on whose behalf an advertisement is exhibited or, in the case of an advertisement for a meeting or other event, the person promoting or arranging the meeting or event will be liable for prosecution as well as the person who actually does the damage.  The range of offences is being extended to cover the exhibition of articles such as banners or flags put up without permission.  There is an exemption for advertisements for public meetings and public elections, provided the advertisements are subsequently removed.  Likewise, advertisements that are exempted development will not be liable to prosecution under this provision.  Section 7 does not deal with advertisements or slogans put up by an occupier or with his consent and it does not enable a local authority to <Col N="1462" /> take action if the occupier is not agreeable. The proposed section 8 provides for this.</P>
    <P>If a local authority considers it is in the interests of the amenity or of the environment, they can secure the removal of an article, advertisements or slogans, whether or not it was put up with the consent of the owner, occupier or persons in charge.  The local authority may themselves remove the article, advertisement or graffiti with the agreement of the occupier or serve a notice on the occupier requiring him to take remedial action.  If he does not do so, the local authority may remedy the situation and recover any expenditure reasonably incurred.  The occupier has a right of appeal to the courts where a notice is served and other defences are included also.  The effective use of the provisions in these two additional sections by the local authority will go a long way to eliminating the unsightly fly-posting earlier referred to which is now so widespread and will facilitate the removal of graffiti and slogans in the future.  Amendments Nos. 13, 21, 22 and 23 are consequential on the introduction of the new sections 7 and 8.</P>

      <P>This is the most significant of the amendments which the Minister is introducing and I am very glad it has come before the House.  I am sure it will be passed with the agreement of the House.  I apologise for being unwittingly disorderly earlier on.  I understood the Minister was making an opening statement to which I was supposed to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the proliferation of these slogans, although the visual effect on the environment of tattered posters hanging from hoardings all over the city are very offensive visually.  The local authorities should have some means &mdash; as they will have if this Bill becomes law &mdash; to ensure that these sites are cleared up, hoardings painted and kept clean.  I hope this section will be effective.  It puts the onus on the local authorities to ensure that cities and towns are kept in a condition that is not offensive &mdash; primarily to those who reside there, because it is important for people who live in a town or city to be proud of them &mdash; but also <Col N="1463" /> for the sake of visitors who we are so keen to encourage to visit here.  Many of them come from countries which have stringent laws on litter, graffiti and so on. When I was in Switzerland last year &mdash; you will think I am a much-travelled man &mdash; I was shocked to see that even the clean Swiss are having an outbreak of graffiti.  That is very disturbing because, if their standards are slipping, there is less chance for the rest of us in this regard.  I have been saying for ten or 12 years that what I find extraordinary is this.  We vote money in this House and we give a very large subvention to Bord Fáilte, probably in the region of £13 or £14 million a year.  We continually boast about our nearest neighbours who are our best friends.  We send teams of hoteliers, airline officials, travel agents and members of Bord Fáilte to travel to England to encourage the British to come over here, and then we allow a most unrepresentative minority to daub slogans at points of entry such as &ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo; and offensive remarks about their Royal Family and political leaders.  They are a most tolerant people to come, but the success of this daubing was very evident on the tourist figures last year.  A number of cross-channel television companies showed shots of entry points to the country with offensive slogans which was the first thing that met the visitors. For the last 12 months the fly-over on the Stillorgan Road outside the Montrose Hotel has had `H-block' painted on it.  I encouraged the officers in the Department of the Environment to get on to the county and city managers to ensure that this sign was blotted out, but it is still there.  There are also offensive personal references to the Taoiseach, of whom I am no great lover, on a wall in Cork for the last 18 months and to his predecessor. It is time we decided what we want.  We can no longer be ambivalent.  We must have an open, democratic country and have sufficient self-confidence not to need hysterical slogans.  It should be a matter of education to see the rapport between the Germans and the British &mdash; and their differences were much deeper and more bitter than ours were with <Col N="1464" /> England.  We should have enough self-confidence to say that we are equal and independent, that we want the British to come here on holidays, spend their money and that we welcome them.</P>
    <P>Ninety-nine per cent of ordinary Irish people would say that of all the tourists who come here the friendliest and the most welcome are the British.  We must remember that the British themselves had their problems in this regard after the war, with &ldquo;Yanks Go Home&rdquo; plastered all over their walls.  We are not the worst in the world in this regard.  I hesitate to name one country I have visited. The Americans, with their architecturally beautiful cities, have the approaches to them defaced by mile after mile of advertising hoardings.  We moved reasonably effectively against that in the 1963 Act. I hope the effect of this amendment will be to awaken an awareness among our people not simply for commercial tourism reasons or for the sake of getting industries in here but to give ourselves the confidence and the self-respect that an independent people should have.  We must make it clear that because we disagree with people we do not hate them. If this Bill encourages that awareness it will have been worthwhile for that reason alone.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I will consider extending the period to 14 days, <Col N="1465" /> although personally I should like to see it at two days.  The maximum fine will be £500.  If I find it necessary to promote awareness in people of this measure, the Department through the local authorities will have signs erected along roadways, and if necessary notices in the media, drawing attention to the provisions of this Bill.  In America they have signs indicating that fines of $500 will be imposed for breaches of the regulations.  If necessary I will inform the people of these provisions continuously to ensure in every way I can that the legislation will have continuing effect.  Knowing the goodwill of local authorities, I am sure they will be delighted to have this legislation behind them.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say why it has to be fixed at £500?  This has been the bane of the lives of many people. Legislation was enacted in 1894 in which £5 was levied.  That type of legislation is still in existence.  Is not this an opportunity to get away from that?  We should not have to introduce a new Bill because the fines are inadequate.  If we have runaway inflation, in ten years' time this will be useless and it will still pay a man to empty a truck of rubbish in O'Connell Street, as one person did recently and was fined only £10.  We should have a hard look at this now.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I take the point.  Given the co-operation we have had on the Committee Stage of this Bill this afternoon, I have no doubt that, if needs be, we can introduce enabling legislation to increase the maximum fine.

      <P>If the Minister takes that point, will he not take the amendment suggested from his own side of the House, if he will not take mine, and increase the fine to £1,000?  If there is a valid reason, such as a limit on the fine which a court can impose, I accept that as a legitimate constraint.  The figure of £500 is an arbitrary figure.  I share Deputy Briscoe's faith in the ability of successive Ministers for Finance, whether they be Fianna Fáil or otherwise, to control the rate of inflation over the next 15 years. We will not have this type of Bill in the House in the foreseeable future.  Why not provide for £1,000 if we can do so?  It is a maximum fine and the courts will not always impose it.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister of State whether under the Bill he is promoting any special status attaches to potential litter which, unless something is done about it will become litter, namely, and in particular, election posters tied to lamp posts?  Unless they are promptly removed after the election, and even if they are left up for the duration of the election, they will fall on to the ground and prolong the squalor which is inseparable, apparently, from our form of democracy.  Is there any provision in the Bill to penalise parties who permit their election posters to remain up after the day of the election, or to penalise them if their posters are fixed in such a way that they do not stay up but fall on the ground?</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I suppose election litter can offend people in different ways according to their persuasions. I totally agree with what Deputy Kelly is saying.  I was determined in this Bill to make sure that political parties were covered.  They will be obliged to remove posters, flags, or whatever, within seven days of the election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Minister realises that very often, without any default on the part of a party, a heavy rainstorm may have the effect of littering the ground.  Undoubtedly the heavy storm this afternoon has not added to the amenities of Dublin West in the context I am describing.  Would he consider in some future legislation, if he is there long enough to be in charge of it, introducing some rule whereby special stands or hoardings could be made available to political parties on which they could stick their literature side by side, like so many stamps in a child's stamp album?  This would have no less effect on the voter, and it is done in many continental countries which are just as entitled to be called democracies as we are.</P>

They are now given these powers to remove abandoned vehicles.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1977, are the basic statutes governing the operations of different classes of companies in Ireland.  As such they have a particular importance in that they provide the framework within which a very substantial part of the economic activity of the country is conducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Companies Act, 1963 has, on the whole, stood the test of time and has served us well.  The period since its introduction, however, has seen considerable expansion in our economy and it has been marked by a rapid increase in industrialisation and, of course, our entry into the European Economic Community. Apart from the 1977 Act, which dealt with the method of transferring securities on the Stock Exchange, the only amendment of any substance in the meantime was made by regulation in 1973 to give effect to the First EEC Directive on Company Law.  This dealt with the publication <Col N="1486" /> of documents and information on companies generally.  It is inevitable that substantive revision of the Act should now be necessary to keep pace with the changes stemming from various developments in the interim.  The present Bill is a first instalment of an extensive legislative programme which will update our code of company law to suit the circumstances obtaining in the latter part of the 20th century and which will enable us to fulfil our obligations as a member of the EEC.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with only a small number of matters each, perhaps, important in itself, but it is not a major reform of company law nor is it intended as such. Its basic purpose is to cater for a limited number of particular situations where the need for revision of the relevant provisions is obvious at present and where, as some would perhaps say, revision is long overdue.  This is not, of course, to say that other provisions of the Act do not require urgent attention; our EEC obligations alone will give rise to a number of extensive measures in the future.</P>
    <P>I would hope, therefore, that Deputies in their consideration of the Bill, will bear these circumstances in mind and that they will not be unduly disappointed at the fact that this first Companies (Amendment) Bill is not a more substantial and comprehensive measure.</P>
    <P>While I will only touch on them in general terms here it may be useful to summarise the provisions in the present Bill.  They comprise the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a number of minor adjustments to facilitate the more efficient operation of the companies registration office,</P>
    <P>&mdash;an amendment to the provisions in relation to persons who may act as company auditors and public auditors,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the amendment of a particular provision rendered unconstitutional by a Supreme Court decisions,</P>
    <P>&mdash;improving, in the interest of employees, the provision about preferential payments in the winding-up of companies,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the removal of the restriction on the <Col N="1487" /> number of partners in the professions of accountant and solicitor to enable them to broaden the scope of their services,</P>
    <P>&mdash;increasing fines to take account of inflation and revising the provisions in relation to certain legal proceedings in the interests of more effective implementation of the Companies Acts,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the repeal of sections 29 and 30 of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961, to enable service, as opposed to industrial, companies to use the word &ldquo;standard&rdquo; in their names.</P>
    <P>Employees will no doubt welcome the changes I propose in section 285 of the 1963 Act which deals with preferential payments in a winding-up.  I accept the representations that the list of priority debts in that section is somewhat deficient and accordingly I am extending that list to include pension fund payments owing by a company whether in respect of their own contribution or of contributions deducted from their employees.  I am also improving the preferential provisions in so far as they relate to sick pay accruing to employees.  In addition, in line with the change in money values since the coming into operation of the present Act, I am increasing from £300 to £1,500 the sum to which priority is given by the same section for employees' salaries or wages in respect of services rendered during the four months prior to winding-up.  This too is an issue on which there have been representations down the years.</P>
    <P>The provisions dealing with the Companies Registration Office will speed up some of the processes used in that office in the carrying out of the registrar's functions and will strengthen his powers in enforcing the law.  It is also necessary to tighten up some of the procedures to ensure that maximum information under the relevant heads is available to the public at the earliest possible date.  I would refer, for instance, to the new procedures governing the striking off of companies no longer trading and companies which <Col N="1488" /> fail to furnish annual returns for three consecutive years.  This provision should help to update considerably the records of the Companies Registration Office and it should be welcomed by practitioners and the business community in general. The same, I hope, will apply in regard to the availability, prior to incorporation of information as to the directors, secretary and registered office of a company.  The volume of work involved for the Companies Registration Office in securing lodgment of returns by defaulting companies will be reduced to some extent by virtue of these new procedures.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains features which should be welcomed, in particular, by the accountancy and legal professions.  I am removing the limitation imposed by section 376 of the 1963 Act which prevents the formation of partnerships consisting of more than 20 persons.  I accept the argument that firms of accountants and solicitors may wish to expand so as to identify and concentrate on appropriate areas of specialisation with a view to improving and extending the range of services to their clients.  I recognise, too, that these firms may wish to provide organisational structures which will encourage and provide advancement opportunities for their more outstanding practitioners.  As the same arguments may also be valid for other professions I propose to introduce, on Committee Stage, an amendment enabling the Minister to allow other professions relief from the limitation of section 376.</P>
    <P>Accountants will be especially interested in changes proposed in section 6 which substitutes a new section for section 162 of the Companies Act, 1963.  The new provision has two main objectives. The first is to end, six months after the commencement of the Bill, the arrangement under the existing provision where the Minister may authorise a person for appointment as auditor of a company on the basis of having obtained adequate knowledge and experience in employment by a member of a recognised body or as having practised in the State as an accountant, in either case prior to the operative date of the 1963 Act.  It will be generally accepted that persons satisfying <Col N="1489" /> those provisions have had long enough to establish that fact and in any event it is unrealistic to attempt to operate them with any degree of certainty in 1982.  I would draw attention to the fact that the provision whereby authorisations may be granted on the basis of similar qualifications otherwise than from a recognised body still stands.  This is an arrangement which enables us to grant recognition, in appropriate circumstances, to accountants from abroad and by so doing to enable, in some cases, Irish people who qualify abroad to return home.</P>
    <P>The second objective of the provision is section 6 of the Bill is to give statutory force to what has been the practice, since 1967 of making appointments of public auditors by reference to the same criteria as those for auditors of companies.  The phasing out of the criteria which I have just mentioned will also apply to appointments of public auditors.  In addition, there is the ending of the present administrative arrangement under which public auditors must apply on a continuing basis for reappointment.  Authorisation of all public auditors will, in future, be on a permanent basis and members of recognised bodies will be automatically entitled to act as public auditors just as they are now entitled to act as company auditors. I should explain that public auditors are those who audit the accounts of industrial and provident societies and of friendly societies and they have, up to now, been appointed on an individual basis under the provisions of very old legislation relating to such societies.</P>
    <P>A general measure which strikes at all aspects of the Companies Act, 1963 and which, it has to be admitted, is overdue, is the provision in section 15 of the Bill to increase all fines.  There are the penalties for failure to comply with all the requirements of the 1963 Act including matters such as the filing of documents, returns and statements, holding meetings and providing other information to the Registrar of Companies.</P>
    <P>The increases reflect the fall in the value of money in the time which has elapsed since the fines were fixed and the desirability of enhancing the deterrent <Col N="1490" /> effect of these penalties.  This is another measure which, it is envisaged, would effect some saving in the resources of the Companies Registration Office which are taken up in the pursuit of companies failing in their obligations.</P>
    <P>Because of a Supreme Court decision of some years standing it is necessary, for constitutional reasons, to amend section 168(3) of the Companies Act relating to obligations on officers or agents of a company to make statements and produce books or documents to any inspector investigating the affairs of that company. As I am including this provision on the advice of the Attorney General I trust that it will be generally acceptable.</P>
    <P>In concluding I would emphasise again that I recognise that this Bill is a relatively small measure &mdash; a first step &mdash; in a series of amendments of company law.  These will reflect the need for change arising from developments in commercial activity generally and, more immediately from the necessity to translate into Irish law the provisions of EEC Directives already adopted.  A draft scheme of the next amending Bill which will give effect to the Second Directive, about the formation of public limited companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, was approved by the Government last September.  The Bill has now been drafted and is having final scrutiny in my Department.  I expect to introduce it later on in this session.  Work is proceeding on the measures necessary to give effect to the Third and Fourth Directives and proposals on these will be made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>This is the general background against which I present this Bill.  I consider that the amendments it proposes are worth while and accordingly, I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acting <i>ad hoc</i> as spokesman on this measure and on the following measure.  My party have no objection to this Bill which is entirely uncontroversial.  The only thing that could be said about it, as a former Chief Justice used put it in an ancestral adage, is é an locht an fhad.  The only fault one has to find with it is that there is not more <Col N="1491" /> of it.  As the Minister fairly admitted&mdash; he is being advised by the same people who advised me and, I presume, advised him on the last occasion he was in charge of that Department &mdash; the resources of the Department he presides over are fully stretched at the level of experience which is leaned on mostly and is necessary in the work of drafting and piloting legislation of this technical type through the Dáil.  The Minister referred to the fact that this is only the first in the series of enactments which will cumulatively update the code of company legislation we have.  It is fair to him and to the Department to emphasise that from this side of the House.  To try to minimise the anxieties which have been expressed to all political interests here by the professions or other interests keen to have this updating done as soon as possible, I am aware that is being done quickly.  From, my own experience I know that the people who are advising the Minister are not dragging their heels in the matter.  I join with him, although he has not said so in many words, in asking those outside interests and professions to have patience.  No matter who is in charge of the Dáil, or which party is in Government, I expect that the remaining stages of this reforming code will be along reasonably quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with a number of points in the Minister's speech.  The Minister foreshadowed the necessary amendment of other provisions of the Act or company law code as a whole.  He foreshadowed that our EEC obligations alone will give rise to a number of extensive measures in the future.  I am not sure whether in using that phrase he has in mind Directives which are already in existence or Directives which may hereafter come into existence.  If it is the latter I should like to state that the proposed Directive, if it is adopted, will oblige us to legislate in such a way as to force multinational companies setting up here to disclose the entire dimension of their operations outside the State, as well as inside, to their employees.  Although I can see the industrial relations reasons for that &mdash; I do not despise them &mdash; it is <Col N="1492" /> something that will be very deleterious to our industrial investment programme. While I have not heard this matter being thrashed out by my party I would not be surprised if the view we will take of it will be that whatever industrial relations reasons there may be &mdash; I accept their validity and I do not make little of them &mdash; they must be outweighed by the importance of ensuring that our company legislation, or similar legislation, does not have a disincentive effect on people on whom we heavily depend, rightly or wrongly, for better or worse, for the provision of jobs here in the future just as we have depended on them in the last 30 years.  What kind of country would this have been had there not been an IDA and successive Governments of whatever political colour to support it?</P>
    <P>It is all very well to draw a conventional caricature or cartoon figure of a wicked multinational who is only interested in making money and is indifferent to the fate of his workers and to imply that we should be well able to supply jobs for our own people without bothering about investment of this kind.  Unfortunately, experience in the twenties, thirties and forties showed that native expertise, contacts, marketing and know-how was not adequate to provide new employment at anything like the rate at which agricultural employment was declining.  Therefore, anything which operates as a disincentive, whether resulting from our EEC obligations or not, will have to be scrutinised here with the utmost care.</P>
    <P>I often hear people from the left, and the far left in particular, speaking about the private sector having fallen down in its obligations, about businessmen having neglected their social duty and being only out to make money for themselves and not contributing anything to the social benefit of the State.  I should like to put forward the point of view that businessmen are not there as businessmen to discharge social obligations.  As human beings of course they have human and social obligations and as citizens they have civic and social obligations but as businessmen they must not be expected to feel a larger sense of social responsibility than anybody else in the context of <Col N="1493" /> their own employment.  We should try to attract businessmen here and keep them happy while maintaining an acceptable level of wages, working conditions and industrial relations.  I am not at all in favour of &mdash; I never would advocate &mdash; allowing the workforce to be exploited or treated any worse than workforces are anywhere else, quite the opposite.  If we can attract them here and if the by-product of their coming here &mdash; it is not their main object and I admit that their main object is to make money &mdash; is to enhance employment and generate new jobs which in turn will have a ripple effect, then we should welcome them.  Bees have a strong social sense but they do not set about their operations in the summer in order to provide the people who own them with honey.  They are coaxed along with sugar, heat and well-built watertight hives by their owners to the end that they will go about their business going from clover to clover, the by-product of which will be that the owner will scoop large numbers of cones of honey out of their hives at the end of the season.  It does not do the bees any harm.  No doubt they feel perfectly fulfilled and they are answering the demands of their own nature.  On top of that they are leaving something over for others.</P>
    <P>I hope that is not regarded as an unflattering comparison for the business community. If I were a businessman I would be flattered to be looked at in that light. The business people must not be expected by the Labour Party, socialists or any other type of ideologue to experience a deeper or more urgent sense of social obligation than anybody else experiences in the context of his own profession.  They cannot be expected to be missionaries in the cause of other people's employment.  That is not what they are there for.  They are there to make money.  I do not think that is particularly lovable but equally it is not a sin or a crime.  Our laws permit it and people who are not in business make money also. The useful by-product is employment, investment and all the things which we are desperately short of.</P>
    <P>If I have anything to do with it, my party will not go along with legislation, <Col N="1494" /> however understandable its inspiration, which will have the effect of rapidly deterring further industrial investment, of being yet another weight thrown into the scales against us along with our inflation, bad infrastructure or poor industrial relations, when foreign industrialists are making up their minds whether to locate here or somewhere else which is kinder to them.</P>
    <P>All that is not to be interpreted as a declaration of love of businessmen or of multinationals.  I have no business interests. I have no connection with and I am not employed by, seconded by, lobbied by or suborned by multinationals or even national firms, except to the extent that every Deputy tends to get representations from people about matters which interest them.  The business community take a lot of ideological stick from people who are expecting something of them which they expect from nobody else and they blame the private sector generally for a failure to achieve targets which it is not the business of the private sector to set.  Those targets are set by governments and politicians and they are targets which others may be induced as a by-product of their own purpose in life to accomplish. I would not put it any higher than that and we do not have to apologise for taking a modest view of the role played by the private sector in our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the dimension of this Bill which would have the effect of relieving accountants and solicitors of the present limitations in regard to the number of partners and I am glad he will be introducing an amendment.  I would have no difficulty about taking it today but I do not know how other Deputies feel about it or whether the Minister has his amendment ready.  I welcome his intention to extend the benefit of this section to other professions as well. There was no sinister intention to exclude them.  It was simply the case that the solicitors' profession was first envisaged and then the accountants came galloping up and more or less got in just under the tape before the &ldquo;off&rdquo; in the draftsman's office.  Had the others been a little earlier they might have been envisaged in the terms which the Minister now envisages <Col N="1495" /> at an earlier stage and not merely by way of an amendment.</P>
    <P>There is a section in the Bill which will remove the power to qualify people on the basis of experience alone for appointment as auditors of companies.  Section 6 is a long section but I notice that the provisions regarding qualifications for appointment as auditor do not apply to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I must admit I did not notice this when reading it under a different hat and I probably would have inquired as to the purpose had I noticed it then.  I should like to know why the Comptroller and Auditor General is excluded.  Is it envisaged that we might one day have a Comptroller and Auditor General who would not be qualified under the criteria envisaged in the section for auditors of companies?</P>
    <P>I cannot see much sense in perpetuating the very delicate graduated tariff of penalties which are now being increased to keep pace with inflation and which are listed in the First Schedule.  I have no quarrel with increasing these penalties to reflect the fall in the value of money but I have to marvel at the fine callipers, the fine legislative tweezers, which was set to work in 1963 on these various offences and which prescribed such delicately differentiated penalties as that which separates £25 from £20.  Who is the Solomon whose sense of moral obliquity is so acute that he was able to insert in the draft of the 1963 Bill provisions which subject one kind of trivial offence under the Companies Act to a fine of £20 but thought that there was a troy ounce of extra evil in another offence for which the appropriate fine would be £25?  The same might be said to apply with only slightly diminished force to the other fines of £5 or £1 or upwards to fines of £50 or even £100.  Most of these are minor offences, although I do not think it has ever been litigated in terms of money sums.  The question of what is a minor offence has often been litigated but I do not think we have reached a firm view as to the uppermost limit at which a money fine can be imposed on a summary hearing. I would not be surprised if most of <Col N="1496" /> these, if not all of them, would qualify as minor offences.  What is the point in this elaborate structure or scale of penalties? There are eight different categories of penalties here varying from £5,000 to £5, like brightly coloured piles of monopoly money notes.</P>
    <P>I suspect that if we were to track the historical reason for this it would be the usual good old reason that English legislation has or had originally a scale of varying penalties somewhat like this, that the niggling exactitude, the dandruffy pettifogging of some Victorian draftsman was originally responsible for these finely graduated fines.  They survive into our legislation in 1982.  It is too small a point to justify mucking up the whole Bill or the 1963 legislation but the next time the Minister's advisers get a chance they might see if there is some neater way of expressing the public loathing and condemnation of the criminal behaviour which can be committed by people under the Companies Act in such a way as to do away with the pretence that they can measure the seriousness of these offences according to such a fine scale.</P>
    <P>The party I represent otherwise welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It had not been my intention in the course of the discussion on the development of company law envisaged in this Bill to make reference to the general questions of business development and the important connected questions of unemployment, but as those matters were touched upon by Deputy Kelly I would agree with him to the extent that our technical legislation on matters of company law should do everything possible to encourage the creation of employment.  He makes the point that nothing should be done to further discourage the private sector from creating productive employment.  Would that the private sector would create the employment that the country needs.  I wish that they did carry out that function to an extent which would make some inroads on the high and increasing degrees of unemployment.  I wish that all we required were some improvements in our company legislation to bring about <Col N="1497" /> increases in the amount of employment available.  The hard truth is that the private sector have failed to meet the needs of the country in the provision of employment. They are open to criticism on that account.  The private sector have fallen down and for that reason the Labour Party have always advocated that in the circumstances the State has the obligation to take up that shortfall and by its own involvement in production or the provision of employment to take whatever steps it can to ensure that it will meet the shortfall in employment.  The private sector have not come up with or even tended to refer to that line of country. However that is a bit beyond the scope of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the <i>ad hoc</i> amendments proposed in the Bill are acceptable in so far as they are improvements of the existing situation, but the Bill leaves undealt with at this stage a number of key critical matters on the question of company law and the time has come for us to have a look at and consider them.  The first I want to refer to is the whole nature and basis of the concept of what a company is all about, namely the concept of limited liability itself.  That whole concept came into general practice around the turn of the century.  It was formalised in the Companies Act, 1908, and it has developed through the years both in the UK and in this country, culminating in the comprehensive legislation of 1963, but, as with any other legal concept, it is a mistake to think that it must be accepted as hard and fast and that, once that concept has been in operation for a number of years, it must remain so on a permanent basis.  Recent business developments and the state of development we are at now call for a hard look at the universality of the concept of limited liability.  We must examine the question in certain specified cases&mdash;I will enumerate just a few and there may be more that would be appropriate&mdash;where it would have been reasonable, just and appropriate that a restriction should be applied on that concept of limited liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of limited liability means that it is open to people by using the device of a company to go into the marketplace, <Col N="1498" /> incur debts and responsibilities to members of the public, and in the event of the liquidation of that company to be able to avoid, either in whole or in part, the debts and responsibilities that they have incurred in that manner.  Members of the public are all too well aware of the relatively common circumstances whereby from time to time a major company goes into liquidation, where the directors or shareholders of that company will be well known in the public eye to be people of substance, very wealthy members of the community, possibly even millionaires, and the liquidation of a company in which they would be involved would result in very serious and substantial losses right across all sections of the community involving everything perhaps from financial institutions down to the ordinary man in the street who might have contracted to buy a house or something of that sort from the company. The members of the public will have the prospect, after many of them have suffered serious blows financially, perhaps body blows involving the loss of their savings&mdash;they might have paid a deposit on a new house, for example, which they might lose&mdash;three, six or nine months later, of the directors, the public figures of that company, again operating in the realm of high finance through assets of theirs which they would have applied or invested in some other company or in some other way.  It would be reasonable, in order to protect vulnerable people who have entered into dealings with companies, that the privilege of limited liability should be restrained to assist those people in special cases.  I will enumerate a number of the examples that I have in mind.</P>
    <P>The first concerns a member of the public having paid a deposit to purchase a new house from a builder or developer company or having made stage payments as the building of that house would proceed, and that company before the completion of the house would go into liquidation. Such a course might well involve the loss of the entire of that deposit or those stage payments that the person would have made or of a substantial part thereof.  Such a loss to a person in that <Col N="1499" /> category could very well mean the end of the person's prospects of ever being in a position to buy a house for himself.  As I said, that person would be presented with the spectacle very likely at a later date&mdash;not that far distant&mdash;of the directors of that building firm operating once again in the realm of high finance.  It would be wrong that the persons who were directors of that firm after that deposit was made should escape entirely through the company device liability for the payment of that deposit to that person, the member of the public who made it.</P>
    <P>The building and developing companies who build these houses operate according to their own rules, which they lay down.  One does not have the free bargaining of the marketplace so beloved by Deputy Kelly, if he will excuse me for saying so.  They operate their own rules. In the ordinary case of the purchase and sale of a house when a deposit is paid the deposit is held by the vendor's solicitor as stake-holder and in the event of anything going wrong the deposit is thereby usually secured and the purchaser would be in a position to get it back.  The building companies will not accept that.  You cannot buy a house from a building company with their agreement that the deposit will be held by their solicitor as stake-holder.  No, they insist that the deposit moneys and stage payment moneys must be paid over into their hands. That gives rise to a great potential danger of loss to the purchaser of a new house, normally a young couple in a most weak and vulnerable position.  There is no give or take or bargaining here.  I have been in the position many times of having requested that a builder's solicitor would hold the deposit as stake-holder and that request has always been turned down. That is one of the categories that I would regard as a special case where the ultimate privilege of complete limited liability should be restrained.</P>
    <P>The second also concerns the question of building and developer companies. When the local authorities give a mortgage on a new house, and building societies likewise, they require that the building <Col N="1500" /> company give a guarantee on the new house, guaranteeing it against defects for a specified period, sometimes one year, sometimes two years.  That defects indemnity is given by the building company.  If the building company go into liquidation the value of that sealed defects indemnity by the building company becomes worthless for practical purposes.  It would be entirely wrong and unjust that the persons who were directors of the company at the time when guarantees of that nature were given should be in the position in their personal capacity to escape all liability on foot of that defects indemnity because they would know, or should know, the financial position of the company at that time; and if that danger was there they should note and know, if the law so provided, that they would be taking upon themselves the risk of personal responsibility in the event of that company liquidating.</P>
    <P>Likewise, building and development companies with gay abandon issue guarantees, as they have to do, that they will maintain the road and services servicing that new house until they are taken over by the local authority.  Every new house has to get such a sealed guarantee by the building company.  In the event of that company going into liquidation before those roads and services are taken in charge by the local authority the unfortunate purchaser of the new house would find himself saddled with a very substantial debt to the local authority for which the building company were liable under the gurantee but which would be worthless in the event of a liquidation.  In that situation also, I think it would be appropriate, just and reasonable that the directors of the company at the time such a guarantee or indemnity was given should carry a personal responsibility for that guarantee and its terms.</P>
    <P>A final category I wish to consider refers to companies in the business of manufacturing and selling new goods to consumers.  In the case of a company who give a guarantee on new goods to a consumer that they accept responsibility for those goods for a fixed period &mdash; be it one year or two years &mdash; and who go into liquidation during the currency <Col N="1501" /> of the guarantee, I think it would be reasonable, because of the special situation which our law recognises for consumers embodied in recent consumer legislation, that the persons who were directors of the company that gave the guarantee in the event of its going into liquidation during the currency of the guarantee would carry a responsibility for it and would be personally liable.</P>
    <P>I have set out some examples we should think about as a basis of cutting back on the overall concept of liability that has become axiomatic in our law since the concept of companies legislation was practised on a wide scale at the turn of the century.  I do not suggest that the list of the cases I have given is exhaustive; many others might be appropriate. However, they occured to the Labour Party as special key examples that, having regard to the times in which we live, would be appropriate for treatment of that nature at this stage.  The case of building and development companies has been highlighted by the recent liquidation or receivership of a major building company and the possibility that there may be others to follow in this area.  I am aware that many purchasers of houses and persons involved in buying houses with connections of that company are extremely concerned and perturbed about deposits they have paid and stage payments they have made.  They are in a state of uncertainty as to whether they will get their money back or get their houses and are concerned about the general outcome of that situation.</P>
    <P>Members of the public do not have an adequate knowledge and do not have adequate protection available to them when they come to deal with a company where a debenture exists.  Persons about to have dealings with a company where a debenture exists clearly are not aware of the serious hazards that face them in dealing with a company in that situation. The person concerned could be about to buy a house from a builder.  The existing legislation provides that the existence of a debenture has to be registered in the Companies Office and it is open to any person about to have a dealing with a company to go to that office and ascertain <Col N="1502" /> if a debenture exists on that company. That is true but it is not a factor that would occur to very many people about to have dealings with a company.</P>
    <P>The law provides that companies are obliged in all their documentation &mdash; letterheads, receipt books, invoices and application forms &mdash; to specify certain limited particulars affecting the company. These include the location of the registered office, the registered number of the company and perhaps the names of the directors.  I suggest that there should be added to that list in the case of a company where a debenture exists a statement to the effect that a debenture has issued and that consequently in the event of a receiver being appointed a person having dealings with that company might suffer.  The wording could be worked out.  Where a debenture exists there should be an obligation on the company that that fact be noted on all papers, letters, and documentation of the company. I do not say that what would be a complete answer to the concern I have for persons having dealings with the company in that situation but it would be of some help and it would be a reasonable thing to do.  I suppose it amounts to the same kind of situation as the law that requires a statement on packets of cigarettes to the effect that smoking may damage one's health.  There should be some wording to the effect that where a debenture exists having dealings with such a company may end up damaging one's pocket.</P>
    <P>It will be our intention to table amendments on Committee Stage to cover the headings of the matters I referred to and we will discuss them further on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will wish to conclude the Second Stage debate this evening and I will facilitate him.  Most of us are familiar with the 1963 Act but it is a matter of very considerable regret that 20 years later we have only had minor amendments to company law, in 1973 and 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the very short time I was in Government and before, I felt considerable dissatisfaction with the progress being made <Col N="1503" /> on the reform of company law.  Every concerned Deputy must be preoccupied with the fact that, despite our entry into the EEC many years ago, we have made singularly little progress towards implementing a number of basic EEC directives on company law.  I had hoped this Bill would be much more elaborate and that the major developments in those directives would be enshrined in this Bill or in other Bills which would be introduced almost immediately.  I am afraid that, apart from the relatively minor amendments in this Bill, we will see very few changes made in company law within the next 18 months or two years.  It is amazing how quickly time slips by.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the development towards implementing the Second EEC Directive, it must be pointed out that progress was made only when the Irish Government were taken before the European Court of Justice for non-implementation of the directive.  We are very tardy when it comes to implementing directives dealing with company law.  It is important to point out that at this moment the Irish Government are in breach of our obligations under two other EEC directives on company law.</P>
    <P>Everybody interested in the European Community company legislation is familiar with the Fourth Directive which contains very important provisions relating to the disclosure of information.  We are in breach of that directive too.  If it had been fully enshrined in our company legislation, some of the horrendous stories we hear about limited companies would never have come about.  If that information had been disclosed, people would have been forewarned and they would not have suffered losses which amounted to tens of millions of pounds.  The Fourth Directive should have come into operation in July 1980.  On Committee Stage, Deputy Taylor and I intend to table a number of amendments.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that it has been decided to raise the general limit in section 10 from £300 to only £1,500.  That is a derisory amount.  It is scandalous in this day and age that the ceiling for payment <Col N="1504" /> of an employee's outstanding claim in the event of the company's insolvency should be raised from £300 to only £1,500.  What is £1,500 in the context of 1982?  It is precisely ten weeks average earnings of an industrial worker, who earns £142 to £145 per week.  For many years a worker slaves for a company, or at least gives an honest day's work.  Under this proposed amendment the ceiling for payment of such a person will be £1,500.  That is completely unrealistic.  The Minister should have a serious look at this.</P>
    <P>Let us take the £300 mentioned in the 1963 Act.  Adjusting it for basic inflation, the limit should have been raised to £3,500.  I do not know what people do in the inner sanctum of the law section in the Department or what Deputies do when they become Ministers and influence their parliamentary draftsmen and the secretary and assistant secretaries of their Department, but if I had been involved I would have said that £300 in 1963 is now worth £3,500 taking inflation into account.  On Committee Stage I will propose that the figure be at least £4,000, or roughly six months' wages.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to the introduction of some form of indexation. We are proposing to increase this figure to £1,500 and in five or six years' time we will probably be debating raising this figure to £3,000, but in the meantime the employees will suffer.</P>
    <P>I have great personal regard for my colleague, Deputy Kelly, but in terms of company law I can only regard some of his views as quaintly Victorian.</P>

      <P>Let us take the example <Col N="1505" /> of a person who forms a limited company, borrows money from a bank, gets a grant or loan from the IDA, gets a site from the local authority to build a plant and then accepts the responsibility of taking on workers, telling them they would be employed at a certain wage and accepting the responsibility of making returns to the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; PAYE returns, VAT returns, PRSI returns and so on.  If in the heel of the hunt one gets a return on capital employed of anything from zero to 30 per cent or more one is doing well.  In some cases it could be vastly more but most would be doing well to get 14 or 15 per cent on capital employed if one accepts that responsibility and the concmitant social responsibilities in the eighties.  I do not claim to know very much about American company law but one of my relations has a small private company in America and he explained to me the rigours of Californian company law that he has to meet.  Even when in hospital he still has to make tax and company returns and he is visited by the American enforcement agencies relating to company law with a rigour which makes him regard company law in Ireland as a joke. He is a Dublin man who went out and made his money as a tradesman and then set up a private company there.  In America the rigours imposed on people who engage in enterprise to discharge their social obligations are very considerable. With that slight divergence from the unique exposition we had from Deputy Kelly on the virtues of business enterprise I shall conclude by saying to the Minister that we intend to table a number of amendments, particularly to section 10 of the Bill.  We shall urge him, perhaps between now and Committee Stage, to have a sharp look at that income limit.  I think he could do that and it would be very welcome.  I am sure the Minister wishes to conclude.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the three Deputies who have spoken and to Deputy Desmond for giving me the opportunity to conclude this evening so that we may have the Committee Stage <Col N="1506" /> ordered for next week, as I should like to get the Bill through as soon as possible. I should like to deal briefly with a number of the points that have been made and in the case of those that I do not have the opportunity to deal with tonight we could perhaps deal with them on Committee Stage, which I hope we will have next week.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor complains with some justification about the abuses of limited liability.  He instanced cases where perhaps it is particularly blatant and unfair to those who suffer as a result of the default of a liquidated company and who then have their losses added to by their anger at seeing the principals in that company going back into the same type of business six or 12 months later.  That is very annoying and is clearly an abuse of limited liability.  However, there is provision in the 1963 Act &mdash; I think in section 184 &mdash; which allows the court to stop such persons engaging in business again as far as a company are concerned, being a director of a company or managing a company. But they can only do that if fraud or dishonesty can be proved and it is very hard to prove fraud or dishonesty.  I hope that in the next Bill of this kind which will deal with the domestic side of company law, as opposed to the EEC side of it, we can include a provision to meet that sort of point and prevent people like that going back into business other than as sole traders on their own account.  I suppose you cannot stop them if they have not been declared bankrupt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one businessman in this city who is now in his fourth company, the previous three having failed to pay their creditors and been liquidated.  He was in the same line of business on each occasion. I do not know why members of the public deal with him but I suppose most of them would not know that he was in business three times before and defaulted three times before and abused limited liability three times before.  Deputy Taylor gave instances of this happening in building companies where it can be pretty blatant.  It happens in other spheres also. Certainly, there are amendments I would wish to make on the lines he has indicated. At present we have the very unsatisfactory <Col N="1507" /> situation that the section under which the Minister puts in inspectors to hold inquiries has not been as enforceable as it should be.  People who are very properly the subject of inquiry by inspectors under that section now apparently feel themselves free to engage in business again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor made the point about debentures and said, I think, that the existence of the debentures should appear on the notepaper of a company. The position with debentures is rather more satisfactory from a creditor's point of view than it is in many other aspects of a company nowadays because the debenture, as I understand it, is not valid and binding on the company unless it is registered in the company's office and information about it and the size of it is accessible there to any creditor who might be concerned about the financial health of a company with which he is doing business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly was concerned about whether the further Bills to which I referred were Bills which would relate to existing Directives or whether they would relate perhaps to Directives that have not yet come into effect.  All the Bills I mention relate to Directives which are in effect in Europe already.  Unfortunately, there are four or five and as Deputies have said we are in default.  It is only fair to say that the Bill implementing the Second Directive in respect of which we were recently before the European Court was prepared long before there was any question of our being prosecuted or otherwise dealt with by the court.  Even though the subject of that Bill is not a very lively topic Deputies will see when they get the Bill the amount of care that had to go into the preparation of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond complained about tardiness in this respect and I suppose on the surface he might well do so but I should like to explain that this country has to do as much in relation to company law as the United Kingdom.  We have four or five civil servants who are designated to deal with this kind of legislation.  At the same time they also have to service all the committees in Europe which are sitting <Col N="1508" /> literally every week.  We have no additional officials that we could put on the European side while reserving some officials here full time for the legislative side.  A very small number have to service it at both ends and also have to deal with day-to-day company matters that arise in any case domestically without reference to the EEC.  We have to do exactly as much in relation to legislation as the UK. We have five people, I think, dealing with it at this level.  The British may have up to 100 and the Germans many more.  It is one of the disadvantages of a small country to have to produce as much work as another whose resources may be 50 times greater.  Some allowance must be made for that.  When we were summoned, prosecuted, or whatever the word is, in relation to the Second Directive, we were in good company.  Five other member states were up as well, some with 20 times or more our population.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Desmond may misunderstand the point about the £1,500 wages in section 10.  I think he feels that an employee is confined to a total of £1,500, but that figure relates only to wages.  As he said, it would relate to about 11 weeks and if any employee were owed his wages for 11 weeks by a company, he would have long since gone from that company.  Eleven weeks is more than adequate in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The other points on detail raised I could usefully leave until Committee Stage.  I ask that Second Stage be passed now and that Committee Stage be fixed for next week.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that the Labour Party should not make the dangerous assumption that they have the monopoly on social conscience in this House.  The reintroduction of this Bill has little to do with conscience, and the emotive language used by its supporters masks a poverty of original ideas and a limited grasp of the complex interaction of economic factors in our country. I am as much aware as the members of the Labour Party of the speculation in land on the periphery of major urban areas which has reached an unacceptable level.  The answer, however, is not to swing to the opposite extreme which would create chaos in our local government system and could seriously jeopardise <Col N="1510" /> the building industry.  The answer is not to make a futile attempt to rescue this flawed Bill.  Indeed, we have had little evidence to suggest that the Labour Party are sincere in their alleged preparedness to discuss amendments to the Bill.  This Government are already responding to the problem of controlling building land prices in a manner which is most suited not only to the provisions of our Constitution but also to the pace of our economic development and to our system of administration.</P>
      <P>I believe that most members of this House welcome enthusiasm and innovation in our efforts to overcome severe problems in our society.  These qualities need to be tempered by reason and foresight, if we are to achieve lasting solutions. I do not think that any of these qualities are evident in the promotion of this Bill.  It is not new; it selects elements of the Kenny Majority Scheme, thereby reducing further the value of an already doubtful proposal.  Above all, there is no indication whatsoever that the Labour Party have given any realistic consideration to the consequences for everyone of introducing this disruptive measure into our existing administrative framework. The re-introduction of this Bill is not just a misguided attempt to win popular support. It is &mdash; to use Deputy Higgins's adjectives of last week where they properly belong&mdash;a seedy and subversive exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to await the Attorney General's considered views on the legal and constitutional aspects of the Kenny Report in the light of recent Supreme Court judgments of major constitutional importance, before rushing headlong into a discussion of legislative proposals.  In the meantime, it is surely logical to examine proposals based on the Kenny Majority Scheme in the light of the advice and interpretation already available to us.  But we do not believe, as both of the main Opposition parties seem to believe, that talk is a substitute for action.  Any reference to the Minister's statement in this debate last week should be enough to demonstrate that this Government are approaching the problem <Col N="1511" /> of building land prices on a most comprehensive scale.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, as the Minister has indicated, are developing a comprehensive set of measures designed to tackle on all fronts the building land prices problem. Our approach has been to give detailed consideration to ensuring that it does not involve any of the disadvantages which are inherent in the Labour Party proposals. The taxation measures announced in the budget will have the effect of returning to the community a considerable proportion of windfall profits resulting from the provision of local services.  It is more realistic in our present economic circumstances to generate revenue than to establish an elaborate system which would require very considerable capital investment.  In addition, our taxation proposals have immediate effect, whereas the Labour Party proposals are so fraught with problems that I cannot see them operating effectively, either now or in the future.</P>
    <P>The other options which the Minister has undertaken to examine are an earnest of his concern to find a workable solution to this difficult problem.  It is not our policy to indulge in unrealistic theory, or to let our imagination run wild in contemplating results before we have even assessed the value or the potential of the measures which we would propose to adopt.  We have acknowledged that there is no easy solution to the problem and the Opposition parties are being less than honest in their reaction to the Fianna Fáil approach if they do not agree that it is both sincere and responsible as a basis for dealing with land price control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the National Economic and Social Council, Report No. 55 &ldquo;Urbanisation: Problems of Growth and Decay in Dublin&rdquo; stating that &ldquo;the Council suggested that something should be done about the Kenny Report and if that was felt to be insufficient something better than it should be adopted&rdquo;.  He did not dwell on the council's recognition that there were &ldquo;considerable difficulties involved in resolving this controversial issue&rdquo; or on its acknowledgement of the suggestion <Col N="1512" /> that unless very large areas were designated so as to include virtually all land within reach of expanding towns and cities, fresh anomalies could and would arise between landowners within and outside the designated areas.  Do the Labour Party seriously consider that this Bill is something better than the Kenny scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Higgins also made wild allegations in this House last week about so-called subversive suggestions by the Minister.  The Minister did not in any way suggest a diminished role for the Legislature, as Deputy Higgins suggested in his speech.  Instead, he acknowledged the role of the highest court in the land in interpreting the Constitution, and suggested that the House should not waste its time debating a Bill which ignores recent Supreme Court decisions of major significance, and even disregards the basic principle of the Kenny scheme which was designed to validate the jurisdiction to designate an area.  Deputy Higgins should not be complaining about a tedious re-run of the old <Col N="1513" /> objections that were prepared for the Minister in 1980.  This is a tedious re-run of an old Bill and Deputy Higgins has failed to grasp that the Minister's reservations are based partly on constitutional interpretation of very recent origin.</P>
      <P>I feel that I have said as much as I can on this subject and will make way for others, to give them more time to speak on the subject.  I am sure there will be further contributions from the Opposition, although I am waiting to see someone from Fine Gael coming in who supports this measure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not know what attitude they will adopt, that will be a matter for Fine Gael to decide but a careful reading of Deputy Barry's speech on the Bill indicated that he called upon the Labour Party to withdraw it.  He did not indicate what the attitude of his party would be in the event of this Bill coming to a vote.  The Labour Party will not be withdrawing this Bill.  The Bill was put forward by the Labour Party on a previous occasion; it was put forward by the party last week and this week and the Labour Party will continue at every available opportunity in the future to highlight the position that has arisen on the question of building land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three distinct aspects to the Bill and to the question of building and development land.  The first is the question of the taxation of speculative gains, the second is to ensure orderly planning of large areas for development and the third is to determine the ultimate price of land for housing purposes, both in the public and the private sector.  There is no doubt that the recent improvements in the question of taxation are to be welcomed. <Col N="1514" /> They are an improvement on the previous position but the Minister in his speech conceded, as is obviously the case, that that is not an answer to the problem.  It is more in the nature of attempting to treat the symptoms of the disease rather than tackling the disease itself.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of this Bill involves what might be described as orderly development.  We are not talking here about development of small groups of five or ten houses but about large-scale developments, highlighted by the problems that we faced over the last decade, namely the construction and development of new towns.  The population and demographic changes in the country over the last decade are the problems we have to face and we will have to face them again.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area alone we have had to build three new towns.  Those towns have been developed so far under the free enterprise system staunchly advocated by the Minister and by Fianna Fáil. The result of that kind of development, where the building of a new town has been concerned, has left a lot to be desired.  It has led to ribbon development and it has left the degree and stage of the development to the discretion of the industrial builders and developers.  Take the case of the new town of Tallaght, which now has a population of 75,000 people.  What have we there as a result of the free enterprise system?  The town has been built to a population of over 70,000 but the heart of the town, the town centre, is still missing.  The land for it is reserved and drawn on the map but the area that should be occupied by that town centre, by all the facilities and infrastructure that 75,000 people in a new town need, is not there.  That has arisen from the basic, inherent defect in a large-scale development under the existing system.  You may say you will have a new town in Tallaght, that the land is zoned for this purpose; you may invite the land owners to make planning applications to build on that land and they get planning permission to do so, but having got the planning permission, there is nothing in the system which obliges <Col N="1515" /> them to put that planning permission into practice.</P>
    <P>They are not required to provide on that land that for which they obtained planning permission.  They do that, if they do it at all, at a time and in a manner which suits the developer's financial purpose and is in no way designed to or aimed at the probable needs of that new developing town.  That does not enter into the consideration of the developer.  He does not ask if they need shops, a cinema, a library, a church or a health centre. That is not the criterion under which the developer in the free enterprise system operates.  He decides which aspect of the development for which he has planning permission will produce the most immediate and highest degree of profit for him.  It is on that basis of operation and progress that he proceeds to carry out the development. The local authority are helpless in this situation.  All they can do is zone land for different purposes and hope and pray that the developers in some haphazard fashion will ultimately come forward and provide what they have planned.  In fairness it must be said that, no doubt, eventually that will happen.  I am sure all the infrastructure and the town centre that are needed in Tallaght, which I take purely as an example, will be provided.  But can we wait that long?</P>
    <P>This is the basic directive of the Bill, that that element of haphazard development in a large-scale development is taken out of the system, that the local authority are the guiding active hand in procuring and achieving that development because the local authorities, having acquired the land that is necessary, will then dispose of it by building contracts to developers in part and will develop such part as it may consider appropriate.  The point is that in the situation envisaged by the Bill, the local authority are in the saddle.  They control the development and make events happen, not awaiting them to happen at the will and whim of the individual developers. When the local authority specify or give out a building contract, in some cases for private houses, in other cases for local authority houses, for shops, factories, <Col N="1516" /> a library or for any of the purposes that make up a new town, the contract then specifies a time.  The local authority decide they have the needs of the community at heart and they decide what is needed in the development of that town at that stage in its development.  Being in control of the situation, they are in a position to specify by contract with the builders and developers what is to be built, how it is to be built and when it is to be built.  The question of orderly development is a key and important aspect of the Bill because it can only be achieved by the local authority taking effective control of that development.</P>
    <P>The financial aspects attached to land are a key factor of what is envisaged in the Bill.  There is no doubt that developments of this nature &mdash; this is implicit in the speeches made by Deputies on all sides &mdash; developments of this scale, have produced substantial profits, and the question that arises for determination here is whether these profits should accrue to the community through the local and other public authorities or should accrue to private landowners whose land fortuitously happens to lie in the intended path of the development?</P>
    <P>I first want to make one point clear, that there is no element of expropriation in this Bill.  That emphasis has been put on it by Fianna Fáil, but the Bill makes it clear that every landowner whose land would be designated under the Bill would receive its full existing use value in addition to the full cost to the landowner of the relocation.  Yet it is suggested that the existing use value is not adequate.  By some stretch of the imagination it is contended that the landowner should receive not the existing use value but double, treble, quadruple or up to ten times the existing use value.</P>
    <P>Is that what it is contended, in justice and equity, should be received by a landowner in that situation?  We must look at the question of where this constructive increase in the value of that land comes from &mdash; whence comes that windfall?  I will examine that in some detail.</P>
    <P>You could have a case in which a man might achieve windfall profits from his land, admittedly without any effort on his <Col N="1517" /> part but in a situation in which taxpayers' money has not gone towards the creation of that windfall.  Take the case of oil or minerals being discovered on a man's land.  A man who finds such wealth gets a windfall profit purely fortuitously because he did not do anything to improve the value of the land, yet the value improved.  That is a windfall, but the kind of windfall we are talking about in the context of the Bill is very different because we have to look at the question of what is it that increases the value of that owner's land.</P>
    <P>It is not something that just happens. It is not the normal increase in the price of farmland.  It arises in a very special way because of the fact that his land fortuitously is found to be in the path of development and it becomes serviced with water, drainage, roads, all provided out of public funds.  That is the factor that causes the increase in the value of the land.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech on this Bill the Minister said that during 1982 he would allocate £87 million for public water and sewerage schemes.  That money that he is to allocate &mdash; I am sure he will &mdash; was provided by the taxpayers: it was they who provided the Minister with the £87 million to be allocated, as he put it, for that purpose.  The bulk of that will come from the PAYE sector of the taxpayers.  We therefore reach this situation: PAYE worker, and taxpayers generally, pay their tax week in, week out, and the money ultimately gets funnelled into the hands of the Minister for the Environment and he will allocate £87 million to be expended, as the Minister indicated, on public sewerage and water schemes, going out into new virgin territory, land which was agriculture-based only.</P>
    <P>It is that expenditure of taxpayers' money that under the system we have been operating produced the increase in value of that land, and what has happened is that the unfortunate taxpayer, like the young man setting out to buy a new house, will be paying many thousands of pounds extra for his house, the price increased artificially by development works for which that man has paid <Col N="1518" /> in the first place as a taxpayer.  He is caught on the double, because it is his money, the tax he paid, that enabled the development of that land, yet the landowner who did not contribute anything to the development will get double, treble, quadruple the price of the land.</P>
    <P>I do not know by how many thousands of pounds the cost of the house would be increased by the development, but we know it is very substantial, anything between £4,000 and £6,000.  It is entirely outrageous, unjust and inequitable that the taxpayers, having provided the Minister with £87 million to carry out those developments, should find themselves having to pay later thousands of pounds more for their houses because their own money has been expended to increase the value of that land.</P>
    <P>This applies not only in the private sector.  It applies to local authority houses because the local authorities, in the calculation of rents and sale prices, when they come to sell houses, find that the land cost is as important and serious a factor as it is in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill are moderate and it escapes me why any reasonable person would oppose the Bill.  This is a situation that cries out to high heaven for something to be done about it, but what is the response of the Minister?  He calls the Labour Party's attempts at equity in this form &ldquo;cynical and dishonest&rdquo;. Deputy Briscoe called it &ldquo;seedy and subversive&rdquo;. Where does the true cynicism lie here?  Fianna Fáil recognised that there was a scandalous situation on the question of building land in 1971.  They decided &mdash; I do not know why &mdash; they would do something about it.  They commissioned a report which came through in 1973 as the Kenny Report.  I do not know why they troubled to commission the report for all they have done to implement it.  They must have had some doubt as to the constitutionality or otherwise of the proposals they had in mind because with great foresight they brought on to chair the committee the Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Justice Kenny, one of the most eminent lawyers in the country.  It can be safely presumed that any proposal he would put forward or lend his name <Col N="1519" /> to would be prefectly legal and constitutional. Having got the report they did nothing about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister levelled the same criticism against the Coalition Government of 1973 and rightly so.  I accept that criticism and the fact that the 1973 Coalition Government did nothing about it reflects no credit on them.  They brought in many worthwhile measures and many excellent reforming measures but I regret that the implementation of the Kenny Report in some form was not one of them.  The fact that they did not do so may well have been a factor in many members of the Labour Party having reservations about participating in a second Coalition.  Be that as it may, the second Coalition programme had provision in it for implementation of measures along the lines of the Kenny Report.  I should like to think that had they the opportunity of staying in power for longer than the six months they did, they would have implemented it.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some comments on the Minister's amendments to the Bill.  One of his amendments indicates that the Government intend to take whatever additional measure may be necessary to ensure that land is made available to local authorities free of any element of speculative gains.  The words used are interesting, &ldquo;additional measures&rdquo; it states.  That presupposes that the Government have already taken some measures to ensure that land was made available to local authorities free of all elements of speculative gains.  I know of no such measure in existence at present which enables local authorities to acquire land free of the element of speculative gains.  I am curious to know what the Minister means by additional matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister throws out a complete red herring and that is the question of the constitutionality of the Bill.  He uses different expressions on different occasions. On one occasion he said there was a probability that it was unconstitutional. On another occasion he said there was no doubt but that the scheme proposed in the Bill is unconstitutional and on yet another occasion he said there were serious <Col N="1520" /> doubts about it.  He does not give the source of his advice.  Are we to take it that it is his personal opinion whether it is constitutional or not?  It is interesting to note that in the course of his speech he indicated that he sought the advice of the Attorney General in the matter.  That is the proper course to adopt because the Constitution, to which the Minister rightly pays such high regard, provides that it is the Attorney General who is responsible for advising the Government; yet he takes this line on the unconstitutionality of the Bill although admitting that he has not got the advice of the Attorney General to hand.</P>
    <P>The Minister took it on himself to quote the decision of the Supreme Court on the Act dealing with rent restrictions as a basis on which the Supreme Court would hold this Bill to be unconstitutional. That decision was an entirely different situation because what the Supreme Court held was that the Act dealing with rent restrictions had the effect of depreciating the value of a house in the hands of the landlord.  There is nothing in this measure to do that.  This measure ensures the full use value of the land so that this situation is not comparable in any way with the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The designation of the land ensures that it keeps its normal use value.  The Minister made the point that it should be the court which should designate the land rather than the local authority as specified in the Bill.  If the Minister felt that was his only objection, that matter and other consequential matters could be dealt with by a number of amendments to this Bill which the Labour Party would be happy to examine on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Today on the Bill dealing with litter, the Minister produced seven pages of amendments to the House.  Litter is another word for rubbish so that we have a situation where on a Bill dealing with rubbish the Minister is prepared to introduce seven pages of amendments but in the case of a Bill to provide homes for young people at a reasonable price he is not prepared to put forward any amendments and throws out the very valuable <Col N="1521" /> principles enunciated in this Bill &mdash; a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water.</P>
    <P>The key explanation of the Government's attitude to the Bill is not really concern about its constitutionality, not that they have any real intention to implement the Kenny Report or anything like it, not that they are convinced that any other system of bringing equity into land sales is possible but simply that they do not want this Bill, mild and modest in its intentions though it is, on the Statute Book.  This leads to the inevitable conclusion that they are concerned only to represent the few, those who have made and continue to make indecent profits from their land solely as a result of the expenditure of public money to service those lands.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about inducing financial institutions to acquire the land and hold it for release to local authorities. He will have little trouble in inducing them.  They would be interested in the profits that could be made on those developments and would require very little inducing but what comfort would it be to a young couple trying to buy their house at an unnecessarily inflated price to know that it is a financial institution that is now exploiting the situation rather than a landowner?</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed the hope that his remarks would be seen as an indication of the bona fides of the Government in relation to the building land question. I am afraid not.  Pious platitudes and statements of intent are no substitute for action.  There is little merit in Deputy Brady pointing out that we are all concerned to ensure that land at reasonable prices for the purpose of house building is available and maintained.  That is not the case at present and this Bill would mark major progress towards that end.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry was hopeful that an all-party committee might prepare legislation acceptable to all.  It must be quite clear from this debate that it would not be possible on this subject to achieve agreement on all sides of the House. There are conflicting interests here.  The time for action is now.  If we miss this opportunity it will be quite a considerable <Col N="1522" /> time before the opportunity to achieve equity in this field is presented to the House again.</P>

      <P>I must agree with the last speaker when he says the time for action is now.  I must add that the time for action is probably long overdue.  The fact that the Kenny Report was brought in in 1973 and has been ignored by successive Government ever since shows it is high time we had some action on this problem.  The last speaker also went into great detail on the Bill, its implementation, and how it would deal with the situation.  At the end of his contribution he referred to the heart of the matter when he mentioned the plight of young couples and young families who are the real victims of the neglect in this area for so long.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of Dublin City Council for the past three years.  The most serious social tragedy not just in our capital city but throughout the country must be the scandalous housing situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>No public representative could claim to be unaware of this scandal.  Every TD or councillor who meets his constituents in clinics or otherwise must be shocked at the plight of the unfortunate families who are forced to seek assistance from politicians to get what should be a basic human right in any civilised society, a home of their own.  That families should find it necessary to go through the demoralising process of approaching politicans brings shame on all of us who are elected to serve these people.  The scandal is all the greater because successive Governments on both sides of the House have failed to take effective steps to end it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin City Council have a housing waiting list of more than 7,000 families. Many thousands more on the corporation's transfer list are living in substandard and grossly overcrowded conditions. These statistics reflect the increasing difficulty experienced by a large section of our society in their attempt to obtain adequate living accommodation.  What <Col N="1523" /> should be a primary social right is now beyond the means of many of our people. Of course, the tragic housing situation is one of the hallmarks of poverty and contributes greatly to many other social ills today.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the situation as I see it as city councillor and now TD, because it is against that background that we must view those who profit from this situation.  Perhaps the principal contributory element in the increasing cost of housing, both in the local authority and the private sector, as we all know is the very high cost of building land.  The speculation and profiteering in building land is a crime.  I can find no other way to describe it.  It is a crime against our society. Those who profiteer in this manner are criminals in a far more real sense than many of those serving sentences in our prisons today.</P>
    <P>The victims of those profiteers are the unfortunate families who exist in the most disgraceful conditions and whose children suffer in a way which makes a mockery of the constitutional demand that all the children of the nation should be treated equally.  I can describe these speculators only as being on the same level as heroin dealers.  Both profit from the misery of their victims.  Both profit from the most vulnerable sections of our society.  For the land speculator and the heroin dealer our existing laws seem to be inadequate so far.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in putting these vultures in the same category.  Between them they constitute all that is worst in our society today.  There can be no justification whatever for the publicly structured scandal of speculation in building land while so many people live in such shameful conditions as a result.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I must support the Local Government (Building Land) Bill, not because it provides all the answers but because it is an attempt to tackle a problem which has been ignored for far too long.  That the Kenny Report has been set aside for so many years by various Governments would lead one to believe that both major parties in this House have vested interests in land speculation <Col N="1524" /> and are simply not interested in dealing with the problem.  How deep those vested interests are may well be seen when the vote is taken on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>Even at a time when workers are told they must moderate their wage demands, at a time when a most inequitable tax system weighs heaviest on PAYE workers, the small minority of individuals who rake in enormous fortunes at the expense of the homeless are to be protected, apparently, by the two main parties in Dáil Éireann. Local authorities throughout the State, including Dublin City Council on several occasions, have called for the implementation of the Kenny Report or alternatively, significant measures to deal with land speculation.  It seems to be fairly safe to call for the implementation of the Kenny Report or for a building land Bill if you are on a city council or a local authority.  It seems that when people are in power and have the ability to deal with the problem they choose to ignore it.  The vested interests appear to be determined to prevent any such measure being implemented.</P>
      <P>To say this Bill is unconstitutional is an excuse only, of course, and a facade to hide behind when voting against the Bill. The same excuse is used for not implementing the Kenny Report.  We all know the only way to test the constitutionality of the Bill or the report is to implement it.  The tests are in the courts.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the capital gains tax and the proposed special fund to enable local authorities to acquire a building land bank.  In the recent budget we had £91 million allocated to Dublin Corporation.  These measures have to be welcomed.  There is no question about that.  They can be welcomed only in the context of the disgraceful neglect of the past decades when nothing was done and the scandalous disregard of previous Governments for the housing problem. I regret to say the measures proposed by the Government are too little and too late.  Indeed, the Bill is probably only a half measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> In his statement the Minister referred to the dangers of introducing what he called a radical measure.  In my view if ever a situation demanded a radical solution it is that obtaining in respect of profiteering in building land.  I hope this Bill will go some way towards the provision of such a solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State in this Department with special responsibility for housing I feel it incumbent on me to contribute to this debate in relation to the problem of building land.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment has already pointed out to the House that the Bill before us is exactly the same as that introduced by Deputy Quinn two years ago.  In those circumstances I thought it might be appropriate to review the contribution I made to the debate on that earlier Bill when I expressed many serious reservations about its effectiveness in overcoming the problems it purported to solve.  My remarks at that time are on the record of the House.  Like Deputy Quinn I see no point in reiterating the arguments I made two years ago.  I propose therefore to confine my remarks on this occasion to a number of points made by Opposition speakers on Tuesday and Wednesday of last week when the present Bill was before the House.  I intend also to deal with a number of efforts by Deputies on the Opposition side of the House to distort the remarks made by the Minister for the Environment last week and to correct some misconceptions about the effect of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I should like to refer to certain figures mentioned in the media since this Bill was first published in 1980 by Deputy Quinn and other members of the Labour Party about the estimated reduction this Bill, or a Kenny-type scheme, would effect on house prices. Leaving aside constitutional and other difficulties applicable to both these schemes &mdash; assuming for a moment that either of them was implemented &mdash; one might ask what reductions could be expected in the price of housing or in housing rents.  In regard to housing rents <Col N="1526" /> I would point out that at present these are considerably lower than the economic cost of providing a house and, leaving aside altogether the site cost, even the maximum rent payable would not cover the cost of construction.  Therefore there is no reason to suggest that either the scheme proposed under this Bill or a Kenny-type solution would reduce the level of local authority rents.</P>
    <P>Enormous figures have been mentioned about the effect the provisions of this Bill would have on the price of housing. I understand that a possible saving of an amount up to £5,000 on the price of a house was mentioned on the radio recently.  This type of outlandish suggestion can be described only as either demonstrating complete ignorance of the finances governing the housing market and a misunderstanding of what these types of schemes are intended to achieve or as a deliberate attempt to puff up the effects of the Labour Party proposals in order to gain their acceptance by the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

      <P>The best information in regard to undeveloped housing sites available at present was produced by An Foras Forbartha at the request of the <Col N="1527" /> Department in 1980, which shows that the average price for all undeveloped sites in the Dublin area was £4,000.  The relevant figures for 1981 are not yet available but it is unlikely, in present economic circumstances, that this figure will have increased a great deal.  Therefore a suggested saving of £5,000 on the price of a house would mean probably that not only would local authorities give away sites for nothing but that they would throw in up to £1,000 with the site for good measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The average area of a site is an eighth of an acre.  Therefore the Minister is not comparing like with like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it is difficult to estimate what are average site prices at the lower end of the housing market. Prices vary widely.  In areas where a local authority would be likely to designate land under the majority recommendations of the Kenny Report, it is estimated that the average cost of undeveloped land is considerably lower than the figures published by An Foras Forbartha.  Furthermore, figures for land cost would be considerably less outside the Dublin area.  I think everybody would realise that to be the position.  However, neither the majority recommendations of the Kenny Report nor the provisions of the Bill before us envisage the transfer of land acquired by a local authority for anything like its existing use value paid by the local authority.  If local authorities were to transfer land to builders at its existing use value instead of recouping, for the benefit of the public good, the increase in its value attributable to the provision of services by them, this would mean that they would be giving to the individual new house purchaser the benefit of the full increase in its value.  There would then be nothing to stop such a purchaser reselling the house at a later stage keeping the profit for himself.  To prevent that happening it is necessary not only to control the building land market but also to control the second-hand housing market. Of course this would be completely impossible.  Also it would be very difficult <Col N="1528" /> to prevent individual house purchasers who might benefit from such a scheme from selling their houses at a profit.</P>
      <P>Deputies will remember a few years ago when a new tenant purchase scheme for local authority tenants was introduced and an attempt was made to claw back a percentage of the house price. However, this had not been revised because of the opposition to the original proposals.  In addition to examining the site costs, An Foras Forbartha have studied the housing market.</P>
      <P>One could conclude from this work that if land was less expensive in the Dublin area it would not necessarily result in lower house prices.  Instead, purchasers would be enabled and would probably choose to purchase larger, better equipped new houses.  This is because most purchasers of houses go to the absolute limit of their resources when buying. Any increase in productivity in the building industry over the years was not matched by lower house prices.  It enabled a builder, however, to provide better equipped houses to meet the changing demands.  It is highly probable, therefore, that if there are any savings made in the price of land this would result in a change of a preference by prospective house buyers for better constructed or larger houses.  This is the general pattern in the smaller country towns where building land is cheaper than in Dublin.</P>
      <P>An Foras Forbartha have also examined the relationship between new house prices and annual industrial earnings between 1970 and 1980.  In 1970 the ratio of average new house prices to the average industrial earnings was 5.7.  In 1971 this average was 5.5; in 1979 it was 5.4 and in 1980 it was 5.3.  This shows that new houses were cheaper relative to income in 1980 then they were in 1970.  It is wrong to say that house purchasers at present are worse off than the house buyers at that time, before the Kenny Report was even commissioned.  This does not mean that we should become complacent. It is important that we get the basic facts right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to the points raised in the debate by various Deputies.  First was the <Col N="1529" /> question of land acquisition for local authority housing.  I assure Deputy Sherlock and any other Deputies who are interested, that no change is at present contemplated in the procedures which have been established over the years as regards the forward acquisition and the selection of land by local authorities for their house building programmes, and in the manner of financing the acquisition. When he spoke last Wednesday in the House in relation to these matters, Deputy Sherlock expressed concern about the terms of a memorandum on the procedures to be followed and standards to be applied by local authorities in the provision of dwellings which was issued to all local authorities by my Department in April 1982.  There is nothing original or new in the memorandum.  It simply reiterates, in considerable detail, the various guidelines which have been applied to the local authority housing programme over the years prior to it and since the implementation of devolution procedures in the early seventies.  For the first time all the various instructions have been included.  The time was right for such a memorandum as it had become apparent that the escalation in the cost of local authority houses was due to a considerable extent to a lack of compliance with established procedures on the part of local authorities.  It is possible that local authorities might have thought that those requirements had lapsed with the passage of time.  This, however, is not the case.  Indeed, the need for them was never more apparent than now, having regard to the steep increases in costs being experienced.</P>
    <P>Adherance to such guidelines, for example, might have helped to reduce the cost of the many schemes built in recent years when site development works proved to be very expensive due to bad site selection or inefficient lay-outs resulted in the high cost of roads, footpaths and other relevant matters.  I am sure that we all agree that any economies that can be achieved in the cost, without lowering the standard of houses, should be achieved.  This would ensure that we get the best possible return in the number of houses of exceptionally high standard <Col N="1530" /> from any given allocation of money.  I am sure that those at present on local authority house waiting lists would thank us if by doing so we built more houses and thereby lessened the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In the area of site selection, the guidelines require that the sites should be properly assessed by the authority in accordance with the general Department recommendations and subject to consultation with the Department's inspectors. I feel sure that Deputy Sherlock agrees that those procedures, which have been developed down the years, are still appropriate if we are to try to ensure that bad site selection will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The other aspect raised by the Deputy concerns the financing of land acquisition for local authority housing.  The cost of forward acquisition for many years has been borne temporarily by local authorities by overdrafts or by other approved short-term loans which are generally obtained from the private lending agencies. The cost does not form part of the local authority housing capital until a housing scheme commences on the land when any holding charges incurred can be recouped from the appropriate scheme of a loan.  My approval to the financing of such a purchase is necessary in each area where purchase is involved.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy down the years that local authorities should confine such forward land projects to what is necessary for a reasonable housing programme. The practice that has been adopted in more recent years has been that new land acquisitions should be confined to what is necessary for the housing authorities: a five-year building programme.  I am prepared to approve appropriate financing for proposals for acquisitions.  However, I should add that in his contribution to this debate last week the Minister pointed out that the Government are in favour of forward land acquisition on as wide a scale as is possible.  It is recognised that that would be of considerable benefit in ensuring that development value would be returned to the community and that the provincial services would not result in speculation gains accruing to a small minority of people.  This approach has many advantages in the long term but in <Col N="1531" /> the short term the implications of diverting capital into land acquisition require very careful consideration.  Because of this the Minister indicated that the Government will be considering the possibility of inducing financial institutions to acquire and hold land which they would release at a later stage to local authorities to enable them to meet their future requirements.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with a number of points relating to section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act.  It is the intention to review the operation of this section in relation to planning.  In his contribution to the debate the Minister stated that there appeared to be general grounds for concern about the way in which the section is being used in a limited number of areas as a means of discarding reasonable and necessary planning.  The Minister indicated that he would have to ascertain what can be done to meet that situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry said that he agreed with the Minister's view, that he, too, had considerable reservations about the uses to which section 4 are being put in a limited number of areas.  However, we then had the extraordinary spectacle of Deputy Barry going on to accuse the Minister of having issued threats to the basic rights of the elected members of local councils and of suggesting the removal of the fundamental democratic rights of these elected members.  The Deputy said that he could take no other meaning than that from what the Minister said.  Of course, the Minister did not say that and neither did he suggest it.  He was at pains to point out that section 4 was regarded by him as an important part of the balance between the reserve and the executive powers of local authorities and that he would be reluctant to see planning decisions removed from the scope of this provision.</P>
    <P>Against this background it is a gross distortion to say that the Minister is proposing the outright abolition of section 4. The suggestion is unfair, misleading and dishonest.  Deputy Barry spoke in much stronger language about what he termed the abuses of section 4 in a limited number <Col N="1532" /> of areas.  At one stage he referred to disgraceful abuses in this context.  But the Deputy does not appear to be prepared to allow any action to be taken to deal with what he describes as disgraceful abuses but Deputy Barry has been long enough in the House and has enough experience as a Minister not to jump to the conclusion that if a particular statutory provision is not operating in all areas as it should be, the only option is to abolish it.  That is not the case.  We are examining a whole range of options with regard to the operation of section 4 in the planning area but I do not wish to preempt the outcome of the review that the Government intend to have carried out. Consequently, it would be inappropriate to spell out what all these options are.</P>
    <P>I might mention two other rather obvious possibilities.  One would be to require a majority of more than one-third of the local membership of the council which is what is now required for the passing of a section 4 resolution relating to a planning application while another obvious possibility would be to preclude repeated applications for permission for development that have been refused on appeal except where there had been a material change in circumstances or until the specified period had elapsed.  I am sure that Deputies, if they put their minds to it, would come up with a list of further possibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said he intended to examine the provisions of the Planning Acts in regard to the zoning of land by local authorities.  In a comment on this Deputy Barry said he would be loth to see any more powers taken away from elected representatives but the Minister did not say he was going to take away any powers from the local representatives. Finally, I should like to repeat what I said in 1980, that I am very anxious to tackle the problem of high prices for building land.  I do not see the Bill as the answer to the problem.  In fact, there is no easy answer to it, but the way forward is that proposed by the Minister last week and not the simplistic approach suggested by the Labour Party.  The Minister's proposals are reasonable and represent a positive step forward.  They are <Col N="1533" /> very important from the housing standpoint and will not disrupt the building-land market, something that should not be contemplated by any Government in present economic circumstances.  The Minister's proposals are realistic and take account of the constitutional and other legal problems which Deputy Quinn and the Labour Party always seem to ignore no matter how many times they are told.</P>

      <P>The best way to describe the introduction of the Bill by Deputy Quinn is to say that it is like a video show because it is a re-run of what was before the House two years ago.  I was not a Member of this House then but I am aware of the views expressed by the Deputy on that occasion.  I wonder why the Labour Party did not introduce a similar Bill during the seven months they were in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that it was not for the want of trying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but there can be no doubt that his fellow soldiers of destiny then were not prepared to accept his views in regard to land development. There is no way, as Deputy Barry said, that Fine Gael could support a piece of legislation which would be against the constitutional rights of people to private property.  The Minister has outlined his reasons why the Bill is unconstitutional and the decision in regard to the Bill dealing with rents on private property supports the Minister's view. Deputy Quinn is wasting the time of the House because he knows his proposed legislation will not be accepted.  However, it is his belief that introducing it now is a good political ploy before the Dublin West by-election.  It is my view that it will not be sufficient to cod the electorate in that constituency.  That constituency has a great housing problem and a great variety of houses, from the corporation houses in Inchicore and Ballyfermot to the £200,000 houses in Castleknock. A lot of development could be undertaken by local authorities, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn is entitled to his own <Col N="1534" /> ego trip in relation to this matter and I will not deny him that, but I wonder if he has considered the effect such legislation will have on building land throughout the country.  Deputy Quinn viewed this matter in the context of the Dublin area but his proposals would have major repercussions in every town and village.  Lands acquired by local authorities would eventually prove to be a major burden on their resources.  The Bill does not deal with the financing of the takeover of private property for development.  There would be a difficulty in rural areas and farmers could be put out of business if local authorities decided to acquire part of their farms.  Half of a farm may be compulsorily acquired but the remainder of the holding may be worthless to the farmer as an agricultural unit.  That would downgrade the value of that property for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not possible under the Bill.  The Deputy has misread the provisions in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who read the Bill will know that I am correct.  The Deputy has suggested that the local authorities should have the right to decide where the boundary should be.  There is nothing to prevent local authorities deciding that a line should be drawn right through the middle of a farm resulting in that farmer being put out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must approve of all plans.  The plans go on public exhibition and a farmer would have an opportunity to make his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has now admitted that what I said is correct because he has told the House that it would be a matter for the Minister to decide.  We have had enough interference by various Ministers and, no doubt, Ministers from the Deputy's party interfered in cases when they had the right to do so in regard to planning permission.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me in regard to that.  The Deputy's proposals could be detrimental to such an extent that people may conclude that private enterprise is <Col N="1535" /> the best means of development even if supply and demand is the ruling price criterion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn in the course of a radio interview expressed the view that the cost of a site would be effected by these proposals and he mentioned the figure of £5,000.  That is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest of the Workers' Party in this issue is not just of recent origin.  My party's weekly newspaper, <i>The Irish People,</i> has been raising questions about Gaeltarra Éireann and subsequently about Údarás na Gaeltachta since they took over in 1980.  We have been raising questions about this matter for the past five years.  The reasons for our interest and concern have been based on our interest and concern for the Irish language and the development of the Gaeltacht.  Huge sums of taxpayer's money are involved and that means the money of those within the PAYE system. We question whether we are getting value for the money invested.</P>
      <P>Our suspicions were sharpened when, despite continuing questioning by us, the national media did not take up the important issues we raised concerning Údarás na Gaeltachta.  It is clear from what we have found that things have been going wrong for a very long time and a policy review is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of Gaeltarra Éireann and subsequently of Údarás na Gaeltachta was the industrial development of Gaeltacht areas.  By any yardstick that has <Col N="1536" /> been a failure because the Gaeltacht continues to decline and because the cost of jobs provided has been an astronomical £100 million for a net creation of 3,000 jobs, most of which were lame ducks if not dead ducks from the start.</P>
    <P>Another vital question is why this waste of State resources continues even though each project has to be passed by Údarás na Gaeltachta, the Department of Industry and Energy, the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the IDA.  We believe the reason is that proposed industrialisation is not subject to rigorous examination as to viability but results from the operation of a massive patronage system.  Every Member wants a factory in his backyard and when advance factories are built it is a question of finding somebody to set up there, whether he will provide five or 20 jobs.  The curious thing is that the larger the number of jobs provided the less critical the examination of the viability of the project.</P>
    <P>In effect we have had the operation of the worst form of parish pump gombeen politics, a vast system of patronage whereby politicans could provide sops for their areas to cover the lack of any real planning for real industrial development. There was no criticism of this policy because the whole thing fitted into a system and the Gaeltacht was, in effect, a sacred cow and for that reason it was very rarely questioned.  Anyone who questioned the validity of spending this money ran the risk of being dubbed a traitor to the language.</P>
    <P>The real position is that a lot of money is being made by a small group of sharp gombeen business people while the language and the Gaeltacht slowly die.  Is it not ironic that in areas such as Ballymun and Inchicore people who have a genuine interest in developing the language are finding that obstacles are being placed in their way?  They have been trying to find a site for a school in Inchicore for the past five years and still have not succeeded.</P>
    <P>Last December the Coalition decided to have an investigation into the activities of Údaras na Gaeltachta, a decision brought about mainly through a combination of pressure and exposure in <i>The <Col N="1537" /> Irish People</i> and growing concern among the staff of the Údarás at the massive waste of public money.  Four months later nothing had been done to investigate anything and the Coalition finally &ldquo;copped out&rdquo; by ordering a Fraud Squad investigation.  While on the surface that decision seems to be a bigger step than having an internal investigation, in reality it sidesteps the main issue.  Why was so much money spent with so little return? Is the strategy of building chewing gum factories on the rocks of Connemara a realistic industrial development when the area is without infrastructure?  Who makes the policy decisions?  What are the objectives?  Are they attainable?  The Fraud Squad will not be able to answer those questions.  I have no doubt that it is not a question of misappropriation of funds but the misapplication of funds and the Fraud Squad will probably say that there has not been any fraud apart from slight errors in accounting procedures which occur in any company.</P>
    <P>There must be a total review of policy in relation to the Gaeltacht from the very basic question of whether it is realistic to talk in terms of saving the Gaeltacht right through to the question of how that can be done.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to industrialise geographically remote areas and it is impossible if the infrastructure of roads and telecommunications is not present, apart from the fact that such a policy is attempting to restructure society away from the urbanisation which has been a constant feature of development over generations.  It has not succeeded to date and unless there is a serious review of policy it will not succeed in the future.  It is no excuse for the Údarás or anybody else to say that failure is due to the lack of infrastructure.  The infrastructure did not exist 20 years ago when this policy was conceived and it still does not exist.</P>
    <P>Údarás na Galetachta are a good example of how State agencies are abused by the gravy train merchants.  CIE are another good example of this.  State companies are used to shore up private enterprise and to provide handouts to people who have not any worthwhile economic or industial ideas.  There is no reason <Col N="1538" /> why a person who has a worthwhile industrial idea should not receive grants from the IDA.  Gaeltacht grants are not much larger than IDA grants and the main reason that factories locate in the Gaeltacht is that they are marginal high risk investments.  One must compare the treatment meted out to Ardmore Studios by the Minister for Industry and Energy, when they incurred comparatively tiny losses, and the manner in which the Údarás throw money into companies with wild abandon.  There is clearly a double-think in relation to the Gaeltacht and industrial development.</P>
    <P>The most obvious symptom of the problems of the Údarás arises from the accounts released during the past few days which show a declared loss of £11.5 million for the year 1980.  From the proceedings of the last couple of hours I feel that a more realistic figure would be £14.5 million not of a loss but rather a write-off of assets.  Reliable sources also indicate that the write-off for the year 1981 could be a further £6 million or £7 million which would make a total write-off for the first two years in the operation of Údarás na Gaeltachta of almost £20 million.</P>
    <P>Possibly the most disturbing aspect of it is the question which is continually avoided, and that is the manner in which it would appear that this House has advanced money to Údarás na Gaeltachta over and above the limits set by this House in the 1979 Act which states clearly that the Údarás should not have an advance of more than £50 million.  I put a question down to the Minister and I got a written answer the other day which indicates that Gaeltarra had advances of £41.7 million and that a further £22 million was given to Údarás na Gaeltachta, and clearly that adds up to more than £50 million.  No good answer has yet been given to me or to anybody else of whom I am aware which indicates how £22 million and £41.7 million can add up to £50 million.</P>
    <P>To conclude, it is essential for the Government to establish immediately a public inquiry into the affairs of Údarás na Gaeltachta and to review the policy of development for the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <P>An sórt cainte atá cloiste againn anocht, bunaithe dár ndoigh ar chúlchaint agus ar ráflaí, atá ag déanamh an-dochar don teanga agus do na Gaeltachtaí agus is mór an trua go bhfuil an Teachta seo ag baint feidhme as an tseift sin chun a ghnó a dhéanamh.  Cuireann sé imní orm freisin nach raibh an Teachta úd in ann ná sásta a ghnó a dhéanamh ins an teanga dhúchais, an Ghaeilge, mar tá Gaeilge go líofa ag an Teachta sin.  Cén fáth nach mbeadh sé sásta an Ghaeilge a úsáid san Dáil ar an ócáid seo?  An amhlaidh go gceapann sé nach mbeidh saorphoiblíocht le fáil aige?  An é sin an chúis atá aige maidir leis a ghnó a dhéanamh as Béarla, mar tá Gaeilge go líofa aige? Is minic a chuala mé é ag caint as Gaeilge agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé sásta as seo amach a ghnó a dhéanamh maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge agus cúrsaí na teanga ins an Teach seo ins an teanga dhúchais.</P>
      <P>Is amhlaidh go bhfuil an Teachta sin ag tagairt don tuarascáil bliantúil 1980 a foilsíodh le déanaí.  Is dócha go bhfuil leathanach 42 ar an gclár infheistíochta ag déanamh trioblóide dó.  Foilsítear na híocaíochtaí le gach cuideachta ins an tuarascáil sin agus i gcuntais an Údaráis agus léirítear infheistíochtaí a bhíonn díscríofa.  Freisin, tá gach rud soiléir ins an tuarascáil maidir le fostaíocht, scaireanna, deontais chaipitil, deontais oiliúna, agus tá briseadh mion ann des na fo-thionscail, comhthionscail, tionscail eile agus na mion-tionscail ar íocadh deontais ina leith.  Ullmhaíodh na cuntais sin san fhoirm a cheadaigh Aire na Gaeltachta le comhthoiliú an Aire Airgeadais de réir alt 18 den Acht un Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979.  Níl rud ar bith ceilte sna cuntais sin agus tá an clár comhardaithe sínithe mar is cóir.  Níl stop curtha agamsa le haon fhiosrúchán maidir le cúrsaí Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá an fhoireann caimiléireachta ag déanamh a ghnó maidir le litir a fuair an t-iar-Aire agus a thug sé os comhair an Rialtais ar an 23 Feabhra 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl toradh ar na fiafruithe sin fós agus ní cóir domsa aon tagairt a dhéanamh nó aon ní dá raibh sa litir a lua ag an bpointe seo.  Nuair a bheidh toradh na scrúduithe <Col N="1540" /> sin ann beidh me lán-tsásta ráiteas a dhéanamh go poiblí.  Is léir domsa ag an bpointe seo go mbeidh a lán ráiteas le déanamh ag a lán daoine ag an am sin, agus ba mhaith liomsa ag an am sin cuireadh a thabhairt don iar-Aire, agus do dhaoine eile a raibh baint faoi leith acu le cúrsaí agus le himeachtaí sna Gaeltachtaí le tamall míosa anuas.</P>
    <P>An fiosrúchán a luadh sa Dáil ar an 26 Eanáir 1982 ag an iar-Aire agus nach raibh dréacht fiú amháin de théarmaí tagartha ar fáil sa Roinn nuair a ceapadh mise mar Aire, níl aon rud déanta agamsa go dtí seo agus ní chreidim go bhfuil gá lena leithéid.  Is é mo thuairim féin go bhfuil an t-iar-Aire ar an intinn céanna liomsa maidir leis an cinneadh Rialtais de 8 Nollaig 1981.  Tá seans aige féin ráiteas soiléir a dhéanamh go luath ar a imeachtaí féin san tréimhse íontach a chaith sé dá Aireacht i Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá irisí ann san am atá ann anois agus tá feachtas ar siúl acu an méid dochair agus is féidir a dhéanamh d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus, ag dul le sin, do theanga dhúchais na tíre seo.  Ní chuirfidís isteach ormsa mo dhualgas a chomhlíonadh agus is é sin na Gaeltachtaí a chaomhnú agus an teanga a chothú freisin.  Tá caomhnú agús neartú na nGaeltachtaí thar a bheith tábhachtach don tír seo mar is sa Ghaeltacht atá an tseoid is luachmhaire dár n-oidhreacht, an teanga bheo.  Tárlaíonn gur ceantair iargúlta is mó atá i gceist, le bunstructúr lag agus daonra atá ag dul i laghad le fada agus gan tionscail ar fiú trácht orthu bunaithe ansin go dtí le déanaí.  Tagann de sin go léir go bhfuil fadhbanna móra le réiteach ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Is d'aonghnó le tabhairt faoi na fadhbanna sin a bunaíodh Gaeltarra Éireann ar dtús agus, ina dhiaidh sin, Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Le blianta beaga anuas tharla géarchéim ola agus cúlú eacnamaíochta ar fud an domhain agus bhí deachrachtaí dá réir le tionscail a bhunú nó a choimeád ar siúl agus bhí na deachrachtaí sin in áiteanna a bhfuil i bhfad níos mó buntáistí acu ná mar atá sna Gaeltachtaí.  Chomh maith leis sin bhí srianta reachtúla a thug <Col N="1541" /> ar Ghaeltarra scaireanna a ghlacadh ina lán comhlachtaí.</P>
    <P>Ní foláir dúinn nithe mar sin a chur san áireamh nuair a bhíonn léirmheas á dhéanamh againn ar a bhfuil bainte amach go dtí seo.  Is fíor nár éirigh le roinnt tionscal sa Ghaeltacht agus gur beag an toradh atá fágtha ar airgead poiblí a caitheadh orthu.  Ach ní hionann é sin agus a rá nach raibh gach dícheall déanta chun tionscail mhaithe a roghnú agus a fhorbairt.  B'fhéidir go rabhthas ró-dhóchasach anois agus arís ach sílimse gurbh fhearr é sin ná bheith róéadóchasach, mar is annamh nach mbíonn baol éigin ag gabháil le tionscal nua: dá ngéillfí don dearcadh diúltach i gcónaí ní fhéadfaí dul chun cinn ar bith a dhéanamh.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir bheith ag súil go n-éireoidh go maith le gach uile thionscal lena gcabhróidh an tÚdarás ach, ag an am chéanna, níor mhaith liom go dteipfeadh ar mhórán acu.</P>
    <P>Creidim go bhfuil ceachtanna foghlamtha ónar tharla roimhe seo agus go bhféachfar chuige feasta go mbeidh an tÚdarás ag feidhmiú chomh héifeachtach agus is féidir: tig liomsa a dhearbhú go ndéanfaidh mé féin mo dhícheall chuige sin.  Ba mhaith liom go dtuigfí go soiléir nach raibh agus nach bhfuil eolas ar bith á cheilt ag Gaeltarra ná ag an Údarás: tá sonraí an chaiteachais le fáil sna tuarascálacha agus sna cuntais atá foilsithe. Is féidir teacht ar na híocaíochtaí a rinneadh le gach uile thionscal agus, i gcás na bhfothionscal agus na gcomhthionscal ina mbíonn scaireanna ag an Údarás, luaitear na cinn ina mbíonn infheistíochtaí díscríofa.</P>
    <P>Ó mhí Eanáir seo caite rithfeadh sé le duine gurb amhlaidh atá dream éigin ag iarraidh dochar a dhéanamh don Údarás d'aonghnó.  Tá rud amháin cinnte agus is é sin nach cabhair ar bith don Údarás ná don Ghaeltacht go mbeadh ráflaí á scaipeadh agus drochphoiblíocht á cothú: is rudaí iad sin a chuireann lagmhisneach ar an eagraíocht agus a dhéanann an obair níos deacra fós trí thionsclaithe a mbeifí ag iarraidh iad a mhealladh go dtí an <Col N="1542" /> Ghaeltacht a chur ó dhoras.  Is comhoibriú agus tacaíocht a bhíonn ag teastáil ón Údarás le go bhféadfar dul chun cinn mar is mian linn a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá nach léir domsa go dtí seo go bhfuil gá le fiosrúchán den saghas a luaigh an t-iar-Aire anseo sa Dáil ar an 26 Eanáir.  Ar an ócáid sin dúirt sé gur tháinig an t-iar-Rialtas ar chinneadh áirithe ar an 8 Nollaig seo caite, ach, chomh fada agus is féidir liomsa a dhéanamh amach, ní raibh sa chinneadh sin ach go rachadh sé féin agus an tAire Airgeadais i gcomhairle lena chéile agus go dtiocfaidís ar ais go dtí an Rialtas arís.  Nuair a ceapadh mise mar Aire, áfach, ní raibh fiú amháin dréacht de na téarmaí tagartha ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Níl spéis agamsa i ráflaí éiginnte ach, má tá fianaise ag aon Teachta nó aon duine eile gur tharla caimiléireacht de chineál ar bith in aon ní a bhaineann le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, iarraim air an scéal a bhreacadh síos, é a shíniú agus a chur chugam.  Tig liom a gheallúint go bhféachfaidh mé chuige go scrúdófar aon fhianaise mar sin go fíorchúramach agus go ndéanfar aon ní is gá chun cúrsaí a chur ina gceart.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ná bíodh aon eagla ar an Teachta maidir le réamhscoileanna agus bunscoileanna lán-Ghaelacha a bhunú sa chaithair seo.  Déanfaidh mise an rud is gá agus is riachtanach chun an Ghaeilge a chothú, ní amháin sna Gaeltachtaí ach thart timpeall na tíre ar fad, agus geallaim é sin dó.  Ba mhaith liom anois go mbeadh deireadh leis na ráflaí agus leis an chúlchaint maidir le gníomhaíochtaí agus imeachtaí Údarás na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeltachtaí le fada an lá.</P>

He subsequently applied for the £1,000 grant, but this application was also rejected as the foundations of the house were poured prior to 26 May 1977.</P>

      <P>Le cead an Cheann Comhairle tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna 237, 238 agus 239 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Chun leas na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn ba mhaith liom go dtuigfí go soiléir go bhfuil obair an-deacair le déanamh agus fadhbanna móra le réiteach ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus gur cúnamh agus tacaíocht a bhíonn ag teastáil ón Udarás.  Tá sé mar phríomhaidhm agamsa go mbeidh an tÚdarás ag feidhmiú chomh héifeachtach agus is féidir chun fostaíocht shochrach a chur ar fáil ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Ní dóigh liom, áfach, gur féidir bheith ag súil go n-éireoidh go maith le gach uile thionscal lena gcabhróidh an tUdarás ach, ag an am céanna, níor mhaith liom go dteipfeadh ar mhórán acu.  Is fíor &mdash; mar a fhoilsítear i dtuarascálacha agus i gcuntais an Údaráis &mdash; nár éirigh le roinnt tionscal agus gur beag an toradh atá fágtha ar airgead poiblí a caitheadh orthu.  Ach ní ionann é sin agus a rá nach raibh an tÚdarás &mdash; agus Gaeltarra Éireann roimhe &mdash; tar éis a ndícheall a dhéanamh chun tionscail mhaithe a roghnú agus a fhorbairt: ní foláir an cor a tháinig ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta a chur san áireamh &mdash; an cúlú a tharla ar fud an domhain agus an tslí inar theip ar thionscail a bhí bunaithe leis na blianta fada sa tír seo agus i dtíortha eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ritheann ceist liom féin: an amhlaidh atá dream éigin ag iarraidh dochar a <Col N="1329" /> dhéanamh don Udarás d'aonghnó?  Tá rud amháin cinnte agus is é sin nach cabhair ar bith don Údarás ná don Ghaeltacht go mbeadh ráflaí á scaipeadh agus drochphoiblíocht á cothú: is rudaí iad sin a chuireann lagmhisneach ar an eagraíocht agus a dhéanann an obair níos deacra fós.  Ar an taobh eile den scéal, má tá fianaise ag aon Teachta nó aon duine eile gur tharla caimiléireacht de chineál ar bith, iarraim air an fhianaise a bhreacadh síos, a shíniú agus a chur chugam: tig liom a gheallúint go bhféachfaidh mé chuige go scrúdófar aon fhianaise mar sin go fíorchúramach agus go ndéanfar aon ní is gá chun cúrsaí a chur ina gceart.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairimse gur fiú an cúlra ginearálta sin a léiriú sula ndíreoidh mé ar na pointí áirithe atá sna Ceisteanna:</P>
    <P>Tá an chéad chuid de Cheist a 237 bunaithe ar mhíthuiscint mar níl stop curtha agamsa le haon fhiosrúchán maidir le cúrsaí Údarás na Gaeltachta: is amhlaidh nach bhfuil aon ní déanta chun tús a chur leis an bhfiosrúchán a luadh anseo sa Dáil ar an 26 Eanáir agus nach léir domsa go dtí seo go bhfuil gá lena leithéid.  Ar an ócáid sin dúirt an t-iar-Aire gur tháinig an t-iarRialtas ar chinneadh áirithe ar an 8 Nollaig seo caite: ach, chomh fada agus is féidir liomsa a dhéanamh amach, ní raibh sa chinneadh sin ach go rachadh sé féin agus an tAire Airgeadais i gcomhairle lena chéile agus go dtiocfaidís arais go dtí an Rialtas arís; agus, nuair a ceapadh mise mar Aire, ní raibh dréacht fiú amháin de théarmaí tagartha ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá fiafraithe á ndéanamh ag an nGarda Síochána maidir le litir a fuair an t-iar-Aire agus a thug sé os comhair an Rialtais ar an 23 Feabhra: níl toradh ar na fiafraithe sin fós ná ní cóir domsa aon ní dá raibh sa litir a lua ag an bpointe seo.</P>
    <P>I gcás an Údaráis is caiteachas forbartha a bhíonn á sheasamh agus ní bhíonn trádáil ar siúl.  Foilsítear na híocaíochtaí le gach cuideachta i dtuarascálacha agus i gcuntais an Údaráis agus léirítear freisin infheistíochtaí a bhíonn díscríofa.</P>
    <P>

      <P>The International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade, the 1980s, was adopted at the 35th Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 5 December 1980.  The strategy calls on developed countries which have not reached the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for official development assistance to exert their best efforts to reach it by 1985 and in any event not later than in the second half of the decade. The strategy also recommends that the target of 1 per cent should be reached as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
      <P>During the formal adoption of the new International Development Strategy the Irish delegation made the following statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the Government of Ireland have accepted the 0.7 per cent aid target and intend to reach it as soon as possible, although it may not be feasible for <Col N="1343" /> them to do so within the specified time-frame.  Although it is the Government's intention to increase ODA in the years ahead, it is not possible at the present stage for the Irish Government to envisage a commitment as regards the 1% target&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This reservation was made because of the need to make clear in the international forum specifically considering the issue, the limitations of our ability in this regard.  Many developed countries, because of the present world economic situation, are finding it difficult to step up their aid to developing countries.  A number of our partners in the European Community cannot commit themselves unreservedly to the target and similarly made statements outlining their positions when the strategy was adopted.</P>
    <P>However, as indicated in the previous reply, the Government are committed to reaching the UN target as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware Ireland's ODA has increased from £1.963m in 1974 to its present level of £26.335m, representing .06% and .22% of GNP respectively. This puts it in a position similar to some other industrialised countries, a number of which have considerable higher national incomes, as will be seen from the following table with the latest figures published by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD.</P>

Cahirciveen is the principal operator centre for the exchanges at Ballinskelligs, Cahirciveen, Caherdaniel, Kells, Portmagee, Valentia and Waterville.

      <P>A claim for dental benefit was received in my Department on 6 October 1981.  As the contribution condition which requires the claimant to have not less than 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year was not satisfied on her insurance record, she was not qualified for dental benefit.</P>
      <P>An inquiry was issued to the claimant on 16 November 1981 seeking details of any insurable employment in the period but despite the issue of a reminder she has not replied to this inquiry.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 1 March 1982 but was not entitled to payment at the time as, according to the records of my Department, he had not the required minimum of 26 contributions in 1980-81, the contribution year governing his claim.  Following inquiries it was established <Col N="1374" /> that the claimant had sufficient weeks of insurable employment in 1980-81 to qualify him for payment.  All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 8 May 1982, the date of the last medical certificate received, has issued, less supplementary welfare allowance advanced by the health board.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the anomalous situation which derives from the contribution conditions laid down by his Department in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension; if he will confirm the example cited (details supplied) in respect of a particular case; if he will now agree that the person (details supplied) in Dublin should be entitled to an old age contributory pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for old age contributory pension are as follows: (a) entry into insurance ten years prior to attainment of pension age &mdash; with certain exceptions in the case of persons born before 1922; (b) a total of 156 paid contributions since entry into insurance, and (c) a yearly average of 48 contributions, paid or credited, since 1953 or from entry into insurance, whichever is later, for maximum rate of pension, with phased reduced rates for persons with yearly averages down to 20 contributions paid or credited.</P>
      <P>Arising from the calculation of the yearly average as prescribed, it is possible for a person with a relatively short period of insurance to qualify for pension.  A person who was in insurable employment from 1935 to 1958 and then ceased to be so employed because he exceeded the salary limit, except for a period preceding pension age, could, however, fail to satisfy the statutory contribution condition relating to the average test.  In this connection it is appropriate to mention that such a person would have had the option of becoming a voluntary contributor thus enabling him to preserve his full pension entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the person specifically mentioned by the Deputy in his question, <Col N="1375" /> that person reached pension age on 15 March 1982 and claimed old age contributory pension.  He had paid ordinary rate contributions from 1953 to 1961, when his employment with CIE became permanent and pensionable.  For contributory old age pension purposes his yearly average of contributions fell to be calculated from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1981, the end of the contribution year immediately preceding that in which he reached pension age.  In that period he had a total of 429 reckonable contributions which is the equivalent to a yearly average of 15 contributions.  In these circumstances he did not qualify for a contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, it is the intention of the Government to put forward as soon as possible proposals for a national pension plan and it will then be possible to review the qualifying conditions for pension in the context of these proposals.</P>

The maximum rate payable for a man and two child dependants is £40.55 but £1.00 a week is being deducted in this case in recovery of an overpayment of unemployment assistance which he received in respect of his wife for a period after they had separated.</P>
      <P>The maximum rate of deserted wife's allowance for a woman with two children is £52.30 per week.  The rates of deserted wive's allowance are the same as the rates of widow's non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>An unemployed man, however, who is not living with or wholly or mainly maintaining his wife and who has a female person over 16 looking after his children may be paid an adult dependant's allowance in respect of such person.  The present rate of this allowance is £18.95 a week.</P>

      <P>The social welfare regulations provide that the combined weekly rate of disability benefit and pay-related benefit may not exceed a person's reckonable earnings in the tax year relevant to his claim. As from 5 April 1982, the date the budget increases came into operation, the rate of flat-rate benefit was increased but the rate of pay-related benefit was reduced so that the total amount of disability benefit and pay-related benefit in payment (£105.04) would not exceed the claimant's reckonable weekly earnings (£105.04) in 1979/80, the tax year relevant to his claim.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the maximum of the wage scale for county council road workers with effect from 1 March 1982 is £5,318 (£101.87 per week) and that the superannuation contributions under the 1977 scheme in this case would <Col N="1383" /> be £2.60 weekly which is equivalent to 2.55 per cent of gross earnings.</P>

The amounts of contributions are therefore as follows: Social Insurance &mdash; £5.45 weekly equivalent to 5.4 per cent of gross pay; Health &mdash; £0.99 weekly equivalent to 0.97 per cent of gross pay; Youth Employment Levy &mdash; £0.99 weekly equivalent to 0.97 per cent of gross pay.</P>

Accordingly payment of all disability benefit from 29 January 1981, fourth day of incapacity, to 15 May 1982, was issued on 14 May 1982.

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit from 26 March 1981 in respect of an incapacity which he attributed to an accident at work on 26 March 1981.  Before a decision could be given on his entitlement to payment it was necessary to make inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity.  On completion of the inquiries, which were protracted, it was accepted that the incapacity was due to an accident at work and the claim was allowed.  Payment of injury benefit for the full statutory period of 26 weeks from the date of the accident on 26 March 1981 to 23 September 1981 was made on 29 April 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the expiration of this period he claimed disability benefit but he was not entitled to payment as he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions to his credit in the 1979/80 contribution year.  As it is understood that he <Col N="1385" /> was in employment from October 1979 to March 1981 the local social welfare officer has been requested to investigate the apparent failure of the employer to pay the contributions due for the 1979/80 period which could have the effect of qualifying him for payment of disability benefit from September 1981.  On completion of these inquiries his claim will be reviewed and he will be notified of the outcome.</P>
    <P>As the claimant may be entitled to disablement benefit in respect of loss of faculty arising from the accident, the necessary form on which to claim the benefit has been issued to him.  He has also been advised of his entitlement to the cost of any medical care expenses incurred as a result of the accident.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 20 January 1982 and payments at the weekly rate of £22.65 increased to £28.30 from 5 April 1982 were made to him as they became due.  Inquiries were necessary to establish his contribution record during the relevant contribution period April 1980 to April 1981 and following the completion of investigations his record was amended thereby providing him with a title to an increase in the rate of unemployment benefit payable to him of £23.45 increased to £29.30 from 5 April 1982. All the adjusting arrears were paid to him on 4 May 1982.  He is not entitled to pay-related benefit as he had insufficient earnings during the relevant income-tax year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit at the maximum rate and pay-related benefit during the period 28 September 1981 to 9 January 1982 and he received all payment to which he was entitled.  He claimed unemployment benefit at his local office for one week from 15 March 1982 to 20 March 1982 and he was paid only three days of unemployment benefit pending confirmation that he was previously in receipt of disability benefit.  This information was necessary in order to determine whether three waiting days applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is presumed that the Deputy's question <Col N="1399" /> refers to the delay in the payment of the first three days of his unemployment benefit claim which had been withheld.

    <P>The person concerned was written to and asked to call into his local office for payment of the balance of unemployment benefit due to him and he did so on 14 May 1982.</P>
    <P>The person concerned is not qualified for pay-related benefit as a supplement to his unemployment benefit claim from 15 March 1982 to 20 March 1982 as this period is less than the statutory 12 day waiting period for pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether a management survey was undertaken in his Department in the last seven years in conjunction with another State Department on the wide span of his Department's activities; and, if so, (1) the date of its report; (2) the number of recommendations; (3) the number implemented to date; (4) whether any more will be implemented by 31 December 1982; (5) if there were any comments in relation to the Civil Defence Branch and whether he will initiate any further such survey for the purpose of increasing administrative efficiency in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>(1) In the context of the implementation of the recommendations of the Public Services Organisation Review Group in so far as they relate to the Department of Defence a committee comprised of officers of the Departments of the Public Service and Defence reported on the functions, structure and overall staffing of the Department and made certain recommendations in October 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This completed Phase I of the exercise. <Col N="1408" /> Phase II is at present in progress and involves a detailed survey of the civil branches of the Department with a view to setting out and commenting on their (a) functions &mdash; whether they are located in the most appropriate areas or whether cognate functions at present carried out in different areas might be drawn together; (b) staffing &mdash; adequacy and grading; and (c) systems &mdash; whether there is room for improvement.</P>
    <P>The survey is being conducted by officers of both the Department of Defence and of the Public Service and is being supervised by a Steering Committee at Assistant Secretary level.</P>
    <P>(2), (3) and (4) The recommendations contained in the October report relate to the organisation and structure of the Department and form the basis of the detailed survey being undertaken at present. It is expected that this survey should be completed by the end of 1982.  Implementation of recommendations is dependent to a large extent on the outcome of the Phase II survey.</P>
    <P>(5) Civil Defence Branch was surveyed and has since been the subject of a detailed examination arising out of which certain proposals aimed at improving efficiency have been implemented.</P>
    <P>(6) As indicated at (1) above a detailed survey is at present in progress.  Arising out of a Government decision of 23 December 1981 the question of increasing administrative efficiency and ensuring staff economies will be emphasised in the current exercise.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that it would not be practicable for the board to develop new bogs in County Kerry because the bogland is unsuitable for large scale operations.  However, generous grants are available under the Turf Development Act, 1981, for small scale developments promoted by private or co-operative undertakings.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority have a total of 30,000 sq. ft. of factory space and 25 acres of land available in the area which they are intensively promoting for suitable industrial development. A further 30,000 sq. ft. of factory space is planned for the area.</P>

    <P>Normally litter offences are prosecuted under section 52 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, but these provisions have proved deficient.  The Litter Bill, which I have re-introduced in the Dáil, provides substantially strengthened powers for local authorities to deal with littering, including an increase in the penalty from £10 to a maximum of £500 and provision for a fine-on-the-spot system to be operated by local authorities.  Under the provisions of the Bill there will also be a duty on local authorities to take positive measures for the prevention of the creation of litter.</P>

      <P>I or my Minister of State have met deputations from 20 local authorities.  The discussions took account of the value to these authorities of the measures taken by the Government to (i) limit increases in statutory demands on local authorities in respect of supplementary welfare and arterial drainage maintenance, and, (ii) reverse the decision of the previous Government in regard to the application to local revenue purposes of part of the proceeds of the sale of local authority dwellings.  These two measures benefit the revenue accounts of local authorities by an estimated total of £10 million in 1982.</P>
      <P>Allocations in respect of Environmental Works (Youth Employment) and supplementary allocations in respect of road works were notified to local authorities generally on 26 and 27 April 1982, respectively. The amounts of these allocations to the relevant local authorities from whom deputations were received are set out in the table below.  In addition Cork Corporation were notified of allocations of £500,000 and £132,000 for sanitary services and itinerant halts respectively; Kerry County Council received sanction to a loan of £19,200 for Caherciveen Courthouse and Donegal County Council received sanction to £45,000 for Portelvin-Leenane Pier.</P>

      <P>The principles underlying the differential rents scheme for local authority dwellings is that tenants should pay a reasonable contribution, in accordance with their ability to pay, towards the cost of their housing.  Accordingly rents are not related solely to the type and standard of the dwelling a tenant occupies but also have regard to the family income and circumstances.  The scheme does not, therefore, preclude a tenant of a flat being obliged to pay a rent similar to the rent payable by a tenant occupying a house.</P>

The council are satisfied that the new arrangements will not lead to a situation in which there will be a health hazard.
